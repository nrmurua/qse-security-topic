See the following tests of DelegateParameter that are marked as xfail: b04266b (on master around here)
Expectation: DelegateParameters get_latest and set_cache should in principle simply forward the call to get_latest and set_cache of the source parameter.
I think it is more involved than that. At the example of the scale of a parameter, consider the following:

It seems that set_cached needs calculate the raw value, and forward that to set_cached of the original parameter.
get_latest of the delegate parameter should convert its raw value, which is received by calling into get_latest of the source, to the non-raw value.
I will need to look into #1757 again to refresh my knowledge of the new caching mechanism. Then I can implement the cache for the DelegateParameter next week.
Plan of actions agreed upon with @astafan8
