On liboqs master branch, autoconf generates a config.h file which contains macros based on the results of all of the ./configure tests, as well as all of the options that were passed to ./configure, such as which algorithms to enable and where OpenSSL is.
This config.h should not be exported as a public header from liboqs, because the various macros that were set by ./configure might conflict with those present in a relying application.  (I ran into this bug when trying to build our OpenSSL 1.1.1 against our liboqs master (with OpenSSL enabled) on macOS; in particular the OPENSSLDIR macro ends up conflicting and causing build failures.)
We use config.h in two ways:
We should separate these two functionalities.  One file should contain the exported liboqs configuration options and this should be part of the installed public headers.  The other file should contain the raw output from ./configure, and not be installed as part of the public headers.
My solution is to create a distinct oqsconfig.h which contains just the liboqs configuration macros, which is part of the exported headers.  On nist-branch, this will be generated by make.  On master branch, this will be generated by grepping ./configure's config.h for all lines with OQS_ in them.
Various calling files have to change in order to work correctly with this, including:
This has potential implications across the following subprojects:
