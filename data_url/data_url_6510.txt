Starting with #379 (merged on July 26), Docker tests began taking ~10 minutes longer to complete on average. Either that PR or some other change around that time is suspected to have caused this. We should investigate to see if we can bring the runtime back down, as this is starting to negatively affect the pace at which we can merge PRs.
This appears to be caused by the release of Cirq v0.11.1. Sample logs from PRs before and after the change:
Before (~7 min for Cirq install):
After (~15 min for Cirq install):
Cirq is installed twice during the Docker tests (once for Docker, and once for the "install test"), so an increase of 10-15 minutes roughly matches with the difference seen above.
Specifically, most of the time in these tests is lost to building wheels:
This suggests a couple of things:
I am unable to reproduce the wheel-building step locally, even with the pip cache disabled. My system consistently retrieves the wheel files for grpcio, pandas, etc., where these Docker tests instead pickup tarballs and build them.
It might be possible to use the pip --prefer-binary flag to avoid this.
--prefer-binary works! This reduces the runtime of Docker tests enough that they are no longer the bottleneck; instead, "Build all wheels for testing" is the longest-running check at ~30 minutes for the Windows build.
