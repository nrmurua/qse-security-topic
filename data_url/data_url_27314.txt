The MontgomeryCurve class contains fields a and b. The a constant used in reference implementation is different from the A constant used in optimized implementation. Furthermore, the b constant is not used in optimized implementation.
We should separate the constant classes for each of the implementations and encapsulate all constants.
Not required anymore.
