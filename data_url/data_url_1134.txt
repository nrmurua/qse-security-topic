A bunch of them are missing from the top level cirq namespace, but there are some. Do we want them there or should these be in cirq.experiments?
I think if they were at the top level then we might want "experiment" in the name. "rabi_oscillations" is not enough information on its own to describe what will happen.
Related to #3228. While the strategy is not fully defined yet, we are moving towards the direction of moving experiments somewhere :) It might end up in its own package / distro or (I'd prefer) in ReCirq.
I'd vote for avoiding putting them in the top-level namepsace. And, of course, when a given experiment starts getting complex it should be considered for ReCirq
