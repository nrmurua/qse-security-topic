Describe the bug
antlr4-python3-runtime is incompatible between Braket (and the default simulator) and Strawberry Fields, even though it is pinned because of it:
https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-default-simulator-python/blob/main/setup.py#L38
However, it is pegged to a different version in Blackbird, which is used internally by SF:
https://github.com/XanaduAI/blackbird/blob/master/requirements.txt#L1
Error discovered by using pip-compile on a simple requirements.in file with pip-compile -r requirements.in
Output:
The plugin requires the installation of SF: https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-strawberryfields-plugin-python
This means that blindly installing these with pip can lead to subtle bugs due to differences:
Hi @ianhellstrom ,
Thank you for logging this issue. We are working on dealing with this dependency conflict. Meanwhile, if you need to unblock yourself, I suggest you run:
pip install amazon-braket-sdk
followed by
pip install amazon-braket-strawberryfields-plugin
as two separate commands.
pip should be able to automatically downgrade antrl to 4.8, which should work for how we currently use it.
Let me know if this helps.
Perhaps a silly question, but why not simply use 4.8?
It seems as if Blackbird 0.5 uses the same version, which is now also used inside 0.23 of SF. Bit scary that package versions are updated in SF post-release... This ticket can therefore be closed.
