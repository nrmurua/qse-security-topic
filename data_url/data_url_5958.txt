ENHANCEMENT REQUEST TEMPLATE 
Hmm, I'm not sure where this would be coming from. The setup.py in aer doesn't import distutils directly at all, just setuptools: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/setup.py#L30 My only thought is that one of the dependencies in the setup.py like conan, or scikit-build is pulling in distutils. I wasn't able to reproduce this warning locally (or get a build working which I'll open another issue about) when using python setup.py install My only suggestion is to try moving the setuptools import at L30 in the setup.py to be first before everything else and see if the warning is still emitted. Something like:
I haven't been able to reproduce this. We don't import setuptools directly anymore, not sure if that caused this issue. @nonhermitian are you still experiencing this?
I haven't tried in some time. Can probably close as stale. Can reopen if needed.
ok, closing then. thanks.
