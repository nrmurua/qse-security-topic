Example: https://manual.cp2k.org/cp2k-8_2-branch/CP2K_INPUT/FORCE_EVAL/PW_DFT/PARAMETERS.html
I get at the top: Input reference of CP2K version 9.0
For branch 8.1 I get 8.0, etc.
I guess, I used the wrong branch for generating those html pages. Unfortunately, this is still a manual process. Feel free to run sed -i on the server to fix this.
Long term I'd really like to have only a single set of html pages that contain the information about all versions.
The input references for the CP2K versions 7.1, 8.1, and 8.2 have been regenerated with the respective code versions and then uploaded.
