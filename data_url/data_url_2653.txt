Comes after #947
The logic is as follows: if the qubit index is 0 (the control), the operation is returned unchanged. If it is larger then we delegate to phasing the sub gate with cirq.phase_by and a default result of NotImplemented. If it's NotImplemented, we return NotImplemented. Otherwise we return a controlled gate with the phased sub gate.
I can take this
