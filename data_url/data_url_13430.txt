Checking the length of the circuit in BatchedFactory.run bugs out because braket circuits do not have __len__ defined.
(Cirq is only in the picture here because I don't know how to simulate circuits in braket.)
Raises
Convert the circuit to Cirq and check len(list(circuit.all_operations())) in place of https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/blob/master/mitiq/zne/inference.py#L524-L528.
