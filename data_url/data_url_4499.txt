In the code below, the drawing method does not work, with error message:
NotImplementedError: Energy gate is not supported by circuit.draw
This error appears even if the callback gate is the Overlap or entropy, so it is common to all Callback gates.
In order to get rid of this issue, I see two possibilities
Thanks for reporting this @AdrianPerezSalinas.
We are currently discussing the possibility of drawing callbacks in #550.
I am closing this issue since it has already been solved in #550.
