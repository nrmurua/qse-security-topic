This is the tracking epic for RFC 10: preliminary representation of classical expressions.  Details of the proposal are in the linked document.
As of right now, there are PRs open for every "feature" component of the new Expr work that's required for 0.25.  I still have some testing work to write, but assuming there's nothing catastrophic lurking low down in the PR chain, the rest should be some bug fixes and QA stuff.
Here's the review order for the PRs under this issue:
This epic is now complete for the purposes of Terra 0.25.0rc1. I'll leave it open for the time being because it's tracking a couple more things for the final 0.25.0, but in principle it's complete from a feature perspective.
And with the merge of #10503, that's this epic complete.  We still need to add further visualisation support as tracked in #10236, but that's for Qiskit 0.45, and #10504 at least fixes the crashes.
With this epic closed, can https://github.com/Qiskit/RFCs/blob/master/0010-simple-classical-representations.md be considered Implemented?
Yes
