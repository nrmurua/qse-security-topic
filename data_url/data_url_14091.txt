If I use V2 fake backends, I can set a certain noise equal to 0 with
and I can do that for each kind of instruction ('id', 'rz', 'sx', 'x', 'cx', 'measure') and for each qubit.
If I do that, I still have noisy expectation values. The noise is not due to the fine amount of shots since with ideal quantum circuits with the same amount of shots I get much better results.
Which kind of noise is still acting on the circuit?
A reproducible example:
The output is:
