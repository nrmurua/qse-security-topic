Right now because some of the tests use aer they are both slow and fail since they are non-deterministic. Can we copy the model of rb and pkl some results to test the fitter? We should still run the circuits through the idea simulator to make sure it doesn't fail.
BTW, why even for a fixed seed we get a non-deterministic behavior of Aer noise module? It seems that there is a difference in how the noise is generated in Aer, that could be system dependent (e.g. Mac vs. Linux).
Yes, according to chris it can be a little different on mac vs linux
Shouldn't this be an issue in Aer?
Depends what was claimed I guess in the Aer documentation
