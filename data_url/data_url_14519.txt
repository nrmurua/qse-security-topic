This issue is meant as a discussion on how to proceed with changes to the circuit drawers to properly handle bits without registers. A number of bugs and issues have already been addressed but 3 issues have come up that need some design input.
Possible solutions.
Possible solution. If bits are truly primary now, we could show every bit as a Qnum, Cnum with the registers it belongs to subscripted to the bits like Q3c1, c2. cregbundle would not work for this. This might be a user option - old/new display method. If using old, a bit will only be shown on 1 register.
