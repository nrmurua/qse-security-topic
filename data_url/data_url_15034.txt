Running the constrained reschedule pass with a sufficiently large backend can cause a recursion error like:
This seems to be caused by the internal recursion used to push back gates that need to be aligned. It looks like for large circuits it's just exceeding the max stack depth allowed causing an error.
The pass shouldn't error and should function as expected.
Remove the recursion and rewrite the internals to be iterative
