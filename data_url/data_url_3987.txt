@imranashraf I have tried new eQASM compiler and it works very well for me except one simple issue.
The pre-interval and the generated quantum instruction are separated by a comma like this:

But what we are using now for both CC-Light and QuMAsim has no such comma:

So the OpenQL generated eQASM programs are not directly executable at now. Maybe OpenQL should fix this?
@imranashraf Hi Imran,
After discussion with Xiang, we realized that both versions could be used by eQASM. Maybe we can discuss about it on Monday.
@zhangmy61 sure. see you sometime today.
@imranashraf , We tried to use OpenQL 0.5 in the experiment today. We ran into this issue as the comma reported by @zhangmy61 raises an error in the Assembler for the CCLight. Is there a chance this could be updated more urgently?
This currently blocks the experiment.
@AdriaanRol this will be the first thing i will be doing tomorrow morning. Should not consume a lot of time so i should be able to send PR tomorrow morning.
fixed in #156. which version of assembler are you using? I wonder why it did not raise error for me !
@imranashraf @zhangmy61 Could you please tell me if you had any discussion in the past about this issue?  I cannot find any log on any issue and do not know which conclusion/decision you have made. I think that is the source of the compatibility problem.
In the previous discussion with Imran, we reached an agreement that we should use the comma-free version of eQASM programs. So the OpenQL should be updated to generate eQASM programs without commas, and we can continue with the previous assembler 2.2.0 (used in the CC-Light project).
