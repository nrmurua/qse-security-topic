If you attempt to access an option that does not exist no warning is presented to the user.  The user can continue which is good when this is on purpose, but in the event of typos the code author can easily make mistakes.  e.g. options['example'] vs options['exxample']
Access any option that doesn't exist in default_optiosn presently.
A warning should be displayed if the option doesn't exist to hint that the user should verify they are accessing what they are intending to access.
