We can follow the same approach with qibolab and have a label run-on-gpu that submits the tests on demand, in a simulation node with GPU. This would help avoid issues such as #881.
@scarrazza I can have a look at the workflow, do you need to register the runner somewhere in the repository?
@stavros11 yes, but don't worry, I will enable this feature later today.
That would be create @stavros11, thanks for opening the issue.
This will be useful also to test the cuQuantum backend, even if I feel like not many people are using it.
Done, in principle now you can place a new workflow which performs the submission to the corresponding partition.
