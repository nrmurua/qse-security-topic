It's bad that the toolbox is scrolling along with the qubits, they should have their own scrolling, otherwise with a large number of gates in width - the toolbox goes out of sight
The problem with locking the toolbox to the screen is that on some screens the toolbox doesn't fit.
Closing as WONTFIX. If someone wants to put in the effort to have the toolbox drag leftward in a way that still works on small screens, I will of course merge it.
