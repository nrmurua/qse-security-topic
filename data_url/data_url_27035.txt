Both QUICK serial and cuda versions produce extraterrestrial gradients for the following input at HF/def2-svp level of theory. This must be fixed!

@Altaimorin This issue is caused by failing to read the Cartesian coordinates from the input properly. There is nothing wrong with the gradient code. See below. In this case, we have tabs in the input and the whole calculation is messed up.

We need to make sure our input reader can handle these stupid things. I am opening a new issue to fix this.
@Altaimorin Lets continue the discussion in #127 from now on.
