Yes, have been distracted with other things.  Have to understand what he sent.  Also, @zlatko-minev gave a solution, but not an using SelectAll() from Ansys.  Making progress.
This really should take 30 minutes no more, if it's taking more than 30 minutes reach out for helpï¿¼
I have a solution that works in Ansys base class.  I will make a separate branch and we can then have a discussion.
'202-Delete-objects-in-Ansys'
Also will update the notebook in guide/...5.1 Ansys notebook to delete the objects in the project.
