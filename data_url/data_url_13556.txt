If the precision option is too small or if the one-norm of the circuit quasi-distribution is too large, the number of samples in execute_with_pec can become huge.
Two options:
Raise a warning if num_samples is beyond a certain threshold in such a way that the user is aware that the computation may be very long.
Automatically cut num_samples to some default max_samples and raise a warning about this truncation.

Hello!!
Siddhartha here.
execute_with_pec uses either user provided samples or generates them. In both the cases, computation may take very long.
Exploring the first option, I performed tests for sample sizes 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, and 10^6 and found out that a warning for any sample size greater than 10^5 would be a good threshold.

I suggest to issue an UserWarning for sample sizes greater than 10^5
Truncating num_samples to max_samples needs various changes in test script functions like test_execute_with_pec_with_different_samples test_precision_option_in_execute_with_pec  and pec.py itself.

First option is a quick fix. In a later fix, we can add user preference on what actions (continue/truncate to max_samples) to take when sample size is very large.
Please let me know if I should proceed with this approach. Do assign me this issue if agreed.
Thanks @sid1993  for the nice test for checking what is a reasonable threshold for the number of samples.
Since current tests involve very small circuits, in the future we may decide to reduce that threshold. But for the moment I think 10 ** 5 is a reasonable value.
Your proposal (that you have already drafted in #459) LGTM.
