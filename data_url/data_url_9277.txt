After being able to do automatic differentiation, it may be useful to be able to compute the geometric tensor [1] for use informing variational optimization and quantum geometry. The geometric tensor is defined as

where the derivative is with respect to some set of parameters. For example, these parameters could be variational (eg QAOA) parameters, or Hamiltonian parameters which change the ground state.
