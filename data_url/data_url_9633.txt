Now that we are open-source, we can integrate ReviewNB for free to facilitate the review of Jupyter notebooks. What do you think, @lhenriet @sebgrijalva ? Should I set this up?
I think it's a good idea, we might as well get used to it now, as the number of notebooks will keep growing.
I know I said I'd do this, but actually it has to be done with the account that owns the repository, so I think it will be up to you, @lhenriet .
@HGSilveri you should be able to do it now.
Ok, the app is installed on this repo. If you want to use it, go here, sign up and you should be able to select Pulser. It's not of much use right now, but once we have a PR with changes to notebooks, we should be able to try this out.
Thanks, this looks nice!
Does it work for you, @sebgrijalva ?
Yes, I think so

Ok, great!
