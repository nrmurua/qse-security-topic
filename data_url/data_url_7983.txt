Most of our progress bars are in qutip/ui/progressbar.py, with the exception of HTMLProgressBar which is in qutip/ipynbtools.py. It is not available by the solvers.
It should be moved with the other and added it to the progess_bars dictionary so it's usable with mesolve, etc.
@Ericgig I would like to take up this issue. Can you please assign it to me?
