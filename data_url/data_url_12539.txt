Is it possible to support CY gate in TFQ natively? What would be required to implement this in TFQ?
Essentially it would be supporting a
cirq.Y(cirq.GridQubit(6, 0)).controlled_by(cirq.GridQubit(0, 0))
I am wonder this because CX and CZ are supported, and CY different from CX.CY only by a controlled-phase gate.
I realize CY can be achieved with CX conjugated by S.
