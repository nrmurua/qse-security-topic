Right now you can only install Mitiq from pip, which is common, but much harder to correctly resolve dependency conflicts as well as manage requirements outside of python (some of our dependencies may need to be built from source). Especially for windows development and users, having a conda package would make a lot of issues moot ( see #839, #837, #620, #416 to name a few).
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
