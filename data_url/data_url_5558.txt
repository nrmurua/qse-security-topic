Trying to use cuQuantum from Qiskit, I came across this site.
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
I found from #1609 that I need to build qiskit-aer to use cuQuantum from qiskit-aer, so I built the source and got an error when I entered the following command.
I seem to be getting some errors regarding Conan, but I don't know much about Cmake and can't solve them. What could be the cause and how can it be resolved?
On GCP VM instance.
and following documentation
then run setup.py.
The build of qiskit-aer is completed and cuquanutum can be used from qiskit-aer.
Now, if we flag cuStateVec_enable=True in AerSimulator() as in #1609,
and this errorâ†‘ occurs.
Please see #1730.
Conan 2.0 is not supported. Please use Conan 1.X.
Thank you, the conan error has been resolved but the following error regarding pybind11 has appeared.
What error could this be?
I guess that pybid11 is not installed correctly in your environment.
I tried,
However, the error is not resolved. is it possible that the missing module for pybind11 and the inability to successfully build it with cmake is because I forgot to do some command operation and the dependency was not resolved properly during the installation? I can't find any other examples of such an error. (I am concerned that I am not installing the required packages in addition to pybind11.)
can you install pybind11 with pip install "pybind11[global]"?
I confirmed that qiskit-aer can be compiled with cuquantum. I hope that this gist helps your trouble.

(in this gist, "pybind11[global]" was not necessary.)
