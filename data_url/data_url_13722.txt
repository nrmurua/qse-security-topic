Github Actions are not free for private repositories. In recent PRs we added environments (mac-latest, windows-latest) and trigger conditions [push, pull_request] in the ci.yml file.
We can remove Mac and Windows build for the time being These are 8x and 2x more expensive than Linux. https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-billing-and-payments-on-github/about-billing-for-github-actions#about-billing-for-github-actions
Or, we could try to stack together a bunch of commits and push only some of the times to limit overhead (I do a lot of commits, little by little...) and make sure that tests run fine once this are pushed, by checking with pytest for code and make doctest for docstrings and documentation. There is a tool for local checks, though it does support only ubuntu testing, https://github.com/nektos/act.
Once the repository goes public, we can revert to the more comprehensive CI.
what do you think? This should cut it down to roughly ~one build per PR, for each specification. This way we can maybe even keep mac-latest. What do you think, @willzeng @andreamari @rmlarose?
By the way, we opened a ticket to apply to non-profit benefits, but I still think that on private repos the minutes limit will be the same as what's now.
Oh wow I checked our usage and we definitely need to do this. I support your suggestion here @nathanshammah Please go ahead and open a PR
To clarify I mean the
idea
Additionally it looks like the Mac and Windows tests really do add a lot. Just for reference:
