MatPlot has issues when it updates while a mouse hovers over it.
Not sure why, it used to get the following error message, which got fixed in 2.1.
However, the image is still lost for a small time while it updates, whereas if the mouse doesn't hover over it, this does not happen
This specific error is fixed in matplotlib 2.1.0. The underlying event refreshing error is fixed in the QCoDeS commit
