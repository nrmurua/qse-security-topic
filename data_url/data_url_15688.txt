CI is currently failing on all docs and Linux 3.7 builds (only this one because the image tests are in it).
The docs failure is:
and the Linux py3.7 failure is:
Check a recent CI run.
No error.
Immediately, pin matplotlib<3.5 to get CI rolling, then work on fixing compatibility.
The py3.7 failure is related to this message in the MPL deprecations, though that's from 3.4, so not certain why it's just appearing now.
I'm tagging this as 0.19.0 because we should try to come up with a fix for this before we release. Shipping packages with upper caps on requirements (even optional ones) is potentially problematic for users
I had a similar problem with Qiskit Terra version: 0.19.1, Python 3.8.1 and matplotlib 3.5.1, which resulted in Qiskit crashing in "plot_state_qsphere" (again in Arrow3D object). The issue was resolved by updating matplotlib-inline to version 0.1.3 (from version 0.1.2).
