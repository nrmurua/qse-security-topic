I try to install hiq with this bash file :
This is the run log:
From your log, I am not sure if this is the root cause:

If the package cannot be found, you may need to enable EPEL following this wiki. Reinstall  boost-mpich-python3 boost-python3 boost-openmpi-python3 if needed.
Also, you may want to install a complete CMake development toolset (with gcc 7+), which is prerequired. Try
Now, rerun the bash script and let us know your output. Thank you for your interests.
Hi Doc.Qi .This is output and error.Please check it.

@Takishima Can you also take a look? It looks like a download problem for Boost libraries.
From https://serverfault.com/questions/997896/how-to-enable-powertools-repository-in-centos-8, try to do this:
Did you try the fix I mentioned above? If I get no reply from you by the end of this week, I will close this issue.
On CentOS 7, the following should work (tested using the latest CentOS 7 Docker image)
