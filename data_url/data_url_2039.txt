When you serialize and then deserialize a Pauli operator, you get a different instance, which might not be too surprising
This shouldn't be a problem, however Paulis are checking commutation using is instead of ==, so commutation with deserialized Paulis is broken.
Can you give a code example of the commutation being broken?
