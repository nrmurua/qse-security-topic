I noticed the following behavior when directly adding parameters to a station:
This issues a warning "foo is used in the snapshot while it should be excluded from the snapshot", and the parameter indeed appears in the snapshot even though it shouldn't.
This is a simple fix, it should just be a an additional condition here. I don't have time to write a proper PR with tests for this right now, but I can submit something later if this isn't fixed by then.
thank you @mgunyho ! a PR later is great :)
