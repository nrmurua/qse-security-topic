Add tests for controlled-swap gate for qasm simulator (statevector), statevector simulator, unitary simulator.
Like other tests in the qasm simulator these should test for execution in the standard basis gates (which will soon include cswap directly), the waltz basis gates (u1, u2, u3, cx), and the minimal basis gate set (cx, u3).
Looking into this.
