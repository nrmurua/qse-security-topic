Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
In #3821 I added a cirq.Alignment enum and attempted to make it serializable. Unfortunately, it's not possible to define _json_dict_ on an enum subclass because enum reserves single underscore _names_ for internal use. To allow serializing enums we would need to do something different. For now, I've marked the enum as not yet serializable. We have a few other enums, e.g. in the placement/routing code, but none of them are serializable.
Describe the solution you'd like
It'd be great if there were a somewhat generic way to make enums serializable, something like json_serializable_dataclass but specific to enums.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
Some ideas that have been thrown around for this:
General recommendation here is to not use the Enum class; trying to get a change to Enum accepted into Python is pretty much the only full solution to this, but it would take a very long time for that to be available to Cirq.
