I started learning yesterday about Qiskit and I’m also IBMer, I’m so proud. In other hands, it’s a beginner question for who wants to get start in finance domain Q.
I want to do some proof of concept in finance domain. No matter what, just want to see a problem being solved in finance domain. So I went throfuh Acqua Finance but couldn’t understand where I am and where can I go.
My guess is that before jumping into Aqua / finance, why not start with the basics section first, e.g., the material in section 2 of https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials, and then the 'basics' part of section 1 in the same place.
Anyway, also making sure you're aware of the finance-specific tutorials and examples in: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/tree/master/qiskit/aqua/finance
Let us know if this still doesn't do it, there can be additional paths to go through
Just a reminder that the name is now aqua without c. :-)
