The cirq package documentation is out of date w.r.t. the tooling. In particular, the dev docs talk about using package creation scripts in a way that doesn't make sense since cirq-untsable was introduced.
development.md is not under dev section of docs
mention that first verify will likely fail
type "take not of this value"
Initial draft below
Prepare
a) Make sure you're on an up to date master branch and in cirq's root directory.
b) Ensure you have pypi and test pypi accounts with access to cirq distribution
visit test.pypi.org
your environment should contain TEST_PYPI_USERNAME etc
c) What version are you releasing?
Create a release branch called "v${VERSION}-dev".
Bump the development version on master. master branch should never see a non-dev version specifier.
Create a binary distribution wheel. This is the package that will go to pypi.
Upload the package to test pypi and verify that it works.
a) Upload
b) Automated verification
c) Manual verification
Draft a GitHub release and a release announcement email.
a) Summarize changes since last release.
b) Include the binary wheel as an attachment to the github release.
Release the prod and verify.
a) Upload
b) Automated verification
c) Manual verification
Publish the github release and send the announcement email to cirq-notify
Random addendums before I forget:
6b should be "./dev_tools/packaging/verify-published-package.sh "${VER}" --prod"
6c should include python version
7 should email to cirq-announce@
As Adam points out, the version name must be of the form v0.7.0 or else various regexes will fail.
I have updated release docs.  See #3136 for the latest improvements that Balint discovered when running through the procedure.
