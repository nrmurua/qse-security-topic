Given a shot budget of $N_{\text{tot}}$ measurements, it would be nice to distribute them in different quantities for different scale factors in ZNE.
The optimal choice is the one that minimizes the estimator variance. So, e.g., if the estimator of the zero noise limit is a linear combination of noisy results evaluated a different scale factors ${\lambda_j}$:
$$A_{\text{mitigated}} = \sum \eta_j A_{\text{noisy}}(\lambda_j),$$
then, assuming that each expectation value has approximately the same variance, the optimal choice is something like:
$$ N_j  \propto |\eta_j|, \qquad \text{such that}   \qquad \sum_j N_j = N_{\text{tot}}.$$
Not immediately clear what is the best way of supporting this.
To be discussed.
Note that the shot_list argument of BatchedFactory objects (an option that we rarely used and tested) may be useful for this issue.
For a more detailed treatment of the optimal shot distribution see, e.g., the following paper:
