Using 1.0 on windows, I ran into this error when trying to use the artiq_rpctool
Installing pyreadline fixed this. Could this be included in the conda package?
How did you install pyreadline?
conda install pyreadline in the artiq environment. Is that okay?
On windows yes. It's a dependency now.
Not anymore because platform-specific dependencies are broken with conda (of course they are). But if readline is not found now, instead of crashing you just lose line-editing capabilities in interactive mode, and a message telling you to install it.
