The BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements pass fails if any of the proceeding operations involve loose qubits or clbits (i.e. those not in registers).
Loose qubit:
gives
Similarly, if I put the qubit in a register and use only the loose clbit, such as by constructing the circuit with
I get a similar error on the clbit:
The clbit error is the only one that particularly matters, since BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements is run as part of routing where the qubit registers have already been canonicalised.  We shouldn't be getting an error in the internal structures.
The pass creates a new internal DAG for the barrier layer like this: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/fca8db6b86cba106ed0449a99cd10223899b6145/qiskit/transpiler/passes/utils/barrier_before_final_measurements.py#L53-L58
which doesn't include loose clbits.  We don't want to use DAGCircuit.copy_empty_like because that would also copy things like metadata and global phase, but we do need to add the loose bits.
