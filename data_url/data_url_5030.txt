A naive single-qubit version can be implemented immediately and leverage the existing general unitary functions, through relaxing the requirement of unitarity.
Balint has implemented one and two qubit general Kraus maps.
Extension to multiqubit Kraus maps (leveraging multiControlledMultiQubitUnitary) would now be trivial
