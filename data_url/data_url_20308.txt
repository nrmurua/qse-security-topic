The minimal KEM example code the same for NIST and master. The wiki page has almost the same code bar whitespace changes and a macro expansion. For simplicity, I'd like to remove the code block and link to the C example files directly (2 vs 3 things to maintain). Before doing so, is there a need to retain the wiki code block?
Let's try keeping the C code in there for now, as it acts a bit as an illustrated example.  There is the risk of getting out of sync.  I've added a new wiki page called "Release process" to keep track of the things we have to do for a release, and noted that we should check that the examples are in sync.
The PQ KEM example wiki has been updated & the tests worked on a Lunbuntu 18.04 VM. Does anyone feel like proof-reading the wiki content?
I've fixed the leftover references to 'minimal_kem_oqs' with the newer 'example_kem'. The CMake block has been removed following the discussion in the 2018-10-31 weekly meeting.
The SIG example wiki pages have been updated & the code/cmds run cleanly on a Lubuntu 18.04 VM:
Does anyone want to volunteer for a proof read? :-)
I've removed the old references to RAND/KEX etc in the coding conventions wiki:

One TODO exists. on the master branch there is something I don't recognise with the sigs. There's src/sig/sig_[algorithm] dirs and and src/sig/[algorithm] dirs. I'm not sure what the difference is between them.
