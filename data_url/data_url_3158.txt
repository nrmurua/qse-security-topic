Starting out the documentation for a quantum programming library with 3-4 pages of ways to install different components on different architectures doesn't feel especially compelling to me. I think there is probably an easy way to break this up by linking to qvm/quilc (a la README) or to other pages that go into further detail if necessary, so we can get people running their first quantum program as fast as possible.
