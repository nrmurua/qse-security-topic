On seeing this message it confuses some users to believe that a failure has ocurred when exceuting an algorithm that requires lots of circuits to be executed when a job limit is reached. The backend limit error is detected when submitting a job so the code progresses as expected - however the message, maybe due to the fact that it is at Warning level, confuses people. Perhaps this should be dropped to Debug level so we can see its happening if we need to debug a problem, and so users would not normally see this.

Algorithms have been refactored over to use primitives and circuit execution etc is now handled by these. As such I am closing this issue.
