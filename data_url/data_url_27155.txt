We should create a branch, which is compatible with nixos-21.05, soon.
Items to wait for before we branch:
After the branch-off we can start removing packages that have been ported to upstream nixpkgs
Regarding Pysisyphus we should know more somewhere next week. We will see if we can sort out all the issues we are facing there. The branch is unfortunately a bit messy but contains otherwise important fixes (like PySCF bug fix, NWchem assertion fix and XTB pkg-config support). In case we cannot solve this in a reasonable time frame, we can just cherry pick those changes, that are independent of Pysis and merge them separately before branching.
I have opened the 21.05 branch now, since we already start to diverge from nixpkgs master (see e.g.: #68). We can always back port patches later if needed.
We are still waiting for the AVX512 fix though.
OK, the AVX512 fix in openblas has now reached the nixos-21.05 channel. I have removed the fix in our 21.05 branch 0295502.
NixOS-QChem-21.05 is officially ready now.
