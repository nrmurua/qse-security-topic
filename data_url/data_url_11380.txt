The QAOA Results object has some dictionaries as attributes. These dictionaries use strings with white spaces as keys, see: https://github.com/entropicalabs/openqaoa/blob/main/openqaoa/optimizers/result.py#L69
That is a problem when trying to serialize the results object to a json. For good serialization, those white spaces should be removed. However, this means that older code that uses these keys will not work anymore.
