Using cirq.optimize_for_target_gateset(circuit, gateset=cirq.CZTargetGateset()) returns a circuit with more moments. First, it doesn't combine the multiple single qubit rotations into a single PhasedXZGate. Second, it distributes the operations of an optimal moment to make it non-optimal
How to reproduce the issue
I find that using cirq.merge_single_qubit_moments_to_phxz(circ) first fixes the issue.
Cirq version
1.2.0.dev20230628175157
+1 There should be some check that it isn't increasing the number of moments.
