Setting the width and height of the iplot_qsphere figure, as done in the other interactive plots, gives no image because the units for width and height seem to be in pixels (although the size of the eignvalue text seems to be fine).  Thus, anything less width or height >= 300 or so gives a useless figure.
The figure width and height should be set as in all other visual functions.
@filemaster
@nonhermitian, for all figures, the size that you can set is for the container and the units are pixels. The figure will be plotted in the container according its size. I think there is no any bug and all works as expected. The only thing we can do is to force a minimum size for the containers (ignoring user defined size if it is smaller).
