When running the terra unit tests locally from a fresh master with no local modification the image comparison in the pass manager visualization tests fail for me locally. Either we need to relax the comparison threshold or make the image drawing deterministic
Run unit tests with graphviz installed
The tests pass

I also doubt these tests will work in travis, it looks like we're skipping them because graphviz isn't installed in the CI environment: https://travis-ci.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/jobs/202883754#L2216
In a patch that fixes this we should add graphviz to the installed package list to verify this works everywhere.
These are the images being generated locally for me by the 2 failing  tests:

is this an exclusive image comparison issue (like a slightly different alignment)? Maybe a font availability issue?
@1ucian0 is correct, it looks like the font is different see this snippet of the reference file :

I will have a look at pinning this so that it is the same everywhere.
Fonts might vary a lot in each platform. Ideally, we should try to find the same font for every platform, but it might not be possible. We should consider alternatives if that's a dead-end.
What about dumping the pydot graph to DOT and asserting based on that? We can still verify that we are building the graph correctly, and leave pydot to draw the graph consistently. It should be more robust to changes in environment (and would be diffable!)
