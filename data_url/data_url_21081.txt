When submitting a transaction to the network, it takes minutes before it appears in the results of a getObject gRPC call, even if the transaction was pushed into the same node that getObject API call is being made against. Typically I can see it in the results when it is committed three blocks behind the current block height.
It would be beneficial even if the transaction is not committed to a block, that its details are revealed through the API the moment a node becomes aware of the existence of the transaction.
Similar to how you can see pending mempool transactions for other blockchains.
The PublicAPI is fetches transactions by hash from the bufferedChain..
It is actually going through the mempool before moving to the stable blockchain...
I am going to bump up the priority because this can be an indication of another problem
