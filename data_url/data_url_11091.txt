I wanted to use big hydrogen chains for benchmarking of my code.
However, as it turns out, the biggest Hchain I can created using the following piece of code is of length 11:
For higher values of number_of_hydrogens I get an error. After some investigation I have realized that it's because of name_molecule function, which has a multiplicity_dict with keys up to 12.
I don't even need to get the name of the molecule anywhere, so it's unfortunate that this exception is being raised – I need to either use my own custom version Openfermion or switch to using pySCF.
