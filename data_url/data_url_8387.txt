I am generating a new source distribution and run into an issue of copying the .pyx files. For all the files in qutip.cy we want both the .cpp files and .pyx files to be copied in the source. But currently only the .cpp files are being copied.
Did we face this issue before? I think the addition of the MANIFEST.in file in 4.3 overrides the package_include that setup uses.
This issue statsmodels/statsmodels#1606 seems to suggest that they should be added the MANIFEST.in file.

Numpy seems to add it this way - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/MANIFEST.in
If it is okay then I can change the MANIFEST files and continue the 4.3 release.
Resolved.
