from the make.log:
Inspecting vector_x86.h reveals that the stated intrinsics are used when __FMA4__ is defined, which is most likely only the case on AMD Bulldozer/Piledriver (Opteron).
Unfortunately I couldn't find any references to the specified intrinsics so far.
Furthermore (and here is the problem): it seems that FMA4 on Zen is still available, but seems to be broken and while it doesn't get exposed via cpuid there are some binutils around which still enable it. See the wikipedia entry for an overview and the respective links.
While it currently seems that when __FMA4__ is set, the build will fail, there is also a chance that it could compile but return wrong results when running on a Zen, hence we should add -mno-fma4 if we detect that -fma4 is added as part of -march=native to prevent that from happening and fix the build on platforms which would actually support FMA4.
As we have seen in libvori with adding -mno-avx we can't simply add -mno-fma4 all the time.
Maybe we can use check_gcc_flag to check if -mno-fma4 is available.
This issue seems to only affect old Opteron CPUs. Since no one has commented on this in the past ~2 years, I guess there are not many of those left anymore.
