Hi, this is more a question than an issue.
According to this line, it is not recommended to use global variables as Lj_variable. Is this still the case?
I didn't notice this instruction and ran several simulations using a global variable and it seemed to be working just fine. What would exactly go wrong if you would use a global variable?
I'm using HFSS version 2022
