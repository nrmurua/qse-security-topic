While this issue is raised, we should also add a doc for how to perform the release process - including permissions required and any extra tests above and beyond the CI suite that should be run.
@iamvamsikrishnad, could you look into this? If I understand correctly, getting the versions to match will require a new release (i.e. v0.0.3).

This just came up in #62: as part of the release process, we should have some way to identify what PR the release aligns with. I think Github project releases are the way to do this, but I'm not 100% certain.
Each release should be tagged, e.g. git tag v0.04, so that it shows up on github under releases. (And then remember that git treats tags weirdly, so the tag has to be specifically pushed, which I tend to forget.)
We've been seeing increased interest in a stable qsim-Cirq interface, so I've picked up this request. So far, I've found a convenient way of constructing a "fire and forget"-style release in Kokoro, the tool we use to test TFQ compatibility. Once that pipeline is built, I'll cut a new release and send out a PR documenting how to trigger it.
Sounds good.
Version 0.1.0 has been released! We now also have docs/release-qsimcirq.md with details on the release process, which is Google-internal. I've left TODOs for myself to add internal docs for this; until then, users are advised to contact me if a release is needed.
