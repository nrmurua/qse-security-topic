Question: Is this supposed to be False ?
and
The DepolarizingChannel class doesn't have an approx_eq(). I've opened #3887 as a potential fix.
Ahhh thx for digging into it a little more. I took a quick look in the files in your PR and it looks like none of the channels have this _approx_eq_ method. Going to re-title this to encompass the larger issue. Would you mind expanding your PR to cover all the channels in common_channels.py ? I'd be happy to review.
