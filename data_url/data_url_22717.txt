This is related to #75.
Did you upgrade and try again? I fixed that problem in aba2d3f and tested it OK on my KC705 board.
The connection between github commit ID and Binstar build number is opaque
to me. It's not at either of these URLs. Should I be looking elsewhere?

I updated conda. Reflashed FPGA. Problem persists.
LED blinking. Press CTRL-C to break. LED continues to blink for 2 seconds. Then LED stops blinking. Stays solid illuminated.
Repeated this sequence twice to same effect.
Cannot reproduce on my board. The LED never stops blinking here, which indicates the experiment is correctly run alternatively from the flash and from the PC control.
What are your DDB entries for the devices? Also, can you try with a simpler test case that just blinks a LED and does not touch other devices?
Problem persists with a simpler idle program.
Cannot reproduce, the ELF file recovered from your artiq_coreconfig read works correctly as idle kernel on my board.
Bah. There is no travis build integrating my fix. I thought you had checked that...
There is a package with the fix now, you may test and reopen if the problem still exists.
Confirmed that this works on NIST Penning lab's KC705. Required reflash of
FGPA. Using conda build artiq 0.0 np_1357.
