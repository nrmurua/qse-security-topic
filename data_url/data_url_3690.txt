It would be very useful to have a function which uses run_async to submit batches of jobs to the queue for running programs that involve a large number of jobs. This could also include a progress bar.
What else should this support? In the jupyter notebook we could even support a mode in which the jobs are fetched by a second thread that also updates a progress bar.
Ya it'd be awesome to have a version that worked in Jupyter too.
After chatting with @mpharrigan it makes sense for this method to support both using _async and non-async modes of execution, plus batching and so forth.
I too would like such a function.  Failing that, it would still be good to be able to query multiple async jobs with a single query, e.g., qpu.get_job(list_of_job_ids), as it can currently take a while to fetch a large batch of jobs that have all successfully executed.
Will refactor this to reflect desire for batch mode program execution on QPU (I think the async parts of this should be covered).
