I was trying to compare the parameter shift and finite differences gradients on a simple example - while the parameter shift result seems correct, finite differences provide a vector of zeros.
The output:
You can run this code - please, download the pickled ansatz from here.
I'd expect both results to be the same, up to some numerical inaccuracy.
