Fresh liboqs builds now break due to a failed Keccak/GitHub dependency.
scripts/build-keccak-code-package.sh tries to download a now non-existent file:
https://github.com/gvanas/KeccakCodePackage/archive/master.zip
GitHub provides this instead: https://github.com/XKCP/XKCP
The build script fails @ line 21 as it's expecting different directory names than the one XKCP provides.
Resolved by #337.
