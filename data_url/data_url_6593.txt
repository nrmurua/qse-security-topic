As discussed offline, installing pybind11 as part of the pip install qsimcirq process may be driving the installation time way up. This is especially true for the Docker install test, where the Docker image must install git in order to install qsimcirq.
To remedy this, we should instead require that users install pybind11 on their system and add documentation explaining this requirement.
pip install qsimcirq will skip pybind installation if the user already has it installed. Including pybind11 in the qsim requirements was the correct choice.
