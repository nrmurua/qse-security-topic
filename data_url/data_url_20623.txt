Hi everyone,
It seems, that the NTRU-Prime PR (#251 ) broke the implementation for me. After applying 094324c OpenSSL fails when setting the curve list. It works when only one entry is defined and breaks as soon as a second entry is added. Example:
After a little bit of debugging it seems that the problem is the duplicate check in tls1_set_groups in ssl/t1_lib.c.
Before 094324c the following line always results in 0:
idmask = 1L << id;
This seems weird since the id returned by tls1_nid2group_id, is an index in [0,31] for classical algos and the curve_id for PQ algos. Since the curve_id usually is much higher than 31 this should result in undefined behavior.
Sadly, IMHO there is not trivial fix available, since all values until 31 are already used by the classical algorithms from OpenSSL. Further, the id is stored in the resulting group list and is needed in the format as described above.
I have designed a rather ugly fix, with the aim to preserve as much compatibility as possible. I will link this issue in the PR.
Cheers,
Robin
