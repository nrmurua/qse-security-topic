The test input https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/tests/QS/regtest-dft-vdw-corr-2/argon-vdW-DF-cx0p.inp  requires libint but the corresponding folder only asks for libxc (see test failure )

What do you typically do in such a case - create  QS/regtest-dft-vdw-corr-4 and move the input there?
create QS/regtest-dft-vdw-corr-4 and move the input there?
I think, it's ok to just add libint as a requirement for QS/regtest-dft-vdw-corr-2.
