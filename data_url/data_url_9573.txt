Even though our device is not yet compatible with 3D registers, it seems to be a rather straightforward improvement to allow for the creation of 3D registers
Aaaaaaaah, finally! ðŸ˜„
Need a hand on that?
What would it look like in the end? Here's a proposal:
Parameter names such as "columns" or "rows" were convenient but maybe we should use new names such as "x", "y" and "z" or anything related.
Along the way, should we always manipulate qubits in 3D, with z = 0 for 2D shapes ?
We talked a bit about it. The problem is two-fold :
Regarding implementing pregenerated geometries (i.e. other than from_coordinates), nothing has yet been discussed. It is particularly tricky in 3D, as way more possible regular lattices are allowed. I we were to implement it, I would simply suggest cubic (the simplest), face-centered cubic and hexagonal-coled packed lattices (the densest ones)
