When adding a ControlFlowOp to QuantumCircuit, the parameter table is not updated with any of the parameters that occur in the bodies of the control-flow operators.
The inner parameter Parameter(x) should have been tracked as well.
Likely update QuantumCircuit._update_parameter_table to pull parameters out of ControlFlowOp instances as well.  With the way they store the bodies of the instructions in the params field, it's probably best just to teach _update_parameter_table to pull things out of QuantumCircuit instances as well.
