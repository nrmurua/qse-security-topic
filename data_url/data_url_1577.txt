@ggardet Do you have more information about how the test fails?
I forgot to add the log, sorry. I added it to the 1st comment now.
A rounding error...e-32... we should just use np.isclose(np.imag(v), atol=1e-16) or similar.
I can test a patch if needed.

Could someone who has access to this architecture please see if the fix provided works?
@ggardet ?
We happen to be putting together the NixOS package for this at the moment and we're finding this and a few other tests are failing on aarch64-linux due to tolerance issues. Full log: https://hydra.nixos.org/log/df0xzjzyvn3g8g9pmaais8y8k5wv3pd3-python3.8-cirq-core-0.13.1.drv

Yes, the fix in #4636 make the test to pass. Thanks!
@ggardet Awesome
@risicle Does this fix work for that NixOS package? Note, you'll need to test on the dev version of Cirq: pip install cirq==0.14.0.dev20211112014647
@risicle added fixes for the tests you list.  Could you verify these are now fine.  Thanks!
Absolutely. 100%. Perfect - thankyou. üëç
