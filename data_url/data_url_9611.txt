Currently, the QM restrictions on durations of waveforms, pulses and delays are enforced every time. Since not all devices might necessarily need to obey such restrictions, we should move them to the Device class. In this way, the default duration restrictions will just be that they are int, seeing as we don't plan on going below 1 ns precision.
