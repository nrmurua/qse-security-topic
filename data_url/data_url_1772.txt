Description of the issue
PR #3698 hit the following pylint errors:
These files were not modified in this PR; as far as I can tell, the issues above were introduced in #3643 and #3644. Strangely, those PRs did not get flagged by the pylint checker.
I have confirmed that all three PRs listed here used pylint-2.6.0 in their checks.
How to reproduce the issue
Unclear. It seems like check/pylint behaves inconsistently in PR tests; we should double-check that it's set up correctly.
Cirq version
v0.10.0-dev
I was not able to reproduce this locally on branch 95-martin-orion:cirq-expects-values, despite both issues being present on inspection.
On My Mac, I see only the Unused Dict imported from typing (unused-import) error, the other too doesn't show up. It's odd that pylint is inconsistent between environments.
I can find some issues locally. I'm using ubuntu and it happens to be an ec2 instance, so I could share access with someone if they want to repro (or run some commands to help track things).
Some pylint errors on my local machine from the main branch

Marking resolved since I can't remember seeing this since the two PRs above.
