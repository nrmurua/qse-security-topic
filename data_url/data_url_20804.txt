Dear, PQClean project,
Thanks so much for this project!
While running the FiraSaber KEM with liboqs (which copies it from this library: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/scripts/copy_from_pqclean/copy_from_pqclean.yml#L173, https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/src/kem/saber/CMakeLists.txt#L3) with the -fsanitize=undefined flag, this undefined behaviour was flagged (coping the output of the liboqs library):
which corresponds to line https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/blob/master/crypto_kem/firesaber/clean/poly_mul.c#L50 over here.
I'm using clang 11.0.0 on x86_64-Darwin-18.7.0.
It needs a few casts, Kyber had the same problem but running into it is a matter of probability. The Kyber code should have a fix in the same file and function.
PRs are more than welcome :)
