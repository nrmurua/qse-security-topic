When running a VQE algorithm with ansatz UCCSD the following error message shows up:
In case of ansatz EfficientSU2 the code runs fine, only with UCCSD I get the error.
I tracked down the error to be caused by missing parameter bounds. The function signature of the optimizer's minimize function (``) suggests that None is a valid value. But the code never handles None-type input (neither `None` nor the nested list/tuple with `None` values).
So, I propose one of the following changes:
Any fixes (or suggestions therefore) are highly appreciated.
Thanks for reporting this!
If SNOBFIT requires bounds then I think the optimizer should raise an error if they are not passed. The interface is dictated by the Optimizer class so we can't really change that, and adding default bounds is very restrictive (e.g. [0,2pi] is not valid as soon as the circuit contains e.g. a gate like Ry(0.0001 * theta)).
@Cryoris Based on your comment I added a more concise error message in #8638
This resolves the problem at hand in the SNOBFIT code but actually there is still an open question: When I use ansatz EfficientSU2, all parameter bounds are set to (-pi, pi) allowing proper usage of optimizer SNOBFIT. On the other hand with ansatz UCCSD all parameter bounds are set to (None, None).
So, maybe someone with more insight into the ansatzes might have a look at it and can tell why those two ansatzes treat SNOBFIT so differently.
