When upgrading qiskit with pip install --upgrade qiskit from qiskit 0.16 to 0.18 the new
installation failed with the same problem as documented in #4048 and listed as closed two
weeks ago.  Following the instructions that were posted 2 days ago in that same issue
#4048 (comment)
('pip install qiskit-terra[visualizations]`) fixed the issue, however the
standard upgrade path should not leave the user in a bad state.
pip install --upgrade qiskit
User has a usable qiskit installation after an upgrade without performing extra steps.
This was fixed in qiskit-terra 0.14.0 with #4229
