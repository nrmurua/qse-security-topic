I'd like to access datasets across experiments as described in on this page, but have not been able to find any information on how to do that and my guess work hasn't been successful either. In the first experiment, a dataset is generated. In the second experiment, I use the get_dataset method to retrieve the first experiment's dataset, but get_dataset is returning an attribute error.
I am both asking how to access data from a previous experiment and that such a useful feature be explained on the tutorial page https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual/getting_started_mgmt.html#datasets
Thank you!
The experiment that sets the dataset needs to specify broadcast=True for it to be accessible on the master.
The experiment generating the data does have Broadcast=True . Still getting the Attriburre Error. I can even see the dataset updated in the GUI
Thank you for taking time to look into this. While posting the code, I realized I simply misspelled get_dataset. It looks like everything is working fine. Thank you again!
