With all the symbols' values, can I have a simple way to obtain a unitary from PQC layer?
Although, I can define a new function to replace symbols with corresponding values in circuit definition, I think it is inconvenient.
You could make use of tfq.calculate_uitary or cirq.unitary functions once you are finished training with the PQC layer.
Michael's answer seems to work, any other updates on this issue?
