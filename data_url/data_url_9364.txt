There is one good news and one bad news after checking the code for generating Z3 and Z4 ordered states.
Good news: now the new interface can correctly deal with big interaction strength, and run simulation for Z3 and Z4 within reasonable amount of time (by setting adapative to be true). This is great!ÔºÅ
Bad news: for the following code
prob = SchrodingerProblem(reg, total_time, h; dt=1e-2);
The returning number of measurements should be consistent with number total_time/dt. However, the number of measurment steps is given by the actual tiny time steps total_time/ \delta t. I think this is a interface problem.
