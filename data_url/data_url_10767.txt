Description
If you have a big QUBO matrix Q of your problem in ndarray format, the find_embedding method throws an error. This does not happen if you send the same Qubo matrix Q in dict format (eg{(0,1): 1, {1,2}: 0 ....}.
To Reproduce
Expected behavior
Since the EmddingComposite allows qubo matrices in ndarray format. I expected that minorminer admits it too for large matrices as this one with large numbers.
Environment:
Please review the documentation of find_embedding -- the function accepts either an iterable of edges or a NetworkX graph.  As you note, iteration over q_dict provides a list of edges suitable for use in find_embedding without translation to QUBO.
