Here's the LLVM patch that fixes this:
Unfortunately it (while correctly changing codegen) pessimizes test_pulse_rate_dds for unknown reasons, and has a negligible effect on test_pulse_rate. Therefore it doesn't seem worth integrating.
Doesn't this indicate that there is a bigger bug somewhere else?
@jordens Maybe, depending on how you define "bug". As @sbourdeauducq has mentioned elsewhere the root cause of this could be cache aliasing. Unfortunately MiSoC CPU &c cores do not currently provide any insight into their operation--there are no performance counters or anything. The most I could do is a sampling profiler, based on libunwind, but I don't think that will help this issue.
Arguably we should look into it. However, I'm not sure how this fits into the overall roadmap, and this is definitely a nontrivial change--we're looking, at the very least, at a fork of mor1kx and accompanying infrastructure changes, which is annoying enough already.
Per discussion with @jordens the fix should be merged and test condition relaxed (until the other bug is fixed).

RISC-V code seems fine.
