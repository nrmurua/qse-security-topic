Describe the bug
I am simply trying to run the code published on the qutip documentation website for the https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html
I copied the code under the section: Pre-computing the Floquet modes for one period,
and that worked fine, but then at the end of the section they point towards the function 'fsesolve' which would be the 'all-in-one' version of the code given previously, however it doesnt work and i get the error:
The code:

@sahrak Thank you for reporting this. The parameters for sesolve changed slightly since the guide was written and the guide wasn't updated. I will make a PR to fix it shortly, but in the mean time you can run:
@sahrak If #1675 works for you, I will merge it.
