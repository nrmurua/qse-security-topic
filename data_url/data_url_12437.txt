I believe my issue may be similar to #771, which doesn't look like it has been resolved yet.
I am trying to install and use tensorflow-quantum but am having no luck. (For reference, I am using MacOS Ventura 13.4) Thus far, I have tried a variety of methods, none of which have worked.
Method 1: Pip package (my preferred method)
I set up and activate a virtual environment tfqenv and then followed the website instructions as closely as possible. I ran the following commands:
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install tensorflow==2.11.0
pip3 install -U tensorflow-quantum
My error message is in the screenshots below. It appears there is some issue with the file _tfq_simulate_ops.so. Namely, the symbol __ZN10tensorflow12OpDefBuilder10SetShapeFnENSt3__18functionIFNS_6StatusEPNS_15shape_inference16InferenceContextEEEE cannot be found.
For reference, here are the package versions installed in my environment:
As you can see, I am using tensorflow=2.11.0 and tensorflow-quantum=0.7.2.
Also, I am using Python version 3.8.3:
Considering that it seems like others may have encountered similar issues recently, I am wondering if TFQ is in need of an upgrade. It looks like it hasn't been updated since July 2022.
I will post my questions about the other two methods I've tried soon. But for now, this pip package method is the one I care most about.
The _ZN10tensor sort of error has come up multiple times, not just #771 but the linked issues in my responses, #602, #714, #180, #711. The solution in those cases would appear to be the same solution here. This is usually the result of a version mismatch, make sure to check the version of the associated release (since you are not installing the nightly build), TFQ 0.7.2 has TF 2.7.0 as a requirement, not 2.11 (v0.7.2...master#diff-4d7c51b1efe9043e44439a949dfd92e5827321b34082903477fd04876edb7552L8). The full list of requirements is:
With python3.8 and a branch new environment, I can install using pip and run with no problems with TF 2.7:
I have implemented your suggested solution and, at least thus far, everything appears to be working very smoothly. I am feeling delighted. Thank you so much!
It turns out that sharing my questions about the two other methods would be little more than a moot point at this stage.
the issue still persist, solution to install tf 2.7.0
