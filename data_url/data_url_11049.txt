The solution to the maxcut problem of ring is not uniqueï¼Œso I want to add an initial_beta and initial_gamma which I guess will give me the optimal angles near the given initial angles. Thus, I add initial angles to the qaoa_maxcut
inst = maxcut_qaoa(graph=square_ring, steps=steps, initial_beta=1.2, initial_gamma=1.2 )
Then error happens as below


@huichencrytal what's the number of steps you feed into your program? the number of initial values need to match two times the number of steps:
@jotterbach Oh Yes! I forget to change the steps. It works now. I'm so sorry it seems like a stupid question.
@huichencrytal no problem at all! Glad this was it! A good way to get these things sorted out in a faster way is also the Forest Community slack channel http://slack.rigetti.com/
@jotterbach Thank you very much! I just joined the Forest Community slack channel. Excited!
