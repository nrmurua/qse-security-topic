Parameters can themselves run qcodes Loops. These have the flag active=False to indicate that they are not the main loop. As such, qc.active_loop/dataset still returns the main loop/dataset.
When running a main loop in a separate thread that has itself created a loop, calling qc.stop() only stops the inner loop, while the outer continues.
