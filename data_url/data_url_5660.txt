I install qiskit with this requirements.txt
the error says
it should be installed successfully
No response
Could you try x-code-select --install?
This error is frequently happened when mac os is updated, I guess.

I did xcode-select --install, and sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/ but the problem still exist.
there is no message for wchar.h, but conan install: error: unrecognized arguments is still exist
I think the underlying issue here is that you're version of pip is not finding the precompiled binary via a wheel package for qiskit-aer on pypi. Unless you're trying to build qiskit-aer from source, pip should not ever try to build it from source on a support platform. The things I would check are that you're pip version is up to date. If it's not try running python -m pip install -U pip. If it's already up to date then I would try looking at the verbose output when running pip install to try and figure out why pip is rejecting the precompiled binaries.
I just upgraded pip to pip-23.1, but problem still exist.
Here are the verbose log:
You will need to increase the verbosity further with -vvv to see pip checking each individual file to see why it is ignoring one. But looking at that log it looks like pip has no issues with other py3.9 arm64 wheels for other packages. You can try manually downloading: https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8b/3c/359839a3f3d026a9e8dfc7898dd02e5554933a496e0fe212b739485d3420/qiskit_aer-0.12.0-cp39-cp39-macosx_11_0_arm64.whl and pip installing from the wheel file to see why it is not accepting the wheel for qiskit-aer
