The following packages are broken (nixpkgs master: ea780f3de2d169f982564128804841500e85e373):

molcas1809: is this still needed with SHARC-3.0?
Nope, not required anymore.
pysisyphus
python3.vermouth
tests.molcas
I can take a look on these the next days, after I'm done with my presentation :)

builds actually fine for me:

Builds now too for me, after restarting the build 3 times. Something is quirky in the makefiles...
Hm the simplest solution may be to disable parallel building: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/c3e128f3c0ecc1fb04aef9f72b3dcc2f6cecf370/pkgs/applications/science/chemistry/molden/default.nix#L34C6-L34C6
Without some make packages fail, e.g. CFour also can not be built in parallel.
Pysisyphus fails because molcas fails. The molcas error is more severe, see here: https://gitlab.com/Molcas/OpenMolcas/-/issues/420 and here https://gitlab.com/Molcas/OpenMolcas/-/commit/df2d6a459b648ecf4f11f0af995e445ab7feb6b4 for a patch. Apparently pyparsing 3.11 broke some behaviour. The pysis error will disappear with a Molcas update.
This was also the original cause for the failing tests.molcas.
The pymolcas patch can unfortunately not be applied to Molcas 23.10, directly, there is too much offset and changes inbetween. We could manually backport these changes to OpenMolcas 23.10 and vendor our own patch or we can use molcas version from master. What do you think @markuskowa ?

Yes, the original patch looks quite simple. We could create our own patch here and apply it in nixpkgs. I would prefer to unbreak molcas, since we do not know when they will tag a new release.
Fixes the original Molcas problem and Pysisyphus: NixOS/nixpkgs#282890
