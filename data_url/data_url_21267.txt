Attempting to calibrate Urukul synchronization fails with "no IO_UPDATE-SYNC_CLK alignment edge found".
That was observed with Urukul 1.4. When using the default 125MHz RTIO clock and PLL setting (N=32) on the same hardware system then synchronization works.
2 problems right there.
First, the current AD9910 driver seems to be unable to support a sysclk frequency that is lower than the RTIO frequency. This is demonstrated by this line in AD9910.

Second, the sync_clk frequency divider needs to be updated. sync_clk frequency needs to be f_sysclk/16, since f_sysclk = f_rtio/2, sync_div needs to be 4 in this case.
