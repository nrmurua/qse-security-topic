Description of the issue
ConvertToNeutralAtomGates is using PointOptimizer.  This should be using the new Transformer API as the PointOptimizer interface is deprecated.
See: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-core/cirq/neutral_atoms/convert_to_neutral_atom_gates.py#L25
As a related issue, the derived class PasqalConverter in cirq-pascal/pascal_device has goofy behavior, since convert and pasqal_convert have two different behaviors, and there isn't a great way to specify the keep attribute anymore.
Fixed by #5311
