I want to calculate the entanglement entropy of the ground state wave function. Which function should I use if I want to calculate the entanglement entropy for a wave function obtained through a subspace Hamiltonian? It seems that function density_matrix cannot be used for a SubspaceArrayReg.
I encountered the same issue earlier today and believe I have a solution. You can create a reverse dictionary from the subspace field in the SubspaceArrayReg and use that, coupled with the extracted state and number of atoms, to reconstruct the corresponding Array Reg. Here is a snippet I wrote that appears to be working. Let me know if you note any bugs. If there are no bugs, I believe a function that does this should be incorporated into Bloqade.
Thanks for posting the issue and Thanks @Kenny-Heitritter for the solution!
@Roger, could you take a look of the solution Kenny give?  If there is no issue, maybe we should incorporate this function to Bloqade as suggested by Kenny!
On second thought, while the above solution does technically work, I think it is highly inefficient since it takes the subspace state and enlarges it to the full space state to do the entropy measurement. A better solution would be to just get density_matrix() to act directly on the subspace state.
