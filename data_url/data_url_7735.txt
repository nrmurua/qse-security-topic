In lieu of the recent changes in git protocol https://github.blog/2021-09-01-improving-git-protocol-security-github/, the old command for installing to the stable version
pip install --no-deps -U git+git://github.com/jcmgray/quimb.git@develop
doesn't work anymore.
Following is the updated command
pip install --no-deps -U git+https://github.com/jcmgray/quimb.git@develop
