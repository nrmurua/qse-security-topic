Comment from @MichaelBroughton
"It would be nice to have a script like ./scripts/coverage_check.sh that would tell us our python and C++ code coverage. A quick look around bazel docs seems to show that comprehensive coverage support across python and C++ is still kind of in the works and since we're locked into an old version, 0.26.1 or lower, we might have to look elsewhere ?"
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
We will soon pin to Bazel v3.1.0, we could check again if this is doable. First point of entry: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/command-line-reference.html#coverage
