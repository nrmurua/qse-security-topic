Currently, fold_gates_from_left, fold_gates_from_right, and fold_gates_at_random are not compatible with  a scale_factor larger than 3, but it is often useful to go beyond 3. E.g., adaptive
extrapolation methods sometimes go beyond 3 and produce an error.
I know that in principle this can be solved using fold_local but in practice this is not very handy. Indeed we almost never use fold_local in our tests / examples.
A possible way of extending the domain of fold_gates_* functions with a minimal change is by using a decorator (e.g. @extend_scale_domain)  which could do a similar job of the current fold_local . Otherwise we could do a brute force change in the body of each function.
Completely agree @andreamari. Assuming others agree, I'm happy to make this change.
Sounds good. I would recommend against using a decorator as chaining decorators starts to be a bit complex to follow. Making the change in the function body should work well.
