I was running the guess pulse definition in a function and returned an error for the blackman waveform. It works for a Gaussian pulse definiton.
Traceback:
How is cubic_poly defined?
How is cubic_poly defined?
It is a polynomial function that I use to calibrate the pulse. Thing is, it works for a Gaussian shape but not the flat-top one.
We don't have a Gaussian shape in Krotov, so I'm not sure what you mean.
I can't really look into this without seeing the cubic_poly function, but I'm pretty sure you're passing a list or an array as t for flattop. It takes a scalar value, cf. the big "Note" in the function's documentation.
So this is not a bug
