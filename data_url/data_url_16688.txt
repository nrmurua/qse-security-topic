If the rotation angles are close to pi, pi will be displayed instead of the numeric value. This should also be the case for more complex ParameterExpressions. The pi_check function in qiskit.visualization.tools already recognizes if the angle is a ParameterExpression and calls the __str__ method of this class. We probably can update this method to replace numerical values close to pi with the string literal pi.
Here's an example:
should produce
Mind if I try this one? I haven't contributed to the project yet and it seems like I could handle this. Any suggestions/tips while I look around and get started?
Sure!
The visualizers check if the parameter values to go inside the box are close to pi using the qiskit.visualization.tools.pi_check. There we have the line
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/f38b617748d855e98f682d259b7cf597ef16b2a8/qiskit/visualization/tools/pi_check.py#L47
which means that, if the value is a ParameterExpression the __str__ method of this object is used. This is implemented as
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/f38b617748d855e98f682d259b7cf597ef16b2a8/qiskit/circuit/parameterexpression.py#L231
where self._symbol_expr is a SymPy expression.
Since SymPy only renders sympy.pi objects as pi, but not numeric values close to pi the expression does not render numpy.pi or any other pi-values in the correct way. You would probably have to check how SymPy can be forced to show close-to-pi values as pi.
However that might not be that simple, I imagine that it would be done by default if it were easy. Another possibility would be to recursively go through self._symbol_expr.args and replace 3.1415... by sympy.pi.
Here's a short code example you could use to test your ideas
This prints
but should instead produce
If you have any questions or need help feel free to reach out!
I think this might be a duplicate with #3868 with a pending PR #3876
Please, @ljeanette15 and @Cryoris redirect your efforts on that way (if it is true that is a duplicated, otherwise repoen)
That only checks if the whole ParameterExpression is close to pi, not if elements of it are close to pi. I double checked by checking out the PR branch, and the problem persisted, so I'll reopen üôÇ
Let me push up #3876 in my priority list so we can merge it soon and start working on this one. Thanks for checking!
#3876 merged!
Hi @1ucian0 and @Cryoris , the issue seems to be still not resolved (checked by the running the code on my system). I would like to give it a try if it is still not done.
Yes, it's still open! Let us know if you want to discuss something or could use some help üëç
For sure @Cryoris
I am trying to install qiskit-terra from source
when I do
pip install -e .
It give me this error
I have install visual c++ from the link in error
I did not check and box during its installation
Please help me out of this so I can proceed solving this issue

I downloaded visual c++ compiler from this link
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
Did you install cython? If you follow all steps on https://qiskit.org/documentation/contributing_to_qiskit.html#installing-terra-from-source (choose the Windows Tab) you should be able to install Terra from source.
Yes I did. I followed all the steps on the documentation link.
It still gives the error.
I forked qiskit-terra to my account
so rather then doing
git clone https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra.git
I used my link to clone could that be a reason for the error?
No that should not matter. It seems like pip cannot find Microsoft Visual C++, maybe try re-installing it or browsing similar issues in stackoverflow, such as https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49610212/pip-error-even-microsoft-visual-c-14-0-is-installed.
Another option would be to try:
python setup.py build_ext ‚Äîinplace
To see if it can build the modules that way. That works for me.
Thanks @Cryoris and @nonhermitian it worked for me. I am starting to resolve the issue.
I am trying to debug.
This issue persists with matplotlib and ASKII circuit.draw()
it does not go away even with pi = np.pi (using numpy)
any idea where can the issue be which can lead to this issue persisting in all the above cases?
It's a bit difficult to give comments without explicit information, what did you try to fix the issue? üôÇ
@Cryoris, Could we do something like the following in pi_check.py
This should print something like
q_0: ‚î§ RX((pi - x)*(pi - y)) ‚îú
Also, the code example you've provided gives me
19.7392088021787*(1 - 0.318309886183791*x)**2 instead of 2*(3.14159265358979 - x)**2
Not sure if this is expected behavior
I'm running it on Ubuntu 20.04 with python3
Hi,
I was going through the issue. Wanted to give a try. I found the the print is actually coming from _symbol_expr of parameterexpression and it is an instance of Sympy (sympy.core.add.Add) and might be using str of Sympy, which I think is not part of Qiskit Terra. so may be in the str of parameter expression, we do not use sympi and write something custom. Do you agree? Can i give a try?

This is definitely not the expected behaviour, it seems this happened with the last SymPy update. Now that is actually much worse ü§î
@Cryoris, Could we do something like the following in pi_check.py
Since the value of pi does not even show up anymore we cannot do a regex match, I think.
Hi @souviksbhowmik, great that you're interested!
Can i give a try?
I think @shshnkvadali is currently actively working on this, it is probably best for you two to exchange ideas on this, if that is fine with @shshnkvadali.
@shshnkvadali ,
Have you found a solution/approach for this? Otherwise can I collaborate on this?
regards

@souviksbhowmik
Sorry about the delay. I haven't found a conventional solution to this yet. Let me know if you have any ideas. We can definitely work on this together. Thanks
@Cryoris
I am interested to work on this problem.
print(float(sp.pi-np.pi)) gives 1.2246467991473532e-16
So I was thinking of adding an if statement here that checks if the actual pi value is within 1.2246467991473532e-16 of sympy.pi.
If so, then sympy.pi will be rendered.

However, this is in a branch. So how can I edit this?
