I performed ADAPT VQE calculations for CO molecule and found a bug. Using threshold = 0.0001 I get a convergence failure after three iterations. The problem seems to lie in the cycle_regex = re.compile(r'(.+)( \1)+') line 149 . If the sequence of excitation operators have the same numbers at the beginning or at the end, as in my example 190 126 62, then regex.search() finds 6 6 and stops calculations.
Run the gist.
Output: Alternating sequence found. Even though the excitation indices  are 190 126 62.
Convergence of the gradient norm. I found such problem only when threshold = 0.0001, which is really weird.
Fix cycle checking algorithm. Could you please explain me why is this che—Åking necessary?
Also it would be nice to add maximum number of iterations as an input parameter.
@mrossinek Max, are you able to take a look at this issue.
Hi @mdsapova
I just had a look at this issue and opened a PR (see above) to fix the cyclicity checking bug and also add the max_iterations option.
A quick note on why the cyclicity checker even exists:
I originally developed this code as part of the Qiskit Camp Europe in 2019. Back then we used very small systems like H2 to test the algorithm. What we observed was that (since the algorithm explicitly allows reusing excitations) they were indeed reused quite a lot resulting in the algorithm not being able to converge. This may be only relevant for systems as small as H2 where we have a very small number of excitations to begin with but these systems should still work.
This behaviour is also likely to be dependent on the chosen threshold since depending on this value the algorithm may converge before it starts falling into a cyclic choice of excitations.
I hope these explanations help. Please, let me know if I can help with anything else!
