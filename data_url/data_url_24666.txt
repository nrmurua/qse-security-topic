Can a pip package for qctoolkit be created? The name qctoolkit is already taken on pypi, so another name has to be found.
Currently pip install qctoolkit installs the wrong package, which is confusing.
Good point. We are thinking abour renaming the package to something more distinct and descriptive. Preferrably before SpinQubit4.
First step done by renaming to qupulse in #362.
I created a pip package: https://pypi.org/project/qupulse/
