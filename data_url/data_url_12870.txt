Hello,
I have no problem about installation or running ScaffCC. However, I am not clear what the following application does.
ScaffCC/Algorithms/Ground_State_Estimation/
I want to calculate ground state energy of  TiO2. Is it possible to calculate with this application. If it is, can you explain what term(s) needs to be updated.
Cheers...
