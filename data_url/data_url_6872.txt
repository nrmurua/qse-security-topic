In some simple cases, particularly involving Clifford operations, it is possible to automatically update the circuit as a gate is being dragged around such that the resulting circuit is equivalent to the original circuit. It would be nice if Quirk had some kind of modifier key you could hold to trigger this.
Closing as WONTFIX because this is extremely difficult; it's never gonna get done.
