We found a similar problem to this issue, in the nist_clock hardware.
Symptoms:
Running the above code on the kernel has inconsistent results. When an experiment is executed we find the dds is only properly set 30% of the time.
Fix:
Following the example in #421, we increased the current drive for the DDS bus from 12 to 24 mA (units?) in artiq/gateware/nist_clock.py.
However, I was unable to see any problems when using the 'ddstest' command inside 'flterm' before this fix, which I find to be strange. Does anyone have thoughts on why this would be the case?
