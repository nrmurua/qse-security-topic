Hi! Are there any plans to upgrade the Classic McEliece KEM to the round 4 specification?
The Rust implementation classic-mceliece-rust is doing that here: Colfenor/classic-mceliece-rust#33
Yes, round 4 algorithm updates are planned to be included in the next major release of liboqs and the downstream OQS projects. For McEliece, we normally import the code from PQClean, so it may be good to ask the question also in that project.
Great. Thanks. Submitted: PQClean/PQClean#459
PQClean/PQClean#460 is ready for review.
