This should be fairly straightforward to fix.  We raise an error if the pauli string is does not have a coefficient of 1 here - 
However, the underlying PauliMeasurementGate does support DensePauliStrings with coefficient +1 and -1. So, instead of passing pauli_observable.values() to construct the PauliMeasurementGate, we can just pass pauli_observable.dense(pauli_observable.keys()) and then remove the check for coefficient being exactly +1.

I can take this issue.
