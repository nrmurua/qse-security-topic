Description of the issue
If we want to get closer to resolving #1837 and given #4329 , we might want to try and move CircuitOperations hash function off of relying on ParamResolvers hash function.
Things like:
make me a little nervous. What're your thoughts here @95-martin-orion ?
Added a comment on #1837. What this comes down to is a design decision between high-performance resolution of params and strict adherence to the "don't hash mutable objects" rule: removing the hash (or somehow making ParamResolver immutable) might be possible, but it will almost certainly slow down our parameter-parsing code.
In my opinion, performance is the more important consideration; if we document it well (example) and put adequate guardrails in place (like #4329), I think the "mutable" hash is permissible.
+1 for optimizing for performance here. We can put some guardrails around ParamResolver, but it's almost impossible to make anything in python truly immutable, so we are probably always going to have to live with problems like this at some level.

Sorry I was more thinking along the lines of "can we make CircuitOperation no longer rely on the hashing ability of ParamResolver". Not nescessarily by removing ParamResolvers ability to hash, but maybe just by removing the call to hash(paramResolver instance) the in the hash function of CircuitOperation ? If it's easy enough It'd mean users have one less way to potentially go astray.

Probably not? ParamResolver is how CircuitOperation contains its parameter mappings, so the only ways I can see us getting rid of this dependency are:
(1) should be avoided unless it's a major issue for users. (2) is possible, but very awkward (which is part of why ParamResolver exists). To be honest, I have no idea what the ramifications of (3) would be, it just seems unwieldy to me.
NB that ParamResolver is not the only violation of "don't hash immutable objects" in CircuitOperation: it also uses Dict for qubit and measurement key maps and declares them immutable by fiat (i.e. in docstrings).
Closing as won't-fix; given the lack of further discussion it looks like we're happy optimizing for performance.
