ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (2,) + inhomogeneous part.
^ This is the error that I get from from line 482 in _snobfit.py:
request = numpy.vstack((request, numpy.concatenate((y1, numpy.array((f1, 2), ndmin=2)), axis=1)))
After a superficial inspection, it appears that the issue stems from the preceding block of code:
If the execution goes through the else clause, then the type of f1 is a plain float, but if it goes through the if clause, then the type of f1 is a 1x1 numpy array that would not be type-compatible with numpy.array((f1, 2), ndmin=2) part of line 482.
One way to solve this is to add numpy.squeeze(f1), at least as long as the array remains 1x1:
request = numpy.vstack((request, numpy.concatenate((y1, numpy.array((numpy.squeeze(f1), 2), ndmin=2)), axis=1)))
The same issue also happens on line 522 for the same reasons.
