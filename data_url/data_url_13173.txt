We have a Binder badge in the README:

but it's failing. The reason seems to be that Binder installs by default Python 3.7, but Mitiq requires a more recent version.
After waiting 30 minutes for binder to launch, it's still retrying. If it's not broken, then we surely can do something to help it along (or replace it with something faster).
Even when trying to launch binder directly from their homepage, it fails saying there are too many users. This makes me think we should switch to another hosted notebook provider.

cc @nathanshammah since you've thought about this stuff before.
Getting this message for a very long time without progress.

After refreshing, I also got the same message as Nate (too many users...).
Note that the original issue was about the version of python 3.7 which is likely unrelated with the current problems. I remember the build used to run until an error message appeared about the Python version.
Now the build doesn't run/start at all. So it looks the situation is even worse than a few months ago.
So, from my side, I agree that it is probably good to drop Binder.
Decision: remove badge. Follow up in #1820 .
