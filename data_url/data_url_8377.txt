At the moment it is possible to make a custom Gate and pass it to a QubitCircuit so that it will appear on the diagram.
Is it also possible to connect it to an actual operator, so that when  QubitCircuit.propagators is called it also returns the propagator of the custom gate?
Referenced to #441 which involves QIP in general, will be back to you.
