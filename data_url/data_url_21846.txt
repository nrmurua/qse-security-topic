The RTM gateware is the same for all variants (at least for now, and until we support other AFEs).
There are board revision pullup/pulldown resistors installed.
So the firmware can read board assembly version or revision providing that we install these resistors accordingly.
That's about the ARTIQ variant, not hardware versions.
OK, but to get rid of confusion when next HW releases arrives, we should check the board ID before loading ARTIQ.
Alternatively: avoid breaking compatibility (though that won't be possible in some instances), or deprecate the current set of boards - they have plenty of bugs and fragile reworks anyway.
Let's depreciate them. Maintaining software support for old boards gets very expensive and isn't worth it for a handful of quite hacked prototypes.
I mean protection feature that won't enable loading i.e. old firmware to new boards. Then user will get clear message instead of frustration that something does not work.
