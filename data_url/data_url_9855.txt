I have the following segment :
`# Add quadratic terms
And I get this runtime error :
Traceback (most recent call last):

How can I resolve this error?
You cannot set the biases for variables that have not been added to the model. Something like
will work
File "C:\Users\elmm\Desktop\MIT OCW Codes\CQM_2.py", line 66, in build_setcover_cqm
cqm.objective.quadratic[key] = 2 * A * np.dot(np.array(I[i - 1]), np.array(I[j - 1]))
You are again setting a quadratic bias for variables that do not yet exist.
Also, can you please review code formatting and how to create a minimal, reproducible example? I am having trouble parsing your questions and code snippets
here is picture of the model, I was able to fix that

Unfortunately I don't think this is the correct avenue for code reviews. I would encourage you to make a free Leap Account which will give you some free time on the hybrid solver that you can use to test your model. For formulation help please check D-Wave Launch.
Because the runtime errors are resolved I am going to close this ticket.
