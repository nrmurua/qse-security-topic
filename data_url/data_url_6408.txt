Clang is complaining that our OpenCL headers are deprecated, and Ubuntu has moved onto new headers for OpenCL v2.1, as well. We need to update the headers, hopefully while maintaining support back to some minor version of OpenCL v1.
I am happy to do this, unless someone is looking for an issue to work on. I will track the progress and anything that arises in this issue.
This already compiles and passes unit tests on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine:

However, I'm sure that clang is going to complain, if I take out the deprecation warning silence line. I'll be able to get on my Mac and start replacing the API as necessary, tonight.
Sounds good!
Okay, so the deprecation warning on Mac is not about a deprecation within the OpenCL API. It is a deprecation warning for the OpenCL API, entirely. From developer.apple.com
Apps built using OpenGL and OpenCL will continue to run in macOS 10.14, but these legacy technologies are deprecated in macOS 10.14. Games and graphics-intensive apps that use OpenGL should now adopt Metal. Similarly, apps that use OpenCL for computational tasks should now adopt Metal and Metal Performance Shaders.
Haha... No.
Without getting into my personal bemusement, I would not worry too much about OpenCL-based Qrack no longer functioning on Mac, anytime soon. It will, however, probably or possibly become necessary to install OpenCL support separate from the base operating system, perhaps via Homebrew.
I have no plans for a Metal implementation of Qrack, nor DirectX, nor CUDA, (though certain APIs might be more persuasive than others).
See #136 .
Might it become a problem, on second thought? I'm sure I'll have no problem running Qrack in Ubuntu on Mac's Intel hardware. We'll see what comes.
