Dear all
I test code in cp2k-8.2(GPU).   [case:#1530]
When I use mpirun -n  1   /home/dell/Softrun/cp2k-8.2/exe/local_cuda/cp2k.psmp  -i  cp2k.inp -o cp2k-8.2-gpu1.out or mpirun -n  2   /home/dell/Softrun/cp2k-8.2/exe/local_cuda/cp2k.psmp  -i  cp2k.inp -o cp2k-8.2-gpu2.out, it can work quickly(< 2 min), the output files are attached.
cp2k-8.2-gpu1.out.txt
cp2k-8.2-gpu2.out.txt
But When I use mpirun -n  32   /home/dell/Softrun/cp2k-8.2/exe/local_cuda/cp2k.psmp  -i  cp2k.inp -o cp2k-8.2-GPU32.out, it works slowly(about 16 hours), the output file is attached
cp2k-8.2-GPU32.out.txt
And when I use mpirun -n  4   /home/dell/Softrun/cp2k-8.2/exe/local_cuda/cp2k.psmp  -i  cp2k.inp -o cp2k-8.2-gpu4.out, there is a error(acc_devmem_setzero: failed ), the detail error information is attached.

Could you please help me to check the error
Thanks in advance and regards,

This looks like a DBCSR problem. @alazzaro, what do you think?

I have checked these two outputs. I see you have 4 GPUs/node, then you are using 2 threads:

Here, there is something wrong with the number of threads:
Therefore, you have 32 ranks X 44 threads, which is too much...
Are you setting OMP_NUM_THREADS? Please, check it.

Could you attach the CP2K output? I see in your error.txt a long list of
I'm not sure this is a DBCSR problem....

Hi alazzaro
I have check the setting, I don't set OMP_NUM_THREADS. And if should I change some setting ? Could you give me some advices?@alazzaro
The 4 GPUs' output file is attached, please help me to check it.

Thank you very much!

Hi alazzaro
I have check the setting, I don't set OMP_NUM_THREADS. And if should I change some setting ? Could you give me some advices?@alazzaro
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
then you can run CP2K. Check that the output reports 2 threads (line DBCSR| OMP: Current number of threads at the beginning of the log)
Dear alazzaro
Thank you very much.
It works.  Now Current number of threads = 2
But I have another question, The time that I use 32 threads is longer than the time I use 4 threads. I was told that the more the number of threads, the shorter the consumption time. Now I am confused.  Could you give me some advice that how to choose the threads' number?
Yanyan
It depends on the number of cores you have on your system and if you have hyperthread cores enabled.
If you don't set OMP_NUM_THREADS, then CP2K will take the maximum available threads. From your output, I see you have 44 max threads. I can guess that these are total hardware threads, so in reality, you have 22 cores.
Now, based on that, you get the best performance when there is a single thread per core.
In your example, you are running 32 MPI ranks X 44 threads (i.e. each rank has 44 threads), which makes a total of 1408 threads. Since you have only 22 cores available, it means you are squeezing 64 threads per single core, which not optimal at all (remember the rule: a single thread per core). Overprescribing cores with multiple threads is possible (indeed CP2K works), but it introduces overhead and no gain. That's why you see a large slowdown. I hope this clarifies the situation.
Now, for your question about MPI ranks/threads, assuming you have 22 cores and 4 GPUs, you have to understand that the number of ranks must be multiple of the number of GPUs. For your particular CP2K input, I can suggest using more ranks and fewer threads, but it is better to try the best configuration. For example, you can set:
a. 4 MPI ranks and 4 threads (16 threads in total, below 22 cores)
b. 8 MPI ranks and 2 threads
c. 16 MPI ranks and 1 thread
Unfortunately, 6 cores will remain idle.
Dear alazzaro
Thank you for your detailed explanation.
And I think there is something wrong with my computer. Actually it have 2 physics CPU, every CPU have 22 cores, so the max threads number should be 88 before I change export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
The CPU information is attached.

The line: "Threads per core: 2" says that you have hardware threads enabled. The real number of cores is 44.
So, your file line is 44 threads max. Since you have 4 GPUs, you can try the following configurations:
a. 4 MPI ranks, 11 threads (use all threads)
b. 8 MPI ranks, 5 threads (use only 40 threads)
c. 12 MPI ranks, 3 threads (use only 36 threads)
Thanks @alazzaro! Sorry, I overlooked the 44 threads.
Dear alazzaro
Thank you very much.
a. 4 MPI ranks, 11 threads (use all threads)
So it means that I can change export OMP_NUM_THREADS=11 and use mpirun -np 4  to run, it will be the good setting.
Am I right to do this ?
Yanyan
@zyy-qy Yes, correct. Try all configurations and see what is the fastest...
Dear alazzaro
OK! It's very kind of you. Thank you so much
