We need to implement a new Optimizer plugin that delegates to scikit-quant. This can be done in one of two ways:
End result should be able to demonstrate the use of the optimizer with the VQE Algorithm
@joehellmers interested in this one?
Sure you can assign it to me.
It seems like we will need to include scikit-quant with our install.  How do we do that?  It seems like I saw qiskit and other packages being downloaded during the cmake part of the install.  Which file or files do I need to update to include it?
You should be able to implement optimize() such that if py::module::import("scikit-quant") fails then you can throw an informative xacc::error() message that informs the user that this plugin can only be used if they pip install scikit-quant.
