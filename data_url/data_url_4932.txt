I would like to use QuEST simulator in my university HPC. Unfortunately, we only have the AMD GPUs, would it be possible to compile and run with it?
Thanks :)
Thanks to the work of Bruno, yes! AMD GPU support (through HIP) is currently on the develop branch, and will be available in the main branch at the next release (intendedly soon)!
Thanks Tyson! Will wait for the next release then!
Because I am installing QuEST through Spack and it can only get from the released version.
Ahh I understand - then good news, QuEST v3.6.0 is out! :)
