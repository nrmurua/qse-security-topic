Qiskit fails to detect pillow even though it is installed.
Pillow should be detected and used.
Perhaps related to one of the following:
Ah, the trick is that the lazy importer tests by doing import PIL and then looking for the name Image, since the line I derived it from was from PIL import Image.  But in actuality, Image is a submodule that's not imported by import PIL, so it fails - I didn't completely emulate the import-from statement.
This can be fixed most easily by just changing the HAS_PIL variable in qiskit.utils.optionals to test the module PIL.Image, rather than the current set-up of {"PIL": ("Image",)}.  A more general solution would be to tweak LazyImportTester's tests to more faithfully implement the from x import y logic.
(Just for interest: all Python package databases are required to be case insensitive and consider hyphens and underscores equivalent.)
@kevinsung Thanks for finding this. I was having the same issue.
