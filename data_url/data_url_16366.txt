Qubit anharmonicities, in GHz, appear in the Readout Properties column of the Backend Monitor generated by the code in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/tools/jupyter/backend_monitor.py. This is true at least for backends that are currently reporting anharmonicities, which may not be all of them yet, but will be soon.
In a Jupyter notebook, type provider.get_backend('ibmq_montreal')
Observe issue as below:

Readout properties column should show readout properties
-Fix the code near line 282 of the mentioned file to not hard-code the array indices of different qubit properties in the qubit_data array.
-Consider adding a column for anharmonicity to the table (or not).
@dtmcclure  Can I try this?
@Arijit02 all yours. Feel free to reach out with any questions.
Yes, sure. I would love to.
