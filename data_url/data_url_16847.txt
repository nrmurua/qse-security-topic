Currently default values of meas_level and meas_return are respectively set to 2 and avg.

However meas_level=2 and meas_return='avg' are invalid combination and this error is caught by qobj validator in ibmq provider.
invalid default setting should be replaced.
maybe one of below
Are you sure this is failing in the provider? I have run tests on internal and external devices and it went through. My stance is that meas_return should be ignored for meas_level=2.
I'm using qiskit-ibmq-provider 0.3.3 and got some error raised by the qobj validator (actually there was no error before). Anyway, the invalid combination as default values should be updated.
I was using old master branch but the problem doesn't happen now (I'm not sure the commit id causing problem), but I don't think it is ignored.
then qobj.config says
the combination of meas_level=2 and meas_return='avg' may be ignored in our backend, but this is not true for other providers. if say it is ignored, we should remove this from qobj.
Closing as this is not an issue as we do not plan to implement conditional JSON schemas. Extra parameters are fine to be ignored.
