Compose() without a start argument (appending to the end of the unit) returns a mapping value that is off-by-one, throughout the library. Fix the method output, and update the QUnit code that depends on the old convention.
The problem was exclusively limited to QStabilizer, and it was due to grabbing a const pointer to a piece of memory that happened to be a class member that was then changed in the Compose() method before being returned. (I shouldn't be overzealous about const pointer arguments for everything, but I should be just zealous enough.)
This will be merged along with #489, when that issue is finished.
