I think it would be nice to print to screen in the job log in the github actions the docstring of the tests run with pytests. There can be many tests in each module.
One needs to add some verbosity feature to pytest. Not sure it will print to screen. --verbosity=VERBOSE or something similar.
We can add doctests also in CI as per #75.
pytest does not seem to support this, only nose does.
