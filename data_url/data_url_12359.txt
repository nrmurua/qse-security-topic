Hi there,
I get the following error when I try to install tensorflow-quantum in my conda environment:
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow-quantum (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow-quantum
I finally managed to put tensorflow-macos==2.7.0 on my M1 Mac such that it doesn't clashes with the hardware when I import it.
But I can't find any way to install tensorflow-quantum, at least not with pip3 install -U tensorflow-quantum or some variation of it. I was wondering if it is because I don't have tensorflow==2.7.0 but tensorflow-macos==2.7.0.
Package list in the environment attached in the env.txt file below. Working with miniforge channel as it was suggested for M1 Tensorflow.
I hope some of you might have an idea how to end my misery here.

(I can also just write down package versions etc but just didn't put the whole thing here)
I don't have a M1 mac so I can't verify this but #655 seems to have good steps for it and #492 as to why this may be the case.
Thanks Owen, I missed that post. I will try that way... quite annoying, it took me some time to make TF run natively on M1. With this method I have to forget about all that and use Rosetta.
Then the question is still open for the future:
"How to install TFQ on M1, i.e. with tensorflow-macos?"
Yes, I don't think the software has fully caught up to the M1 (I have heard a lot of horror stories of installing various programs).
