To enable trajectory simulation, qsim must accept gates represented by a set of Kraus operators. During execution, these gates will randomly select a Kraus operator to apply using weights determined by the action of each operator on the current simulation state.
So that this does not impact existing qsim behavior, all code which is specific to trajectory simulation should be kept separate from qsim.h and hybrid.h. Initial discussion supported the addition of a new header file for this purpose.
