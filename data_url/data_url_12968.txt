Hi,
I'm trying to compile a circuit and the compilation was running indefinitely. I think I managed to narrow down the problem. For multiple cry gates in a QASM 2.0 definition saved in a file called random.qasm as following:
The compilation using the following code below seems to run indefinitely:
Commenting out one of the cry seems to enable the compile function to successfully finish executing. For context, I'm trying to compile a larger circuit which has  mutiple cry gates as following (pricingcall.qasm) for a specific machine model and I encountered the problem of compilation which doesn't seem to finish executing.

Looking forward to your kind attention.
I tested further, it seems the problem is happening when there are multiple cry gates with param 0. Hope it helps.
This is weird. Thanks for raising the issue, I'll take a look.
