I was wondering why in the advanced usage docs, the example Quantum Fourier Transform is implemented with a SWAP gate and I was wondering if it would work without the swap gate. My impression of QTF was that it could be implemented with only Hadamards and Controlled Phase gates, but trying to just use H and CPHASE gates in pyquil like this:
def qft3(q0, q1, q2): p = Program() p.inst(H(q0), CPHASE(pi/2.0, q0, q1),  H(q1), CPHASE(pi/2.0, q1, q2), CPHASE(pi/4.0, q0, q2),  H(q2),  SWAP(q0, q2)) return p
, it didn't work. Could someone point out what I did wrong or why the SWAP gate is necessary?
Thanks
Hi @seankdecker,
The Quantum Fourier Transform uses only Hadamard and Controlled Phase gates, but it reverses the order of the output (so q2 will be where q0 was e.t.c). The Swap gate is used to make the order of your output the same as the order of your input.
Let me know if you have any more questions.
Oh I see! Thank you!
@seankdecker You are welcome!
@seankdecker Hey, are you fine with us closing this issue?
Oh yes of course!
