The map does not look like what is expected based on the input:

view the doc page here: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.visualization.plot_coupling_map.html
In the example, the displayed image and the input should agree. In the image only the first two edges are displayed, but it looks like there are 8 edges in the coupling_map list. Possibly the qubit_coordinates are being processed incorrectly as well, not sure.

Hi there. It seems like the "qubit_coordinates" and "coupling_map" inputs were simply inverted.
Here you go:

Thanks @dalin27! Would you be interested making a PR to fix the documentation? The lines that need changing are here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/aca01eb9867ccc08a49efc5a27fd60c2e28b5db3/qiskit/visualization/gate_map.py#L592-L600
