The function qiskit.visualization.gate_map.plot_gate_map contains qubit_coordinates_map which is kinda backend specific. I suggest having this as an optional attribute in the backend. In this way, providers could optionally describe how they want their backends plot. If agreed, I can move the current ones to qiskit_ibm_provider and this issue can be closed once that gets merged and the code for checking the optional attribute is implemented in qiskit_ibm_provider and in fake backends.
PS: removing this would also remove the implicit need for a name in backends (backend.name) which now is necessary for this.
I would welcome this. At the very least, the coordinate maps should be somewhere accessible rather than being hidden inside a function in a dark corner of qiskit.
I think this would be an extension of BackendV2... @mtreinish ?
