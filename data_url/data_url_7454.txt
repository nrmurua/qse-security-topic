the example of Shor's 9 qubit correction code has the following line:
This results in:
However, the function is availalbe in the development branch (Yao#master)
Then again, the source code of the stable branch lists the function as deprecated
What is the current state of this function, should we use it or an alternative?
the latest dev branch is not released yet, I believe you are looking at the development version of the documentation as well, there are some breaking changes recently which we will later cut a minor release + deprecation warning.
the old interface was called addbits! in the stable doc: https://docs.yaoquantum.org/stable/generated/quick-start/5.shor-9-code/index.html
you can switch different doc version here

thanks!
