Working with @arpitagrawal23 ... Following the work flow here:

Your misoc version does not match the one prescribed in the artiq-dev recipe.
Hi @sbourdeauducq
When I execute this command:
conda env create -f conda/artiq-dev.yaml
it installed misoc version py_64+git7d9e6057, even though conda/artiq-dev/meta.yaml mentions misoc git hash as py_35+gitd6f86c03. So it seems conda env command is not honouring git hashs mentioned in the yaml file and instead install taking whatever version that is present in the system's cache. I had to execute this command manually:
conda install "misoc=0.6.dev=py_35+gitd6f86c03"
to make sure I have right version of misoc in my conda env. I think it'd great if we modify conda env create command in the installation procedure in the manual so that it will install exact same versions mentioned in the yaml file.
@arpitagrawal23 can you reproduce that (please try)? Or is it just because your environment got out of sync with the working tree?
Hi @jordens
Yes, it's reproducible. Even after deleting folder ~/anaconda3 and doing a fresh installation of anadonda, adding channels (main as well as dev), cloning artiq git repo and following this procedure:
http://www.m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-master/developing.html#artiq-anaconda-development-environment
so that it downloads all packages from the internet again, I'm getting same error.
I am not referring to the top post, but to your analysis. When doing what you said you did, which misoc version does it install? And which one is in artiq-dev/meta.yaml?
NB: I am pretty certain that the system and user python trees are thoroughly messed up on one (that?) machine in the lab. Reinstalling anaconda won't change a thing. We have previously explained several times that unless that's fixed we can't help. We have yet to see an indication that it was fixed.
It installed misoc version 0.6.dev py_64+git7d9e6057 but artiq-dev/meta.yaml file mentions misoc version as 0.6.dev py_35+gitd6f86c03.
No, it doesn't. You said you "cloned the artiq git repo".
Actually I had done that at on 9/1 at 15:16 EST, right after @sbourdeauducq had commented on this thread. Had also taken a picture which shows that all modules were downloaded from the internet (and not taken from system's cache).

Come on. Nobody can help you if you don't take the questions seriously. Can you reproduce it now and using the steps you listed? Anything else is less than helpful.
I can't reproduce it. And I tried. Now.
And please also ensure that you user and system python are not messed up with any residual installations of migen/misoc/artiq/etc or any of the dependencies. I.e. check especially ~/.local/lib/python* and /usr/local/lib/python* and any PYTHON* environment variables. Those should be empty. Report back confirming that you have done so.
Apologies for that. But actually I didn't need any help on this topic. My setup started working fine after explicitly installing the right misoc version by giving conda install command (mentioned in my earlier comments). I just wanted to report that conda env create command is not honouring git hash mentioned in conda/artiq-dev/meta.yaml file and if someone think that it is a valid issue, then it should be fixed.
I've executed these commands right now:
and the output is:
The version py_64+git7d9e6057 is not matching what is present in the yaml file py35_65+git6abc1b4c.
However, if I give this command:
then the version matches. If you think this is a valid issue, you might like to fix it for other new users of ARTIQ. I'm okay giving conda install commands.
Note: I have not done anything to /usr/local/lib/python* folders since I don't want to disturb this machine. I wanted to do things in my account only.

@mntng also seemed to have this problem. If it is confirmed, perhaps it has to do with the contents of condarc and/or some conda bug.
I'm okay giving conda install commands.
That's not a good solution:
@arpitagrawal23 could you paste your ~/.condarc and conda version?
Also please do check that there are no stray fragments of any previous installation in the directories mentioned.
Okay. Here it is:
I have downloaded Anaconda using wget command specified in one of my above comments. I got that URL from Anaconda download.
@jordens Thank you for tagging. Also please reopen Issue.
