What changes, if any, need to be made to the configuration when replacing a Kasli v1.0 with Kasli v1.1?
Our config is patterned after Opticlock.  In kasli.py we have the line:
        if hw_rev is None: hw_rev = "v1.0"
But it is not obvious where hw_rev will otherwise be assigned.  Is it meant to be passed in as a command line argument?
Then, this flag doesn't seem to be used for anything besides:
        if hw_rev == "v1.0": # EEM clock fan-out from Si5324, not MMCX self.comb += self.platform.request("clk_sel").eq(1)
Is there a different condition that should be specified for v1.1.  In particular we are using an external clock and ARTIQ 5.6915.5f8acb
I think more generally it looks like I should probably be using the "JSON system description file" with kasli_generic.py, but I'm at a loss without any documentation or examples for that.
There are examples here:

See also #1346 (comment).
Thank you, I was able to switch over to using kasli_generic with those examples!  Perhaps include that link in the documentation?
