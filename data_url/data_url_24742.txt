Make serialization inheritance aware and compatible by calling all get_serialization_data methods, starting with the base classes:
Possible extension of TablePulseTemplate
I need it to easily extend PulseTemplate functionality like adding and storing constraints there. This way the derived classes do not have to be touched if functionality/data is added in the base class.
Downside: The base class' keyword arguments are not mentioned in the derived class __init__ which is very inconvenient in environments with auto complete (ipython/jupyter)
Better as keyword arguments are explicit:
@lumip As you spend much time on the serialization code and if you can spare the time: Do you have an opinion on this?
I think this is no longer necessary with the new design.
