Describe the bug
When waiting for a job to execute, I often get this error:
To reproduce
Execute a circuit on one of the AWS backends, and wait for the result. In my experience, this error occurs intermittently, and can happen seconds after submitting a task.
Expected behavior
I hope that there is a way to mitigate this problem - it causes a significant disruption to executing jobs on the backends.

Hello @epelofske-LANL!
I think the error you are seeing is due to the credentials associated with your IAM role expiring. This might be a helpful resource for this issue. Alternatively, it might be easier to use a Braket Notebook instance, which automatically refreshes the credentials for you.
Please let us know if this resolves the issue for you. Thanks!
I agree that the issue appears to be that credentials are expiring. The bug is that they should not be expiring within seconds, and it should not be occurring intermittently. I do not know what the underlying cause is, but I know that it only happens for some sessions - for example concurrently many other jobs can be executing completely fine on another process or on another machine.
