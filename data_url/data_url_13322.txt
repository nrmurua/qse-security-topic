Currently the function execute_with_shots or execute_with_shots_and_noise do not allow for specific backend, e.g real hardware rather than simulator or different noise model from the simulator, so the calculation of the expectation value requires specifies a circuit with different basis measurement X, Y, Z, etc when the Hamiltonian is complex.
It would be nice to allow real backend input in the qiskit_utils.execute_with_shots in the qiskit interface so it's a lot easier to calculate the expectation value of an operator.

Hi @Misty-W
I would like to work on this. Let me verify once again, I need to run it on real hardware instead of the simulator right?

Hi @RamAIbot, great that you'd like to work on this! To test the solution thoroughly you would need to run on real hardware, but I don't think it's required to close the issue. @andreamari please correct me if I'm wrong.
Right now the use of one simulator is hardcoded into mitiq.interface.mitiq_qiskit.qiskit_utils.execute_with_shots, but we want the user to be able to specify a valid Qiskit backend (doesn't have to be hardware, could be another simulator) in mitiq.interface.mitiq_qiskit.qiskit_utils.execute_with_shots and obtain a result from running on that backend.
Hi @RamAIbot, in Qiskit a backend can represent both a real hardware device and a classical simulator.
For testing one could use an abstract classical simulator like AerBackend, or a classical clone of a real device like e.g. FakeLima.
hi @RamAIbot, any help needed getting a PR started on this issue? Deadline to get credit for unitaryHACK is this Friday Jun 17!
I’m stuck on how to test the module.I have added the backend. Can you provide any insights?
should I need to write my own test cases

yes, you'll need to write a test function, or parametrize the existing test test_execute_with_shots in mitiq/interface/mitiq_qiskit/tests/test_qiskit_utils.py with multiple backends. You should test with at least two backends to confirm your modification works. You can take a look at other Mitiq tests that use pytest parametrization as examples to guide your implementation.
Is it possible to continue working on the issue even after unitary hack deadline?

@RamAIbot yes you can, we encourage ongoing contributions!
There's still a little time left to get credit for the hackathon, so if you have a draft PR ready I can take a look. I have to step away from my computer for a couple hours but I'll be available to look at it and answer questions this afternoon US Pacific Time.
Hi @Misty-W ,
I will send you a draft PR in sometime.
