The QuantumError class does not currently allow for passing a Parameter like how one does for parametrized circuits. If it did, and one could construct a parametrized NoiseModel,  it would add versatility to what one could do. For example, I could construct a circuit with parametrized noise, then execute that circuit with various noise values to test its relation to performance.
I could not find such functionality currently, so it seems to me that you would need to define a different circuit for each noise value. While this is not terribly difficult, it still seems less natural than having an object possessing an intrinsic noise parameter.
Yeah, it might be a nice feature to have. Would you mind elaborating on a use case when the new feature is useful?
IMO, using the current API, the code would looks like:
If we have NoiseModel with parameterized QuantumErrors, we could do
It doesn't seem to make that much difference. Am I missing your point? @jacobwatkins1
@jacobwatkins1 Can we close this issue?
