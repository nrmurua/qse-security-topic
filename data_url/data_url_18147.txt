I cannot define variables in python named as "x" due to conflict with gates of similar names. I think we should be able to let users use the names.
Running the above code results in QASM error:
I have no ideas
I'm gonna say this is not a bug, and necessary for correct parsing of OpenQASM. A parser builds a symbol table during parsing, and these symbols cannot clash. In OpenQASM, certain string tokens are keywords, like the "x" gate. For that reason, you cannot reuse that keyword in other places. Similar to how in C, you can't name a variable in "int".
@diego-plan9 @atilag @1ucian0 what do you guys think?
I agree itâ€™s not a bug. Better documentation and error handling is needed in the future.
