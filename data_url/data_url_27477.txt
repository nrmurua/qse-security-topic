The final pulse present in many measurements has become superfluous with the introduction of the 'final_delay' attribute of a pulse_sequence. This should be removed.
Agreed, maybe it would be a good idea to have for each interface as part of its docstring how it (should) handle a final delay, both when acting as a primary instrument or as a secondary instrument. We should also check that they also actually behave the way they should
Final pulses have now been removed
