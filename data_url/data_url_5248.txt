To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior.
python3 -m pip install --user .
Expected behavior
Processing /Users/keithyau/src/QC/HiQsimulator
DEPRECATION: A future pip version will change local packages to be built in-place without first copying to a temporary directory. We recommend you use --use-feature=in-tree-build to test your packages with this new behavior before it becomes the default.
pip 21.3 will remove support for this functionality. You can find discussion regarding this at pypa/pip#7555.
