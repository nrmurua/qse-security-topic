The option vector_style='' does not work.
Even though the fix is quite simple, I would like to remove it since it is not documented, it would simplify the code and the option '-' achieves the same thing anyways.
@hodgestar and @Ericgig, any thoughts?
it should draw a line
No response
I think is being broken for 9 years(?, the git blame suggest that line 729-732, that contain the bug, have not been changed for 9 years).
I'm happy for it to be removed -- it's undocumented and fails straight away, so I doubt anyone is using it successfully.
