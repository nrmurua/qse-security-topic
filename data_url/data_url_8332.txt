In Qutip 4.3.1, mcsolve does not take the option store_final_state, which is a possible instance for the Option class which can be fed to the solvers. Other solvers, e.g., mesolve(), accept this option.
One could thus implement this feature also for mcsolve.
Two possibilities can be envisioned: store the wavefunction of each trajectory or the density matrix obtained by averaging over all the trajectories.
This feature could be implemented using average_states, which is already a existing instance of the Option class.
PR #991 (in review) rewrite a good part of mcsolve and have this feature.
