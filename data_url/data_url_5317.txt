How do I run approximate simulations (fidelity-driven or memory-driven) in Python?
I am mainly using DDSim's ReadTheDocs.io documentation for information.
(https://ddsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
The CircuitSimulator page (https://ddsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simulators/CircuitSimulator.html) mentions that the Circuit Simulator is the “default” simulator in DDSIM with the following features: 1) exact simulation, 2) weak simulation, and 3) approximate simulation with different strategies. It has two sections "Usage in Python" and "Usage as Standalone Executable" but I can't find any instructions on how to do approximate simulations in Python.
For the standalone executable, I run "./ddsim_simple --help" and I can see that the following options can be set in order to run approximate simulations:
--step_fidelity
--steps arg
--approx_when
--approx_state
I can't seem to find any instructions on how to set this options when using Python.
Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. Indeed there was a problem with generating the docs for the bindings. You can have a look at #225.
For future reference, the signature for the __init__ method of the CircuitSimulator is the following:
Does this help?
I see. Thank you!  I am able to run approximate simulations now in Python.
I'm not yet familiar with DDSim's code. I saw the approximation options (approximation_step_fidelity,  approximation_steps, approximation_strategy)  in mqt/ddsim/qasmsimulator.py.
I thought I can pass these options to the execute function like this:
I thought it was similar to passing the mode and nthreads options to the execute  function when using the hybrid_qasm_simulator backend.
The way you propose to use the approximation should work with the current version. The keyword paramaters are passed to the simulator.
The relevant snippet from qasmsimulator.py:
PR #225 adds some code to get rid of warnings and a simple test for the approximation. I'll add some documentation when I'll have time.
I initially did not notice that passing  those options (approximation_step_fidelity, approximation_steps, approximation_strategy)  to execute function actually works because I was focusing on  warnings like:
After checking again, I finally noticed that changing the options (specifically I was changing the value of  approximation_step_fidelity) actually changed the result (shots/counts) of the job/experiment even if the warnings are there.
Thanks!
