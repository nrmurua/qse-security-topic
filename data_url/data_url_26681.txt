Running most test cases in qs_ks_types.F line 514 the argument NATOM has inconsistent INTENT.
In its calling procedure it has INTENT(IN) while in procedure qs_subsys_get

I suggest to declare INTENT(INOUT) NATOM everywhere, as in
qs_subsys_types.F, cp_subsys_types.F, qs_overlap.F
The intent of natom is defined as:
Since these are all getter routines, I don't really see a problem.
I guess, we could change it to out in get_ks_env as well. Is that what you meant?

I have it deleted in the latest update.
Fixed via #1264.
