When using AerSimulator.from_backend information such as the coupling map is taken from the backend, however if the simulation method is changed to "stabilizer", the number of qubits is set to a value larger than the coupling map.
Returns 10000 for stabilizer, 63 for extended stabilizer, 32 for statevector, 16 for density matrix.
In this case the fake backend has 27 qubits in its coupling map.
The number of qubits in the configuration should be set to the number of qubits in a coupling map if the coupling map is not None.
