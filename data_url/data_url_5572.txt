Performance of stabilizer method is not optimized yet.
Redesign data structure, multi-threading, and algorithms will be necessary for large-qubit simulation.
Optimized kernels for CPU is already included in 0.12.2 and
I think remaining optimization for stabilizer are
I would like to postpone to 0.14.0 or later
