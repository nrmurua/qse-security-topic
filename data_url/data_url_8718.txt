Dear friends,
Type: bug
I found a small bug in the SimulaQron.py file that prevents the set to "on" the noisy-qubit option from the command simulaqron set noisy-qubit on (same for "off", in fact):
line 290 currently is
@click.argument('value', type=click.Choice("on", "off"))
while it should be
@click.argument('value', type=click.Choice(["on", "off"]))
(add the brackets)
I hope this can help
Thank you for the great work
Best
Thanks for pointing this out @fernandodelaiglesia, this is now fixed in version 3.0.16
