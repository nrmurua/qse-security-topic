Hi devs,
I've been running into an issue installing the most recent dev version. The _blas_info() method is throwing the following error:
It seems this method was changed most recently in commit d7bb119 to include a line containing blas_info['libraries']. For reference I am doing a basic installation with just numpy (1.11.2), scipy (0.18.1), and cython (0.24.1), and not with any of the fortran MC stuff. I'm using Mac OSX 10.11, and Python 3.5.2. [I've also been able to successfully install using a commit from before this, a31f7fc.]
Please let me know if there is just something I've missed here. Thanks!
if you run:
what do you get?
Hi,
Here's the output I get. While I've installed the BLAS libraries on my machine, I haven't 'connected' it with numpy, so maybe this is what's leading to the issue?
Well it seems that you are using the OSX accelerate BLAS. It is just missing the libraries key in the dict. Simple fix, will do today.  Thanks for finding this.
Should be fixed now.  Let me know if latest dev version works.
I am guessing that this is closed.
Apologies, I encountered a separate set of issues related to cython that I have thus far been unable to solve. Once I get that sorted out, if I run into any errors related to the above, I'll get back to you. Thanks!
In our Cython code, or your own?
I don't think it's your code, but I haven't looked in to it in sufficient detail yet. As it stands installing qutip is fine but importing it fails, as it is unable to find the C headers, and is spitting out multiple errors of the form "distutils.errors.CompileError: command '/usr/bin/clang' failed with exit status 1". I can provide the full error messages sometime tomorrow if I'm still unable to solve the problem.
Okay I figured out what was going wrong, and it was my bad. Thanks a bunch!
