Investigate why the release action did not trigger on the latest release, 0.7.0.
See  https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/actions/workflows/publish-pypi.yml.
I can post mortem this:
Basically the syntax for the files as currently on master was invalid as you can see here: https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/actions/runs/619303706/workflow#L11
Once we merge #597 I think this should be resolved, so I would move to close this once that is done. üëç
