Circuit size is limited. I don't know if different devices have different limits, and whether the limit is exposed somewhere. When a user runs a circuit which is too large, the validation passes, and later there is a general job error,  that does not specify that circuit size is the cause for the error.
Two possible solutions:
Or, a transpiler pass that checks the size of the circuit for a given backend. Similar to the last one, but slightly more ad-hoc.
Is any of these solving this issue?
This issue seems still valid:
I'm going to close this as "no longer Terra's responsibility" now; an improved error message would be the responsibility of the backend returning the error message.
Luciano's given example is not Terra's fault because the transpile(circuit, backend) step (which does raise an error) is absent.  In that situation, the backend returning the error is correct.
