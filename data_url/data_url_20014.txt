In preparation for the 0.7.2 release, I ran the Valgrind constant time tests. Dlithium's AVX code is failing them. We previously had suppression files in tests/constant_time/kem/passes/dilithium* but something must have changed in the Dliithium implementation that makes those suppressions no longer match.
To reproduce:
This yields the output in the attached file dilithium_failures.txt, with a few excerpts below:
@bhess Do you have any insight here, Basil? I don't see anything obvious in the most recent commit that changed the Dilithium code, I'm not sure how far back this was introduced.

Just a comment/questions from the side lines, not knowing too much of what's happening:

Whoops, yes.
Yes, there are line numbers which would have to be changed when the code changes. However I can't tell from the previous suppression files and the commit history exactly how the line numbers of the past map on to the current, so I'm reluctant to just blindly change things without understanding the code.

Me too :-) My suggestion actually was for @bhess to do this if this truly was an omission in #1221. But then again, if he's not available for the next few weeks, what about doing the release with the caveat that dilithium isn't fully tested? Combined with the caveat that Sphincs is not at the latest code version (see release text discussion).
For the future, maybe we should run the full valgrind test suite whenever any change in src/kem or src/sig occurs and not only at release?

Hmm... yes we might have to proceed without resolving this until Basil returns.

The constant time tests should be run weekly according to https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/.github/workflows/weekly.yml, but maybe we've got the configuration wrong or maybe we've just been ignoring the results...

"Hopefully": I kind of assumed we're getting email notifications if sth fails there. Now I'm wondering where one can look it up manually (?) -- and whether it's possible to add to the dashboard.

Agreed, so I did a manual code comparison (see #1283), no automation or blind valgrind output line-number acceptance. After updating the passes file this way, all tests ran OK again, so there is a very high likelihood this has been done right. If you'd have time to merge this today, @dstebila , we should see the weekly tests go green again. No need to bother undoubtely sleepless @bhess :-)

Thanks Michael! You made it look so easy -- I must have had a mental block.
