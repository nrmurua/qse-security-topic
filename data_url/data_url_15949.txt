Acconrding to the constructor of AmplificationProblem, the kwarg is_good_state is optional, when it fact, it is required.
Usage without is_good_state results in AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'probabilities_dict'
Reproduce (with qiskit-terra 0.18.0 installed from main branch)
Either change the type hint to reflect the requirement or make it actually optional.
