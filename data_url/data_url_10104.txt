Making it be more than one thing requires the parser of the response to inspect the object before using it. If we want to have the benefits of a numpy array for some of the data_vectors, I think it's worth it to make everything a numpy array
If we don't need it to be a numpy array, might as well make them all lists?
For reference, on python 3.6.3
