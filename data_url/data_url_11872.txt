Installation fails because qiskit specifies numpy >= 1.13 but qiskit-acqua and qiskit-acqua-chemistry specify numpy<1.15,>=1.13. Therefore, during installation, numpy==1.15 is installed creating an incompatibility with the requirements ffrom both acqua and acqua-chemistry.
Create a virtual environment with:
Next, activate the virtual environment using:
Last, begin the installation with:
I expect the installation to finish with numpy installed without any versioning issues.
Specify numpy<1.15,>=1.13 in qiskit, exactly the same as in qiskit-acqua and qiskit-acqua-chemistry.
We are having an extensive discussion with Rudy regarding versioning issues in #235. Additional relevant details may be found there.
acqua and acqua-chemistry with the c in acqua were the original release and at that time were released were compatible with qiskit i.e. qiskit-terra. The qiskit-tutorials remained with that version of acqua though we had renamed things to aqua and released a new version. qiskit evolved to new releases and changed numpy requirement which ended up conflicting with acqua. The tutorials have now been updated to the aqua release so this has been rectified.
