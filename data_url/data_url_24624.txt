Currently TimeType casts float to TimeType for comparisons. This leads to crashes when doing something like TimeType.from_float(1.1) < float('inf') because infinity cannot be represented as an integer fraction. The error message is not clear because it only says ValueError: invalid digits.
Should we have a max time? somewhing like 1e30ns which is a few orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe. If one creates a TimeType with a larger absolute value qupulse does no longer garantuee corectness.
