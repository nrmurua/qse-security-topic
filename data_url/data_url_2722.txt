There is a file in examples called 'supremacy.py' with a function 'generate_supremacy_circuit'
Details matter a lot for simulation and experiment, and this is a very generic name, without a version number.
What about changing the name to something more specific for this particular ensemble or circuits?
I'm not familiar with the circuit that is being generated here. What would you like us to rename generate_supremacy_circuit to?
Named to google_v2_supremacy_circuit.py: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/experiments/google_v2_supremacy_circuit.py
