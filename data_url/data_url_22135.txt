This part is definitely a bug, at least.
Root causes:
The logical AND of (say) int32 with an int? literal gives an int?.
On reflection, this isn't really a bug, since any logical operation other than AND may need to have the result as wide as the widest operand.
We ignore any type annotations on kernel functions.
We actually didn't ignore them, but the old implementation was very weird and needlessly fragile.
