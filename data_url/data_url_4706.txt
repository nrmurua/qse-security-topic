Now the function the w read by qchem.read_gamess are not multiplied by the SCLFAC.  Without it, the frequencies will bias a lot from experiments. So is it possible to add this feature that get w and times them with SCLFAC

1: Not important. Would be nice to have.

Hi @GongSiqiu, and thanks for opening up this feature request. Could you clarify the feature that you would like added; adding some more detail to this request?
Hi @GongSiqiu. Could you please confirm that by SCLFAC, you mean the empirical scaling factors that are used to correct vibrational frequencies obtained from computational methods to better match experimental data?
If it is the case, such corrections are better to be done on the user side, instead of having hard-coded scaling factors in SF. We can help you with that if you please provide us with the code and the data you are using. I also recommend opening a topic for this in our discussion forum if you need help with correcting the frequencies.
Please feel free to let us know if you have any questions.
Yes, I do mean that. I just do it like this:
ri, m, wi, Li=qchem.read_gamess('CH2O2_GS.out')
rf, m, wf, Lf=qchem.read_gamess('CH2O2_ES.out')
wi=wi*0.964
wf=wf*0.964
Because GAMESS always prints results without scaling, I don't known whether it will affect normal modes.
I write GAMESS input file with command  $FORCE METHOD=ANALYTIC  SCLFAC = 0.97 $END but it worth noting that
The output always prints unscaled frequencies, so this value is used only during the thermochemical analysis.
So I think read_gamess should scale frequencies with the SCLFAC
Thanks @GongSiqiu for the suggestion, we are looking into this.
Added in #704 and part of latest release (v0.23.0). @GongSiqiu
