I'm learning quantum adder through the materials from here and tried to run these code about class of quantum full adder. (I worry about invading the authors's copyright so I just write concerned codes I guessed. Sorry.)
NOTES: qiskit.ignis on the 4th and 5th line is now replaced to qiskit-terra.
Then retuned this error message.
I conformed that the PATH is already made in the following steps.
before importing qiskit-terra and jupyter notebook retured '/Users/(Myname)/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages',  as one of available PATH.
as above
I'd like to run the concerned codes without errors.
No response
They live in qiskit.utils.mitigation, so you can import them via
FYI we also have adders implemented in Qiskit directly, see e.g. the docs.
Completely solved! Thank you!
