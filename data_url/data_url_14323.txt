When providing quantum circuit registers with a custom name like this

it would be convenient to get the names of each qubit properly choosen when drawing state vectors

Which is unfortunally hardcoded here for now.
This would be nice to be able to provide a list of names to the plot_bloch_multivector function, or even better, to that have the statevector structure hold the qubit names.
If this is something of interest, and @jzy3d wasn't planning to work on it, I will like to help.
