When using a parameter that has custom setpoints, the loop in ActiveLoop._parameter_arrays forces the setpoints to be hashable, otherwise an error is raised.
This means that setpoints as a tuple are allowed, but lists and numpy arrays are not.
This has a consequence that setpoints > 1D are not allowed, since converting them to tuples still leaves each of its elements as unhashable lists/arrays.
I'm not sure what the best solution would be, the code in ActiveLoop._parameter_arrays seems quite complicated. Perhaps a different method should be used to create the setpoint arrays than simply a tuple sp_def per setpoint.
Minimal example:
Measurement runs with custom setpoints
Error is raised:

Temporary solution that converts all setpoints to tuples:
This relates to the old legacy dataset. No further work on this is planed so closing this issue
