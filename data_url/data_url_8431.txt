I know the mathematical definition of the Mølmer–Sørensen gate. How can I define it as a gate in qutip to use in a circuit? Thanks.
I looked up Mølmer–Sørensen but I'm unsure of the definition.
The definition on the wikipedia article must be wrong because it is not unitary.
Anyway you should be able to define it exactly the same as all the other gates are defined in qip/gates.py. I've copied and pasted the definition of CNOT. Just change the matrix and function name to fit your usecase.
@sahmed95 Can a user defined gate be used in the qutip QIP?
@IIAOPSW : Thanks for the suggestion. I will try that. Nevertheless, it would be nice to have it in the official version of qutip.
You can use the following definition from Maslov, Dmitri, and Yunseong Nam. "Use of global interactions in efficient quantum circuit constructions." New Journal of Physics (2017).

If I may, I would also suggest to add single qubit arbitrary rotation.

In that case we will be able to write complete physical representation of any quantum circuit for trapped ion quantum computer.
This is a good, apparently simple issue to address within the upcoming GSOC project on qip.
This might be of interest in the future months to you @BoxiLi.
This sounds good, I'll work on it.
