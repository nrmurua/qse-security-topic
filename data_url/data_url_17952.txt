The new Qobj format changes the way in which conditionals are treated. Before, a conditional object was embedded inside the gate instruction, in the form:
Now, you use the bfunc instruction to set a classical register (referred by its index in the register property) and then refer that register in the instruction gate to make it depends on it:
No local nor online simulators currently accept the bfunc.
@chriseclectic i think you have done this. correct?
This is done in Aer (though needs some thorough testing), but still needs to be added to BasisAer python simulators
#1778 implements qobj conditionals in terra, and skips two basic aer tests that should be un-skipped when BasicAer supports qobj-conditionals.
