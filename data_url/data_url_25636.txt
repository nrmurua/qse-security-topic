When the following chain of commands are run: covalent start && covalent stop && covalent start --no-cluster, Dask Execution is still activated, despite specifying the --no-cluster option. Currently, users need to run covalent purge in between covalent start and covalent start --no-cluster if they wish to switch between Dask Execution and Local Execution
Run the following chain of commands: covalent start && covalent stop && covalent start --no-cluster. Dask Cluster is still spun up at a valid scheduler address as can be seen withcovalent logs despite specifying the no-cluster option.
After running the following chain of commands: covalent start && covalent stop && covalent start --no-cluster, the executor should reliably switch from Dask to Local.
No response
Tested on Version: 0.110.2.post1. covalent start && covalent stop && covalent start --no-cluster does not activate Dask execution.
