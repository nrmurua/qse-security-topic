The test_parallel.py is failing when the backend is tensorflow (only v2.5.0).
The numpy and qibotf backends are passing the tests.
@stavros11 could you please confirm this happens for you? This is probably why our CI is failing for linux.

Yes, this happens for me with tf2.5 both for the qibotf and the tensorflow backend.
Could you please recheck qibotf? It works fine to me, the code hangs only with tensorflow.

Indeed, qibotf works, it is only tensorflow that hangs. Sorry for the mistake in the previous post. I also think that only the first test of the two hangs with tensorflow, the one that tests parallel_execution. The second that tests parallel_parametrized_execution works for me with all backends.
Ok, I confirm your observation. I did a quick debug and the code hangs when calling the circuit(state), if I run pytest with taskset -c 0 both tests pass, so this sounds like the old thread problem we had before moving to openmp (tf uses c++11 threads created before the multiprocessing fork), if that is the case, then I believe the qibo.set_threads(1) is not working properly for the tensorflow backend.
