Our arch files files have become quite complex and it's no longer practical to write them manually.
In the toolchain we use generate_arch_files.sh to generate arch files and in Spack the better part package.py does the same.
To avoid this duplication we should have a configure.py script that works in both environments, e.g. by using pkg-config.
Instead of this proposal we've decided to adopt CMake.
