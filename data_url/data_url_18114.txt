Informations
local_qasm_simulator_cpp fails when setting particular noise params (the one copied from simulator readme.)
https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-core/tree/master/src/qasm-simulator-cpp#example
What is the current behavior?
c++ simulator fails with particular noise params setting. (Note that python simulator works well, and if I deleted U_error field, it works well, too.)
case 1 (installed from pip), trackback
case 2 (installed qiskit from the master branch)
Steps to reproduce the problem
Here is the codes:
What is the expected behavior?
Run without error.
Suggested solutions
No idea.
This is because the simulator checks if the U_error matrix is unitary and (should) raise an error if it isn't. In your example z = 0.995004165 + 1j * 0.099833417, and abs(z) = 0.99999999975862153, not 1.
If I change the noise params in your code to the following it runs:
However there still seems to be a bug that the error that should be raised by the simulator isn't being caught and passed through to the results: If I run the compiled qojb directly from the command line it just appears to abort.
okay, I do not double check whether or not the U_error is a unitary matrix, I just copy and paste the example in the README.
Thanks.
So it seems like to close this issue, the following should be done:
a) the README should be updated to include the normalization.
b) the error raised by the simulator should be passed through to the result and available to the user.
closing as this is not part of terra anymore and will be documented in aer.
