Suppose a schedule contains gates from 0 - 500 ns and readout from 500 - 2000 ns. When I use
I expect the schedule to be drawn up to 1000 ns. This means truncating, but showing, half of the readout.
However currently it only draws up to 500 ns, because it does not want to truncate the readout.
please use plot_range option.

if it doesn't draw any acquire or measurement channel, this could be a bug.
Ok thanks the plot_range seems to work and it truncates the plot. However in some cases I get this error:
Here's code to reproduce (requires the scheduler branch):
range (0,200) works.
I have also seen that error.
ok, I'll check.
