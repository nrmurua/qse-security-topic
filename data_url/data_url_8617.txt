Do you have a more specific issue than just wanting the stuff to go faster?  Doing sparse matrix - vector multiplication in mesolve is possible.  However, this does not immediately equal an increase in speed as there is overhead from starting the parallel tools.  As for parfor, it just calls the builtin Python multiprocessing, and collects the results.  As such, your complaint is mostly to do with the Python multiprocessing library.
