After #613 gets merged I'd like to bump up the restriction on OrdinaryDiffEq to be any version less than 6.58. Tests show 6.58 and beyond are problematic due to our dependence on internal features of OrdinaryDiffEq but anything less is fine.
The current "< 6.57" was because of an initial hunch from @weinbe58 on the reason BloqadeKrylov was failing but that turns out to be due to a different issue.
No longer necessary thanks to @weinbe58 's work on #619
