It seems there are a few types of waveforms that are implemented in experiments, linear sweep (Fig. 3 of the second paper), nonlinear sweep (Fig.3 of the first paper, and Fig. 2 of the second paper. The nonlinear sweep can be quantified as cubic or tangent functional forms, as described by Eq. 3 of the Methods section of the first paper.

Some some existing pulse shapes.
Pulser seems to have a set of waveforms: https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser/blob/develop/pulser/waveforms.py
I don't know if the precision of the pulse will lead to different fidelity for the prepared state now. Once the adiabatic preparation example is working correctly, I will do some checks about this. We may need to set some bound for the pulse discretion later.
