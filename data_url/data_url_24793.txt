The module file pulses/SequencePulseTemplate defines a Mapping class that is used in the SequencePulseTemplate class to map parameters given to that class to its sub-PulseTemplates. This can mean changing the name and giving a function that mathematically transforms parameter values. This is exactly what we need also for issue #44 . However, the Mapping class represent a mapping from an incoming parameter set to an outgoing parameter set. For issue #44, a mapping from parameter set to a single parameter is needed.
What is to be done?:
I have a simple example for how a user might want to use the software. A lot of the functionality is not implemented yet.
Example
It seems to me that using only one class mapping a set of input to a set of output parameters without constraints on relative sizes would be sufficient for the start. "Slim" versions for special cases can be added later if that substantially improves usability. The example I saw looking over Patrick's shoulder looked good.
