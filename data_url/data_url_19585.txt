Have tried to install from pip or from source on an ARM architecture but find the install fails due to incorrect compiler flags(?). I also couldn't figure out how to directly modify setup.py or CMakeLists.txt to install from source (modifying ARCH_OPT did not seem to resolve it for example).
System: aarch64 architecture, Ubuntu 22.04, pip 23.2.1, Python 3.10.6, gcc 12.3.0.
The error message I get from pip is (similar error from running setup.py directly though):
-- Configuring done (6.5s)

Any assistance would be appreciated! Hopefully it isn't just an issue due to how my system is set-up. Thanks!
I'm closing this as it seems to be a duplicate of issue #65. As mentioned in #65 you could try the old (slower) version of pymatching with pip install PyMatching==0.7.0 until this issue is fixed.

Thanks! Apologies for missing that. Yes, this version does work for me!
(FWIW: I saw a comment in that Issue that this was partly related to stim compatibility for V2? I did manage to install the latest version of stim from source on the same device, by modifying compiler flags in setup.py there. But this might be totally unrelated and not helpful...).
