using .to_matrix() method on the desired Hamiltonian returns array with ellipsis.
Should show expanded matrix
No response
What do you mean "the array has ellipsis"? Apologies if this is too simplistic, but are you sure you're not just seeing Numpy truncate the output because the matrix is too large to display?
Yes, it was that simple. I tried search on google on expanding the matrix but no results showed up (I guess I did not use the right search term). I assumed there was something wrong with the matrix as even printing would still show the ellipsis.
