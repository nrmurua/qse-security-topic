Description of the issue
Mapping expressions to symbols in ParamResolver is ignored during resolution. Expressions to values, however, work as expected - at least for basic cases.
How to reproduce the issue
Expressions to values:
Expressions to symbols:
Additional comments
I'm not convinced that there's an active use case for this behavior that couldn't be achieved with e.g. {a: b + c, b: d - c}. My recommendation here would be to only allow symbols in the key list for ParamResolvers.

I agree we should only allow symbols and not expressions as keys.
Expression keys seem to have a poor cost/benefit ratio. Specifically, on one hand there don't seem to be many compelling use-cases and on the other any practical implementation is likely to fail to be completely general leading to arbitrary and unclear scope of what is and isn't handled.
