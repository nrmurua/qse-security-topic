Hey folks,
Tried to get this set up on Rigetti QCS right now and am having issues building.
I can clone the repo but cant install via source since I cant sudo apt... or install Bazel as Rigetti manages the environment
Working to install via pip I run into a few issues. I've manually installed all the dependencies but keep getting this issue when trying to build tfq 0.5.1:
Which is weird since the requirements.txt show 0.12.0 as needed. Is there something not alinging with the pip package or is there another way to do this from source without bazel?
I have tried with 0.11.0 but then I get the issue:
We're hoping to run tfq + cirq on Rigetti's latest devices but we need cirq 0.12.0 to make that work.
I am following up with them as well but suspect they aren't going to be as familiar.
Please let me know!
Thanks,
Tom
The TFQ 0.5.1 has cirq==0.11.0. The nightly build is cirq == 0.13.1. I'm not sure which requirements.txt shows 0.12.0 (I see https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/051_cp/requirements.txt and https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/master/requirements.txt). There isn't a version of TFQ that has cirq == 0.12.0 as
far as I can tell (see https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/commits/master/requirements.txt). It might still be possible to make it work with that hard requirement, but someone more knowledgeable on the builds will have to provide more insight.
Ah yes that is my mistake. I meant 0.13.1.
I'll look at installing the nightly build to see how that goes. Thank you so much!
This works. Please disregard issue!
