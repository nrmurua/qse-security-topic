Describe the issue
I just came across the extensive usage of the following pattern, see screenshot, try-except to check whether a key exists in a dictionary. I want to propose the usage of configuration validators or use strictly defined record types such as dataclasses-json.
This can be re-written to the following to be more explicit and readable to the user.
There is also a typo: Unkown should be Unknown in C3:ERROR:Unkown sampling method
