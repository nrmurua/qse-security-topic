Hi,
I'm trying to run benchmarking module in Jupyter notebook /demos/T-count Benchmark.ipynb.
After execution of corresponding line in Jupyter notebook
for c in fast_circuits: print(c.get_output())
I'm getting following error:
NameError: name 'ZPhase' is not defined.
If I comment out the line causing the error
c_opt = zx.Circuit.from_graph(g).split_phase_gates().to_basic_gates() 
it works on a few circuits and then again throws a new error:
TypeError: Unknown gate XPhase(0,phase=1)
Please see screenshots below. Would appreciate any feedback.
Thanks!





Thank you for the report. It should be fixed now
