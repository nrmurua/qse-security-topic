By default, to_pandas_dataframe returns something like
It would be nice for downstream applications using DataFrames if all variables were in a list or tuple in a single column. I propose that a flag, say use_sample_column, causes the method to collapse all of the variable columns into a single column, such as
Something like this should do it:
One problem that I see is that for labelled samples (e.g. {'a': -1, 'b': 1}) the proposed format with lists of samples does not work. There are a couple approaches
Actually, I typically go with option 2 (so my example was a little simplified). It's the most clear for postprocessing purposes, and not terribly bad from a memory standpoint. Namely, it fits on a laptop and the fact that you get a very expressive dataframe to use in postprocessing outweighs the drawbacks. The worst case would be 10k unique samples for (say) 1000 variables, not a killer(?). What do you think?
Works for me!
One final comment: It could be hacky, but having two options, use_sample_column_list could provide option 1, while use_sample_column_dict could be used for option 2. That's only if you think memory would truly be an issue. We can always provide additional workarounds in the future, too.
Yeah, I think we should track usage and if it becomes a problem we can iterate.
