Running HHL tutorial https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/legacy_tutorials/aqua/linear_systems_of_equations.ipynb on windows platform crashes the jupyter kernel.  This does not occur when running on Linux platform (ex: using IQX console)
EigsQPE "num_ancillae" and "num_time_slices" values set to 3 and 50 respectively crashes the kernel
From first example in the tutorial :   2x2 diagonal matrix and using the default num_ancillae=3 and num_time_slices=50
 #Initialize eigenvalue finding module
eigs = create_eigs(matrix, 3, 50, False)
Runs successfully on windows when reducing the "num_time_slices" value and/or the number of ancilla qubits "num_ancillae"
could make it working using eigs = create_eigs(matrix, 3, 35, False)
On Linux it works even when increasing num_time_slices=130
eigs = create_eigs(matrix, 3, 100, False)
Should work on windows the same way as on Linux platform
I will note that HHL is in the process of being refactored/rewritten so looking at a platform specific issue with it in the interim is unlikely to get any priority. Do you have any clue as to why the kernel crashed? Some of the libraries that are relied upon, like numpy, have native dlls. Have you tried say updating your environment?
I don't exactly know why the kernel crashes, i just guess that this might be related to the size of the circuit for the engeinvalues that is too big to handle.   The eigenvalues circuit cost increases with the matrix size but even much more with the increase of the number of ancilla qubits and time slice value....
as an example for a 4x4 matrix, 5 ancilla qubits and 5 time slice the eigenvalue circuit cost is
OrderedDict([('cx', 18600), ('h', 12405), ('p', 12400), ('u', 6205), ('cp', 10), ('u2', 5)])  . when setting the time slice to 6 the kernel crashes on windows... but it does run on Linux (IQX).
I would have expected my Windows to handle at least like Linux IQX as i have 32 GB of memory while the IQX kernel seems to get 8 GB of memory allocated ...  But it does not seem to be related to the memory only ...
I learnt today that HHL is under refactorisation, i understand that this platform issue is not a priority. Do you have a estimated date for the new release ?  Thanks
It may be that more opensource products are used/tested more often on Linux than Windows and some bug has gone unnoticed around the native code. Its hard to say. I notice the tutorial uses the Aer backend. You could try using BasicAer in case it has anything to do with Aer native code.
The HHL rework is ongoing at present and we would hope to have this in the next major release. We do not have a firm date for the release yet although we presently we expect it to be early months of next year. Of course it will appear in master branch here ahead of whenever it is released.
In case you are more generally interested in linear solvers I will point out this issue #1343 which also mentions the HHL refactoring.
I have had the same issue, and I am on Windows too (Anaconda/Spyder). I can also say that it does connect to the complexity of the matrix as I have run multiple experiments and it always crashes on around the same complexity levels.
HHL is being reworked under this PR Qiskit/qiskit#5698 where core algorithms have been moved to Terra repo and are being maintained there. The code here will be deprecated and as such is frozen - hence I am closing this issue.
