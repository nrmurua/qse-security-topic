Implement a new AcceleratorDecorator that exposes an option asking for a previous AcceleratorBuffer file corresponding to an execution that exited unexpectedly.
This Decorator will add all previously found energies to a queue, and return them for each execution of Decorator.execute(), until it runs out, and then it will delegate to the decorated Accelerator for the rest of the execution.
