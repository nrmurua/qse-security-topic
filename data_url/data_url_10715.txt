Some parameters are "qubit specific", like initial state or anneal offsets. Would be good if they were transformed the same way the problem is transformed.
For example, suppose I have a small "logical" problem, and I use an embedding to sample from it with the hardware. If I want to use reverse annealing, the initial state I will provide will be in the "logical" space, and won't be mapped to the "embedded" space before being passed to the child sampler.
It is a good point. The problem is that there is not a clean way to discover which parameters should be transformed. I see two different approaches to handle this case:
