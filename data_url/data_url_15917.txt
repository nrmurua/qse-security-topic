When a string is supplied to reps parameter of TwoLocal , it tries raising ValueError which raises another error
Working Example
If possible the string value should be converted to int and if not possible TypeError should be raised.
Try converting string to int, if error occurs raise TypeError
Is it possible for me to work on this myself?

Of course, that would be great if you could do a PR that fixes this - also please include a unit test that asserts the error that is thrown, when you pass in such a value, is as expected. That way we can make sure it continues to work as expected since evidently this was missed in the unit testing before. You will find a set of tests already for TwoLocal here https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/e122c9c0cef78d1ba4ac57442cd03fb0363ba93c/test/python/circuit/library/test_nlocal.py#L402 and you can simply add another there.
@woodsp-ibm I have linked a PR, can you kindly review it?
