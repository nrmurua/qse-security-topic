Update documentation to reflect new JSON schema for gateware/firmware build and device_db.py auto-generation.
The Issue where JSON file format is discussed is here. Schema for JSON hardware descriptionÂ #1474
The Kasli generic JSON schema is here: artiq/gateware/targets/kasli_generic.schema.json
Example JSON files for different lab setups are here.
Is this still important? It doesn't seem very difficult to figure it out from the examples, the schema, and the code.
