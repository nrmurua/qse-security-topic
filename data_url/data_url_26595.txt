Hello,
Trying some MD runs, I have found that the coordinate scaling induced by NPT ensemble usage does affect the position of frozen atoms, and therefore, inter-atomic distances that should be fixed as well. It does not seem to be the desired behaviour in my opinion.
I have worked on a fix for my own runs but it seems to provoke numerous failures in the test cases. My question is the following: should the npt_i and npt_f be properly fixed (which would probably imply more changes than what I did, as well as modifying some test cases), should I just implement my current version as a new keyword, or should I simply keep my version for myself ?
In any case, I will be happy to provide my working materials but my development time is limited since my PhD is about to come to an end.
Let me know which path you prefer !
Cheers,
Paul Clabaut
Hello !
Thanks for the answer, I completely agree with that. In this case, it is probably better that I submit my work in the form of a new keyword. I will try to push that ASAP.
Best regards
Implemented via #2000.
