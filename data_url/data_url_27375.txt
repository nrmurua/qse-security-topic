Using the default configuration file, the install_everything.sh script pulls the latest git repositories of the projects to build the binary files. It might be of interest to somebody to pass the configuration file with exactly those pulled versions to another machine or somebody else, to locally replicate the exact same tool versions.
Example: User A uses QuantumRisc VM B and decides that he wants to directly install the same tools on his host system or another system. Currently A has to manually copy each version stored in the version file and insert it in the appropriate place in the configuration file.
Resolve this issue by adding a sub-script that converts a version file into a valid configuration file for the exact same versions.
