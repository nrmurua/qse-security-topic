We currently use yapf to ensure the proper formatting of all .py code. Our initial python implementation used this structure for imports:
With each import getting its own line. E.g, avoiding a single line such as import numpy, scipy, ... . The only exception are relative imports, like from package import thing1, thing2, .... Each block of imports should then be separated by a new-line.
This has slowly gotten out of order over time, so we should automate the import formatting before running yapf. A tool such as isort could be used to do this.
This will likely require the following (subject to evolve):
If there are multiple commands needed to run isort, we should consider creating a convenience run_python_format.sh script akin to the scripts/run_clang_format.sh file.
