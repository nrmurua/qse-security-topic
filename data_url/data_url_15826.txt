The Terra extra 'bip_mapper' requirements cannot be satisfied on Python 3.9, which means pip install 'qiskit-terra[all]>=0.18' cannot succeed.
The installation should succeed on Python 3.9 anyway, and raise a runtime error if the behaviour is used.
Set the extra to have ; python<3.9 in its requirement.  Not certain if this has further knock-on effects.
Yeah, CPLEX doesn't work on python 3.6 or python 3.9 on any platform, they also don't support 32bit platforms or aarch64. THe list of wheels is available at: https://pypi.org/project/cplex/#files
