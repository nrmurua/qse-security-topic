#2096 (review)
@Strilanc so now I can only use sample and I will always lose the id of any program or job I created.  This seems like a problem to me.
We ended up with a pattern where the sample is gotten from the engine and these other methods still exist.  See discussion in linked PR for why we can't remove them.  These were refactored.  Closing.
