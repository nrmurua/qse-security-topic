i could be breaking stuff by asking for this
bu would compatibility with modeling toolkit be a good thing for the package?.
or is this beyond the vision of the package itself
Could you be a bit more specific? What exactly do you want to use Symbolics/MTK for here?
I was wondering of using NeuralPDE to do some physics informed neural networks.
To see if it can be used to as a  functional layer between Image acquisition  and data processing from a quantum sensor
and to be honest I am clueless on how it will help in anyway , just had an weird thought and  needed an expert view point.
