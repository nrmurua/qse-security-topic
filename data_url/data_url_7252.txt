Ex:
println(Laser())
>> Laser(IonSim.var"#Et#24"{Int64}(0), 4.6290987907722285e6, (x = 1, y = 0, z = 0), (x = 0, y = 0, z = 1), IonSim.var"#ϕt#25"{Int64}(0), 7.29147e-7, [(1, 1.0), (2, 1.0)])
Then find the Electric Field needed to achieve Rabi Frequency:
Efield_from_rabi_frequency!(Ω, T, 1, 1, ("S-1/2", "D-1/2"))
println(Laser())
>> Laser(IonSim.var"#83#84"{Float64}(34784.12980493003), 4.6290987907722285e6, (x = 1, y = 0, z = 0), (x = 0, y = 0, z = 1), IonSim.var"#ϕt#25"{Int64}(0), 7.29147e-7, [(1, 1.0), (2, 1.0)])
Notice that the variable #Et has changed. This did not appear to affect my code, but it is a curious artifact and it would be good to figure out if this is a meaningful change.
