I'm trying to apply partial IQFT on a state. I have (for example) a 3 qubits state psi as ndarray s.t.  psi[0] = amplitude of 000 and psi[1] = amplitude of 001.  So I have qubit ordering reverted w.r.t. qiskit
In order to avoid a lot of memory usage in future computation, I'd prefer not to convert psi by hand.
To initialize the circuit correctly and apply the IQFT on the first 2 qubits from the left I tried the following code:
From the tests I've run, final_state is not what I expected: defining
exact = np.kron(IQFT_matrix(2), np.eye(2)).dot(psi) , with IQFT_matrix(2)= IQFT_matrix for 2 qubits.
np.testing.assert_array_almost_equal(final_state, exact) fails. Can you please help me find what I'm missing?
Further info: I tried modifying 'do_swaps' in 'QFT.construct_circuit()' but still the test fails: the arrays not only differ for index mapping but for value distribution too
