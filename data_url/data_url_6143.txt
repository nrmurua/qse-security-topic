there shouldn't be a 01 measurements.
After the first measurement, the wave-function collapse.
After the second measurement on the same qubit,

we should get measurement of '00' or '11' state,
instead of '01' and '00'
@JunChiehWang In my environment (Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS, Python 3.7.3), results look as you expected (BasicAer and Aer). The latest versions of qiskit and qiskit-aer is 0.12.0 and 0.3 as of Sept. 1, 2019. I recommend you to use these versions (I guess that 0..8.2 is a version of qiskit).
This seems to be working correctly, please reopen the issue if you are still having issues with latest versions.
