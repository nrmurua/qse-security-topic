Hi Johnnie,
Recently I thought it would be cool to use quimb to simulate not only quantum circuits but also optimal control with GRAPE method - which is directly related to experimental-level device control.
In short, the system I'd like to simulate is a qubit coupled to a d-level qudit. And all of the unitary operations are generated by some parametrized, time-dependent (yet discretized) Hamiltonian evolution. The goal is to synthesize the parameters in the Hamiltonian evolution at each time step so that the overall n-step evolution corresponds to some target unitary operation. Here's a good reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02430.
Another Python package qutip allows you to do this but I think their package is not as flexible as quimb: https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-control.html. Hence I ask.
Thank you in advance for your time! Hope you find it interesting :)
Best,
Yuxuan
