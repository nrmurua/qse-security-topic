marginal_distribution raises error when passes a NumPy array of indices:
--> 225 if indices is not None and (not indices or not set(indices).issubset(range(num_clbits))):
226     raise QiskitError(f"indices must be in range [0, {num_clbits - 1}].")
228 if isinstance(counts, Counts):
ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
Try above
It should work for both lists and arrays.

This should be easy to fix and backport for 0.21.1, we just need to change the is empty check on the input validation there to something that works with lists and numpy arrays. I'm pretty sure the python->rust boundary will work fine as is if it gets a numpy array (although it won't be as efficient as declaring an input type as a numpy array, which is easy to add support for in addition to a generic sequence input)
Yeah it is a simple fix.  Was going to do it myself but saw that I would need to modify type hints, and I draw the line at type hinting.
