For qiskit 0.6 and qiskit 0.7 we released notebooks showing the changes. Do we want to keep this up. If so we need to add it for 0.8 and the recent 0.9 release.
Also for completeness I would rename this notebooks qiskit over terra.
I will ask a few of our users through Q summit to see if they saw these release notebooks and, if so,  found them useful. My guess is we might have too much content around releases (blog, new notebooks, change log, release history) and this might be lost in the release process. This is just my guess and I'd like to confirm or deny it.
sounds good
@lerongil should we keep the releases folder?
I'm going to close this. As Leron said, there are many avenues where this information is duplicated. We have release announcements on medium stating the changes, and our tutorials are usually updated to keep track of the changes. Also, release notes are available in qiskit documentation.
Then why should we keep it. If we are not going to update I would remove the folder all together
Forgot to post the follow up here. I spoke to a few folks at Q summit and no one used these release tutorials. This is not to say that they are not useful but they might not be communicated well. I would suggest removing this folder and focusing on our current process of releases:
Blog Post highlighting updates
Updated qiskit-tutorials/qiskit
Changelog
Communication via Twitter/Slack
The more resources we add the harder it will be to parse through all of it.
Agreed, let's remove the folder.
