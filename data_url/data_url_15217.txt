The method pulse.Instruction.draw refers to visualization.pulse_drawer: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/dfbc738be57619b503b931a2d0741433a1bbe21b/qiskit/pulse/instructions/instruction.py#L223-L275
This function does not exist - it was removed in #8306, as it had been deprecated in Terra 0.17.  This wasn't caught by lint because visualization had a getattr function defined (to handle other unrelated deprecations).
...
Possibly this needs transitioning to the v2 drawer, but it's not clear to me if there's an entry point for single instructions any more.
As a stop-gap measure, we can probably directly call visualization.pulse.ScheduleDrawer, which while logically deprecated (because its entry point was), wasn't actually removed as part of #8306.
Fixed by #9144.
