With respect to project: qiskit-advocate/qamp-fall-21#39, I am trying to simulate few simple Qiskit circuit lists on a Qiskit Aer Simulator, with compute engine as Dask on Kubernetes Cluster, but continuously facing serialization (pickling) error(s).
I am even getting these errors while testing a DASK code example available on Qiskit Documentation Portal : https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/parallel.html
Error Messages
Execute the DASK code example available on Qiskit Documentation Portal : https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/parallel.html
As Cloudpickple module is now available for serialization, so flaws of pickle should not be realized, as both lamda functions & inner class can be managed by cloudpickle.
Though serializers option (serializers=['cloudpickle']) of Dask Client was mentioned, but it seems some additional option is required to force the pickling / serialization of Quantum Objects, being submitted by AerSimulator.
Should be fixed in #1365
