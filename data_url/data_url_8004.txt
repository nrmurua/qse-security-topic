As reported on the QuTiP mailing list:
I just find that one of our documentation pages has a plot that repeats several times and makes the page hard to read. I attach the link below: https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-time.html
This is because this documentation page doesn't manage and clear the plot context properly.

The plot should only appear once.
