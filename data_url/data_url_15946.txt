marginal_counts is broken for pulse jobs. I
Gives output
It seems like it is assuming creg will be present in the header. This is not true for pulse jobs which do not have classical registers and therefore this field won't be present. The fix should make marginal_counts work when the header is empty.
What happens if you do marginal_counts(job.result.get_counts()), indices=[0])? That's my normal workflow for using marginal_counts() because using it with results ends up deepcopying and making it too slow.
Of course, that's independent of this bug though we should fix the function for pulse results too.
I am new to quantum computing and would love to work on this issue.
Thanks @a-freakish! Assigning to you ðŸ˜„
This issue already has an open pr in progress: #6486
The referenced pr #6486 appears to be closed (b/c no further work done) ?  Should someone pick up this PR and finish it?
yes please @chetmurthy ! Remember to respect the @rithikaadiga's authorship in branch off their code. Shall I assign you?
Luciano, I'm new to the org, and to QC.  But this seems sufficiently "just a software problem" that, yes, I think I should have a go at it.  You can mark me down for working on it.
