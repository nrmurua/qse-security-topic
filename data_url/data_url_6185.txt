On FreeBSD I'm getting these warnings:
Are you by any chance developing the project on Windows?
Hey @yurivict, this warning is fine. We do support various OS: Linux 64 bits, MacOS and Windows 64 bits. So it all depends on the compiler you are using. FreeBSD should work as well if you use a version of clang or gcc that supports C++14, but we don't officially support it. I haven't even tried to build on it but I'd be glad to help if you want to add this support :)
I think this should be:
Oh, yes. You are right.
Could you fix it in a PR? :)
I can mentor you If not used to Github collaboration workflow
Why don't you just commit the fix?
hehehe sure I will
