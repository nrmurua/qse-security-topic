Running qiskit-metal (for example executing: design = designs.DesignPlanar() ) will result in
NameError: name '****' is not defined
You will find out that **** import is enclosed in:
if not config.is_building_docs():
This occurs because the config.is_building_docs() method senses the existence of the .buildingdocs lock file, which might just be the residue of an interrupted run of the doc build.
just interrupt (Ctrl+C) any doc build and the lock will stay there, causing the above problem.
launching qiskit metal should work regardless of the flag being there or not
What is the purpose of that flag (does benefit outweighs impact)? Is there a different way to sense whether docs are being built that is interrupted-docs-resistant?
