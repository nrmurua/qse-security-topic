Can the tolerance made to be user definable for setting the tolerance in the isometry to circuit conversion in
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/extensions/quantum_initializer/isometry.py
Right now the tolerance is hard-coded to be 1e-10, but it would be useful for the user to be able to adjust this tolerance.
I would be happy to take this issue.
I can take over this issue.
