Hi,
Previously for rigetti M1 device, we don't see this issue. But for rigetti M2 device, we found Quilc Container timeout more frequently. When do quil_to_native_quil, the running time of quilc for M2 is longer than M1.
Could you provide an example program and chip spec that isn't behaving nicely?
we are using compiler.quil_to_native_quil and saw timeout error like below:
Retrying (Retry(total=2, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'ReadTimeoutError("HTTPSConnectionPool(host='translation.services.production.qcs.rigetti.com', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=30)")': /devices/Aspen-M-2/get_version_info.
I can't give the a lot detail of program. So just give some characteristics of it. qubitCount is 3. gateCount is 618. 1Q is 588. 2q is 30. We don't have chip(M2) spec on our side. So the public info from here(https://www.rigetti.com/what-we-build) might be useful.
