The optimal 2Q compilation routines in quilc use a Nelder-Mead library that also includes a grid-restrained variant. We might replace our usages with this variant instead, as it is loads faster.
This seems to fail to converge much more often. If quil-lang/magicl#45 is sufficiently successful, we should close this issue.
