In Python, I can do this:
but now we get a NameError if we have
This should be valid code
I wonder if we can fix this by keeping a registry of defined subroutines that the Program can reference when run. In python we see that the subroutine definition is dynamically looked up at run time:
Before the subroutine is defined, we can label it as an extern function in the Program object so the openqasm is valid
I wonder if we could make the decorators use a lazy initialization pattern. So nothing really happens when the function is defined - it just returns a Program object in which the conversion has not happened yet. Then the first time the Program object is used (i.e. any method or property is accessed), then the conversion happens.
