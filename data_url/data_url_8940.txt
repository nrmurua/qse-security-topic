Detection fractions are directly measurable on hardware, and less sensitive to the details of the noise model, so they make a much better X axis than "physical noise parameter".
The thing that makes this tricky is there's not an obvious place to put it in the CSV data. If it's stored as a detection fraction column then it doesn't aggregate trivially.
One idea is to add num_sampled_detectors and num_sampled_detection_events columns. These columns can be added together like the rest. This would result in the detection fraction being massively oversampled, but that's okay. The main issue is likely that there's too much disk pressure to consider re-reading the dets data, so the stim sampling process would need a new option to output statistics about the samples to a tertiary file.
A very flexible non-commital thing to do would be to add a separate "collect_det_fraction" command that produced a CSV file that could be joined with the main CSV file by the plot command using the strong id as the key.
