Should summing probabilities be done by reduction?
Otherwise, should mixed_findProbabilityOfOutcome also just iterate with Kahan summation?
Similarly, it calcTotalProbability doesn't use OpenMP on local/distributed CPU
These are really debugging functions and need not be parallelised in order to have greater accuracy - I've instead updated the doc
