As a user of the pulse library, I would like to be able to specify that (parts of) a pulse should be repeated a fixed number of times without interrupting execution or depending on hardware triggers.
While the desired behavior could be achieved using LoopPulseTemplate with a specifically tailored Condition subclass, maybe a more direct mechanism to express such fixed amounts of iterations would be beneficial.
Possibilities are:
@qutech/owners @qutech/bluhm-group Do you have preferences?
It seems to me that extending SequencePulseTable would induce the least code overhead when defining loops without being awkward. One of the other options may also become relevant in the future and could be kept in the list of desirable features. Here I would lean towards a ForLoopCondition subclass as it probably recycles better.
