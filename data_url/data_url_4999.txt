Following the quick start in the README, I get the following error with GCC 9.1.0 (but no errors with GCC 8.x or 7.x).
CMake output:
Compilation error (snippet):
That's weird: numTasks is declared const!
I understand in OpenMP 4.5, const variables were automatically shared. For some compilers, making it explicitly shared doesn't compile!
A disappointing solution is to remove const in all declarations of vars used in OpenMP blocks and add them explicitly to shared, but perhaps there's something else going on/wrong
patched in ec9871b
