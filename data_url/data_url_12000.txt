Hi!
I found a mistranslation in https://qiskit.org/documentation/locale/ja_JP/tutorials/noise/8_tomography.html#%EF%BC%91%E9%87%8F%E5%AD%90%E3%83%93%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%81%AE%E7%8A%B6%E6%85%8B%E3%83%88%E3%83%A2%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%95%E3%82%A3%E3%83%BC%E3%81%AE%E4%BE%8B .
１量子ビットの状態トモグラフィーの例 (= a translation of 1-qubit process tomography example)  must be １量子ビットのプロセストモグラフィーの例.
How should I correct it?
Hi! Sorry that we never replied to this. Thank you for reporting it! That's a big help.
It looks like this tutorial no longer exists. But for the future, FYI that translations are handled in the https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-translations repository.
