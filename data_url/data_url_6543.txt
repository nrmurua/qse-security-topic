Cirq has introduced an API for requesting expectation values from a simulator: quantumlib/Cirq#3492
We need to implement this interface in qsimcirq. This should be mostly orthogonal to #270, but all combinations should be supported in the end (noiseless full-state, noisy full-state, noiseless EVs, noisy EVs).
