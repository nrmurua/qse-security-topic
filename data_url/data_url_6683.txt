Hi,
I just started experimenting with the simulator and subsequent measurements turned out be heavily correlated. I just initialised a qubit in some state and measured it, and repeated the same process many times. The result was very very strange. It may be the case that randomness generation is just not refreshed frequently enough so that it somehow use the same values for quickly repeated measurements.
Here is my code:
And the result of running it was:
On the third line you can see the trace of an event which should not happen in the lifetime of the universe. A measurement event happened 1829 times in a sequence where each individual event had only 10% chance! I get similar results for about each 3rd test runs.
I do not know if it is relevant but I am running Liquid on a 64 bit Windows 7 OS which runs on a VirtualBox instance hosted by a 64 bit ubuntu machine.
Do you have any clue what is happening under the hood?

@pizzasok: A new pseudorandom number generator is created every time you create a new Ket. The generator is seeded with the current system tick count, which is updated rather infrequently in general, especially on VMs. Thus, the behavior you're seeing is expected.
A better practice is to create one Ket object, and then use the Ket.Reset method when you want to reinitialize. That way you'll use a single random sequence, and should get good statistics.

Thank you for the reply, I tried not to make new Ket instances and it works indeed. My new code is:
And the result is:
Looks much more random :-)
Thank you for the support!
