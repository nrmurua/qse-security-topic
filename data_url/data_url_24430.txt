From @marcolincs
Currently the QRoute.length() property method does not take the fillet into consideration, thus causing the length utilized in the rest of the code is underestimated. need to update this method (and maybe other things related or that brake as a consequence) so that the fillet is taken into consideration.
.....problem is that it has been said we might want to have a different fillet for each corner. That will make this implementation much more complex and pervasive then just changing the one method
Improved fillet
