The circuits2qobj should be a simple function that just serializes the circuits to run on the backends. This is a follow on to #1134 and #1144
This is blocked by #1144, therefore on hold tag.
started to fix #1144 with #1173.
I am removing the 0.7 this can be done after.
While doing this let's make sure that #1138 is also addressed (placing final measurements at the end of the qobj.instructions list)
@ajavadia I don't agree with #1138 being addressed in this. The circuit_to_qobj should just be dumb and write out the qobj how it receives it. This should really be a separate update inside the simulators. If they can optimize by having the measurements at the end then we let them do it. Experiments dont make a difference
