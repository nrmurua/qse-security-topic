For some extremely large (high depth, high gate count) circuits, the local QASM simulator (qasm_simulator) occasionally encounters a core dump:
I encountered this on a 16 qubit circuit that was extremely high depth - it contained upwards of 38000 rz gates, 16000 rx gates, and 32000 cx gates.
Oddly, it appears that the error disappears if I compile the circuit to not use any rz gates. Although, I think that the error also only occurs sometimes - I can not deterministically replicate it so far.
No error. No core dump.
No response
I think this a bug in qiskit-aer the exception being raised is at least coming from qiskit-aer and qasm-simulator  is definitely part of aer. I'm going to transfer this issue to the aer repo.
This error is raised in gate fusion. An workaround is set fusion_enable=False.
@epelofske-LANL Could you share your codes that reproduce this issue? I would like to take a look.
