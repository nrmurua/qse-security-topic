When trying to transpile a circuit with a Reset instruction with an AerSimulator backend with a noise model, the transpiler raises an exception about "reset" not being in the equivalence library.
Successful transpilation
This is a consequence of the conversion to BackendV2. Before the conversion, AerSimulator had no target object so this code would execute and insert reset into the list of allowed instructions. Now when the noise model is set as an option, this code sets the basis gates:

which takes the intersection of the default set with the basis gates of the noise model:

which defaults to just a small set of gates:

These cached basis gates get used to set the backend configuration basis gates:

The convert_to_target() function which AerSimulator uses to generate the target object uses the configuration basis gates to set the instructions in the target and so "reset" is not included.
I am not sure if it makes sense to add reset to the default set for NoiseModel or if some other solution is preferred. My workaround for now is to use NoiseModel(basis_gates=["id", "rz", "sx", "cx", "reset"]).
