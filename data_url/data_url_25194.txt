When using container-based executors, users often need a greater degree of customization than is possible through PipDeps or BashDeps alone.  For this reason, we allow users to customize the image used by Covalent tasks in container-based executors.  While the Azure Batch and GCP Batch plugins provide a constructor parameter container_image_uri, the AWS plugins are a little older and so they rely on an environment variable, which is used globally for all jobs using those plugins.  This issue is dedicated to updating the AWS plugins, both adding this new constructor parameter to the AWSExecutor (see AgnostiqHQ/covalent-aws-plugins) and removing the environment variable.
