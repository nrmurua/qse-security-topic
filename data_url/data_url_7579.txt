use on and on! to represent operations without side effect on regsiters and in place operations on a register. A demo will looks like
We will use the matrix product order in chain rather than the gate order in a circuit diagram. (which is reversed), e.g
on!(register) can take a block
lazy constructors for blocks that requires an integer (number of active qubits).  This is because
the information about active qubits is contained in registers, we should be able get it directly from a register.
