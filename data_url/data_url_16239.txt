In quantum circuit compose we have dest._calibrations.update(other.calibrations).
A calibration looks like this:
Therefore, if we have multiple calibration for x each one for a different qubit compose will loose them.
A simple example suffices to see why this is the case
results in {'a': {(1,): 'bb'}} i.e. the calibration for (0, ) is no longer present.
In the simple example above we should have {'a': {(0,): 'aa', (1,): 'bb'}}. I.e. the expected behavior is that all calibration be carried over when using compose.
Replace dest._calibrations.update(other.calibrations) with something tailored to the structure of the calibrations dict.
