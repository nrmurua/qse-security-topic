I notice the base of the logarithm in the entropy() is 2. It is also documented in the API as such.
result -= ev(i) * std::log2(ev(i)); 
Many papers, however, tend to use the natural logarithm. So does the Qiskit.
I understand base 2, e, or 10 can be used to calculate entropy. Is your choice of the base 2 just a personal preference, or is it conceptually significant in the context of Quantum++?
I've used the convention used in Nielsen and Chuang (Sec. 11.1), in which they use log_2, to measure the entropy in "bits". With this convention, a maximally entangled state has entropy 1. I will document this in the Doxygen, thanks again for the code review!
PS: just realized it the log_2 was documented already :)
Sounds great. Thanks.
