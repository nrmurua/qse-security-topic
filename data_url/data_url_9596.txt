Just an idea here, open for discussion.
The Simulation class is getting big. What about separating from the class all the configs elements related to noise >? Then, we could provide the necessary elements at initialization. Something like my_sim = Simulation(sequence, >noise_config).

This is an interesting suggestion. I already went into this way with the refactoring I was proposing in the Simulation class a couple of weeks ago (#152). A SimConfig class (inside the pulser.simulation module) would include at least two sets of instructions:
There could be then other sets of configs added later, or more specific subclases.
I added a new SimConfig class in an attempt to be clearer. It encapsulates noise types, temperature field, number of runs, and solver options, and is part of the simulation module.
