Hi all,
I am trying to compute initial amplitudes to pass into a minimizing function, but I am confused how to work with the ccsd_single_amps function within the PyscfMolecularData class.
This is what I have so far:
n_amplitudes = 5 in this example so my initial amplitudes are [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]. Surely there must be a better way for me to initialize my amplitudes? Any and all help is appreciated!
molecule.ccsd_single_amps currently returns none.
Hi @jason-jk-kang,
It seems like this is not a bug in OpenFermion or a feature request. Could you please copy and paste this question to the Quantum Computing Stack Exchange with openfermion and  cirq tags?
