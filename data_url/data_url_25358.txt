If you attempt to dispatch when Covalent is not started, you get a trace with a ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 61] Connection refused. For an experienced user, it's obvious this is caused by the dispatcher server not running, but for others it might not be so obvious. We should implement more graceful exception handling, so that the user gets a helpful message like "The Covalent dispatcher server is not running. You must start Covalent before dispatching your workflow."
Hello, I would like to work on this issue. Could you please assign it to me?
Thanks for participating in Hacktoberfest @rutvikk05!  Looking forward to your contribution üëç
Thanks @wjcunningham7!
I've started working on this, but not sure how to approach the problem. In which file should I make the changes to change the error message?
@rutvikk05 the file you'll want to take a look at is covalent/_dispatcher_plugins/local.py.  That will include the classes and methods referenced in the acceptance criteria.
@wjcunningham7 I'm trying to reproduce the error in windows 11, but I'm unable to setup covalent. Is it compatible with windows?
Windows is not supported. Here is the list of supported platforms.
@scottwn I will take up this issue. Can you assign it to me?
