I get the following error message. My code runs fine on the first try, but gives the error if I try to run it again. I can restart the kernel every time, but would like to know if there's a fix. Could someone help please?

P.S. You can use Markdown to format the traceback in a user-friendly way:
e.g.
```python-traceback

Renders to:
The variable e does not exist outside the except block even if the try failed...
So trying to give more information about the error resulted in more confusion, sorry.
I would suggest to use functions instead of string for your coefficient, the speedpup is often less than the time it take to compile the string, (which is not included in the progressbar).
It is the first case where it would work once, but not the following times. I would be interested in the real error message and/or a code to reproduce the bug. If you are comfortable hacking your version of qutip: adding print(e) in the except block

Thank you for the answer. I will try to use functions as you suggested. I didn't know how to use pdb so I didn't know what to do.
I added print(e) but nothing happens. I can attach my code (in Jupyter notebook) if you'd like to look at it.
To give you more information, I tried the same code in a Linux machine and it works fine. So I think the problem might be for Mac computers only. Also, these problem popped up after I upgraded to qutip 4.5. The problem didn't go away when I reverted to the previous Conda environment though...
Hi All
I get the same error when attempting to run the qutip tutorial
"Bloch sphere with colorbar"
from the qutip tutorials with a virgin install of qutip from the conda-forge on Python 3.7.6 using the latest version of Anaconda..in a new environment.
Whats up?
@jtwamley we will look into it in the next months.
Should be fixed by #1199 and released in QuTiP 4.5.2.
