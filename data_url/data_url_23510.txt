MWE:
The npts parameter should be set correctly.
I get the exception:
The problem seems to be that setting npts calls self.update_lin_traces() which in turn calls self.start.get() which doesn't seem to work if the VNA is in CW mode.

@mgunyho Thanks for the detailed description. It looks like perhaps update_lin_traces should only be called if the instrument is in a different mode. Would you be willing to make a pull request that implements this ?
Yes, that seems to be the correct fix. I can try to implement it the next time we're using the VNA.
