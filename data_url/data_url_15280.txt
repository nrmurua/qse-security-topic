Currently we cannot use the method dispatch mechanism in Qiskit because functuools.singledispatchmethod is available in python 3.8+. I often  prefer to use method dispatch to make code readable (rather than writing long if-clause), but EOL of python 3.7 is  2023-06-27.
Alternatively we can add this package to dependency.
https://pypi.org/project/singledispatchmethod/
I'm not sure if adding more dependency makes sense since we can still write reasonable code without dispatch mechanism.
Maybe this could help simplify BasisTranslator which has to call  functools.singledispatch outside the class.
I'm in favor, in general. Can we smoothly drop the dependency once we drop support for 3.7?
I don't have a strong opinion on the decorator but for limiting it to just 3.7 we already do this for other things: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/requirements.txt#L11-L12 and https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/requirements.txt#L18-L22 where we are using specific libraries only with 3.7. When we drop 3.7 support next year we can just remove those lines
Thanks for the feedback. I found there were potentially many developers who also wanted to use method dispatch. I opened PR for dependency.
