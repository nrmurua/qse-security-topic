Description
A user needs to be able to filter the dispatch list by the dispatch status by clicking on the short link above the dispatch list
Requirements
UI reference

Nice to have - If a user filters by a status and navigates to the graph page, and if he comes back to the dashboard, the filter state should be retained. This ideally needs to be extended to both sort, search & pagination as well.
