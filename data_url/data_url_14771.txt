The code in qiskit/visualization/state_visualization.py needs testing. Current coverage is:
(This is a follow up from #300 (comment))
Still a valid issue: https://coveralls.io/builds/24960860/source?filename=qiskit/visualization/state_visualization.py
on hold until #2968 is decided.
Is this still workable?
@gabriellm1 it is! Probably following the #4544 style.
can I work on this? This is my first issue.
hi @gabriellm1 are you working on this? If not I will assign to @abzsd
Go ahead guys :)
thanks @gabriellm1 üòÑ @abzsd I'm assigning to you, let us know if you have any questions
‚úÖ state_visualization.py is now 56.84% covered! (improvement over the 6% at start but a dedicated test would be great!) https://coveralls.io/builds/44969725/source?filename=qiskit%2Fvisualization%2Fstate_visualization.py
Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
Did you have any change to have a look @abzsd ?
Hi If @abzsd is no longer working on this issue, I'd love to be assigned and write the tests.
reassigned to @smturro2 due to no response from @abzsd üòÑ Let us know if you need any assistance @smturro2! You can review the snapshot testing instructions in the contributing guidelines for guidance on mpl testing
Hi @javabster thanks for assigning the issue. There seems to be tests in the snapshot testing for many of the functions in state_visualization. Was there specific tests in mind?
ah yes I see what you mean @smturro2! By checking the link to the coverage report I can see there are still quite a few lines (highlighted in red) that don't have test coverage. Some of these could be covered by more snapshot tests (e.g. adding another snapshot test with different arguments) and others could be covered by regular unit tests (e.g. I see a lot of the lines that raise errors are uncovered, it would be good to write unit tests that check the error is raised correctly). You don't need to reach 100% coverage, but I think if we could reach 80% coverage that would be great!
I don't think we actually catch the snapshot tests in the coverage report - all the snapshots are in test/ipynb, but the coverage report just runs stestr run, which only looks in test/python.  So we actually probably have slightly better coverage than it looks like we do, but we're not detecting it.
That said, we're definitely under-testing the visualisation modules, so any further efforts to help out on them are always welcome!
Hi @smturro2 are you still working on this issue?
@javabster im no longer working on thisüëçüèª
ok thanks for letting me know, I'll unassign you so that others can jump in if they would like to work on it :)
HI, I, Saiprateek Dasgandhi am a beginner. Just been a few months doing Qiskit and am looking forward to contributing to Qiskit. If this issue is open, can I work on this?
Do let me know of any prerequisites that I should be aware of.
sure thing @PSD-20, I'll assign to you! If you haven't contributed to terra before please read the contributing guide, and if you are new to open-source/github in general you might find these videos  helpful.
Ohk. Also, Can you please assist me with how I should begin with this particular issue.
Hi @PSD-20 to get started with this you can see the coverage report for this file here: https://coveralls.io/builds/61022961/source?filename=qiskit%2Fvisualization%2Fstate_visualization.py
As you can see there are lots of lines of code highlighted in red, which means that they are lacking tests to cover them. So you would need to write some tests that would cover these lines of code. You can see examples of other tests for the visualisation module in test/python/visualization.
Hi, is this issue open and not assigned, could I work on this issue?
