In QuTiP 4.5.0 conda release on Mac, I get an error if I call a quantum circuit to print in jupyter notebook. However, the circuit is printed after the message.
This did not happen with QuTiP 4.4.1. Imagemagick is installed. This issue may be related to the closed issues #1179 and #702.

pdf2svg isn't part of ImageMagick, (at least on brew) is http://www.cityinthesky.co.uk/opensource/pdf2svg.  It feels like all of these system commands should be made a bit more robust.
In particular, the bare os.system is not the recommended way of calling out to system commands any more.  It's now preferable to use subprocess.run.  Here, the bug is, I would assume, actually on the previous line:
will return a non-zero error code which isn't checked for, but will not raise an exception.
If Jupyter supports displaying embedded PDF files and that's all it's being used for, then it might be worth removing the conversion to SVG.  (pdf)LaTeX certainly supports embedded PDF files as graphics.  The fewer little dependencies we require, the better.
Also, while this is neither here nor there, #1179 isn't yet closed, merged, or ready for merge.
I've had the same problem recently, trying to plot some circuits. Had to dig into the code to find which packages were missing. Maybe we could replace the os.system() calls with a the subprocess.run() and show on which call the code failed.
Just a small comment in the meanwhile, might be instructive to run the code on ipython (on the terminal instead of jupyter), usually it gives the behavior of os.run() commands as well. Might help with installation of missing packages.
