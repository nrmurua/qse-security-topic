Using 2.0 on windows, is there anyway of calling methods defined by getattr in the kernel? I tried getattr on its own in the kernel and that didn't work, and then tried using it in build instead. However, I get an error message when I try to access the method. Using the following code,
I got the message,
If I get rid of the kernel decorator it prints the value 50 as you expect. Is there a better way of calling methods by name in the kernel?
getattr is not supported in kernels by design. Every use of getattr that could be in principle efficiently compiled can also be represented using closures, which also shows intent better IMO. Is there a reason you cannot rewrite what you want using closures?
@whitequark He is not using getattr inside the kernel, and I don't see a technical reason for his use case not to be supported.
@sbourdeauducq oh, I misread that. I agree that this should work. I will look into it.
