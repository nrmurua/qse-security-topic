There is much we can do to improve the "device" component of pyQuil. In the README, we write that pyQuil is for:
In addition, we have added a lot of other functionality to pyQuil that doesn't fall into those 3 buckets. Some of these additional buckets include:
The last bucket, "Schemas for device topologies, gatesets, and performance specifications", is captured nearly entirely in device.py and is hardly mentioned in the pyQuil docs. A good quantum programming library should make it easy to target a particular device configuration, as this is a critical step in the typical workflow for either running on a real QPU or simulating the operation of a quantum computer. That being said, I think it is time to promote device.py to its own directory, start adding some helpful tools (beginning with #1025), and give it a section in the docs. It would probably also make sense to pull some of the device-specific logic out of api/_quantum_computer.py and put it in this new folder.
