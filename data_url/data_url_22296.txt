Using artiq 2.0.dev+485.gc0d5914 on windows, I have an idle kernel that turns ttl_bdd(ttl3) on,
I'm trying to run the following experiment at priority -1 in the background,
I need to call self.core.comm.close() here in order to have this experiment restart once another experiment is completed. If not I get a ConnectionResetError("Connection closed").
I interrupt this background experiment Pause_Test with an experiment that pulses a ttl once.
Triggering on ttl13 on the scope, with ttl13 green, ttl14 yellow and ttl_bdd blue, I get the following waveform,

The seamless handover seems to occur perfectly between ttl13 and ttl14. However, the idle kernel turns on after the background experiment terminates. Is there a way to prevent that? If I remove self.core.comm.close(), the idle kernel doesn't turn on when 'ttl13' pulses, but the background experiment doesn't turn on after that.
Yes, it's supposed to, as I explained on the mailing list a few weeks ago. Do this: https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/examples/master/idle_kernel.py#L11
