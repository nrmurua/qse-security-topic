The simulator contains code for simulating the following gates:
These gates don't exist in Terra.
In addition, when the gates mcrx, mcry, mcrz are added to a circuit, before transpilation, Terra already converts them to other gates. So, although these gates exist in Terra, effectively the code in Aer for simulating them never runs.
These gates are there because they are used in the simulation of other gates (that do exist).
