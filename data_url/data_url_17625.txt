when I get to the following step i have the error:

Would it help to uninstall sympy 1.2 myself?
@kwyip I am not a Qiskit developer, but are you sure that you have source <name of your venv>/bin/activated your virtual environment? I am asking because if you had done so, the environment should have contained no existing installations. I've just installed Qiskit into new venv without any troubles.
Please, check that you have done all the steps:
Hope, it will help! If not, probably someone from community could provide a better solution.
I have the same problem, but I'm using python 3.6.2 and Ubuntu 16.04 and the message is the following:
I think I ran into this problem once. I had sympy installed via anaconda, so I did this:
This will install sympy via pip for you.
I also agree with @Exferro that if you have really created a new environment you should not have any pre-existing packages.
If this does not solve the issue please reopen.
I am running the latest python 3.7.  I running into problem installing qiskit:
C:\Users\dave_>pip install qiskit

I see this as well, even doing a docker build (so the environment there is pretty clean). The suggestion of conda uninstall sympy after installing anaconda and before trying to install qiskit seemed to do the trick. The anaconda version is https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh. That feels like it's a workaround and there is an underlying issue with a double-dependency.
Thanks for the advice. I revert back to qiskit 0.7, and it worked. For my intent&purpose, qiskit0.7 works fine.  I filed a bug under qiskit #579 and got an answer that explains this.  Since then, it should be fixed.  However, i am still using 0.7 since i am fine with it.
