Fix __repr__ to not access non-existing attribute ExperimentResultData
Hi @brunorijsman! Thanks for reporting this. The bug is actually in Qiskit-Terra and it is already fixed in master, not in release though. The fix came in this PR #4890. @chriseclectic @mtreinish as it is not specifically a bug fix PR, do you think we can include it in case there is another bugfix terra release (0.16.5)?
Following @vvilpas 's comment above, looks like this has already been fixed and released, so closing as resolved.
