Setting the shots of a Sampler to a float results in it failing, but not until the job is executed.
The code above fails on the final line, but it could fail sooner, when the Sampler is created with shots set to a float.
This is creating a usability issue for us in the circuit-knitting-toolbox, where users often do some math to determine a suitable shots count.  If they forget to round the value and convert it to an int, they currently get the above error when they go to execute the circuit using the toolbox.  We've found that because the error comes then from deep inside the circuit-knitting-toolbox, the user is typically unaware that their own error caused it.
Check the type of shots when the sampler is constructed.  Don't wait until result() is called on the job.  Provide a clear error message when it is a float.
I believe 0.12.1 resolved this issue. This is same with #1754.
I confirmed this code works with 0.12.1.
