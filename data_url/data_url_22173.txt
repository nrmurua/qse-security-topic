smoltcp populates the ARP table from every incoming IP packet (such as the TCP SYN), so it never actually needs to resolve a MAC if all you're doing is listening. Therefore it has no special support for gateways.
@whitequark you have keep-alive in smoltcp. does it still need wiring in artiq?
Yes.
Timeouts and keepalive turned on, and tested by adding a -A OUTPUT -d $CORE_DEVICE -j DROP rule to iptables.
