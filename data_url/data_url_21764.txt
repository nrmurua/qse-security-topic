PYON can't serialize type annotations returned by inspect.getfullargspec()
Sample code:
^^Above code mimics behavior used by artiq_rpctool ::1 PORT list-methods for listing driver methods.
See 
PYON should either (1) process type annotations (preferred), or (2) pc_rpc.py should drop them entirely and not pass them on to PYON (undesired, but acceptable). If (1), then PYON should be able to decode the same on the receiver side.
Pending on approval of #1188
