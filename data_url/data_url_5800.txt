Qiskit AER simulator does not recognize the GPU and fails execution by saying that GPU is not supported on the system.
Output:
When I change the device to CPU I get the following;
I'm not sure what is going wrong in this particular scenario since it's a very simple example I was expecting it to work. Are there any further steps to compile AER backend with CUDA libraries that I'm missing?
Thanks

Do you have both qiskit-aer and qiskit-aer-gpu installed in the same python environment? If so that might be your issue. The 2 packages are mutually exclusive and will conflict with each other if both are installed. Unfortunately python packaging doesn't give a mechanism to properly expose this automatically for pip so the burden is placed on users to install only one or the other. Do you get this issue if you only install qiskit-aer-gpu in your environment?
I close this because no response for mostly one month. I hope @mtreinish 's comments cam be help.
