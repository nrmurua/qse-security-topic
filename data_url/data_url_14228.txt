The Rényi entanglement entropy is a common quantity used for studying the entanglement structure of quantum states, so it would be useful to have function to compute it (perhaps in quantum_info.states.measure). The $\alpha$-th Rényi entropy is calculated as
$$S_\alpha = \frac{1}{1 - \alpha} \log \left( \text{Tr} \rho_A^\alpha \right)$$
where $\rho_A$ is the reduced density matrix of the subsystem $A$, so it would be straightforward to compute it with partial_trace and a list of qubits to trace out. As the Rényi entropy is often studied in the context of stabilizer states, an efficient algorithm for computing the Rényi entropy of StabilizerState's may be nice as well. For stabilizer states, the Rényi entropy is independent of $\alpha$ and can be computed as the binary rank of the reduced stabilizer tableau:
$$S_\alpha = \text{rank}_2(T_A) - N_A$$
where $N_A$ and $T_A$ are the subsystem size and stabilizer tableau truncated to $A$, respectively.
I am happy to implement this and submit a PR if this seems like a useful addition.
Hi @eliotheinrich, I think this would be a good addition. I'll assign you.
