Several paths have been changed as files have moved around, so we should preserve backward compatibility with a deprecation warning.
Examples (need to check against 0.7 for a full list):
It would be good to verify current master against the existing qiskit-tutorials and the example scripts in terra along with any other scripts people use or have locally that use terra for 0.7. We should find all the places where we're potentially breaking existing users before we release. My basic workflow for running qiskit-tutorials with terra master is:
That should launch the tutorials repo in your default browser running terra from master.
I also pushed up the WIP patch for the 0.8 release notes: #211 any backwards incompatibility we find as part of this (and we don't fix prior to release) we should make sure to add to that
based on feedback received about running prior notebooks, we seem to be ok here. The biggest change is just qiskit.compile --> qiskit.compiler.transpile and qiskit.compiler.assemble
