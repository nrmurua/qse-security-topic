Description
find_clique_embedding does not successfully return for the graph of Advantage_system1.1 with use_cache=True
This behavior affects dwave.system.samplers.DWaveCliqueSampler
To Reproduce
Minimum example (for K8) assuming configuration for Advantage_system1.1
Expected behavior
find_clique_embedding may not return, or may terminate with an EOFError such as
Workaround
Use the above clique_embedding function or similar using use_cache=False instead of DWaveCliqueSampler. This prints a correct embedding that can be used directly with FixedEmbeddingComposite
Environment:
Thanks for your bug report.  It's known that find_clique_embedding can take a couple of minutes the first time that it runs on your system (per sampler).  I wonder if you stopped it at just the wrong time (e.g. if it was in the middle of writing the cache to disk).  Would you please run the following, then try your code again with use_cache=True and allow it to finish?
Thanks, the embedding works now. Sorry it looks like I just overlooked the busgraph_cache class.
To the contrary, no apologies necessary!  The caching code should be more resilient, and I think I know how to prevent this in the future.  Thank you very much!
