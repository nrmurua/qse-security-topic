the addition of SIRIUS to the toolchain broke the "default" configuration (running the toolchain without any arguments):
CC @mtaillefumier
Also, farming tests for Current Toolchain (psmp) currently throw an exception due to initializing SIRIUS multiple times ("SIRIUS library is already initialized").
I have the patch for the first issue which I think is more important right now. Do you want a pull request or can I send you a patch for this.
I do not understand how sirius can be initialized more than one's. the only time it is called is in cp2k_run.F which call a wrapper cp_sirius_init() which call sirius_initialize() function.
I think farming in CP2K (but I'm not sure) calls the init part twice for the master rank, which behaves as master and worker.
The current solution is to finalize the library before going to farming, see

Therefore I would add there a sirius finalization...
This is indeed a possibility but the real fix would be to call sirius_initialize only when needed. As far as i understand it is not possible because the input preprocessing is done after the initialization of the full library. I do not know however how much work it would be to have this information available.
I will make the necessary modifications to avoid the double initialization.
Ok I included the modifications ion my pull request.
As a side-note, spglib somehow became necessary for at least the sdbg-test (CI test that runs by default). However, spglib's install script added the library only conditionally to the link-line (IF_MPI and IF_OMP). I fixed as part of PR #63 (early version of PR #63 failed due to missing spglib symbols).
this was fixed in #67 but unfortunately not referenced
I doubt this was fixed in #63 since I merged/rebased the PR into my PR and it was still failing. Anyhow, should be good now.
