no clear relation between amplitude and gain and the graph,
the exact register name should be written where it intervenes in the schematic
are we "wontfixing" this issue?
At least not until my course next week and even my presentation on march 27th, so depending on the timing for the release, we can postpone to later... This doesn't sound like a critical development.
I guess this is clearer like that...
