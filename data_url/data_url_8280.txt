While trying to migrate to pytest from nose , #1131, there is only one failed test arising on all platforms.
The problem seems to be a test in the control module, exactly it is qutip.tests.test_control_pulseoptim.TestPulseOptim called by     test_03_dumping(self): on line 340.
Indeed, TestPulseOptim seems to have this attribute where tmp_dirs
are defined,
Any help @tehruhn and @ajgpitch would be great. I think one should call setUp.
This can be closed, #1131 fixes this.
Maybe we can try remove pytest-cov?
We only use it for Travis, the end user only needs to install pytest.
I don't think removing it should change the output, but we can try it if you think it might work.
ah ok no fine. I meant to comment the other PR.
