I have a stabilizer circuit with five qubits. A measurement is happening in one of them so we can end up with two channels for the rest of the qubits for each measurement outcome 0 and 1. For each channel I can directly extract the corresponding Kraus operators and the total set of them (including both channels) satisfies the resolution to the identity (which is expected). However, if I first extract the choi matrices for both channels and from them I then extract the Kraus operators through the function choi_to_kraus(), the resolution to the identity is not satisfied.
I attach below two txt files, that contain the choi matrices in Qobj form
choi_even.txt
choi_odd.txt
Quantum object: dims = [[2, 2], [2, 2]], shape = (4, 4), type = oper, isherm = True
Qobj data =
[[1. 0. 0. 0.]
[0. 1. 0. 0.]
[0. 0. 1. 0.]
[0. 0. 0. 1.]]
I've tried changing the tolerance in the function but the normalization is still wrong.
