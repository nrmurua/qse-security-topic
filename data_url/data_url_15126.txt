There is no way to programmatically find the max_shots allowed by a V2 fake backend, even if this value is None.  This, along with missing the configuration file as a whole, makes it hard to treat the V2 fake backends as drop in replacements for their actual counterparts.
Try to query the max number of shots from a V2 fake backend
There should be a way to do it, even if the return value is something like None because there is no actual bounds for a simulator, save for allowed time.
No response
It's something like: backend.options.validator.get("shots", (None, None))[1]  (this also works for backendv1)
shots are defined as options on a backend because it's a user configurable run time option. A maximum value for shots is defined as a validator {so it errors automatically on value update) for the field, so you can query it from the validator.
Interesting, did not know this.  It also does not seem to work as intended.  Namely, the above suggestion does work on real v2 backend, and gives None on fake v1 and v2 backends:
returns None while
returns 100000
gives None.
But on V1 real backends it still returns None:
For the real and fake v1 backends, the configuration file also returns different, non None, values, here both equal to 100k shots:
and
So, unless I am missing something, it is either a bug for V1, or one still has do an instance check and code differently for each backend version.
But this does address the issue for V2, since the above mentioned solution does work in those cases, so closing as solved for original issue.
