Hey everyone - Perhaps a noob question. I am looking to implement max clique on the DWave annealer.  I need to pass a sampler to this method:
def maximum_clique(G, sampler=None, lagrange=2.0, **sampler_args):
When I check the dimod module,  I only find the abstract class Sampler and in the examples the simulatd sampler is used. Does this mean I have to implement a new Sampler in order to use the maximum_clique method ? Please let me know.
If this is not the appropriate place to ask this question, please close this issue and point me to another location perhaps SO.
Hi @pbanavara ,
dimod provides a sampler API. Any sampler which uses that API should work with a dwave-networkx algorithm. Specifically, your maximum_clique method can/should assume that the sampler has the sample, sample_ising and sample_qubo methods and that it returns a dimod Response object.
There are several samplers that we have implemented in several different packages. You can see our list of packages https://dw-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects.html#projects
The noteable ones are ExactSolver in dimod, DWaveSampler in dwave-system, and SimulatedAnnealingSampler in dwave-neal.
Hope this helps!
@arcondello  Thanks much. I am now using the DWaveSampler with my credentials. Any idea what's the maximum size of the graph that I can embed using this sampler. Also does the graph have to be fully connected ?
You might find https://dw-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/max_cut.html#max-cut useful as an example.
Also you'll need to embed your graph (use the EmbeddingComposite as in the above example). The largest complete graph that can be embedded is K65.
Great ! Thanks @arcondello I was missing the Embeddingcomposite step. Will reach out to you if I come across any more issues. So looks like the graph need not be fully connected or complete. I am trying out with all variants and so far if I stay under 40 nodes, I am good.
Glad to hear it, good luck!
