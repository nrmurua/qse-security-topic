The qobj specification does not specify a datatype for pulse samples datatypes. This is because JSON does not have a floating point datatypes. Backends that create a pulse_library may not emit sufficient precision to JSON and this may cause SamplePulses to have a norm greater than one when cast to np.complex128 even if it should be exactly unit norm.
Should not fail
Samples that have a norm of almost but greater than 1. should have their norm scaled to 1.
#2796 fixes this
