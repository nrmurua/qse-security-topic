Comes after #997 (which defines the cirq.testing.assert_equivalent_repr method)
Basically the goal here is, for each place you can find def __repr__( in the project, there should be an associated test that calls cirq.testing.assert_equivalent_repr(a, b, c)  on a few test values.
is this still a thing? i could give it a go if so.
@funston It is. Go for it!
Assign this to me
