During the initial migration to the new DB schema in #823, several methods of Result to query the transport graph were modified to always look up the data in the db. These are:
We will need to query the db for this information once we add the ability to resume workflows as the server would then need to rehydrate a partially executed computational graph. Presently, however, hitting the db is not yet necessary; the dispatcher  holds the entire transport graph in memory during execution. Further, these methods are also exposed to the client which also has the entire Result object in memory but doesn't have access to the server's db.
@wjcunningham7 I believe this is out of scope until we support resuming workflows, is that correct?
get_node_result() relies on get_node_name(), get_node_output(), etc., which were updated to use the in memory Result in #1216
get_all_node_results() in turn relies on get_node_result()
_get_node_output() was changed to get the output from the in memory Result in 9e321a9. get_all_node_outputs() relies on _get_node_output().
_get_node_status() was changed to get status from the in memory Result in 3292926
Functionality to retrieve the error from the in memory Result was added in 3292926
Functionality to retrieve the node name from the in memory Result was added in 3292926
