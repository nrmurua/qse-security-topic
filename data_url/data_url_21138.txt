Investigating...
I can load auspex hdf5 with:
load_data(datapath, filenum, datestr)
or
load_latest_data(logpath).
Do none of them work?
What branch are you using?
master for both auspex and qlab.jl
Yeah, load data definitely doesn't work for me:
data = load_data(datapath, 9, "171101", true); results in HDF5 crashing.
So far I've tracked it down to the fact that somehow Auspex is putting in the h5 header even when you don't ask it to...
Okay, the auspex issue is fixed by this...
Still need to fix qlab.jl to load a file with a header...
Oops, was looking at the wrong git repo on orion ðŸ˜ž
