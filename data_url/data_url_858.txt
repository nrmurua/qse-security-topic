Describe the feature you'd like
Support for generating OpenQASM should be extended to all observables in the Braket SDK.
How would this feature be used? Please describe.
The to_ir() method on the observable classes should be extended to accept a parameter to determine the IR to translate the circuit to. The IRType can be either JAQCD or OpenQASM.
Implementation Notes
#322 adds the to_ir() implementation on the Observable class which delegates to _to_jaqcd or _to_openqasm depending on the specified IRType.
We need to implement the _to_openqasm methods for all the observables supported by the Braket SDK.
Note: #322 adds a reference implementation for IR generation for 2 observables:
which might be helpful to look at.
