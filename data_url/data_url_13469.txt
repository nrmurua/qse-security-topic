Right now, we have mitiq_cirq, mitiq_qiskit, and mitiq_pyquil as submodules for interfacing with the three supported "front-end" packages.
Soon, we will have mitiq_braket (#590), mitiq_pennylane, and potentially others. This starts to clutter the namespace.
Add mitiq.extensions where mitiq_qiskit etc. all live.
Please propose them below, or upvote proposal 1!
Proposal 1 is good for me.
Is this still open for discussion ? Just wanted to check before I start working on this.
@purva-thakre yes in the sense that we still need to decide when and how (mostly in terms of deprecation) to introduce this change.
@rmlarose Gotcha.

A couple of questions about this.
Yes to both!
A couple of questions about this.
Putting this as p0 because, as discussed @ Mitiq meeting, we want to have this for the next release after adding support for Braket.
As discussed in the last meeting, below are a few data points for us to consider when choosing the module name - specifically generally agreed upon definitions of some words as well what names are used by a few other projects - for us to discuss at today's meeting.
Pennylane uses "interfaces" for NumPy, PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow. What we call front-ends they tend to call types of Devices.
In AirlineQ, our front-ends are referred to as "compilation frameworks."
Tequila refers to them as "backends."
(computing) shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information.
(OOP) an abstract type that contains no data but defines behaviors as method signatures.
(PC Mag) The combining of...components so that they work together.
(computer science) a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs. These may include...classes...or type specifications.
