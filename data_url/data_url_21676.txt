The coreanalyzer tool exits with an error when run after an RTIO underflow was caused by an SPIMaster device (module artiq.coredevice.spi2).
Relevant device_db.py entry:
Is that only spi2 devices, or all devices?
If I cause the underflow using a TTLOut device, it doesn't occur. (TTLHandler.process_message doesn't try to access message.data like SPIMaster2Handler.process_message does)
PS: I'd guess that the required fix is to move this line into the if clause that follows it, but I don't know enough about the context to be certain.
Yes. Thanks for submitting and analyzing!
