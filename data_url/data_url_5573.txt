Runtime Primitives provide some error mitigation algorithms such as T-Rex, M3, and PEC with resilience_level.
It would be useful for testing and developing purposes if Aer primitives can simulate the results of error mitigation with noise model.
I think we can do it except for the PEC. I'll have to do some research on the PEC to find out the way.
(Because it is an approximate simulation without exposing the internal implementation.)
