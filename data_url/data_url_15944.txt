The u3 gate as defined in terms of gates in its docstring,
$U3(\theta, \phi, \lambda) = RZ(\phi) RX(-\pi/2) RZ(\theta) RX(\pi/2) RZ(\lambda)$
and in terms of a matrix
does not appear to be consistent up to a global phase. The code representation uses the matrix form, but i think the gatedef uses the underlying gate form.
Given the gate definition above, the relationship between the two is

I would suggest adding a note in the docstring about this for those who may get confused on the issue of phases and differences between the u and u3.
Appendix:

Thanks @zlatko-minev , agree this is a bug in the documentation. The OpenQASM 2.0 doc uses ~ to denote equality up to a global phase, so maybe we can re-use that here with a note explaining the expected difference in global phase between a U3 and it's implementation.
I think the documentation and the actual matrix definition in the code should be exactly equal.
For U this is correct:

For U3 this is correct:

i.e. U3 =  U multiplied by a global phase of exp(-(phi+lambda)/2)
@ajavadia , right, you are correct.
An enhancement for the beginner here could be to note that the sequence in the doc which states

does not equal the matrix rep given below in the docs:

but is instead only equal up to the global phase of  exp(-(phi+lambda)/2) as you say.
For instance, it is not clear to me now, if the to_matrix method would include or not the global phase. This may matter if using it to construct a control operator I think from the matrix algebra.
Hi, I've also run through this problem and have a few points to add:
I think that qiskit defines U3 and U as the same gate:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/265530145033bc31a92fc6989be1e5e20de92252/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/u.py#L98-L110
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/265530145033bc31a92fc6989be1e5e20de92252/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/u3.py#L98-L110
The blocks above are the same - UGate and U3Gate have the same array.
u3 = U also in QASM:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/98130dd6158d1f1474e44dd5aeacbc619174ad63/qiskit/qasm/libs/qelib1.inc#L6-L7
However, this is different from the definition in Qiskit/OpenQASM/examples/stdgates.inc:
gate u3(θ, φ, λ) q { gphase(-(φ+λ)/2); U(θ, φ, λ) q; }
I agree with @zlatko-minev's last comment. The global phase is important in the case of a controlled operator, so it should be clear what is the exact definition of U3.
Thank you, @jond01 , this is well shown in your post. I would hope they are consistent as well to minimize down-the-road bugs in someone's code.
This looks like it would be a simple fix. @ajavadia are we going to fix that for 0.20?
