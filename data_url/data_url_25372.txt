Acceptance Criteria
Will there be a separate method that queries Result.lattice.transport_graph directly?
I think that would be one way to do it? I was thinking of enhancing the API, so get_all_node_results can get the lattice and electron data it needs from the API instead of the DB. But maybe it's easier to get it from the in memory Result object?
Yes I vote for in memory syntax. The goal is for result object, once queried to contain all information presented by methods instead of making costlier http calls as at that point of post queried result space, the users work is scripting in Jupiter notebook for rapid analysis.
PS: we can backlog an issue to deal with large objects in our optimization releases.
