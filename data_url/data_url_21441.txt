Lists with more than one tuple element containing a mixture of 64-bit and 32-bit types arrive corrupted on the host.
Run this simple program.
Should print [(0, 1.0, 0), (1, 1.5, 2), (2, 1.9, 4)].
The program prints [(0, 1.0, 0), (1157660168, 2.7486801591331844e+24, 0), (1073217536, 2.12199579106e-313, 2)].
Based on my observations, I suspect that this issue is rooted in the compiler or firmware, but not in the host RPC code.
The issue here is that the alignment padding isn't skipped when advancing to the next array element.
