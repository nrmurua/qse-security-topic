Hi all,
I have detected and fixed following bugs to get the MPI version of HF gradient code to work.
2)https://github.com/merzlab/QUICK/blob/master/src/mpi_setup.f90#L160, https://github.com/merzlab/QUICK/blob/master/src/mpi_setup.f90#L161  The size of the arrays (6*nbasis) is incorrect. The arrays wonâ€™t be broadcasted.
Fix: Use the correct values
3)https://github.com/merzlab/QUICK/blob/master/src/shell.f90#L1811
quick_molspec%chg is not broadcasted. Therefore, slaves will assume zero values
In MPI version.
Fix: Broadcast quick_molspec%chg from mpi_setup.f90
4)https://github.com/merzlab/QUICK/blob/master/src/optimize.f90#L82
MPI geometry optimization would fail at L82 after the first iteration. This is because slave nodes do not have access to quick_method%iopt value.
Fix: Broadcast quick_method%iopt from mpi_setup.f90
With regards,
Madu
