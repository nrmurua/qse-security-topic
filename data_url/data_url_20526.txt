When I run OQS-master on my Ubuntu VM, make tests fails.  The failure (see attached log) seems to not be connected with any of our changes.  Eric did some checking and also encountered failures during make tests when running various commits even before our changes.  So probably not our problem.  This issue is to record the issue, discuss, and decide if we want to do anything about it.
make_tests.log
On Ubuntu 16.04, I get past the "sftp commands" tests, but get stuck on "forwarding.sh".
This also appears to be unrelated to Torben's changes. I get the same error on the real openssh-portable repo, with the HEAD of master branch.
Problem doesn't exist on some platforms (AmazonLinux, some Ubuntu) and even when it does occur seems to be unrelated to our changes.  Closing.
