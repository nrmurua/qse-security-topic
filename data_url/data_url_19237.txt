The problem presents when a qiskit circuit, composed of a rotation gate with an angle that is a fraction of pi, is converted in a qasm string and then loaded as a qibo circuit with the method Circuit.from_qasm().
The error raised is: "ValueError: Invalid value ['pi/2'] for gate parameters."
Here is a small script that reproduces the error:
The problem seems to be in the staticmethod "_parse_qasm(qasm_code: str)".
I'll open a pull request with a possible solution that worked for me.
