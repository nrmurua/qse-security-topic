Issues with references when allocating multi-dimensional array on core.
Sample code:
Both methods should do produce exactly the same behavior
This is the correct behavior. If you run your "broken" test_python_array method on the host Python, you will get the exact same result.
Fine. That seems like an inconsistent use of pass-by-reference/pass-by-value in the Python interpreter, though. Odd.
It is consistent (even if perhaps confusing) - you just have to know that the * operator on a list does a shallow copy of the element. Does the code below make it clearer?
