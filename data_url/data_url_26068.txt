qBraid/qbraid/transpiler/clbit.py line 22 uses property index of qiskit.circuit.classicalregister.Clbit. However, back-references to/from Bit instances to their containing registers have since been deprecated. Instead, one must inspect Registers to find their contained bits. Therefore, we must either add a qiskit Register argument to our Clbit class, or store the index of a qiskit Clbit as an integer, as we do for cirq and braket. Either way, any and all Clbit objects created throughout the transpiler must reflect this change.
