I tried to synthesize a 2-qubit identity gate (a 4x4 matrix with 1's on the diagonal), which should result in "nothing to be done". Unfortunately, BQSKit seem to crash on that input. It strikes me that this case should be easy to handle upfront, no need to go through the compilation flow and crash somewhere deep inside the code base.
Can you share your code?  Something else may be going on.
I did the following:
This runs without error and I get a circuit with 2 single qubit gates that is close to the identity.
Note that bqskit does not specifically check if the input is the identity or any other well-known unitary; any input will be numerically synthesized.
So it looks like there is a bug with optimization_level=3 where it crashes on the identity because it assumes a non-empty circuit.  As a workaround, try optimization_level=2.
The issue ended up being our circuit hashing algorithm not handling an empty circuit properly. This is fixed in the soon-to-be-released 1.0.4 update. Optimization level 3 should now synthesize the identity properly to an empty circuit.
@qcc4cp Thanks for the bug report, and your textbook is awesome! I am happy to discover that you are using BQSKit; please don't hesitate to reach out directly. We are happy to help with any further integration issues and would love your feedback.
