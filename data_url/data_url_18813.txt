I think the specification should touch on rounding of stretch/length with dt unit.
For example, how should compilers resolve stretch s in this case?
Should it raise an error (20dt cannot be divided by 3)?
(Another example)
I do not think this should be an issue. 20dt/3 will resolve to a floating type ultimately (once the value of dt is plugged in from the backend). I also think this would be an issue to raise for a compiler written for OpenQASM3, rather than in the specification itself...
