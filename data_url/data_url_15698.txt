If two classical registers have a non-empty intersection of clbits, it's possible to have InstructionSet.c_if resolve an integer index to a different value than the original QuantumCircuit would.
They should resolve to the same clbit, because they use the same index.
Instead of storing references to the classical registers in the instruction set, store a reference to the circuit, or a bound callable that came from the circuit to resolve the indices.
