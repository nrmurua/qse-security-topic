Many problems in verification of quantum systems utilise a certain fitter,
which typically scales poorly with the number of qubits. We have recently
explored ways of subsampling the measurements (and hence constraints in
the fitters). For testing non-locality, we can show bounds on the
one-sided error incurred by omitting, in the spirit of probably approximately
correct (PAC) learning.
We would like to add an implementation of such a subsampling fitter,
starting with testing non-locality and only subsampling the constraints
of the LP, rather than sampling the observable in a more intelligent
fashion. This could improve the scalability of verification in the "black box"
set-up, where we do not make any assumptions about the response of the
quantum system to a control signal.
