The following does not work on a machine without avx2 support:
Here's the output of lscpu:
This works as expected on an avx2-capable machine:
@maffoo, could you try this with 2 and 3 qubits and report the results? qsimcirq ought to be AVX/SSE agnostic, but it's possible that certain operations in the Python-to-C++ translation are specific to AVX.
I'm specifically suspicious of NormalToInternalOrder, which mangles the qubit order to better align with AVX/SSE. If it's not actually needed for SSE, what I expect to see with 2 or 3 qubits is that initial state affects the result (unlike above), but the effect is incorrect.
I see the same thing with 2 or 3 qubits:
Looks like the sse simulator also ignores integer initial states:
Ugh, I was inadvertently using an old version of qsim (0.6.0). Tried again with 0.9.2 and setting initial_state works as expected. Sorry for the false alarm! :-)
