The device is now retired.
Hi @nonhermitian I have submitted a draft pull request with this bug fixed  (#814 ). However this is my first pull request to qiskit and need some help with the final details (tests, log...). Could you lend me a hand? Thanks!
This issue should now be closed. Thanks for merging @nonhermitian
