Notice that, when a coupling map is provided, the output is:
transpile should apply the layout, even when there is no coupling map.
It's worse when the layout is to map the circuit to specific qubits which would be one of the main uses in many Ignis experiments. Eg the following does nothing
But what you would want it to do is something like this:
How that 5 (in range(5)) can be inferred from the first example? In #5346 Im taking the max in the layout. Is that reasonable?
