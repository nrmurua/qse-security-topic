Almost everything sphinx does is determined by docs/api.rst. If you change that file to only mention a single class, the docs build finishes in seconds with output for that class.
Corner cases:
We should also include the sphinx-quickstart-style Makefile in docs/ for familiarity with other python/sphinx projects
This is a duplicate of #2278  Closing that one as this has better details.
Did you close this by accident?
Duplicate of #2704 as well?
My comment (about adding Makefile) has been done
Oops good catch.
As devsite is coming, I'm going to close this.
