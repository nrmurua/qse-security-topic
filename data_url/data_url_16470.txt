Utility function assertResult in trantspiler/test_mappers.py uses global variable DIRNAME=QiskitTestCase._get_resource_path('qasm') to build qasm path and later append filenames to the path. This is will break if the location of the qasm files ever were to change.
Not a problem now, but will cause problems in the future.
Same as now.
Instead of using the global variable and building the path the assertResult function should use the Path.QASMS from test/utils.py and build the filepaths like so QiskitTestCase._get_resource_path(filename, Path.QASMS).
