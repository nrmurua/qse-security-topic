...A separate problem is that the decompositions look different because there is a kind o f "gimbal lock" for decomposing a CNOT gate - the specializations to TwoQubitControlledEquiv etc. were supposed to make decompositions unique, and I covered a lot of the special cases, but this shows I did miss one or two. In particular for this case it can decompose an XX-equivalent gate into:
which is unique unless lam1l==0 or (as in this case)  lam2l==0, at which point only the sum the1l+phi1r or the2l+phi2r will matter. I should make a PR to spot this case and pick a canonical representation.
