Right now we have separate error types for different components: MapperError, DAGCircuitError, QASMError, ExtensionError, TranspilerError, CouplingError. Why do we need these? Can't we make every error just be a QiskitError?
If there is truly a benefit, then we should be consistent. For example add a QobjError as well. But I don't think this is needed.
I'm closing this issue in favour of #601. Ali, if you don't mind, move the conversation there.
