Every other file works fine.
For example, double click qobj.py and this opens.

Double click random_objects.py and it freezes and does nothing. I can open it in other editors like vim but I think it should work with the python default editor.
When I try to open up with IDLE from command line I get this error.

Which leads me to think there's a character somewhere in the file that causes the crash. But I don't know where.
Well, what char is U+1d7d9?
Appears to be fancy 1

Not sure how it got in there. Perhaps as a comment?
I think the recommended way to include mathematical symbols is to use the :math: construct.
This is an example from piqs
As the comments get built into API docs, then it is good to be able to be include math symbols
In some comments (not the docstrings) in random_objects.py and metrics.py (that I can think of - possibly there are others), there are high-range unicode symbols used to make the mathematics clearer.  This couldn't be done with the :math: sphinx directive because it's about code comment readability.
I'll close this for now because it's very old, and really the "proper" solution is just to use a text editor that knows how to handle all text.
