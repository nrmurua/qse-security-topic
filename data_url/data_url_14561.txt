I used extended stabilizer simulator as my circuit has many qubits. But, I got this errors:
I got this same warning when used for the small circuits as well.
Actually, I don't know much about qiskit-terra. I saw it asks to report by opening an issue here and did.
It seems duplicated with #7033.
@rabeehic Can you provide an example value of qc that triggers the warning? The smaller, the better.
The extended_stabilizer simulator has the basis 'cx', 'cz', 'id', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'h', 's', 'sdg', 'sx', 'sxdg', 'swap', 'u0', 't', 'tdg', 'u1', 'p', 'ccx', 'ccz', 'delay', 'pauli' and the notion of efficient synthesis for this backend (roughly: minimize non-clifford gates) is different than for other hardware backends (minimize rabi pulses). Probably a different synthesis pass or cost function should be used for this backend. It's unclearto me  where the best place in the compiler that has the context to implement this logic.
Nevertheless I can't see how the first warning got issued and briefly playing around I wasn't able to reproduce it, so there appears to be an additional bug within this pass.
ping @rabeehic ?
