The source of this error is admittedly a little mysterious to me, but it's happened a couple times so I think it isn't my fault. I've been running batches of measurements online (GST) asynchronously over night, and I'll sometimes get an UnknownApiError. I've posted a snippet below.
The sleeping currently from HTTPErrors, when the system is Retuning, or when my jobs aren't done.
I've included the stacktrace, @ecp-rigetti.
I don't know how to work on this until we see an actual error, but I have now submitted a PR that fixes the ultimate (secondary) pyQuil error that prevents you from seeing the Forest error. Please let me know when you know what the Forest error turns out to be.
