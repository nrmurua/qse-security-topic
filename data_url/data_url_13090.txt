Scoping this issue before #1211 and #1208 is a bit premature, but suffice it to say, once some examples of the pieces needed to integrate QIR and Mitiq are completed, it should be more clear how to integrate the insight into Mitiq.
TBD, probably an RFC, maybe just samples somewhere.
This issue had no activity for 4 months, and will be closed in 2 weeks unless there is new activity. Cheers!
