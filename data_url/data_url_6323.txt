Recent benchmark experiments might indicate that new approximation techniques behoove QUnitMulti parallelism, by sometimes breaking simulations into quasi-similarly sized sub-units of entangled qubits. However, in the case of full entanglement, QUnitMulti effectively becomes a single-device simulation. By or before full entanglement, it makes sense to cross a threshold, from single-device QPager elements under a multi-device QUnitMulti, to a multi-device QPager (under a semi-auxiliary QUnitMulti, at that point).
Test and implement a switching threshold between optimal multi-device simulation modes.
This has already effectively been achieved. We can consider this completed.
