I looked around for this code but can't seem to find it.  Is it available online somewhere or do we need to get it from the authors?

Mcbits (and I suspect QCBits as well) seem to have a lot of dependencies on NaCL.  We could grab NaCL at compile time and build it or try to include the common parts of it that we need.
I think that requiring it as a dependency when compiling with McBits and QcBit is probably reasonable?
Yeah, that seems fine, we don't need to put everything into our repository.
See #67 for mcbits.
McBits added via #67.  Not adding QcBits at present due to security concerns.
