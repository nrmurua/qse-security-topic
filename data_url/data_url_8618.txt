I am trying to use heterodyne simulation using built in milstein solver. It gives me error.
Looking at the code it seems that internally milstein solver is converting heterodyne problem into two homodyne problems. Which is fine. But not quite implemented correctly. Can you please update me on this? I will be willing to provide a patch.
Thanks for the bug report and your interest! Can you give an example which demonstrates the error? Then it would be easier to identify what might be wrong and how it should be fixed.
