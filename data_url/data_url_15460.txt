example:
circuit.decompose().decompose().decompose().decompose().decompose()    
can be something like:
why:
I found it useful when decompose initialize state, and see how gate change each decompose
This seems both easy to implement and a simple shorthand for people.  In general, decompose isn't the best way of translating between basis gates (the BasisTranslator transpiler pass is our preferrred method now), but I do know people still use decompose as a quick check.
I'd be happy to accept a PR on this that adds reps as the keyword argument in QuantumCircuit.decompose - it just needs to loop over the call to the Decomposer pass that many times.
Very good idea. I would love to use this feature.
Hello, if it's still open, I would like to work on this
@dryicecube Thank you! But it looks like @poig has created a PR #8142 for this issue. You can find other first good issue to contribute https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22 Let us know if you need help.
@poig Have you submitted additional PR to address repeat gates_to_decompose in your to-do list? If so, can we consider this issue to be fixed?

haven't started the PR, but I will keep the idea for others or start the PR when I have a good solution.
I explained in the other PR - I don't see a need for any modification to gates_to_decompose here, and I think adding it would confuse the interface of a generally simple function. I'll close the re-opened part of this issue (as it's effectively a feature request) as "won't fix", but thanks for the initial PR!
