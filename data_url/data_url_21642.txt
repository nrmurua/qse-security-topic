Zotino driver overflows silently.
The Zotino driver overflows silently. This can lead to vastly incorrect voltages being applied without warning to the user. In combination with #1443, this causes silent, incorrect behaviour inside the +-10 V Zotino range.
In an experiment, write a voltage close to +10 V to Zotino.
This results in incorrect voltages and no warnings/errors
A ValueError should be raied on over/underflow.
