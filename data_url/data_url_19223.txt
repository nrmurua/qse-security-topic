By installing both qibo and qibojit from master and running pytest -x tests/, we get
@stavros11 @BrunoLiegiBastonLiegi could you please have a look?
Have you reinstalled qibo from master with poetry? Because I think that if you install qibojit with poetry, it will downgrade qibo to 0.2.0 version, thus, the tests will fail.
This is probably related to https://github.com/qiboteam/qibojit/blob/0519c0e2273563d6439583fdca8d3010acb5dd19/src/qibojit/backends/gpu.py#L324. Qibojit needs to be updated for the new result objects. I also get several other failures for cupy though.
@BrunoLiegiBastonLiegi could you please have a look with @stavros11?
Yes, I think @stavros11 is right, I need to update the qibojit backend to accomodate for the new outcomes object, as I did for qibolab. I forgot about that, sorry.
