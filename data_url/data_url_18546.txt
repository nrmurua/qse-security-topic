The Gitlab CI YAML file .gitlab-ci.yml is meant to work just like its counterpart on Github, the CI YAML file .github/workflows/test.yml, but the two files are out of sync. Evidently, the Gitlab YAML file has not been in used lately for the official repo (https://github.com/quil-lang/quilc), which is on Github.  My organization has use for it on a private Gitlab server mirroring the official repo, so we'd like to get this working and in sync with its counterpart.
PR #782 resolved this, therefore closing.
