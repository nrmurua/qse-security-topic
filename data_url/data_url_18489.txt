One idea for a compiler hinting is to understand what qubit states are considered to have short vs long relaxation time, and to judiciously put NOTs into the program to try to keep the overall state in a long relaxation subspace. There are some arXiv papers about this.
This seems super hard to do automatically and is more in the domain of a responsible algorithm author, but maybe it is easy to do small bits/easy cases of it. It's an idea for a rainy day.
