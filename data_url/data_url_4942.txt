When the number of amplitudes in the lists submitted to the initialisation function initStateFromAmps becomes too long (>24 qubits for QuEST_PREC=2 or >25 for QuEST_PREC=1) the programme crashes with the error message "segmentation fault". It would be helpful to have a warning in the documentation for this or generate an error message when the number of amplitudes exceeds the supported number.
Hi Natalie!
I cannot reproduce this on the current version of QuEST. Building the following with QuEST_PREC=2
gives me the output
Can you post a minimal example to reproduce your issue?
