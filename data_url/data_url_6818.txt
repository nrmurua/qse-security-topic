This is a bug in Firefox, not Quirk but you may want to track the issue here.  The horizontal qubit and measurement wires in the circuit diagram display are rendered as slight zig-zag lines instead of continuous, perfectly horizontal lines.
See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1847681 for more details.  At minimum this affects Firefox versions 115 through 116 (and 118 nightly) but it does not affect 109 (or earlier).
Quick-and-dirty fix that corrects the visual issue but breaks all other browsers (and the sampling gate icons):
src/draw/Painter.js:451
Thanks for reporting this to Mozilla. I will sit back and watch.
