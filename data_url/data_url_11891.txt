Note: paulis[idy][0] is a tuple.
You need to  trigger the _simplify_paulis() method  to trigger the bug, which is not easy.
To reproduce the bug, you can replace the get_maxcut_qubitops() method in maxcut.py as the following. The replacement does not make any logical sense but will help trigger the bug.
seems like pauli_list's elements should be lists [coef, Pauli] as opposed to tuples (coef, Pauli).
Yes, just generate pauli_list as list of lists [coef, Pauli] and everything should be fine.
yes, the exception is gone after replacing the Pauli element from tuple to list.
