Thanks for opening - note, we switched to a monorepo structure:
./setup.py - defines the cirq metapackage, which is an empty package that defines the dependency list for all the cirq modules
./cirq-core/setup.py - cirq core
./cirq-pasqal/setup.py - cirq-pasqal
...
etc.
You have to decide which one do you want to install.
xref #4261
Please note that the GitHub tarball for 0.11.1 doesn't contain cirq-pasqal, cirq-ionq, etc.
@yurivict, yes because it was a patch release on top of 0.11.0 which only had cirq-google and cirq-core. We cherry-picked a single commit to fix the JSON serialization backwards compatibility issue with cirq.TrialResult. The extraction of cirq-pasqal, ionq, etc. were done after 0.11.0 on the master branch which we will cut for the 0.12.0 release in a couple of weeks.
Ok, thanks!
