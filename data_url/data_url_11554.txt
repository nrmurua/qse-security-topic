When we run a vqe/qaoa algorithm on a real quantum device assigned to a private hub, we cannot check the time_taken of the jobs on qiskit. The result object can be viewed once and since the results are pulled at the end of each iteration of vqe/qaoa, so we can no longer access to this information. Is it possible to add the time_taken like metadata in the job(job.time_taken) and/or also the global time_taken for these jobs?
See #1243
Is this resolved? @AzizNgoueya  can you close the issue if not needed anymore?
