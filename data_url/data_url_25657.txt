Acceptance criteria is for codecov to report 80% coverage
First step is to identify which modules to target for code cleanup or additional testing and document them in issues here.
Need to check with @wjcunningham7 on the status of functional tests, if we want them to run on PRs and be included in codecov, or if we want to prioritize nightly builds.
