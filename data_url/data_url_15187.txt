Using the PadDynamicalDecoupling pass:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/locale/bn_BN/stubs/qiskit.transpiler.passes.PadDynamicalDecoupling.html
Does not work with dynamic circuits (meaning they have if/else statements).
Returns the following error:
I tried to add durations.update([("if_else", None, 0)]) (e.g.):
in order to update the durations property so that the passmanger would work. This did not work, it resulted in a different error:
No errors
No response
Hello, please use the new Qiskit ibm provider provider as discussed here. Regarding, dynamical decoupling support for it and dynamic circuits is limited please see this entry in the FAQ and this documentation. In general, Qiskit's dynamical decoupling baked into its core do not work 100% correctly with all backend behaviors and the passes highlighted here are better for IBM's dynamic circuit devices (although do not work with the timeline drawer currently).
In particular, we are still awaiting the completion of this issue. I am closing this in favor of the above issue.
Ok yes this makes sense; with the new provider module, the error qiskit.transpiler.exceptions.TranspilerError: 'Conditional instruction if_else is not supported in ALAP scheduler.' gets thrown, instead of the first error I was encountering:
returns:
Great, I will be adding support over the holidays to the new pass.
