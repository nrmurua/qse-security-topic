We get asked this quite a lot in meetings and is also helpful for my own workflows everytime I update my container with the new image.
@zohimchandani We have added configuration files to the image such that you are prompted to install the VS Code extensions for notebook development. If you accept to install the extensions, you should not need to install anything else to develop/use notebooks from VS Code. I'll close this as done - please re-open the issue if anything is unclear or requires additional steps that are not covered by the Getting Started page.
