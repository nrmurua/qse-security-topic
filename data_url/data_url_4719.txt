I may be missing something, but when trying to add LossChannels to the layer in the quantum_neural_network.py, the output of the layer is None
Expected behavior: Output shouldn't be None
Reproduces how often: 100%
System information:
Hi @jonasbrami, the quantum_neural_network.py tutorial is tailored towards using pure states. Adding loss channels to the circuit might (and in most cases does) result in mixed quantum states. Strawberry Fields keeps track of the purity of the state internally and the state.ket method returns None for mixed states. To adjust the tutorial for using loss channels, the code would likely need to be altered to use state.dm (which returns the state in the density matrix formalism).
I'll remove the bug label, but let us know if you have any related questions. ðŸ™‚
Thanks a lot for the explanation :)
