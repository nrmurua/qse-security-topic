Currently, the test coverage of the drawers is very uneven.
Therefore, a meta test to cover the most relevant cases is needed.
There were attempts in the pass to write such a test (see  #1617) but they resulted too dependant on the environment (see #1780). In the meanwhile, the structure for a meta test was introduced for mappers (see and https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/test/python/transpiler/test_mappers.py) and following that structure would be ideal.
Hey there! I'm interested in fixing this. Any pointers or preferences on how you'd like for it to be implemented? (other than the links already mentioned)
Alright, will look into other issues then for the time being. Thank you for the information!
on hold until #2968 is decided.
Closing this issue, since after #4544 we are moving the mpl circuit drawer to binder and text still on the regular tests. Probably latex should be moved to the mpl circuit drawer test too.
