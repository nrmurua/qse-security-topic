Excuse me. Is there any way to get the computation time on real backends? It seems that the field with this information in the Result class was in some of the previous versions of qiskit.
The runtime may not be exactly what you expect (refer here: https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/3901/comparing-run-times-on-ibm-quantum-experience/3912#3912)
But I think we can reintroduce it.
I think this is being worked on separately on the backend. I'm closing it here as it is not related to Terra, but I think it will be introduced in a new version of the IBMQ API.
