Currently it is not possible to use the .draw() method on a circuit that contains a gates.Unitary gate. I think it would be useful to have this feature in Qibo, and I guess it is not difficult to implement.  I encountered this issue while working on a current project. The typical use for me of the .draw()  method is to make sure that the circuit I'm building is the desired one.
So here is a small code to reproduce the issue:
which gives
NotImplementedError: Unitary gate is not supported by circuit.draw
I would propose that we could draw something like:
