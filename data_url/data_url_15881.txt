Building on #6646, if I use a 7-qubit mock Casablanca system with Q3 disabled so that it is now two 3Q cmaps then I cannot target the first sub-graph [0,1,2], only [4,5,6] works:
gives
TranspilerError: 'The initial_layout parameter refers to faulty or disconnected qubits'
It looks like the route selects the largest and last sub-graph to use and raises for others.  This is not intuative nor makes any sense as the qubits in the other sub-graph are operational.
I think the underlying issue is that the some of the transpiler passes were checking for a fully connected coupling map and would error if it wasn't. That restriction should be finally relaxed with #9840. If that wasn't the issue (I don't know what FakeCasaQ3 is so I can't test) then I expect it's related to the faulty qubits code in transpile() which I've proposed removing in #9900.
