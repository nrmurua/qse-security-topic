Description of the issue
We produce an ugly warning that cirq_google is missing if the user only installs cirq-core.
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
v0.11
This is now a problem with aqt and ionq
Ideas:
Don't print the full exception, which is long and says its an Error when it's actually a warning. I was legitimately surprised to see that import cirq had actually succeeded since I saw so many exceptions in red text
Upon import error, define the subpackages to a shim class that will throw a meaningful exception when you try to use it
