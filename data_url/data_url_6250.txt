When I call qiskit.providers.aer.noise.device.basic_device_noise_model with thermal_relaxation=False, UnboundLocalError occurs.
It is because relax_params is defined only when thermal_relaxation=True.
See https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/qiskit/providers/aer/noise/device/models.py#L158
Run the following code.
Get the following output.
No error occurs.
Initialize relax_params.
See #52
