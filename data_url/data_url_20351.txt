The source code for kem_newhopenist comes from https://www.newhopecrypto.org/software.shtml.  We would want to add the reference and AVX2 implementations of NewHopeNIST 512-CCA and 1024-CCA (the AVX2 implementation is in the Additional_Implementations directory).  Note that the optimized implementation in that ZIP file is just a copy of the reference implementation.
