I've currently got lots of copy paste code from Stabilizer in network_users, telemetry  and shared (that I will also still cleanup ofc).
Should I just adapt it to fit Thermostat incl. comments/docstrings? Or should this be broken out into a crate?

My impression is that some of the network_users stuff and shared could potentially move to smoltcp-nal. The telemetry stuff looks compact and to some extend custom already.
Yeah, I would personally like to move shared into the embedded-nal. NetworkUsers could potentially move to the NAL, but I'll need to think about it further
