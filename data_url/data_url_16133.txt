Jupyter kernel dies while importing qiskit.
Installing qiskit in a jupyter cell by doing the following:

The kernel appears to have died. It will restart automatically.
Can you provide more details such as how you are setting up your venv or whether you are using pip or conda.

I think there was an issue in updating qiskit. I had to uninstall all the libraries in a conda env and then make a new one.
Otherwise, I had a dedicated conda environment for qiskit with python 3.6 and numpy when I had this issue. The qiskit upgrades were made through pip, and the rest via conda.
