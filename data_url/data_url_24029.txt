Inspired by @srjmas:
Ability to execute qiskit metal on one machine and delegate the simulation to another machine (for example running metal on linux and communicating with windows for the Ansys runs)
Lab and academy work is often on personal machines using any type of OS. Often the Analysis tools are centralized on a server with remote access. However the design is not done on these servers, but on the local machines. Only rely on those remote machines for brief lapses of time.
Also: having access to a simulation farm in the cloud. For 3$ per hour, you can access a machine that will outperform everything you can practically reach in the university, enabling full simulations of complicated designs.
I would also strong support this feature request!!!!
