In the NPA hierarchy (npa_hierarchy.py) the code is explicitly imposing no-signaling and normalization, but these constraints are redundant on levels 1+AB and higher. They only cause numerical instability and should be removed.
As a point of comparison, this same bug was present in the QETLAB implementation of the NPA hierarchy but was fixed in PR-24 by Mateus Ara√∫jo.
In order to fix this bug in toqito, we need to follow the same type of approach as was carried out in the QETLAB solution, namely, remove the non-signaling and normalization.
Thanks as well go to Mateus for pointing this bug out in toqito as well.
