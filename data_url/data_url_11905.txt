Steps 2 and 5 in section 2B are not properly integrated with MathJax and LaTeX and display incorrectly. Most likely a simple typo.
Hi, thanks for your interest and apologies for the slow response. This tutorial was removed from our codebase and replaced with educational content in our textbook, which as far as I can see, does not contain the same bug, so I will go ahead and close this issue.
Thanks anyway for your feedback and helping us make Qiskit better! ðŸš€
