I had a lot of fun going through the escape room challeges, and I see that you're working on several more sets of escape rooms! I wish there was a Mesecons/Lua tutorial like qiskitblocks. I hope this project keeps being developed and improved. I look forward to updating it.
I'm working on level II right now, it's good! Quite a challenge.
