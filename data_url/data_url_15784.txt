In the providers documentation page, some documentation redirects seem to be broken.
Hover with the mouse over the class names - at some places, they don't lead to the documentation.
All references linked to docs.
Thanks for this - QuantumCircuit and the gates definitely should link to their respective pages.  This is likely not the only page of the documentation with bust links - it's easy enough to forget to put in the linking markup by mistake.  Best thing to do is just report it when you see it, as you have done, and we can fix it.
The BackendV2 and V34 aren't real classes - they're just being used as examples for how the deprecation policy would apply if they were to exist, so there's nothing to link on those particular two.
