Wrong noise model at compilation  for RB Sequence with T1,T2 Errors
in the " Run an RB Sequence with T1,T2 Errors" section:
run cell with code:
job = qiskit.execute(rb_circ_transpile, noise_model=noise_model, shots=shots, backend=backend, backend_options={'max_parallel_experiments': 0})
Obtain a  RBFitter object corresponding to noise_model2
replace code by:
job = qiskit.execute(rb_circ_transpile, noise_model=noise_model2, shots=shots, backend=backend, max_parallel_experiments=0)
This will in addition eliminate the warning:
:10: DeprecationWarning: Using backend_options kwarg has been deprecated as of qiskit-aer 0.7.0 and will be removed no earlier than 3 months from that release date. Runtime backend options should now be added directly using kwargs for each option.
Further in the notebook I see also:
gates_per_cliff = rb.rb_utils.gates_per_clifford(transpile_list2,xdata[0],basis_gates,rb_opts2['rb_pattern'][0])
Isn't:  ,xdata2[0] instead of ,xdata[0]_ ?
Pardon that this didn't get more attention sooner. The noise tutorials no longer live in this repository so I'll close this as stale.
