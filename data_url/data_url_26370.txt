While libint is fast and actively maintained there are a couple of drawbacks:
An alternative to libint would be https://github.com/sunqm/libcint (respectively https://github.com/sunqm/qcint with the optimized intrinsics for x86_64).
Even though there is an interface in CP2K, it is not as generic as it should be, meaning that the calls to it are still tailored to libint, so what should be done is to move the libint-specific glue code further down and then write a second set of glue code for libcint.
The huge binary footprint is also accompanied by excessive build times. Unfortunately, the problem seems to be low priority for the libint developer. So, it would indeed be great to have an alternative available.
This could also be an opportunity to move some of the work related to integrals (packing/unpacking) onto the GPU.
