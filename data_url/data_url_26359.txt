When trying to use the restart file written by CP2K for a simulation with the following EXT_RESTART part AND a &PERIODIC_EFIELD:
CP2K immediately crashes with:
The culprit is the internal generation of the REAL_TIME_PROPAGATION section in case &EXT_RESTART is used and RESTART_RTP is not explicitly set the .FALSE.
This then triggers the assertion which checks that RTP and the periodic efield are not enabled at the same time.
The user can salvage the restart file by explicitly setting RESTART_RTP .FALSE..
