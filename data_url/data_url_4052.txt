After Hardware Resources-aware Parallelization in the Low-level Scheduler, Triggers on different Channels can Happen at the Same Time but not Necessary with the Same Duration, Successive Trigger Instructions without 'wait' in between are Not Handled Properly by the CBox Execution Unit. To fix this Issue, Triggers need to be Merged (and Split when they have Different Duration) with Proper 'wait' Insertion.
Concurrent Triggers Merging and Splitting Support is Implemented in the CBox Backend in Commit 921c9d0
The New Feature is under Test... This Issue will be Closed Once all Tests are Successful.
Tested on the Scope and Working.
