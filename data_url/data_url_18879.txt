Need to add input/output types for OpenQASM programs into the spec. See pp. 22, 23, 24 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14722.pdf. VQE example should be updated (or a new one added to compare).
@karalekas volunteered to write this into the spec.
There's also an issue to resolve in the examples which sometimes use 'input' and 'output' as variable names.
Closing via #225.
