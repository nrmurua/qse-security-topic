I am a bit unsure about what hamiltonian batching is doing behind the scenes.
Let us work through an example:
So I would like to measure terms like Z0, Z1 ... which only requires the statevector to be built once and all the qubits measured in the Z basis. Moreover, the 15 qubit circuit can also fit on a single GPU. However, becuase we call via  execution=cudaq.parallel.thread, all GPU resources are activated which is inefficient for this example.
My question is if this workflow is doing any optimisation at the compiler level to figure out how to optimally distribute the H terms across the GPUs?
Thanks.
