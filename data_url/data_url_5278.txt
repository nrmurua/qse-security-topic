Dear,
I wanted to test on intel-qs a script I wrote using Qiskit, but I could not find an implementation of a multi-cx gate.
I believe I could just build the mct myself, but it will be simpler if it is part of the library. Like in Qiskit, just passing the indexes of control-qubits, the target qubit and ancilla qubits (depending on how the MCT is developed).
Can I contribute somehow?
