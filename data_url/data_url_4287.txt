Currently, the dependencies in the Qibo ecosystem are the following:
But then the users will need a separate installation of all the various tools, even just to run circuits.
Moreover, we usually leave to the user the burden of installing dependencies for the backends (including TensorFlow and NumPy). I will open a separate issue for that.
A better organization could be the following:
Indeed, the user will often interact just with qibo (as frontend), or qibocal, for different tasks. Everything else is just going to implement backends.
In particular, qibo.core will only contain the current qibo.backends and qibo.gates, since they are the building blocks used by the backends.
