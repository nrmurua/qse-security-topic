Summarize the task
With broader changes to devices (#4744) and optimizers/trasnformers (#4722), vendors might need to update device decomposition to use the newest transformer APIs. At first glance it looks like:
cirq-ionq has their own devices and should be in a good position to consolidate any missing device info into the metadata fields as well as adapt decompose_to_device into a proper transformer.
