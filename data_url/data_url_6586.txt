The version string in setup.py is currently '0.0.1',

but pypi thinks the latest version is '0.0.2'
https://pypi.org/project/qsimcirq/0.0.2/
Also, it would be useful for qsimcirq to have a version attribute __version__ for programatic access. This does not currently work...
While this issue is raised, we should also add a doc for how to perform the release process - including permissions required and any extra tests above and beyond the CI suite that should be run.
@iamvamsikrishnad, could you look into this? If I understand correctly, getting the versions to match will require a new release (i.e. v0.0.3).
Another tangentially related issue is that qsim is currently locked to version 0.6 of cirq, but AFAICT everything works just fine with the latest 0.7 cirq.

I created a seperate issue for the doc.
These are now consistent at 0.0.2 - further work is tracked in #59.
