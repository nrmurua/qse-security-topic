Pulled the latest repo to retrace these steps. The networkx rendering works, but I get the following error message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/quax/projects/quantum-fog/graphs/BayesNet.py", line 158, in
bnet.write_dot(path1)
File "/home/quax/projects/quantum-fog/graphs/Graph.py", line 258, in write_dot
nx.write_dot(self.get_nx_graph(), path)
AttributeError: module 'networkx' has no attribute 'write_dot'
The networkx write_dot issue seems to be related to this: nipy/nipype#1350
Errors disappear when referencing nx.nx_pydot instead of nx.
Will push the changes to the master.
No longer have this issue after a new Anaconda installation with a mint QFog environment.
