I was trying to make circuits with only JJ ands capacitances using the Custom circuit.  As there is no harmonic basis in that case i used the discretized version but i couldn't get the eigenvalues of the circuit.
To minimize misunderstandings, please state briefly what you expected to happen.
$\displaystyle 4.0 EC Q_{1}^{2} + - EJ \cos{\left(θ_{1} \right)}$
$\displaystyle 4.0 EC Q_{1}^{2} + - EJ \cos{\left(θ_{1} \right)}$
The second circuit gives me am error as :
Any additional information you would like to provide to aid us.
I tried adding a spurious inductance of very low energy for example as :
but this creates two issues. it adds a flux and also the frequencies do not match even as the added term to the hamiltonian at zero flux becomes negligible.
Thanks for posting this!
For part 1: The default for circuits without linear inductances is charge basis. @saipavanc Is discretization even expected to work in that case? If not, then we should issue an exception
For part 2: are you saying you are inductively shunting a Cooper pair box / transmon? The L -> \infty [in the original post this read: L->0, which was an error] limit is highly singular and should not yield the CPB/transmon spectrum, see https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.217004. If I am misunderstanding your point, please follow up with some more clarification.
For part 2: I meant that i added a negligible inductive energy and not a negligible inductance.
(sorry for the wrong manipulation with the issue closing)
For part 2: my bad, I meant to write L -> \infty and went wrong. It is the L-> \infty limit that is discussed in the paper I quoted. As I said, the limit is singular (you cannot go continuously from L2-integrability boundary conditions to periodic boundary conditions), and the spectrum will not converge to that of a CPB/transmon.
@MFMFMFMFMF I have a few questions about the following input file that you have written.
Here, you are setting EC, which is the capacitance energy, to zero. But, this would imply that the capacitance is basically set to infinity, and no matter how big or small a capacitor you add in parallel, it would only give you infinite capacitance. Thus, there is not kinetic energy term in the resultant Hamiltonian. This is what is causing trouble, as one of the strings which corresponds to the kinetic energy is rendered to be an empty string, which should not cause any trouble as such and I will fix it in the very next commit.
But, I am guessing that this is not what you were trying to do. If you want to set the capacitance in the junction to be zero, then you should set its capacitance energy to a very high value,  like in this input file.
And the above code gives me results as I would expect. Let me know if this is what you were trying to do. Also, we have updated scqubits to a new version 3.0.3 which changes the way symbolic expressions are printed. I recommend that you upgrade to the latest release.
Regarding the parameter ext_basis, as @jkochNU was referring to, the parameter is used to set the basis for the extended variables in the Circuit. Since, there are no extended variables in transmon that setting would not affect any of the numerical calculations.
yes perfect thank you so much for your answer
