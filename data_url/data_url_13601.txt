Currently the readme just mentions the PyPI installation.  Adding information on the development version installation may be helpful. Since the "installation" part of the documentation is just the one imported from the readme, this would be reflected also in the documentation. We could simply add a link to https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html#development-install.
Closing this as Developer information links to CONTRIBUTING.md which includes development installation instructions.
@nathanshammah reopen if you think we should do more.
