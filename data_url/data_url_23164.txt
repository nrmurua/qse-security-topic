After out discussion this morning, maybe we can continue to find the best setting for the scope. Imho:
By no means, an API user should want to use the continuous mode of the scope.
Same for Specan or NA:
Maybe this need to be explained in an explicit way, but in my opinion this is what one naturally wants
I am not a big fan of reintroducing some backward coupling between the widgets and the internal functioning of the instruments. I am afraid that you will end-up with highly unpredictable behaviors where depending on the visibility of the widget your instrument behaves differently and in the end a debugging nightmare... All this for an extremely small benefit (basically that at the first startup, the user doesn't need to press run continuous if he wants to have the scope running continuously). I would prefer a warning in case the gui is not open and an instrument is set to run continuously.
Regarding a "single acquisition"  that actually launches a predefined number of averages, that makes sense.
OK, I think we need to uniformize the interface of the 3 acquisition instruments following your suggestions:
The difference between asynchronous acquisition and blocking acquisition should be clearer.
I see 2 possibilities:
I tend to favor the second option. A tentative API would be:
"""
I believe it is not crazy to use this API even in non-GUI mode, so it's only behind the signals that I would detect if the widget is visible or hidden to prevent unnecessary display of curves  (If we want to go for this optimization, we need to make sure the curve is updated once the widget becomes visible again).
I am moving the proposal towards the wiki page -->https://github.com/lneuhaus/pyrpl/wiki/API-for-acquisition-modules
this discussion is out-dated w.r.t. new scope API. Usage of that one will show if new issues arise.
