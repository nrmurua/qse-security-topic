I agree there is duplication in this PR, but does it seem more consistent to keep complex within singleDesignatorType and to use designator rather than numericType within classicalArgument/classicalType?
The only complex example that I found in the OpenQASM3 paper is like:
Using the example, 'complex' LBRACKET numericType RBRACKET is the correct syntax.
If we keep complex within singleDesignatorType, it will match to complex[24] but I did not find any example in the paper.
I see. I was not aware that we had settled on supporting type designators of the complex type other than float (nor am I a fan of this as I believe it is overkill for almost all anticipated use cases). After reviewing the latter discussion of #175 I agree your proposal is correct for the agreed-upon syntax within the original PR. I will put forward a fix.
