Hi,
I cannot find any doc (except the source code itself) about which progress bar are available and how to use them. Especially, the only references to the progress bar in the doc are the options for mesolve etc.
I think it could be really useful to document it, or provide an iPython notebook making use of it.
EDIT: Plus the docstring of mesolve function (for instance) seems to contradict the first lines of the function:

Hi, thanks for raising this. I have raised an issue in the docs repo for the documentation gap. So I guess in this issue we will focus on the possible contradiction. There are others who know this solver better than me, so I will wait to see if they comment before I investigate further.
It's not completely contradictory: if you provide an instance of BaseProgressBar, it'll work. And the argument is optional. Just that on top of that, you can just say True to avoid instanciating yourself the progress object, and this is not documented.
Anyway, I'm just noticing, I don't know the code neither. ;)
@ajgpitch Maybe I should close this issue and move the discussion to the linked issue in the doc repo?
