In some cases it can be really annoying having to use 2 different algorithms for Encryption and Signatures. For example, I have to use GLYPH for signatures (which has 2KB public key sizes, which is okay compared to other PQC algorithms, but can still be inconvenient compared to traditional ECC or even SIDH/SIKE) and SIKE for encryption. Implementing both a good encryption scheme and a signature scheme that can use the same algorithm can be very useful, especially in decentralized systems like Tox and Bitcoin. This whitepaper discusses a possible implementation.
Unfortunately, isogeny-based signatures are still far from practical. So, for the moment, the SIDH library will only support KEX and KEM schemes.
Bummer having something like:
Y. Yoo et al. “A post-quantum digital signature scheme based on supersingular isogenies”.
In: International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security.
Springer. 2017, pp. 163–181.
directly in this library, uptodate and supported on windows/MS Visual Studio would be cool.
