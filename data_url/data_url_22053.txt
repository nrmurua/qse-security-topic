It would be useful to have some method that allows an experiment to check if termination has been requested, cf. the current check_pause() which checks if termination has been requested or if there is a higher priority experiment.
This would be used for experiments which should not be paused, but which need graceful termination. An example is a loading experiment, where graceful termination is used to turn ovens off, but where the experiment should not be interrupted.
