Description
class QuadraticModel defines the summation range for quadratic coefficients as :math:\sum_{i<j} b_{i, j} x_i x_j, and that is accurate for binary variables but quadratic models allow self loops for int variables, so it seems to me the summation for QMs should be :math:\sum_{i \le j} b_{i, j} x_i x_j
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
Update definition as needed.

Feel free to make the change. Probably just going to <= and adding a note that self-loops for binary and spin variables are not allowed.
