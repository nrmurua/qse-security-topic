According to pep8 comparisons should be

I'm not 100% sure whether changing the comparisons will break anything so I left it untouched for now. If you have pep8 installed you can check for this error with

i dont see any problem with changing to
if Object is None:
i tested in a few places and it seems fine, and since it is the preferred way of writing it i guess we should change these.
tl;dr We should go ahead and change it according to PEP8
I vaguely remembered that
and
do something different. According to post on stackoverflow "==" tests for value equality, while "is" checks for whether the variables point to the same thing. Since "None" is a singleton the two are the same (except for some oddball cases).
The post about the oddball case also seems to suggest that "is" is faster. Anyway, it's a) safe to change and b) recommended, so we should do that.
I agree, with strings it's different but for None it is identical but should be changed to comply with pep8. I'm make a global substitute:
sed -i 's/== None/is None/g' *.py
sed -i 's/!= None/is not None/g' *.py
and submit shortly.
FYI there is also autopep8 to fix pep8 issues in a batch way
Thanks, that's good to know!
