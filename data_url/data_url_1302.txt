Description of the issue
When running pytest in the Cirq repo (or check/pytest), the tests in dev_tools/bash_scripts_test.py run a series of git commands and compares the output against expected values. A few of the tests will fail with very confusing errors if the user has configured init.templateDir in their global ~/.gitconfig file.  The reason is that the command
will generate a "warning: re-init ignored" message, and that in turn causes the tests in bash_scripts_test.py to fail because the tests rely on matching exactly the stdout/stderr from the commands.
How to reproduce the issue
The result will be a bunch of output ending in a failure. The full output is below.
Cirq version
0.16.0.dev
