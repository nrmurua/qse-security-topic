Right now the ApproximateTokenSwapper class https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/transpiler/passes/routing/algorithms/token_swapper.py is currently built using a combination of retworkx and networkx graphs. However, the networkx usage shouldn't be necessary anymore as retworkx has all the required features and should be significantly faster. We should migrate the remaining networkx usage to use retworkx instead.
Additionally, the token swapper is the last place in terra that is using networkx, except for a few conversion methods in qiskit.dagcircuit. So in the PR that does the migration we can make networkx an optional dependency and remove it from the requirements list and switch the converter methods to use runtime imports inside the methods. Besides reducing the number of dependencies this should have an improvement in import time (see: #5100 )
