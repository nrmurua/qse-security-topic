Convert each function in qBraid/tests/transpiler/test_transpiler.py into a unit-test using pytest. Break down existing test functions according to a testing scheme that isolates and tests each component of the transpiler separately, and in its own file. The number of total tests and breadth of individual tests should be optimized towards maximal coverage with minimal redundancy.
