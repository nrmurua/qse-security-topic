This issue might also exist in compressed versions of SIDH — I'm not sure what the expected failure rate is.
A seed that triggers differing shared secrets in SIDH-p434-compressed is 1D4195F28F6203603A329870DADAB52B2CFEB187F25B63DD8C101315BD9460066BCD4CE87557475D7C92367FC57F273A
@patricklonga, can you look into this?
Thanks for reporting this, Thom. We are indeed looking into this.
This issue was solved in a recent PR. Thanks for notifying this, @thomwiggers.
