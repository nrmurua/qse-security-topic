Readthedocs.io for Cirq was a great start and served us well, but it has limitations and also is a standalone site for Cirq. We need a new site that fits nicely into the rest of the Quantum AI OSS efforts: OpenFermion, ReCirq, qsim, Tensorflow Quantum. The QPolish project is intended to deliver in 2020 a complete revamp of the documentation and to roll out a new website to unify our OSS presence on the web.
