Currently, we only check for matching NIST KAT test vectors for KEMs and use our own test vectors for signatures.
While this is useful to validate that both the NIST signature API and the detached signature API work on all platforms, I think we should still check the NIST KAT test vectors, i.e., do both checks for signatures.
Is there any reason not to do this? Or does it just need to be implemented?
