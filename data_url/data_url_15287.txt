With the aer namespace migration to qiskit_aer and the pending deprecation of qiskit-ibm-provider we should look at removing the pkgtuil usage that adds hook points for namespace packaging. The hooks can be found here:
As part of the 0.23.0 release we should deprecate these and remove them after the qiskit-ibmq-provider package is retired (which should be mid 2023 hopefully) probably as part of qiskit-terra 0.25.0. I don't think we can emit a warning on their usage so the best we can probably do is document it in the release notes for 0.23.0 that the removal is coming.
As an aside we can't technically block namespace expansion in an external package since python packaging supports it to some degree without any changes in the root package. But in practice that built-in mechanism is broken for a lot (if not most) of cases which is why we have the pkgutil hooks in place.
