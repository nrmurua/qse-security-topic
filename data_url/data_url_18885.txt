In the grammar(https://qiskit.github.io/openqasm/grammar/index.html)
expression: ... | expression LBRACKET expression RBRACKET |...
It will incorrectly match strings like 1+2[3]. It should be indexIdentifier instead.
You may refer an obsolete g4 file but the latest still allows 1+2[3]; in expressionTerminator here.
However, I guess that expression LBRACKET expression RBRACKET is necessary because subroutine or kernel calls can return bit[n] and their caller can access its element.
I know they are issues in the current g4 but this kind of errors will be identified after parsing.
Sounds reasonable. bit[n] can be viewed as classicalType LBRACKET expression RBRACKET though. Agreed that it can be checked after parsing.
