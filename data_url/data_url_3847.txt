The optional decomposition to primitives after the router has been omitted during the merge.
This leads to changes in the golden output files of the tests such as:
The only change is that there are 17 non-decomposed swaps now versus decomposed ones before. That is about 3 cycles for each swap more cycles on a duration of a swap of 10 cycles.
That could explain it.
Because a non-decomposed swap reserves all resources (and there are several) for the full 10 cycles, while a decomposed swap only does that for the durations of the individual primitives.
Adding a decomposition pass after the router would prevent this.
