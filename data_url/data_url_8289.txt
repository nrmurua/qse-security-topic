The eigenvectors returned by .eigenstates() method are determined up to a sign (which is correct, but leads to interesting issues in some cases). Is it possible to update the eigenstates method to fix these internally? A simple workaround is to invert (multiply by -1) any eigenstates that cause trouble, but I'm not sure I know of a universal test for "trouble". As an example, this gist demonstrates a fix whereby all eigenstates are made to have positive initial values. I suspect this fix is specific to SHO states, but perhaps a universal standard exists where each vector could be made to match the expected result?
