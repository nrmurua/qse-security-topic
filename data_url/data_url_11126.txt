I'm a user trying to take advantage of OpenFermion's tools for handling ladder operator algebra.  I have an application in which I have many terms that are sums of products involving one fermionic operator with one bosonic operator.  (I'm also working with boson-boson and fermion-fermion products.) The issue is that multiplication apparently isn't defined for FermionOperator with BosonOperator.
Handling products of mixed statistics is straightforward algebraically, granted it is usually physically irrelevant to consider sums of terms having different statistics.  So my feature request is to add support for multiplying operators with different statistics.
@jrstryker Would you be interested in implementing or maybe a first pass design?  It might help the broader openfermion community to see an example.
