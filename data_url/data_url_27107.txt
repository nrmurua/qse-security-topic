Dear developers
I have installed Dcore and everything was fine. No mistakes or issues was in procces, But when I try to use command dcore_pre dmft_s              quare.ini it gives:
triqs_dft_tools is not installed!
We can use a TRIQS-compatible library instead by setting environment variable DCORE_TRIQS_COMPAT to 1.
Traceback (most recent call last):

RuntimeError: TRIQS is not found!
But TRIQS and triqs_dft_tools was instaleted. Can you tell me where does the program indicate where to look for TRIQS and triqs_dft_tools? Maybe it's just worth manually prescribing it.
Hi, how did you install DCore? pip install dcore on anaconda? What happens if you do pip install dcorelib?
Yes I have done this steps. I`ve re-install triqs_dft_tools and it works. But now when I use dcore -np 2 dmft.ini I get:
RuntimeError: Error occurred while executing MPI program!
In output file this message appears:
AssertionError: Type of indices incorrect : should be None, Gfindices, list of str, or list of list of str
Unexpected error: Type of indices incorrect : should be None, Gfindices, list of str, or list of list of str
I have installed again open mpi using conda install -c conda-forge openmpi but still mistake is happening.
Hi, I need more information.
TRIQS is 3.2.0 version. And whenl I try to use CTHYB TRIQS solver dcore gives me this massage when I use command dcore_pre dmft.ini:
