I was trying to generate a bitstream for 2.0, following the instructions. I get the following error,
It seems like commit
m-labs/misoc@6af3e1b
changed how the csc_map is defined maybe and I see the master artiq/gateware/targets/kc705.py has been changed to update this but not the release-2 version. Checking out an earlier version of misoc seems to fix this. I'm wondering if the installation from source instructions should have instructions for how to install specific branches instead of just the master or if just updating the release-2 version of kc705.py is enough? Or possibly branching misoc and migen as well?
