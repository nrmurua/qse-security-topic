Add tc.templates.blocks.random_circuit to generate random circuit for demonstrating quantum supremacy, the circuit structure can be found from Google's paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5
Add a function random_circuit in /tensorcircuit/templates/blocks.py which generate the corresponding circuit with given spec (1D/2D, entangling gate type, depth, qubit number, etc.)
Difficulty: ★★
Is this the task for Tencent Spark Project?

It can be if the students are too smart and the problems set is not enough for them. But in general, everyone from open source community is welcome to contribute to these tasks. These tasks are just features we'd like to see in future tensorcircuit.
Great. You are really building the community.
currently we have an alternative that using tc.Circuit.from_qsim() to load google random circuit structure
