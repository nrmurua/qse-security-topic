@jbqubit I have verified that it works on another computer and on mobile phone which wasn't connected to the same network.
Perhaps youtube will work for you?
Well. 301 MHz is Nyquist + 1 MHz. I would expect full scale AM at close to 1 MHz. Maybe that's aliased with the scope trigger rate to what you are seeing.
@marmeladapk and you are definitely using that jesd204b version? Your gateware version is before the jesd204b bump.
you are definitely using that jesd204b version?
@jordens Yes, I pulled each repo manually.
Current Sayma SAWG (variant A) doesn't support CORDIC frequency0 at 301*MHz. Must be < 300 MHz.
I can see your video now.
@jordens For every frequency above 300 MHz the effect is the same. Well if Sayma doesn't support frequencies above 300 MHz then there's nothing to talk about.
@marmeladapk The sample rate is 600 MHz. It supports frequencies above 300 MHz just fine. In the sense of Nyquist images.
Could you try some of the experiments from #1040, #1039?
It supports frequencies above 300 MHz just fine. In the sense of Nyquist images.
Ya, OK. But we're still struggling to understand what's going on in the 1st Nyquist zone.
