Currently, the assemble method accepts parametric_pulses argument, and if not set this value will be pulled from the backend.configuration().parametric_pulses. This field is automatically provided by all IBM Quantum backends but is not documented within the BackendConfiguration(https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration.html) object and is instead autopopulated as an attribute by the classes machinery.
Try using an IBM Quantum backend and fetching backend.configuration().parametric_pulses, this will be present but not documented.
parametric_pulses should be a documented attributed of BackendConfiguration.
Add the attribute to BackendConfiguration. Care must be taken to make sure it is also dumped still in to_dict and from_dict.
@taalexander may I work on this issue?
Certainly ðŸ˜„ , assigned. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have.
Thanks, @taalexander  this is my first terra issue so I would like to confirm what I should do:
Thanks @taalexander, I've just created PR #6494 .
Hi @taalexander, there was an issue during azure pipeline.


Could you give me a hint where I can find the log of execution and how I can run this build locally to try to reproduce it on my environment?
Thanks,
This seems like it may have been an issue with CI timing out, perhaps it is oversubscribed. I've kicked it off running again.
Is this issue still open ? I am totally new to contributing and I would love to work on it.
Hi @fs1132429, I made changes for this issue and there is an open CR. Now, we have some issues with the build.
@taalexander I've run build once again and It looks like that on the weekend there is less process run. Now, all checks pass. Thanks. :)
Closed by #6496.
