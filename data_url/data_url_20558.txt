@baentsch it's not as straightforward as we thought it would. Do you guys have a slack channel or something ? If you don't, that's fine. We'll try to figure out how to fix this.
Sorry, no Slack channel. We use github to communicate. The above is quite normal: oqs-openssl and upstream openssl have different, sometimes conflicting code paths (one of the reasons for starting the work on the stand-alone oqs-provider). All these conflicts need to be resolved as part of the work on the PR: Often it's simple (comment changes), sometimes it requires deeper understanding of the logic: It is a good exercise to get acquainted with the project, but may require some effort at the start.
One more hint: After resolving all conflicts, be sure to successfully run python3 oqs-template/generate.py && make generate_crypto_objects && make test && LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. python3 -m pytest oqs-test/test_tls_full.py.
@loganaden : Can I ask how things are going for you? Any questions? Problems? I'd be glad to help you get up to speed and on-board as an active contributor if that'd be your goal.
@loganaden Any news regarding your suggested contribution? Our goal would be to close this within the next two weeks: Will you/your team have time to do this until then? Alternatively, I'd be happy to do it. Please just let us know.
@baentsch I got taken up. Sorry, please go ahead.

Thanks for letting me know. In case you'd like to take a look: #407
