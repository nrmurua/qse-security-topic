Without an observable, the canonical way to compute "raw results" (i.e., results without error mitigation) is execute(circuit).
However, with an observable, the interface is different:
Should we (i) support a common interface? and (ii) do this by adding a "raw" module which does not do any error mitigation but exists solely for the purpose of having a common interface?
It would be really useful for documentation and examples. For example:
It doesn't really have a use beyond documentation. One may misinterpret mitiq.raw to do error mitigation.
From Mitiq meeting: Should it be a module or just a function?
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
