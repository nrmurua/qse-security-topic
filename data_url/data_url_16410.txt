qiskit.exceptions.QiskitError: 'Desired statevector length not a positive power of 2.'
The exception is raised in case is_measurement=True because input for CircuitStateFn.from_vector is 2D array.
For case is_measurement=False, the input for CircuitStateFn.from_vector is 1D array.
to_circuit_op() works for both is_measurement=True and is_measurement=False
Modify CircuitStateFn.from_vector to handle both 1D and 2D array.
I would like to work on this. I think there will be a simple fix for this. The error would be due to incorrect handling of the input vector in the case of 'is_measurement=True'. Let me know if i can work on this.
hi @deeplokhande
sure, go ahead (if it is up to me)
The simple fix is not available for this. it will require heavy changes in base initializer function.
Here is my complete tree analysis.
First thing first, the primitive vector must be a column vector. i.e. for a n-length vector the dim will be (n, ). If you try to send a list of list with n-length since you want to send a row vector, where the dim will be (1,n) and the function will throw the error for the input primitive not being dim>1.
So we fix the primitive vector. For a n-length primitive vector.
We know that 'is_measurement=False' works.
Now for the case of 'is_measurement=True' case:
So I think this issue will persist. And we should open a new issue for Conversion of QuantumCircuit to Initialize class.
Opflow is now deprecated soon to be removed. New features/enhancements are no longer a consideration.
