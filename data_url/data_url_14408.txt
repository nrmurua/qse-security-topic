Maybe we want show a optimized circuit in which the CZ gates run simultaneously.
Below shows two CZ gates that run in parallel, which means they occur at the same time.

But current default draw() function can not display similar case correctly:

Can we make the draw() function show parallel gates in a more compact way?
I'm not entirely sure how we'd go about clearly showing these overlapping gates - if we collapsed them down to be like the first example, it'd be impossible to tell what was happening.  That said, your premise is also slightly flawed: without scheduling and routing information, there's not actually any guarantee that the gates you've shown run at the same time on a given hardware backend.
You can get Qiskit to show you the logical layer information that you're referring to using the DAGCircuit.layers() method, if this is acceptable.  You could do, for example:
Then each separate image shows a "layer", where all the gates in it could logically run at the same time (if hardware supported it).
If there's a simple improvement to the drawers that could be made to better show layer information, we could consider accepting a PR on the subject.  My position (as a maintainer), though, is that qiskit.visualization is a fairly basic "helper" package for visualisation of various quantum objects in Terra for debugging purposes, and we'd rather that some external package took up the mantle of being a full, configurable visualisation solution.
