Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
qsim uses findall_operations_with_gate_type to locate measurements while converting circuits to qsim format.
Describe the solution you'd like
findall_operations_with_gate_type (and its sister method, findall_operations) should inspect CircuitOperation for matches.
Known issue: both methods include moment index in their return value, and sub-operations can't be precisely located with a single moment index.
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
Create an alternate method in qsim for locating measurements. (Changes in qsim are necessary for supporting repeat-until anyways, so this may be preferable)
[optional] Additional context (e.g. screenshots)
Relevant qsim code
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
Discussion in Cirq design sync: move qsim off of this and try using transformers to find measurements.
