Currently, this is sometimes a Optional[dict], Optional[Dict[str, PulseTemplate]], Optional[Union[dict, PulseStorage]] or MutableMapping.
We should find one consistent notation and stick to it. A MutableMapping[str, Serializable] would make most sense.
Branch issues/308... now has PulseStorage implement MutableMapping[str, Serializble]. To replace all the above "wrong" annotation, I will wait until all pending pull requests are merged before continuing (otherwiese there'll be redundant changes and conflicts)..
