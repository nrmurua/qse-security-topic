I get this error for anything less than nsteps = 1000000 (I've tried 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000, 500000) while using mesolve to get the dynamics of the system according to the Lindblad ME.
Details - It is a two qubit model, with both qubits coupled to baths and with inter-qubit coupling present. The solution for unit time with 100 divisions takes about 10 min but for any time interval greater than 1, I keep getting this error even with nsteps = 1000000, 5000000. Anything greater than that takes >2 hours to evaluate.
Initial State:
Hamiltonian:
Jump operators:
Time steps:
Using mesolve:
Note: nsteps=1000000 in the line above evaluates in 7 min
Ideally, I would like to solve for time in the range (0, 400) but in the worst case, time range (0,250) will do (with about 1000 divisions). But, increasing nsteps is not an option because the evaluation takes too long. Are there any changes I can make for faster evaluation?
Pure numerically speaking, the last diss_coeff is a way larger than the others.
With this large frequency, if you want to solve the dynamics using ODE, I don't think there is a way to make it faster. You have to either simplify your model mathematically, or, because there is no time dependency in your system, use the (deprecated) essolve that computes the dynamics using eigenvalues.
Thinking about the physics, the T2 time is much smaller than your tlist, the system has already fully decohered.
PS: @jakelishman It seems that the essolve does have some use-cases? Like in small systems for verification perpose. I remember there is another PR that also mentions it. As we deprecated it, I'm wondering if there is an efficient alternative in QuTiP?
@BoxiLi Thank you, that was the root of the problem. I'd made an error while defining the list of coefficients. It's working fine now.
That last coefficient was not supposed to be that large.
