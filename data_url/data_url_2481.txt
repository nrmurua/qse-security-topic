@c-poole I ran into this while running pytest on my Windows. Does pytest pass for you on Windows?
This seems to be a win32 bug: winpython/winpython#613
Edit: Based on comprehending the linked issue, it's not a winpython error at all. Suggestion is to use np.longdouble in place of np.float128. This defaults to float64 on my Windows and np.float128 on Linux.
I suggest we replace np.float128 with np.longdouble and np.complex256 with np.clongdouble. These won't change anything on Linux but it will give us np.float64 and np.complex128 on Windows and won't break tests on Windows builds (this change also depends on how many devs we have on Windows ).
Kind of related: @Strilanc  Should we add a Windows build on our Travis?
Hi, Is there a solution for this problem? I am using Windows 10. can you please point me to the right install for numpy?
Thanks,
Luis
We already solved this; by not using float128. What commands are you getting to run into this error?
Hi, I am using in a function.
def softmax(x):
x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float128)
e_x = np.exp(x)
return e_x / e_x.sum(axis=0)
I have np version 1.15.4
The snippet you posted doesn't use Cirq.
yes, sorry...
I couldn't figure out how to do it in Windows. So I switched to an Ubuntu virtual box and created a python environment with the specific pip requirements and versions ... and problem solved...
Thank you!
Luis
any support for windows 10 and python 3.8, I am getting the same error.
AttributeError: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'float128'
@hafez-ahmad can you share the code you're using where you're running into this using Cirq?
@balopat here it is josuemtzmo/trackeddy#9
@hafez-ahmad  That code doesn't use Cirq.
