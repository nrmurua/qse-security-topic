QuTiP is hosted on Anaconda's conda-forge channel and on PyPI. I would like to showcase downloads on the website and possibly have a development notebook (or in a personal repository) showing them updated, for QuTiP presentations.
conda install qutip: For conda-forge, it is possible to use the anaconda-package-data with dask and intake,
https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-package-data
pip install qutip: For PyPI, it is possible to use, pypinfo
https://github.com/ofek/pypinfo
Note that  withpypinfo Google's Big Data queries are not free, but new accounts come with some budget credited.
Some data:
*pip install qutip data starts in 2016. In 2018, 8000 downloads are reported. For 2019, well over 10,000 downloads are predicted.
*conda install qutip data starts in March 2017. For 2018, 30,000 downloads have been performed.
This data is useful to gauge the effective popularity of the two package managers and distribution platforms and can help in setting priorities for relative support and bug fixing.


With pypinfo we can also easily extract other information on users' machines details, such as  python usage, which can provide guidance on aspects:
This information is relevant also regarding #882. About OS:
This information is relevant for choices such as #959.
This data allows to better understand the user base of QuTiP.
The recent feature by GitHub "Used by" allows to draw connection graphs on the open source software ecosystem. This applies also to the quantum tech ecosystem:
This is just a partial piece of information, but more insightful than favorites and partly even than forks: It really tells that QuTiP helps engineer an ecosystem of other libraries.
The conda-forge download badge has been added to the Readme.
