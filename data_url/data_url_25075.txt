Printing the game uses a lot of ink, since the backgrounds are predominantly black.  It would be more ecological and cost-friendly to make a version that was the same but instead used white backgrounds (but please keep the original version as well so that users have a choice).
Excellent suggestion. I'll add a light version to the game assets.
@iroha7941 Entanglion v1.2 has just been released with a light-themed version of the game assets. Enjoy!
