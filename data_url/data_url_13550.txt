In noise scaling for zero noise extrapolation, it could be interesting to provide a method to visually highlight the part of circuit that is being inserted, for example showing the folded gates in a different color. @rmlarose mentioned that Cirq's testing has a feature that could be used for this (maybe it's highlight_text_differences).
Requesting clarification: Do you want a function which inputs the folded + original circuit and highlights gates?
The Cirq function you linked shows â–ˆ where the diffs are, which probably wouldn't be helpful. To actually show highlights would require something else I think.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
