zsh: illegal hardware instruction  python
Hmm... this is weird as Python 3.9 should be officially supported on Apple Silicon.
I will try to adapt PR #444 to give you a possible workaround.
Could you try the following using the branch on my fork that is used for PR #444 ?
Thank you so much for the effort. There seems to be issues with the M1 chip, what I did was to uninstall conda and install:
pyenv global 3.8.10
All the best,
So that's your first issue: Python 3.8.X is not officially supported on Apple Silicon. Please try to install a more recent Python version and try again.
Also try downloading the code from https://github.com/Takishima/ProjectQ/tree/feature/apple-mx-processors (you can either use Git or download the ZIP file; in the latter case, unzip it somewhere on your system and then simply do python3 -m pip install path/to/unpacked/
Did you try the latest version? Did  it help?
If not, this is probably related to the fact that Python 3.8 is not officially supported on Apple Silicon and there is little we can do for the compiled C++ code (since you're compiling the code on your machine locally anyway).
Perhaps if you could post the full log of executing python3 -m pip install projectq -v I could look a bit more into this issue.
