Describe the bug
When a user defined a FreeParameter("str") where the "str"  is a OpenQASM keyword. For example, it fails for b, q, bit, qubit, input, OPENQASM, 3.0. 1,2.
To reproduce
gives the error
Expected behavior
Expected the circuit to run correctly. For example, using FreeParameter("a") works correctly.
For context, here is the OpenQASM generated when an input is named b
b and q are used as variable names by the Braket SDK and will cause a collision if customers create parameters with the same names. To mitigate this, we will update these automatically created variables to __bits__ and __qubits__.
The other variable names listed conflict with OpenQASM naming standards and we will update documentation to reflect this.
Reopening this issue, as PR #675 was reverted by PR #701. Additionally, I think there is still a need to document the fact that OpenQASM language-reserved words (such as input, angle, etc.) are not allowed as FreeParameter names. Ideally this would give an error message but at the very least it should be documented (e.g. in the FreeParameter documentation).
