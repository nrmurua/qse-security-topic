Not sure what is causing this serialization error. @diego-plan9 can you take a look?
It seems quite similar to the errors in Aer that caused two tests to be skipped during the Qobj PR (as IBMQProvider contains also code very similar to Aer's to deal with noise model, etc) - I'll check with @chriseclectic as they can probably be handled at the same time.
a few other examples also fail. it seems the failure happens when trying to run on devices, not Aer.
Seems we are being too lax when handling qobj.experiment.instructions.parameters, and is rippling up when using types that cannot be serialized by default - will issue a PR shortly!
