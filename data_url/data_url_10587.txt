Right now the TilingComposite is only defined for Chimera-structured hardware graphs.
See also #294
TilingComposite has been modified so that Chimera structured subproblems can be tiled over Pegasus-structured graphs. This is a partial solution. #431
The ability to tile Pegasus structured subproblems over Pegasus structured graphs is still absent. This involves changes to the class signature, amongst other things.
