Perhaps I am not understanding how a qutip device works.
I have been following the example from https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/qip/qip-processor.html#qip-processor as I want to add noise to my quantum circuits.
However, I saw that using processor.run_state(init_state) returns a different state compared to qc.run(init_state) for certain circuits.
By just adding an RY gate to the circuit, both methods of obtaining the state now returns the same state with unit fidelity.

Sorry for such a long delay... @QuantumFall  This issue somehow escaped from my email list and I never noticed it.
This is actually a situation often encountered when testing just one gate. If Hamiltonian acts trivially on the state for a few time steps, the adaptive solver may decide on a step size so large that all the reaming pulses are skipped.
Set the max step size fixes it:
Usually, this is because the Hamiltonian is 0 at the first few steps. This example is actually slightly different. The first pulse is a non-trivial (sxsx+sysy) (swap-like). Maybe it is because it has no effect on the initial state (0,0,0,1). But  (1,0,0,0) seems to work well.
It seems really necessary to adaptively choose a step size for the simulators.
BTW, new updates will most likely only be added to the separate package qutip-qip. Please feel free to check there.
Hi Boxi, thank you very much for your response!
