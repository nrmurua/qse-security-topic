The "X-Gate for a Transmon Qubit" example is a very simple example of a gate optimization, and thus it fits in quite well into into the progression of example notebooks, as the first example for a gate optimization. It is preceded by state-to-state optimizations and followed up by more complex gate optimization (dissipative "3 states" optimization, and perfect entanglers).
However, the example could need a little bit of cleanup, and an extended discussion.

@FernandoGago Would you have time to expand this example a little bit?
Yes, I will take care of this as soon as possible.
That looks pretty good already! A few comments:
Sorry for taking so long, but I am finally back from my holidays.
I will try to implement all the suggestions that you made.
Regarding the physical meaning of the interaction, it is actually a potential V(t) that is being applied to the transmon. So the actual term in the Hamiltonian is - \Op{q} V(t), where \Op{q} is the charge operator which is diagonal in the charge basis. However I am not sure how it is written in the eigenstate basis. Usually for a Rabi cycling we need a interaction Hamiltonian which is nonzero in the diagonals +1 and -1. For this system, after changing the basis, I believe that was (almost) the case when I checked many, many months ago, so I still don't know why is this behaving so badly.
I am going to make a couple of changes and tests to see what I can do with this point from the list.
