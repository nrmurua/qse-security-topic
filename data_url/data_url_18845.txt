The syntax highlighting blocks on the OpenQASM 3 live spec site are currently not being highlighted as OpenQASM 3.  Sphinx uses Pygments as its highlighting engine, and there's currently no OpenQASM 3 support in Pygments (or in external packages), so we're currently lexing things as a mix of Python, C, and Javascript (!) and just hoping for the best.
I've written 95% of a Pygments lexer for both OpenQASM 3 and OpenPulse, which we can publish as a Python package and begin depending on.  My questions are:
I'm happy to go with anything.  For my own view, I personally would host it as a separate repository, within this OpenQASM organisation here on GitHub.  It is really a supplemental package, and it'll be easier to manage in the long term if supplemental tooling is in separate repos.  We already do this for the vim syntax highlighter, and I see this as largely the same thing.
I suggest going with your preference of a separate repository within this GitHub org.
This was brought up in the TSC meeting on 2022-06-17 and the consensus was to handle this in a separate repo within this GitHub org, and I'll sort out the logistics of managing PyPI releases within that.  I'll push a new repo in the coming few days, once I've ironed out the last couple of lexer-delegation bugs I'm aware of, make an initial PyPI release, and then transition our documentation build over to relying on that package.
At some point in the future, once the language is a bit more stable and we can point to public instances of adoption, I will get into contact with the Pygments team about contributing our lexer upstream to their project.
This issue will be fixed once our documentation highlighting is all done with the new Pygments lexer.
