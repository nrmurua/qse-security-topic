In the RTD we should create a new document explaining what should be the expectation of certain configurations, or say file paths when someone wants to self host Covalent. Some of the things that are necessary to be covered in this doc include:
How does assigning an executor to an electron with a short name like "awslambda" affect that electron's execution on the Covalent server (on the remote machine)? As part of this, a short explanation might also be needed to describe how Covalent parses that short name internally.
Users should be aware of the two types of syntax for setting an electron's executor:
Default configuration means using dask executor, any env Deps will interfere with the covalent's installation because those Deps will get installed in the same environment as covalent.
Local file transfers do not work as expected.
