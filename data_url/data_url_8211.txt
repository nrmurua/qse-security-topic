Thanks for reporting this. We've already fixed it in master, but haven't yet pushed a new patch release out. We hope to do that soon.
You can temporarily work around it by installing SciPy 1.4 in your QuTiP environment, or building QuTiP from the latest source.
Should be closed by QuTiP v. 4.5.2, just released.
