Describe the bug
When installing QRL, it errors out with "No such file or directory" and "no repository found" errors:
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Expected behavior
QRL is updated and runs with no errors.
Desktop (please complete the following information):
I have finally gotten back to this, and the same error still occurs with newer versions as well:
I am going to try cloning the git repository directly and seeing if the output is more useful there.
Much more useful... maybe:
(Home directory replaced with "~" by me)
So... why is it looking for ".hg", and what is supposed to create it?
Try to run following command inside the QRL repo before building it
hg init
Thank you! Now the error is...
Pretty much the exact same thing, but a bit less verbose. Hmm.
Much more useful when made verbose:
...So maybe it has to do with "license_file"? But now the question is which line of code prints that, and which line of code is asking for the file or directory '': ''?
setup.py seems to call setuptools to use pyscaffold in some way, but I know pretty much nothing about these tools making it really hard for me to debug. Usually I would just follow the layers of functions until it got to something useful, but everything is so abstracted that I do not know where anything is.
Modifying setup_package to be:
To use pdb.
Then stepping through the entire setuptools program using:
(Line numbers will probably change if you have a different version of setuptools than me)
I have finally isolated the file not found error to the function walk_revctrl(dirname='') in /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/setuptools/command/sdist.py at this line:
So the problem is whatever is calling that function.
That appears to be the following line in /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/setuptools/command/egg_info.py:
Uh huh...
I had made a thread to test if this is a Pyscaffold error and it looks like it may be one indeed? Still not sure yet.
Edit: Actually, it does get beyond self.resolve(). Hmm... I guess I must still step more granularly.
In pyscaffold/pyscaffold#484, I was recommended to try running the command without the .hg.
In doing this, the process to get to get an error is a bit different. .hg seems to be missing in the find_sources command in egg_info.py(295)run(), run by the egg_info in the build_py class of usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/setuptools/command/build_py.py. I get there using the following sequence of operations, this time operating on an unmodified setup.py with command python -m pdb setup.py build, as this is a newly-cloned repository:
Upon debugging more, this seems to be an error in yet another invocation of walk_revctrl, in /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/setuptools/command/egg_info.py(581)add_defaults():
Upon going into the function, after the following series of steps:
ep.load()(dirname) is successful at returning items until... around versioneer.py? Anyway, rather than manually go through all of these each time, I decided to look at the documentation to see if there is a way to break once a variable is a certain value, and there indeed is. So, my commands to get to the point of this are now:
I've done some more debugging, with a fresh repository, and this time making comments to know what it's doing:
