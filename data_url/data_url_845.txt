Describe the bug
the results of an algorithm with 11 qubits (all the ones avaiable on IonQ), have an inconsistent number of measured_qubits. Some are 10 Qubits measurements, other 11.
To reproduce
The circuit we ran was simply: (Hadamard gate)
q0 : -StartVerbatim-GPi2(1.57)-GPi(0.00)-EndVerbatim-
repeated multiple times, (actually we ran it for 10,20,30,50,100 Hs) on 11 Qubits.
Trying to get the results of the task gives the following error message:
"""
braket/tasks/gate_model_quantum_task_result.py in measurements_from_measurement_probabilities(measurement_probabilities, shots)
199             )
200             measurements_list.extend(individual_measurement_list)
--> 201         return np.asarray(measurements_list, dtype=int)
202
203     @staticmethod
ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. The requested array has an inhomogeneous shape after 1 dimensions. The detected shape was (100,) + inhomogeneous part.
"""
By looking at the "results.json" file of the task (and also inside "measurements_list" variable in the file producing the error it is clear that for some shots there are 11 measured qubits, for other ones only 10.

Thanks for reporting the issue @EmilioRui! We are currently looking into this and will report back with an update.
The issue should now be fixed. Please let us know if you still encounter an error while trying to run this task. Thanks!
I can confirm it is fixed.
May I know what was it? Just for my curiosity
We had incorrectly processed results from IonQ for certain tasks in which all qubits were used in verbatim mode. Thanks again for reporting this issue and for your continued use of Braket.
