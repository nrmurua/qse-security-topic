pulser-core 0.8.0 pins jsonschema to 4.4.0 causing conflicts with other packages due to missing format-nongpl extension.
Removing of the constrain does not make any test fail.
Suggested to remove jsonschema constrain.
Hi @picbeats , thanks for raising this up!
This seems sensible, as far as I can remember we don't have a strong reason to pin the jsonschema version.
Is this urgent or have you managed to circumvent this issue for now?
It's not urgent, but required a workaround in a build pipeline, so would be nice to fix it with a next release.
Alright, no problem!
@picbeats The change has been released in v0.9.0, feel free to update your pipeline.
Thanks, that's worked. Still have issues with requests and pasqal-sdk vs. jupyterlab-server
