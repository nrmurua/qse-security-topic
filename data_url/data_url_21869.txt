Let me know if I've misunderstood something or if you have a strong motivation for keeping things as they are.
I went along the lines of the digital-servo. One argument would be that the corner frequency is the only (externally relevant) frequency scale of a PI filter. We change it if that's your preferred parametrizaion. I don't think there would be that much less special casing.
kp and ki is my preference. But, as I said, I'm happy to be convinced otherwise.
