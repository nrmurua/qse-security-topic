It was pointed out to me that the notebook at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/qiskit/terra/compiling_and_running.ipynb is trying to import QuantumProgram despite being in the section of notebooks that should be kept up to date for the latest Qiskit version. This is generating an error.
This is not updated and will be removed it was moved due to a mistake
