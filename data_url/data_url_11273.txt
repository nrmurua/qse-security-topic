It looks like the time has come. Parts of this are being discussed at #339 but it deserves its own issue, which is: how to support optimizations in a faster language such as C, C++, or Cython? I think we could simply have Cython be a dependency, but that requires a C compiler like gcc to be present on the system so making it be optional might be more involved.
I have been doing some research on this, and here is a brief summary.
Cython is a superset of of Python, and its source code needs to go through 2 stages of compilation:
The standard approach for those 2 stages is:
Eventually it goes back to priority of speeding up in scientific computations, which I'm not sure yet. @babbush

I think this is not currently urgent and it would be a very large project, so I'm going to close the issue. But thank you for this research Sheila.
