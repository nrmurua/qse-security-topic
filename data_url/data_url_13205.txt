Per PR feedback it was suggested to replace the use of the NoisyReadoutSampler and cirq.measure_confusion_matrix with a fixed analytical solution. Additionally, Revert changes from #1605.
As mentioned in the PR it is okay if this is a follow-up PR to #1449.
Here's a reference
Hi @amirebrahimi, should we include this issue in milestone 0.21? For context, the target completion date of milestone 0.21 is Nov 30.
I think so as it should be a relatively small PR. #1449 needs to land first.
Would you please assign this to me as well, @Misty-W? Thanks!
