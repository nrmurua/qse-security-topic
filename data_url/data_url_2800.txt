With the recent rollback, this is back to being an issue.
@Strilanc I think there's an implicit assumption in optimize_circuit that opt.new_operations only act on opt.clear_qubits. I can imagine cases in which this is not necessarily the case, e.g. if a decomposition uses an ancilla qubit. However, the most expedient thing to do now is to make this assumption explicit and come back later to addressing its removal. Is there any PointOptimizer that either exists now or that we would like to exist before launch that this would be an obstacle to? (Note that even without fixing the extraneous moment thing, if this is the case then optimize_circuit can do the wrong thing as it is right now.)
This is addressed in #650. (The stretching, not the assumption about which qubits the new operations act on.)
Can this be closed?
I don't see an actionable proposal here anymore and think this can be closed.  If reopened please make it an explicit proposal.
