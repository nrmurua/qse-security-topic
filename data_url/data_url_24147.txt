Observed this issue when saving the design from MetalGUI. App did not crash on my system but there were exceptions when using 'cancel' .
QFileDialog.getSaveFileName returns empty string as filename - ( https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metal/blob/main/qiskit_metal/_gui/main_window.py#L163 )
This caused a FileNotFoundError during opening of file (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metal/blob/main/qiskit_metal/_gui/main_window.py#L171).
To fix the issue , an empty check was added. File will be opened and written to only if filename is non-empty (length of string is non-zero)
