From https://travis-ci.com/github/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/jobs/363142665#L1921 , the below QASM will transpile and simulate to either a result like
or a result like
I haven't investigated too much other than to figure out that, at least for me, the results would be consistent within a session and this only occurs when a coupling_map is provided (from the backend or as an argument to transpile).
This is a very old issue now, and I can't immediately see what the OQ2 circuit is meant to simulate to.  Given the description, my guess is that whatever the issue was, it stemmed from inconsistent handling of classical wires in our default routing passes.  We've fixed all known issues with those in our default routing passes now, so I'll close this as stale.  (This circuit now reliably simulates to an all-zero bitstring up to noise.)
If you happen to remember the problem was here and it's still valid, feel free to re-open this.
