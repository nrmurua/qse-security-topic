When creating a quantum circuit with no name, the default name is set to circuitX.  Currently, X starts from 1 rather than 0, and can cause some confusion when trying to index circuits by name.
gives 'circuit1' for the initial circuit created.  It should be 'circuit0' to coincide with the the indexing in Python.
