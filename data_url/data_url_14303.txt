I tried to run an Estimator primitive program by using the Qiskit Runtime ibmq_qasm_simulator and passing a specific NoiseModel created from a real device backend. However, it seems that the simulator is not loading correctly the noise model because the expectation value I get has zero variance (I would expect a small deviation due to noise).
EstimatorResult(values=array([-1.]), metadata=[{'variance': 0.0, 'shots': 10000}])
Since the quantum circuit is preparing the state $| 1 \rangle = X | 0 \rangle$ and I'm computing the expectation valued of the Pauli $Z$ operator, the result, in case of no noise, is deterministic: $\langle Z \rangle = \langle 1 | Z |  1 \rangle = -1$. However, loading the noise model as in the example above, it should be possible to observe a small deviation from this value, together with a non-zero variance.
@kt474, @jyu00: this feels likely to be something in Runtime to me.  If so, shall we transfer it over to you?
