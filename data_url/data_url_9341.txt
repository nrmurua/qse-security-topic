After we merged Jonathan and Minh-Thi's examples, let reorder the page a little bit with the following order:
Manual:
Lattices, Waveforms, Hamiltonians, Registers, Observables, Emulation, Working with Subspace, Working with Units, MIS, CuDa
Tutorials:
Rydberg Blockade, Adiabatic Evolution, Scars, QAOA MIS, Weighted MIS
Let us get rid of other pages in Tutorial at this moment.
Lets us also delete the advanced topics since the Rydberg Blockade has been moved to the Tutorials
In addition to the reordering of the tutorials, please also change the folder names
qaoa to MIS
ring to blockade
weighted-mis to MWIS
