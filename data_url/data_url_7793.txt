Without opt_einsum, the code seems to have problems to import the functions in tensor_core.py. Probably it's better to add opt_einsum in setup.py
Thanks for raising this (for openjournals/joss-reviews#819). Originally the quimb.tensor package was separate (and optional) but now the core module has begun to depend on it for various reasons.
Have updated setup.py and the installation notes, and released a new pypi version.
