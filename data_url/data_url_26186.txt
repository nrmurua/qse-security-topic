The info in this screenshot might make a person think the project's documentation is not updated regularly (made that mistake myself).

Considering RTD builds the documentation when a new change is pushed to master, might want to change the Deployments info to RTD and not github pages.
The github pages workflow might be for this page: https://vprusso.github.io/toqito/
@vprusso I am unassigning myself because that portion in question is accessed through Settings.
You simply need to disable that workflow as we are not using anything in deployments.
Great. That's been disabled and no longer renders on the main page:

Going to close this out as I think that solves it, but re-open if I missed something.
