When trying to return the QASM string from a QuantumCircuit with a delay element using the qasm method, qiskit returns TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable.  I have included a simple example here and a couple more examples of working and non-working code at this gist
Here is a simple example that fails
This results in the following error traceback
The output from the above should look like this
This can be fixed by adding "delay" to the list existing_gate_names here
delay isn't a known instruction in QASM 2, and it's not defined in qelib1.inc, so we can't really just add it to the known gates list.  In principle, we could have some mechanism for declaring instructions with no definition as opaque in the output QASM, but I think we'd need to have QuantumCircuit.qasm accept a list of names that it should declare like that; it also wouldn't be great if we just pass through all gates with no definition as opaque, since that might just be masking bugs in the input.
Ok, thanks for the info. Might be useful to have an error that says something for instructions that aren't qasm but makes sense as is also.
