Would it be possible to have the option of getting the default values from the GUI for that particular experiment?
What if there are multiple GUI connected with different values? What about artiq_run and other non-GUI ways of running experiments?
That's true. We can live without that but if we could use self.scheduler.submit with experiments without specifying all the defaults that would be a big help already.
