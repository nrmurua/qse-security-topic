Add "NIST Round" and "Specification Version" fields to https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/oqs-template/generate-oid-nid-table.py once open-quantum-safe/liboqs#892 is addressed.
Maybe also automate platform-specific OSSL algorithm test inclusion/exclusions from the same YAML as/when available.
@xvzcf Would you have time to do this? Currently this is blocking open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos#83 -- which in turn is needed to generate a correct(ly documented) test server (which is due with the release of liboqs v0.7.0).
Would it also be worthwhile to add a "Specification Version" field?

Thought about it but didn't see enough of a difference to the current "Implementation Version" field.
