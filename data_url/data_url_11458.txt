Further to my issue #21 detailing what QuTiP functions would be needed for qgrad.qutip, I opened a PR #22 that deals with all such operators. It is a big PR since we are gradually discovering more and more functions that we would need. I am opening this issue to discuss the tests for all such QuTiP operators and will link a separate PR to it soon. Some tests are already been pushed and ready to be reviewed at #18
TODO:
Closing this on #22
