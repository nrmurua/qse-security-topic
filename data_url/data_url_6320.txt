QPager -> QHybrid stack, for example, fails the test_qunit_paging test. This is likely a significant inaccurate edge case, for stacks involving QPager. Within the QPager implementation, I have determined that the bug is likely within ApplyEitherControlledSingleBit(), or a QPager distributed gate logic method called within it, or else Compose(), or else Prob() or a probability check variant.
I can address this tomorrow.
I think that the bug is in page-wise QPager::Compose(). Following another cup of coffee, I'll hopefully be able to remember how we form these Kronecker product states, extended to separate pages.
I think my paged algorithm could be fixed with a quantum arithmetic shift. Thinking about it.
Similarly, there were bugs in basically all of the Compose() and Decompose() variants of QPager, systemically. However, I've found a fix for Compose(), and Dispose() seems fine. Decompose() was kludged into low-performance but working state, but QUnit relies on Compose() and Dispose() without Decompose(), so I think we're in a tenable state.
