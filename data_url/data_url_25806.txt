PyPi, like GitHub, does not have a stable tag built in to the platform.
Setuptools allows automated tagging of releases as pre (like GitHub). Applying the tag causes PyPi to treat pre-releases as lower numbers than the last final release, thus surfacing the final release. We can include this in pypi.yaml for continuous releases and then manually create final releases.
