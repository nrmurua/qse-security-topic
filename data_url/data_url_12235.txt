Hi, I meet an error
just in this morning. I typed the same code yesterday, it worked successfully. But now it came out with error. I don't know why. Please help to solve it.
The following three blocks are my code:
I have tried to
1.conda install conda
2.python -m pip install --upgrade pip
3.upgrade:pip install -U qiskit
Thanks for helping!
Hi,
I copied and pasted your code and run them on my jupyter notebook. It seems running fine. Either there is a maintenance of real-device backends so that you cannot run them at that precise moment, or something with your environment. Would you mind checking it again if your codes run on the simulator and real-device backends when they are not under maintenances?
Here is the output of my code..waiting in a queue...
Hi,
I am closing this issue. Please reopen if you still have problems.
I still got such error, not always, (but if I use 8 qubit, I always got that)
Got a 400 code response to https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/api/Jobs?access_token=XiRVksfIVPPb6UnZA2mGBwWiWFgR0EvapwqQc7MeZ6PkDUBSa9bAVtH9uwo1aMZE: {"error":{"status":400,"message":"Generic error","code":"GENERIC_ERROR"}}

I'm pretty sure it's not due to maintenances, could you please tell me how can I find and fix my environment?
