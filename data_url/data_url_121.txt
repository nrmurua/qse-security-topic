The IonQ backends support performing measurements only as a final step in the kernel execution; mid-circuit measurements are not supported. Right now, measuring more than one qubit causes issues when submitting to the IonQ backends, even if these measurements are performed at the end. The CUDA Quantum toolchain should
Submit the kernels below to the IonQ simulator.
E.g. it should be possible to sample this kernel on IonQ backends:
It should also be possible to sample this kernel (non-sense code to illustrate what I mean):
It would be nice if this was also something the compiler could compile into a kernel that can be sampled on IonQ by using 4 instead of 2 qubits:
Not a regression
No response
PR #571 disabled some nightly integration tests. Once this issue is resolved, the list of supported tests should be reconsidered.
Here is another example of a program that fails due to this issue. This program uses cudaq::observe().
It fails on the "YY" job, which produces this IR (note the multiple measurements)
