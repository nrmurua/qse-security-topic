Instead of having two different branches for the cpp_only and master (C++ and Fortran) code, there should be one codebase, with flags in the Makefile to control which dependencies are used and so on.
Ben identified that the Fortran-based libraries were obsolete and performed the merge in commit 3a63330. All that's left is to remove the cpp_only branch.
This was merged and cpp_only is now deleted.
