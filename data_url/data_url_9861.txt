Currently CQM.from_lp_file (using grammar from make_lp_grammar) supports coefficients expressed as decimal numbers:

but not scientific/exponential notation, for example:
or
Motivation: QPLIB contains problems with coefficients expressed in scientific notation.
Putting this here so I don't forget, it looks like SciPy might be adding support for reading LP files scipy/scipy#14593. It also appears that they use HiGHS for their support.
No one seems to be working on that SciPy feature, so it might be worth considering contributing #1182 (i.e. some variant of it) to SciPy?

See response #1182 (comment) tldr; yes but need a few things to happen first
