Hi,
I wanted to know how to change parameters inside XASM code, for instance:
__qpu__ void bell(qbit q,double theta) { H(q[0]); CX(q[0],q[1]); CX(q[0],q[1]); CX(q[0], q[1]); Rx(q[0],theta); Measure(q[0]); Measure(q[1]); }
now how do I actually set "theta" before executing the above function ?
In the C++ api, I find a function IR::setRuntimeVariables which takes as argument HeterogeneousMap, does this do the job ? How do I achieve the same in python api ?
Thanks
Hey @aravindhv10, once you have that kernel as a CompositeInstruction, you can call CompositeInstruction::operator()(std::vector<double> params)
Hope that helps, let me know if you need anything else. I'll put a task on me to add this to the Basis documentation page.
Hi, Thanks for your extremely quick reply !
Do you also know how to implement this in python ?
Sure
You could also use the xacc.qasm() call
Thanks ! That worked.
