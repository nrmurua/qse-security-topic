This blocks #279.
Done. I made QEMU allocate a PTY, since that looks the most like a serial port. Unfortunately there is no good way to figure out which PTY it is. Currently it is /dev/pts/8. I suggest simply restarting the VM using xl destroy && xl create every time you forget which PTY it was attached to.
Alternatively I can attach it to a named pipe, but that's more likely to break software connecting to the virtual serial port. E.g. I don't actually know how to connect a terminal emulator to one.
