trying python setup.py install gives:
pip install cplex==12.10.0.0 (not latest) seems to work.
We are not restricting cplex version:
"cplex; python_version >= '3.6' and python_version < '3.8'",
We may need to restrict the  version
Do we want cplex in the requirements at all now that the optimization stack works without? ðŸ¤”
Because QuadraticProgram does not depend on cplex, I think cplex could be optional.
