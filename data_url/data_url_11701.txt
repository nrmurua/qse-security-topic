FEATURE REQUEST TEMPLATE 
ENHANCEMENT REQUEST TEMPLATE 
I suspect you are implementing an optimizer using the stable code as a base rather than code from master branch of the repository here (you did not complete any information such as version in the issue template which is designed to help us help you).  Components in Aqua used to have a CONFIGURATION dictionary, from which the _configuration was set. You can look at other optimizer code in Aqua (stable branch) to see this. However the CONFIGURATION and associated code used by json/dict declarative interface was deprecated in the last version and is removed from the latest code which is in the master branch here, and will hence not be in the next version we release.
If you want to work with master code then here is some help on how to install from source.
many thanks, @woodsp-ibm  for your reply.
To implement my own optimizer to use with VQE algorithm, I must use Optimizer from qiskit.aqua.components.optimizers  or not.
Hi, yes you would sub-class Optimizer. Each component type has its own base class, so for optimizers this is Optimizer. By implementing the class it means that any algorithm that uses an Optimizer in Aqua can use any one of the specific sub-class optimizer implementations. There are quite a few optimizers there that you can look at as examples, some which wrap scipy optimizers and others which are complete implementations in their own right such as aqgd.
