The figure and code for We can further control the exact alignment by giving relative weights to the stretchy delays
Figure 6b is not the circuit this example is referring to. In the arXiv paper, the b part of the figure sits below the a part, not on the right. Also the code is broken, e.g., delay[g]; doesn't specify the qubit.

Figure 6 should be replaced with Figure 6 on page 29 of the arXiv version. The code should be on page 30 of the arXiv version.
