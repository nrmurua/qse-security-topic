I can only access 5 out of 16 qubits on device 'ibmqx5'.
The following lines in file projectq/cengines/_ibmcnotmapper.py prevent me from doing this
It seems ProjectQ assume we have access to only 5 qubits on IBM cloud.
In fact, if I change it to
I am able to access all 16 qubits on device 'ibmqx16'.
Here is the question,
The _ibmcnotmapper.py is custom for the 5 qubit IBM chip with its connectivity and should not be used with another chip.
The default compiler for the 16 qubit IBM chip can be found here:
https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ/blob/develop/projectq/setups/ibm16.py
and an example here:
https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ/blob/develop/examples/ibm16.py
Currently if you want to run on the 16 qubit chip, you need to do the mapping manually. We will at some point add an automatic mapper for that chip as well.
@damiansteiger Thanks a lot! üëç
BTW, have you considered changing import projectq.setups.ibm to something like projectq.setup('ibm')?
Because import itself is doing something is not intuitive. Moreover, it is not safe when you are trying to use different setups in a single program due to the python import mechanism (not friendly to new python programmer).
Thanks for your feedback.
I agree. We have already thought about a few ways to improve the setups and decomposition rules. It will be a breaking change, so it will take us some time in order to improve everything at once.
If you currently want to use different setups at the same time, you can do so by explicitly importing and specifying the compiler engine_list instead of relying on the default parameter...
