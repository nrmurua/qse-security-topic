%azure.target cell in Part IV of the Deutsch-Jozsa tutorial fails to execute on Binder. %azure.connect cell allows the user to connect to Azure and shows the list of targets, but attempting to set a specific target fails  with the Unable to find package 'Microsoft.Quantum.Providers.IonQ'. error.
On Binder, we restore NuGet packages when building the Docker image, and then prohibit to restore them when the VM is running (to speed up IQ# start time). We need to make sure Providers.IonQ package is loaded at image build time and is available at runtime.
