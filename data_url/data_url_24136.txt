When pyEPR is updated, Metal needs to be updated.
Metal needs to use the latest commit in pyEPR do avoid a segv.  That would require use of latest tag and published version of pyepr.
In particular, when plotting, there are inf and negative values for data.  The data was being put into a log scale.  Can't take log of negative numbers nor inf values.
Also Metal needs to have some additional error catching for older version of pyepr.
@obrienpja  is working on making EPR standalone, so pyepr will not used in the future.  Also, looks like code was merged and this issue was not closed.
