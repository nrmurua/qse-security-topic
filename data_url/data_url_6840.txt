When making distillation circuits, it is useful to be able to operate on Pauli product observables like ZIX*Y. Currently the shortest way to achieve this is to repeat the observable twice (once to get it onto a single qubit, once to restore). If there was a variant of the current controls where these variant controls were only satisfied if an odd number of them were individually satisfied, this problem would be fixed.
So basically:
