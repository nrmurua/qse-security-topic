Describe the bug
When measuring a qubit non-destructively that is part of a GHZ that the thread process has distributed, it causes the thread in question to behave erratically on shutdown from network(stop) and causes it to hang and fail to end the execution.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

System:
Additional context
Program uses a network of 6 nodes, with two nodes called R1 and R2 both running a process that measures the GHZ (for testing purposes) non-destructively.
Thanks for reporting. I'll check into it.
Which backend are you using for qubits? EQSN?
Might want to try QuTiP backend and see if the same issues are there.
The backend is EQSN. I attempted to try other backends but none were downloaded when I originally used "pip qunetsim" on my venv. I assume there is a way to grab them directly, I just didn't see a reason to try at the moment.
