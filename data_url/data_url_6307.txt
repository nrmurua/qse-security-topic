There is still a bug in QPager::PhaseParity():
There's one more issue, actually: QPager doesn't preserve relative phase of partial PhaseParity() operations, per page, to match the intended implementation up to a global phase factor. However, it would if I applied half the opposite phase rotation on both even and odd parity permutations, and this might be a more canonical form for the gate anyway. I'll have that shortly.
