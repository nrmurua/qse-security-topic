When using a Parameter which has a ramp rate set through a combination of step and post_delay (or inter_delay) as a setpoint parameter in a doNd measurement, waiting overheads can increase dramatically. This is the result of the post_delay being set to the delay time provided as an argument to the doNd measurement functions. Slowdowns are most severe when when the stepsize in a doNd measurement loop exceeds the step property of the Parameter. In this case the delay time is applied multiple times for each setpoint.
If the step size in a doNd measurement loop is smaller than the step property of the Parameter, slowdowns will only occur when sweeping the Parameter over larger ranges, e.g. when the ramped parameter is used in an inner loop and is swept from the final point to the initial point of the inner loop.
Relevant to all doNd functions that (temporarily) overwrite the post_delay.
The ramped parameter keeps its intended ramping behavior when it's changed and waiting time for delays in the measurement are only applied when a setpoint is reached.

Thanks @JouriB for the report
We will improve doNd functions to deal with this issue.
