When a quantum instance is configured to forward all network traffic, there is no way for quantum to recreate the forward setup after a soft reload. There is an added issue that after a reload subsequent reloads/shutdowns fail due to an invalid pointer because there is no default gateway to put back into place.
To be clear the inital reload properly removes the forwarding setup but does not recreate it.
