Is there any tooling available that would have allowed us to detect #1631 and #1636?
Preserving @cryptojedi's input (via @dstebila) so it doesn't get buried in a (hopefully) soon-to-be-merged PR.
I checked with @cryptojedi and he says that after this there shouldn't be any operations of the form /KYBER_Q left in the source code -- we could consider a CI test that grep's for those. He also writes that one could compile with -Os and then check if the output has an DIV instructions.
