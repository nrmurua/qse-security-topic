Hello,
I am trying to package thewalrus into linux openSUSE Tumbleweed.
I write spec file that contain compile instruction for the source code.
Which can be found here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:andythe_great/python-thewalrus
With full error log here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/home:andythe_great/python-thewalrus/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/x86_64
The dependencies installed are as follows.
I encounter an issue during testing using pytest. I'm uncertain why the error occured.
Thanks
My guess is that
Hi @kevinsmia1939!
Can I ask what version of The Walrus, and what version of the tests you are using? It looks like there might be a mismatch between the two versions.

Hello,
thewalrus version is 0.12.0
By "version of the test" did you have external testing data or tool?
The test that was done simply use pytest 5.4.3 and the test data in the source code given in the .tar.gz file in github.
Thanks @kevinsmia1939! And where are you accessing the test directory from? It would be useful if you could post the command you are using to invoke pytest as well ðŸ™‚

From discussing with other packager, it seems like pytest would not work during package building. So I switch to gtest and it work now, thanks.
