I installed HiQ with the following command(Official tutorial), there was an error prompt message, but I solved it and installed it successfully.Here are the details. Hope the official tutorial is getting better and better.
install command
sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-doc libopenmpi-dev sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev sudo apt-get install libgoogle-glog-dev sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip git clone --recursive https://github.com/Huawei-HiQ/HiQsimulator.git cd HiQsimulator python3 -m pip install --user . 
When I use the following test command  to test whether the installation is successful, I encounter the following error prompt message.
Test command
mpirun -np 2 python3 ./examples/teleport_mpi.py
Error prompt message
mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:
Process name: [[19585,1],0]
Exit code:    1`
Then I ran the following command to solve this problem
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
This is the result of a successful test.
