When you say "regular build/tests", what do you mean?  How did you run the tests?  It's quite possible an immediate workaround for you is to install testtools as an additional package.
@mtreinish: looks like Aer is using some testtools-specific functionality, so we should probably either bite the bullet and add it to requirements-dev.txt for Aer only, or gate the test case that requires useFixtures behind an optionals.require_in_instance("testtools") call.  It's certainly doing weird stuff by directly importing FullQiskitTestCase, which probably shouldn't be accessible unless testtools is installed.
Let me close this issue because no response since 1 year.
