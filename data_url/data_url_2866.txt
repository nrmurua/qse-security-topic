This just started happening to me when I run bash continuous-integration/check.sh (was working fine before):
Huh, this is also happening to me. Then... it stopped for no reason?
I mean, literally for no reason. I was running the code in the debugger, and reached the point where it tried to do the fetch. Then I ran the command in my terminal and got this:
Then I was distracted for a bit talking to people, came back to my machine, and re-ran the command. At which point it worked:
To be clear, these commands were literally one after another in the terminal and nothing else changed. And the commands should be purely local. Yet somehow a consistent failure turned into a consistent success.
And now I can't reproduce the bug at all anymore!
Same for me.  It was broken and now it's working again.
@kevinsung which machine did you see this failure on? A google workstation? Maybe there was some kind of silent forced update due to the recent CVE...? I'm really at a loss as to how this switched from working to not working and back.
I ran it on a Google workstation. It's working now again, too.
Okay then, I guess this one is closed by confusion until it reoccurs.
Could be a transitory github issue. May 29: "We are investigating reports of elevated error rates." (https://status.github.com/messages)
@maffoo The error was happening when running checks against entirely local files, without pulling from github.
