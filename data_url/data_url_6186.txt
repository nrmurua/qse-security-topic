could you give more information to reproduce this issue?
qiskit-aer uses copied nlohmann-json:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/0.2.1/src/third-party/headers/nlohmann_json.hpp
We already have nlohmann-json installed.
Could you tell more information to reproduce this issue? OS, commands, logs, and etc.
In my understanding, qiskit 0.10.3 does not support FreeBSD.

I can't reproduce this at the moment.
I'll reopen it if it would come up again.
