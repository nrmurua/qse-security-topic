I installed numpy 1.19.0 and it shows DeprecationWarning when I called StateFn.eval, e.g.,
StateFn(Z).adjoint().eval(Zero).
We maybe need to replace round with np.round.
DeprecationWarning: The Python built-in round is deprecated for complex scalars, and will raise a TypeError in a future release. Use np.round or scalar.round instead.

Thanks!
