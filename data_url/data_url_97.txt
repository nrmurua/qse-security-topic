A lot of applications require using a linear system solve (using cupy) to create the initial quantum state. On  systems like NERSC, it's hard to install anything new in the container as you are creating a new  instance for every run. Since cupy is a scalable gpu enabled library, it would be great to have it latest-hpc image.
