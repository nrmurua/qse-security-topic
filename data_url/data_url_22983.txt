leads to cancelling execution because of extremely long delays. shoud reduce the amount of data that is transferred if possible
issue is that after 10 min of no console output, the job gets cancelled -> just need to add a few prints in the specan unittests
another issue will be that jobs on travis-ci.org (once we are open source) gets cancelled after 50 min max. Right now we are rather at 90 minutes. So we will have to do something. This could be simply to identify the slowest tests and avoid running them on travis with a skip decorator.
right now we only have 2 iir failures
