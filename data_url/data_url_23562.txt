As discovered by the dynamic duo @jenshnielsen and mypy in #1640, the import of the config module and the later overriding assignemnt in the main __init__.py file is a bit creepy.

Like, what is qcodes.config now? What should it be?
I propose that we resolve this by renaming (with an appropriate deprecation cycle) the qcodes.config module to qcodes.configuration. I think that will have the minimal impact on user workflows.
@QCoDeS/core what do you think?
I agree, This will however need careful testing to ensure that the currently (by blackmagic working) logic does not break
i agree with the issue, and the proposed solution.
This issue was solved by #1682
