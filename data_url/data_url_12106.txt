This phenomenon occurs when using an account where the "ibmq_20_tokyo" device is one of the allocated backends.
"ibmq_20_tokyo " is probably falsely labeled as operational = True.
Changing the label of "ibmq_20_tokyo "  to operational = False could solve the problem.
There is no more ibmq_20_toyko.  But also this was an issue with retired devices and being able to retrieve jobs from the device.  This is no longer true.
