This would be useful for testing optimizations on circuits that involve measurements.
@Strilanc This basically means implementing _has_channel_ and _channel()_ for cases when there are non-unitary operations in the circuit as well, right? So  cirq.channel(cirq.Circuit(cirq.DepolarizingChannel(0.3)(cirq.NamedQubit("c")))) would work too.
