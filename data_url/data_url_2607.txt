More generally, instead of having to say cirq.google.EjectZ().optimize(circuit), we should just be able to say cirq.push_z_gates_to_end_of_circuit(circuit).
This is was renamed to cirq.OptimizationPass we can close it in place of: #1241.
@Strilanc  Ping.
Duplicate of #1241 which was fixed by #1248
Thanks Victory
