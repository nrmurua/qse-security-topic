Currently, it is very easy to accidentally forget to add a cirq method or class to the API reference. There's probably dozens missing. Here is my proposal for fixing this:
Suggestion: Make the functions no-ops during normal execution (just like typing.cast) to reduce import-time overhead.
I'm not sure how much that will save, since I'm imagining the bodies consisting of basically some_list.append(the_thing). The string construction would all happen basically unconditionally.
You can probably maneuver sphinx autodoc/autosummary to do what you want without putting annotations everywhere
