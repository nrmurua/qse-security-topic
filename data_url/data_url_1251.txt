Is your design idea/issue related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
I was watching someone construct a cirq Circuit, and they tried to type cirq.M and cirq.R for measure and reset, which didn't work. However, this seems like it might be a reasonable thing to support, since M and R are often in used in Circuit diagrams in similar manner as H and X?
Describe your design idea/issue
Make cirq.M and cirq.R aliases for cirq.measure and cirq.reset.
I feel seen
I see you @kjsatz
