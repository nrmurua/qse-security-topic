The section "How to modify the simulation precision?" appears twice in the documentation (it is repeated at the the end of the "Basic examples" section).
Another little suggestion regarding the documentation. I think the "How to perform measurements?" section could appear before the "How to select hardware devices?" section, as I would consider the former a less advanced topic than the latter.
Thanks for this, I think we can fix both points.
