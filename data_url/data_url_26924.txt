Sometimes, the test QS/regtest-pod/hellium-pbe-5A.inp gives wrong results, for example on POPT version at UZH, see:

or PSMP

I think it would be safe to drop this test if the problem persists.
The three hellium tests in regtest-pod are all identical apart from the He-He separation and should go through the same sections of code. Assuming that the shortest distance test is stable, I would say that nothing would be lost in terms of code coverage or tested features if only that test was kept. There's nothing immediately obvious that would explain why the test is occasionally unstable.

It seems the last time this showed up was over 100 commits ago. Hence, I'm closing the issue for now.
The problem is still there (see current test on dashboard). It is rare, but I would propose to drop the test as suggested by @nholmber
Closing because we cannot reproduce it anymore.
