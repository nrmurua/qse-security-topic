optimization_level=0 does not work in execute() and transpile(), and runs default_pass_manager (if coupling_map is specified) instead of level_0_pass_manager.
results in no gates, i.e. two CNOTs are cancelled out.
It should return
(No optimization for level 0)
In transpile_circuit.py,

thanks for noticing this, will fix.
I found the same example with optimization_level=3 causes another issue (some error in unrolling)...
