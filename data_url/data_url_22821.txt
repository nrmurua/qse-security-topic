If you want to calculate the electric energy of a volume you can simply use DistributedAnalysis.calc_energy_electric(), but if you want to calculate the energy of a surface you need to write the code manually. The two codes are nearly identical with the only difference being that you need to replace the line A = A.integrate_vol(name=volume) with A = A.integrate_surf(name=surf). Now, I could've simply added a boolean surface or something and it would work just fine but I think it would be best if the function would automatically check if the name given is a volume or a surface (or an edge). I don't think it would be that difficult but I didn't found where in the code you can get a list of names + their corresponding type (i.e. solid\sheet\edge). If there is no such option I could  add it myself but I'm posting this because there might be such option that I didn't found, or maybe someone wants to give it a go before I get to it ðŸ˜‰
