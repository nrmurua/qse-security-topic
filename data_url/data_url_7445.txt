Dear team,
Is that possible? If yes, how? I wasn't able to find anything like that in the documentation.
Thanks,
Hi, thanks for the issue. If you are mentioning about manipulating the circuit structure, maybe you will find the **
Manipulate the block tree** section of this notebook be useful: https://giggleliu.github.io/notebooks/notebooks/yaoblocks.html
The subblocks API might be the one most relevant. If you want the matrix representation of a unitary, just call mat.
