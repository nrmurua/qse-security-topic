In pulser-pasqal/pulser_pasqal/pasqal_cloud.py, we validate the device of a sequence by checking that it matches perfectly one of the available devices. This is too restrictive, it would be best to check that the properties of the device of the sequence can be obtained by one of the available devices.
Creating this function, it could be interesting to develop an intermediate function to check that the properties of a channel can be obtained by another channel.
This is closed because it is performed by switch_device.
