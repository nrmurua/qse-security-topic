We use a version of the Catch2 header for unit tests and benchmarks, but we do not respect all its conventions and options. In particular, Catch2 now supports benchmarks, but we use our own benchmark implementation instead of Catch2's features, making the command line --help menu slightly confusing.
We should convert to using the built-in benchmark features of Catch2. This would also immediately make the relevant options on the CLI meaningful, like --benchmark-samples. This likely isn't a difficult conversion.
