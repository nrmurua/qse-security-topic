Circulant matrices [1] periodically pop up from time to time in various applications of quantum information. It may be useful to have a function that checks whether or not a given matrix is circulant.
Something like the following may be a good place to start:
Ideally, this function would be placed in matrix_props/is_circulant.py. The content in the docs/ directory would also need to be updated as well along with basic unit tests to be placed in tests/test_matrix_props/test_is_circulant.py.
