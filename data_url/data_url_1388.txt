Description of the issue
The docstring for ArithmeticOperation has an Examples: section with code in triple backticks: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-core/cirq/ops/arithmetic_operation.py#L43. This renders on the docsite with a bunch of XML cruft: https://quantumai.google/reference/python/cirq/ops/ArithmeticOperation#examples
