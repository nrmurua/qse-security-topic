Describe the bug
Gate identifiers consist of a (user specified) arbitrary name, e.g. RX90p and the index of the targeted qubit. Handling of this is inconsistent when simulating.
To Reproduce
Using compute_propagators() of the Experiment class, an instruction with name RX90p acting on qubit 0 is store as "RX90p" whereas the lookup_gate method expects "RX90p[0]".
