Usually I can over-ride some standard gate (e.g. X) with some Kraus operators using define_noisy_gate. The same doesn't seem to work with parametric gates such as RY. If I try to run the following:
I get the following error msg
Is there any way to construct a noisy version of a parametric gate?
@msohaibalam can this be closed now that #829 is merged?
I think there's a case to be made for leaving this issue open. PR #829 produced code that should be compatible with the feature desired here, whenever it's introduced. But that feature does not currently exist and would be good to have.
