Currently, if a pulse is defined identically multiple times and used in a job it will be stored multiple times in the Qobj and then loaded into device memory for each instance of the pulse. In this case, waveform memory will be used for each pulse. An optimization pass to replace identical instances of a pulse in a pulse schedule would improve the usage of waveform memory in hardware and reduce confusion of pulse users running into waveform limits on hardware.
