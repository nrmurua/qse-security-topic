I have calibrated a custom gate with the pulse library, and it worked fine with binding values with only real values; however it throws the following error: qiskit.circuit.exceptions.CircuitError: 'Bound parameter expression is complex in gate custom_gate
Here is some example code I wrote to reproduce the error:
And running this code produces the following exception message: CircuitError: 'Bound parameter expression is complex in gate custom_gate'
Qiskit should recognize that a complex expression for the pulse parameter is valid and the circuit should be successfully run.
No response
