Hi ScaffCC developers,
based on LLVM release_31 before the commit 871865b
Before FlattenModule PASS, sha1.n12812.ll is 222+K, but after FlattenModule, sha1.n12812.inlined.ll is 6837+K! then gen-gasm failed to transform such HUGE LLVM IR.
@eddieschoute Please try @ajavadia latest commit 871865b    it might be able to work for SHA-1 algorithm #7 (comment)
Regards,
Leslie Zhai
