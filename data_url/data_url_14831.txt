I am going to introduce the new progress of qasm3 to my colleagues, and I would like to thank the community for their contribution. but i find for loop can not use as paper said [ https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14722.pdf ]
I've read about the support of qasm3, but I don't quite understand what it says about for loops. " Discrete sets and negative stepping is not supported.  "  [ https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/build/qasm-feature-table ]
error after run code in quantum computing lab : line 6:8 no viable alternative at input 'j'
run this code in quantum computing lab
more detail about how to use for loop ?. thanks a lot

Those loops are not valid for loops because they don't include a type for the loop variable.  Please read the OpenQASM 3 documentation, which is not a part of Qiskit.
After that, you would need a simulator or hardware that supports for loops.  I'm not certain that there are any that are public at the moment, although if conditionals and while loops are better supported.

I am looking forward to the availability of the for loop feature in the qasm3 module of Qiskit as soon as possible, because I want to write Quantum Fourier Transform directly within it.
