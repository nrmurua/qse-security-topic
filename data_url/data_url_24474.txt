pyqtgraph is in the install_requires list in setup.py without any version requirement. This downloads version 0.10 (latest available release). However, version 0.11 is the minimum (as specified in extras). If this version requirement is also added to the install_requires list (as it should be for consistency), that fails because 0.11 does not exist (anywhere). As a workaround, we can download the develop branch from github by adding an extra parameter to the setup() call:
dependency_links=[ 'git+https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph@develop#egg=pyqtgraph' ],
The version number should in that case still be omitted frominstall_requires, because setup() does not properly parse the develop version (0.11.0.dev0+gad7453c) and the >=0.11 check fails.
pyqtgraph should also be removed from extras (no longer needed, and version check fails).
@mjwoudstra Qtt works with pyqtgraph 0.10. The 0.11 version was only required for part of the functionality, but I am not sure that is valid currently. Once pyqtgraph 0.11 is released officially we should update to 0.11
