Is there a way to obtain the number of CNOTs in a quantum circuit. The tutorial over here https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/hhl_tutorial.html suggests one can use result['circuit_info']['operations']['cx'] but it seems changes were made and the method doesn't work anymore.
Circuit.count_ops()[‘cx’]
