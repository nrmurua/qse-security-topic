@laurynasas - the release workflow failed with Container action is only supported on Linux. However, qsimcirq v0.10.0 was successfully released.
I see, this is a known issue, there's a nice workaround by having a separate job for collecting artifacts and uploading them as described here pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish#15 (comment).
I'll work on the change.
