@ajgpitch @jakelishman,
Moving the discussion we had last week here.
It contains the options used by the solvers:
But making the solver objects, I added new base solver (solve_ivp, dop853) which require new options. Eventually, using dense vs sparse matrix should also be added somewhere.
So I have a few issues about it:
It has some installation settings: has_mkl, has_openmp and some Qobj options, auto_herm, auto_tidyup_atol.
I am adding a new value: path, which set the path to where the compiled string code are saved. Here also there is no easy way to change the default. If it was possible, I would have the default matrix data type set here.
File saved in the users home "~/.qutip/qutiprc". If qutip is installed with openmp, it contains the matrix size over which it is worth to use the openmp version of spmv.
Under used.
I would propose:
Implemented in #1289 (partial for master) and in #1337 (for dev.major).
