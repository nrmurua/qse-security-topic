Ping @Strilanc
I don't see a use.  We should deprecate and then delete.
Agreed with the deprecation - I know that it is used in TFQ - not sure why - so we should definitely be careful deprecating it.
Wanted to mention that we removed this stray use from TFQ in the PR here
Thanks for the info @zaqqwerty!
