Dear all,
I am working on Fe on MgO; the Fe:3d are the states of interest. In total I have 200 electrons in my system and the desired target occupancy of Fe:3d would be around 6. A similar work was done in Phys. Rev. B 93 140101 (R) 2016
Dcore seems to be working well when using the Hubbard-I solver (judging from dcore_check) however I cannot get a single iteration when switching to CTHYB because the program will always crash
is there a way to overcome this? I played with the solver parameters quite a bit but it does not seem to affect the outcome.
The input is below!
Thanks for your help in advance -
Best,
Chris
I guess that your build of triqs/cthyb was not configured with "-DHYBRIDISATION_IS_COMPLEX=ON -DLOCAL_HAMILTONIAN_IS_COMPLEX=ON".
Please refer to this page.
