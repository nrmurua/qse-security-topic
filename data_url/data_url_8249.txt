I try to run the code for finding floquet energies from the qutip user guide.
I got the following error
String format coefficients ('sin(w * t)'  in H) which use cython for compilation often fails on windows. Using functions instead work better.
Here there is also an error in the error message, we will fix that bug soon.
Hi,  I think you may have some typos in your code, for example you have a pi instead of np.pi in line 9. Also in the definition of the constants you have 2np.pi instead of 2*np.pi.
I've run your code changing those typos and I didn't get any error. I am running it in Mac OS X Catalina.

Thanks this worked.
import numpy as np
from qutip import *
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
delta = 0.2 * 2np.pi; eps0 = 1.0 * 2np.pi; A = 2.5 * 2np.pi; omega = 1.0 * 2np.pi
H0 = - delta/2.0 * sigmax() - eps0/2.0 * sigmaz()
H1 = A/2.0 * sigmaz()
args = {'w': omega}
H = [H0, [H1, 'sin(w * t)']]
T = 2*np.pi / omega
f_modes_0, f_energies = floquet_modes(H, T, args)
f_energies
This didnt' work for me.  I'm also running it on a Mac
The particular reported bug was fixed in #1199, and released in QuTiP 4.5.2.
