When compiling using local QVM, receive the following error:
QVM version:
Issue happens both when using --compile and not.
QVM log:
Works fine when using remote QVM. Code to reproduce:
Are you referring to this QVM? https://github.com/rigetticomputing/reference-qvm
@vtomole I don't think so. Rigetti has kindly provided us with an AWS instance with QVM installed; I'm assuming it's similar to the QVM in the cloud (if not the same).
@ntezak clarified that the locally deployed QVM doesn't have compiler installed. Closing the issue.
