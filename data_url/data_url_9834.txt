Description
Assertions are usually bad, but tests are still succeeding? This looks strange, no?
Version: 0.11.5
clang-14
FreeBSD 13.1
I am not sure what you mean? We include many asserts in the code for debugging purposes. But when we compile the libraries for the Python interface we use -DNDEBUG to disable them.
We leave them enabled for testing as well.
Scratch that, I believe this is just counting the number of Assertion Macros that succeeded in the test cases.
It looks like catch2 is printing this confusing message.
Thanks.
