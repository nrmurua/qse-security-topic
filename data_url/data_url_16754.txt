When exploring other unrolling issues I noticed that the following test only fails for levels 0 and 1.
At a guess, what's going on here is that CXDirection is inserting Hadamards, which can't be unrolled to U1 gates (only U2 or U3). Levels 2 and 3 are maybe finding a layout where q[2] and q[4] are adjacent.
So there is an issue here in that if the circuit can't be expressed in terms of the requested basis, we should raise an error instead of returning a circuit in the wrong basis.
Closing this in favor of #3972. Thanks @kdk !
