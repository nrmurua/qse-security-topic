We often want to display the wavefunction as a plot.  Best would be to have a built-in bar chart for wavefunctions:
This would plot a bar chart with bitstring on the x axis and probability on the y axis.
The second option could restrict to plotting a subset of the Hilbert space.  As the number grows exponentially this is useful for ignoring the ancilla qubits, etc.
I could make the crux of this code work independently in my environment. Was able to plot the bar chart for whole of the wavefunction. For the subset part, i understand that the
quantum_simulator.bit_string_probabilities seems to be deprecated. Hence, I left the fourth-to-last line incomplete.
In wavefunction.py
@rasa97 would you like to package this up and make a pull request?
