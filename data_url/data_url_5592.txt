The following code returns {'0':1000} with Aer 0.13.0:
The expected result would be {'1':1000}, which is what older versions of Aer return. Furthermore, if instead of qc.ry(np.pi/2,0) a small angle is added:
the result is again correct. Alternatively, transpiling the circuit gives the correct result, but as far as I know, transpiling shouldn't be necessary to run on a QasmSimulator.
