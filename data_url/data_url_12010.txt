I get the same error.
so the actual file in IBM Quantum Lab is located at
https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/files/qiskit-tutorials/**qiskit**/tutorials/circuits/1_getting_started_with_qiskit.ipynb
but the links in the tutorials point to
https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/files/qiskit-tutorials/tutorials/circuits/1_getting_started_with_qiskit.ipynb
the possible corrections could either be in the location of the files in IBM QLAB or corrections can be made to the links.
i.e the issue is with the documentation and not the tutorials themselves. so I'd suggest you drop the issue in the docs
The links have been removed because it was impossible to keep the tutorials in sync with the quantum lab.
