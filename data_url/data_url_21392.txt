This gh issue reports on the safe region of the AD9117 RETIMER Clock Phase.
DAC AD9117 is (at least) used on the shuttler board with a built-in retimer to check the phase difference between IO Clock (DCLKIO) and analog clock(CLKIN). Both clock is sourced from the same clock source but they arrive at AD9117s at different phase. By physical measurement, CLKIN to DCLKIO should have a phase shift of around 90 degree on all channels yielding the CLKMODE value of 0xC3 (both I and Q datapath have selected RETIMER-CLK Phase 1). The retimer should have a boundary region in which multiple DACs or their datapaths select a different RETIMER-CLK Phase from each other, which will affect the DAC pipeline latency.
This gh issue provides a patch to scan for the safe region and reports the safe region. Thus, we can safely force the retimer to select a clock phase based on this finding.

AD9117 Analog Clock(CLKIN) and System Clock share the same clock source with 125MHz Frequency.
AD9117 IO Clock(DCLKIO) is generated from System Clock with a phase shift of 45 degree to the right.
VCO Frequency is 1.25GHz. Increment value of phase shift = 1/(56*1.25GHz) = 14.28571ps
Period of System Clock and AD9117 IO Clock clk= 8ns = 0.6428569 degree per increment
560 FINE_PS = 360 degree

From the log message, you should see the reported RETIMER-CLK Phase at each FINE_PS. The patch will also report any DAC channels and their datapath having a different RETIMER-CLK Phase.
Definition of Safe: All DACs and their I&Q datapathâ€™s RETIMER select the same RETIMER-CLK phase
