This may not really be an issue per se, but I thought it would a good idea to post it anyway.
On updating my conda  environment which is devoted for qutip I get,
Collecting package metadata: done
Solving environment: \
The environment is inconsistent, please check the package plan carefully
The following packages are causing the inconsistency:
conda-forge/osx-64::qutip==4.2.0=np113py36_2
done
All requested packages already installed.
Is this because qutip depends on somewhat older versions of it's dependencies  (like numpy, etc)?
MacOS 10.13.6
I can’t tell now, will investigate. What’s strange to me in the first place is that on conda-forge, it says that for Mac’s Os, QuTiP is now at 4.3.1, https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qutip.
Also, it would be useful to update the windows version from 4.2 on conda forge. Cc @quantshah.
Hi @TejasAvinashShetty, I had a try at the conda install on my machine. I had no issue:
Can you please specify your machine configuration and what did you do to update the environment?
I guess I am unable to reproduce the issue unless I go back to qutip 4.2.
Googling "np113py36_2", I ended up on this QuTiP Google Group thread, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qutip/BwtoyhW60jo
maybe making sure you are not in the QuTiP folder resolves the issue.
You can also activate your environment, uninstall qutip, update all the rest and then install qutip
Another practical suggestion, not really assessing the issue, would be to create a new environment and do a fresh install.
I had a glance at the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qutip/BwtoyhW60jo ,. i don't think so my issue is as serious as stated in the above link. I am not in the folder of qutip.On trying to update this is what I get.

Reinstalling fixes the issue. though there may be better ways to go about this for e.g.
