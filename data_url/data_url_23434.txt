Would expect the plot to have x axis time, y axis frequency and colour plot magnitude
In MatPlot it gives an error:

In QtPlot It writes the correct names on the axes but doesnt transpose the plot and makes up values for the axes to correspond to the shape
ie qc.MatPlot(data.VNA_magnitude) gives

and qc.MatPlot(data.VNA_time, data.VNA_frequency, data.VNA_magnitude) gives

Same system works fine for 1d plot axis switching in tutorial notebook

I ran into the same thing, and ended up ignoring it because it failed, then I forgot about this :( .
The problem is:
The z-array is a 2d-array.
The x, and y axes in the plot are just rescaled/relabeled from the xy arrays.
The plot then just plots the data as pixels. If the rescaling of x or y failed to the number of points on z, it wil revert to only show the index, which is why your x-axis has 200 points in your second screenshot, while it had 50 points on y in your first plot.
@alexcjohnson Is this understanding correct?
@alexcjohnson @giulioungaretti I think this is a bug that needs a fix before release.
Thanks Merlin. I did notice how my axis just rescaled themselves to fit the pixels (which is pretty funny) but you definitely have a better understanding. Definitely agree that this should be fixed before release
and @nataliejpg  üç∑  for a superb bug report!
Its always good to have funny times... :)
I was playing around with interpolating data onto a grid a little while ago, and just checked it. That one takes care of realigning x and y correctly, however, we wont want to interpolate in all cases, especially not when we have x and y as setpoints...
