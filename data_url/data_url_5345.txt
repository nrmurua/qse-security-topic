Now we support expval of a sparse Hamiltonian (with Kokkos), but not for the adjoint differentiation method.
On the other hand, expval of a Hamiltonian involving Hermitian is not supported in the forward path (as default.qubit does not support it), but we support it in the adjoint differentiation method.
We now support expval(ham) in the forward path using Lightning's custom C++ backend. Still need to add backward support of a sparse Hamiltonian.
