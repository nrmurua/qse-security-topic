As Lightning compiled with GCC is better performing than with Clang, it is better to use GCC for building wheels for macOS. In addition, GCC supports new C++20/23 functionalities better. Still, for robustness, we may have a Clang test in CI.
Note: Due to how we now build for ARM on MacOS as in pr #306, GCC may complicate matters. We may need to await for M1 Action runners for this to be fully possible without cross-compilations.
