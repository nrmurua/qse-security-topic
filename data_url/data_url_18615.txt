An internally-voiced user request is to be able to parametrically compile generic two-qubit interactions. In a fully general interpretation this is too arithmetically complex a task to do on-the-fly, but #422 would permit support for the special case of a two-qubit interaction specified by a time-independent Hamiltonian. One could conjugate the Hamiltonian into the diagonal subgroup, parametrically compile the resulting diagonal operator, and decompose the static conjugation operators. The performance characteristics of the result will be slightly worse (≤ 8 CZs rather than the ≤ 3 CZs in the nonparametric case), but it might be better than nothing.
