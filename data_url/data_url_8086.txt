Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Sometimes qutip.mesolver generate rhs_**.pyx or cqobjevo_compiled_coeff_**.pyx files.
According to the docstring of solver.Options and rhs_generate, I guess rhs-things relate to string-format time-dependent Hamiltonian, but I couldn't find description about such files. I didn't know even a meaning of 'rhs' (abbreviation?).
So I suggest to add documents about them.
Especially, I have the following question:
Saving solver result with pickle module, and loading it sometimes fail, for example:
(I'm so sorry I haven't reproduce this behavior with simplest code, so the following is a dummy-code)
Note: I used pickle module instead of qsave/qload. I guess it's no difference because qsave uses pickle module internally.
rhs_**.pyx or cqobjevo_compiled_coeff_**.pyx are cython compiled function for string-format time-dependent systems.
rhs_**.pyx create a function for the right hand side (rhs) of the equation solved by the solver. It's now mostly used in brmesolve.
cqobjevo_compiled_coeff_**.pyx is used in QobjEvo with string coefficient.
Which version are you using?
QobjEvo should not be found in Results and QobjEvo can be pickle in recent version...
I'm sorry to forgot to show qutip version.
Software versions are following:
so qutip is latest one.
I mainly use mesolve and paralell_map (I haven't use brmesolve).
I can reproduce this problem.
(Note: environment is different of my previous reply, but qutip is latest 4.6.2)
I attached a notebook:
https://gist.github.com/KosukeMizuno/5f879603b6343a18fdf0dc50f3f8b7b0#file-checkpyx-ipynb
How to reproduce:
Looking at it, the issue is in sesolve which is called by mesovle when no c_ops are passed. It save the Hamiltonian in the results.
If you do
before pickling, it should work.
But I would suggest to extract the states as numpy arrays and use numpy.save. With it, the data should stay readable even if you update numpy or python, while any qutip (or scipy) update could make it impossible to unpickle Qobj.
At this time, I use your treatment, and it works.
Thank you very much.
