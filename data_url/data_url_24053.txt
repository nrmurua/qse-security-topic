From @marcolincs
This is already implemented in anchored_path.py and it is therefore used by both RouteAnchor and RouteSimple. This needs to be applied also to RouteMeanders. It also needs to take into consideration self intersection for RouteMixed........in general should move up into the QRoute and figure out how to ripple down to all routes
support all the route types
Also, looking at the unobstructed() method, it relies on component instance boundaries to be square: self.design.components[component].qgeometry_bounds()
this is an assumption that will not be possible all the time. needs to be generalized
support different shapes than squares
Also keepout has not been implemented, and it needs to be to make sure that keepout actually works constructively for fabrication
support keepout
Also need to add the points of the mixed route and the anchored route into the "visited" points of A start to prevent collision
support mixed PF
enhanced usability
Note:  There has been progress on this with https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metal/blob/main/tutorials/Appendix%20B%20Quick%20topics/Testing%20QComponents%20for%20overlap%20and%20collisions.ipynb
@nalanzil  has worked on this previously, when he gets bandwidth in the future.... this can be addressed again.
