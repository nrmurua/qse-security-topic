Given a simple quantum circuit consisting, e.g., of a single X gate which is converted to a gate and then transformed into a controlled gate, the current method returns a composed gate that consists of multiple 2-qubit and 1-qubit gates instead of, e.g., a CX.
produces
Return a CX
It seems as if the operation.name check in add_control.py cannot identify the respective gate as X, since the operation.name is set to circuit__.
I would like to give it a try if nobody else is working on this.
All yours, @faisaldebouni .
It seems this issue has been fixed as by-product in 8f717d9.  However that was only a superficial fix by increasing the lookup table for gates we can efficiently control. The correct way would be to improve the synthesis of controlled operations, I'll open a new issue for that.
