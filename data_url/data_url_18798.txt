OpenQASM needs a logo!
Hi @silky, we had some discussion on this at the TSC meeting today. We are interested in this but want to do it the right way. Our initial thoughts were that there would be two ways to source a logo
For either option, there are some details that need to be sorted out primarily related to the logo and its ownership. It is currently unclear who ownership would be attributed to (eg., the OpenQASM foundation does not yet exist) and under what license the logo would be provided with.
Therefore, we will consider this issue as desired but on on hold for now. Other feedback on the issue is welcome ðŸ˜„ .
