In PR 539 : Updating notebooks validation script to exclude individual tasks, we excluded tasks in CHSHGame and MagicSquareGame because some tasks required implementing two code cells at once before running the test, so the first of the cells implemented is guaranteed to fail.
Currently, the following notebooks have a multicell_solution
We can enable those tests in the workbook by using raises-exception cell tag which runs the cell but ignores any exceptions encountered during the cell execution. Here is a sample PR : #805 which enables these tests in CHSH Workbook
However currently, we can only enable the Workbook tests and not the jupyter front-end notebook tests because KataMagic stores the results of its previous excutions whereas CheckKataMagic doesn't. For more details, here are the links KataMagic code and CheckKataMagic code
@tcNickolas, @anjbur, maybe we can do this small change in CheckKataMagic to store the results of previous tests, so that we can enable those tests. Thoughts?
We will be migrating the Katas to the new QDK that will use a different infrastructure (see https://devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp/introducing-the-azure-quantum-development-kit-preview/ for the announcement), so we won't continue to improve the existing infrastructure of Q# notebooks magics. Closing this issue as "won't fix".
Thanks @tcNickolas for your valuable guidance.
Looking forward to the new kata experience. Just had a look at https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/experience/quantum-katas, and the experience looks way more polished :-)
