Hi Alan
I put the steps into sections and clarified a few things. I removed the option to get Liquid from the browser, and just included the Clone from the Desktop Client which works.
However, I am not an expert on Markdown and the resulting document does not look as it should. I did not change any numbers of the steps, but they are all messed up when I choose view. I hope you can fix that.
Thanks
Judith
