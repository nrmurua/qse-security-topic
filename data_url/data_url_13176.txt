DDD works by first processing the input circuit to detect all idle windows, i.e., all the empty holes in the circuit where DDD sequences can be inserted.
The proposal of this issue is to identify identity gates applied to a qubit as idle moments. In the current situation an identity gate is considered as an actual gate and therefore Mitiq considers that moment as "occupied".
Two main motivations:
For some frontends (e.g. Qiskit), adding identities (or delay gates) is often the only way to artificially create idle windows (without creating barriers of 2-qubit gates). So it would be good to consider sequences of identities as proper idle windows.
DDD adds many identities to create a delay space between the sequence gates. If we implement this feature, we can recursively call  insert_ddd_sequences() to also fill such delay spaces with additional sequences.
