One needs htop to monitor cpu usage but it is cumbersome to install via sudo. Moreover if one does not have sudo privilage, it makes life hard. Can we ship containers with this installed as default please?
You can use top if htop is not provided
@zohimchandani You have sudo privileges in the container, see also the README in the container. You can install htop with the command sudo apt-get install htop.
