The Aqua build currently fails due to the copyright year checker, which asserts that the copyright year is (2018 for the year of the creation of Aqua)
However after confirming with @nonhermitian, the correct header would be
We should change the behaviour of the CI accordingly.
I think we have three possible options to change the current configuration
Options 1 and 2 are probably best. The problem with option 3 is that it can be difficult to infer the correct year of creation and if files are copied or the history is lost in some way, we cannot get the correct result.
The files should have first year of creation, and last year of modification if this is different than first year of creation. We do not check the year of creation only that the last year of modification is the same as the last commit date since as you point out history can be lost etc. The last year is checked since often when PRs were generated and code was created/changed the copyright was not changed when it should have been. This has been working in the build to date so we will have to look and see what happened with your PR.
