Needs investigation:
I haven't seen this yet. I'll post if I do.
Reproduced with https://github.com/hartytp/artiq/commits/master 10b87ac. Files here https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ag9X4YPcKLqjHQlhPCDs4oA3PyOB1KaS.
Conda build environment
broken_conda.txt
It would be really helpful if others with access to Sayma could try this out on their AMC/RTM.
Resetting artiq to current master (0b86225) and rebuilding gateware and firmware fixed this. Rebuilding just the firmware (with --no-comiple-gateware) did not seem to (although I will double check those observations tomorrow.
Since none of the changes I made touch the gateware, I'm at a loss to explain this.
Okay, this was some conda issue...
Is the buildbot working for Sayma now?
Check I/O timing numbers (reported by Vivado) at the flash pins.
AFAIK in case of @bradbqc it's the same bitstream that worked before and didn't work after flash.
In my case AFAIR when I had this bug and after clearing flash the same bitstream worked. I had this problem both on Kasli and on Sayma, @bradbqc has this problem on Sayma.
@marmeladapk Yes, except the flash failed, citing "Error: Cannot enable write to flash. Status=0x00000000." I'll try erasing and re-flashing and report back
Has anyone seen this with recent Vivado (2018.3)? I haven't.
Seems fixed AFAICT.
