It seems strange to bundle examples as part of the Cirq library. Any objections to moving these to either the docs/ directory or a top-level examples/ directory?
I'm leaning towards moving them to within the docs/ directory since that will make it easier to build tutorials out of them using the literalinclude directive.
I think moving examples to be a top-level directory makes sense.
Moving them to docs seems good.
