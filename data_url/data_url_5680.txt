Importing any qiskit.aer module will log several messages of the form:
Run the following Python program:
Importing a module ideally would not log any messages.
The easiest option here would be to change the backend detection code to run when the list of backends is requested, rather when in the constructor - happy to put a PR together for that.
There was an alternative solution proposed in Qiskit/qiskit#7498 (comment) which suggested (if I understand correctly) removing the assembling of circuits in available_methods/available_devices and replacing it with some metadata on the binary.
Instead of calling cpp_execute_qobj, calling cpp_execute_circuits will resolve this issue once #1717 is merged.
available_methods  is constant for a binary. However, available_devices depends on environment: ["CPU"] or ["CPU", "GPU", "Thrust"]. But just for checking availability of GPU, calling CPU and GPU may be not-small overheads.
