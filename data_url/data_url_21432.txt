Despite new Zync ZC706 FPGA+Evalation boards shipping with 64 GB SD cards to use with their FPGAs, current binary builds (zc706-nist_qc2-sd:134016) compiled and hosted on nixbld.m-labs.hk do not load from exFAT formatted memory.
FPGA boots using the binary file provided and is ready use in conjunction with an ARTIQ master session.
FPGA freezes on initialization and does not finish its boot sequence. It cannot send or recieve signals via artiq_coremgmt, nor can the OS interact with the card via network protocols. The board indicator lights show that initialization has not completed.
Using an SD card formatted in FAT32 allows the system to boot, but given that ARTIQ binaries are no longer working with hardware that Xilinx themselves are providing to use with new boards (exFAT formatted 64 GB cards), this does not seem like an ideal long-term solution.
I don't think this can be done, as far as I know the Xilinx BootROM which is burned into the chip and reads the bootloader from the SD card does not support ExFAT. But this is not a hardware problem, you can repartition/reformat the card as FAT32 using e.g. the parted and mkfs commands on Linux.
