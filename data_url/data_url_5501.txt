After the latest commit on the master branch I get the following error
The circuit file "ben_11_16_0.txt" assumes that you're using bristlecone_70 (thus the "70" at the top of the file). You'll need to use the corresponding ordering and grid files to run that circuit.
This behavior is intentional - the only reason this invocation worked before is because we were silently ignoring bad gates in the input. We'll need to update the relevant examples before resolving this issue.
i did not look at the file names...my bad...
