When using the four channel resp pulse submitted below, the last two masks are not registered in the hardware setup, resulting in an error upon execution. I made sure all masks and measurement are defined. The same pulse works if I only define two measurements A and B.
qctoolkit.hardware.dacs.alazar.AlazarCard._registered_programs.resp contains:
Python AlazarProgram with properties:
total_length: 192000000
masks: [1×2 py.list]
operations: [1×4 py.list]
<qctoolkit.hardware.dacs.alazar.AlazarProgram object at 0x0000000006840978>
The field operations contains the 4 defined operations with the correct maskIDs. However masks only contains the first two masks.
Here are the parameters I use:
And this is the pulse
resp.txt
This works:
resp.txt
I don't understand everything that is going on but it seems that the 2 masks are already lost when sequencing the pulse in sequencing.py, Sequencer.build
Right now I don't desperately need this to work since it works if I just use 2 measurements but I am guessing eventually we will want to do a pulse for which I cannot find a workaround.
This turned out to be a bug in the Matlab code which is fixed now
