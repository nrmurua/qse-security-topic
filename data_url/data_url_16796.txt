In parameterized ControlledGates like CU1, there are separate parameters associated with the ControlledGate and its base_gate. These should be references to each other, otherwise can lead to inconsistencies.
This may depend on whether #3773 is reverted in which case params are used sometimes to create an instance of the base gate class, although maybe that didn't work for custom gates.
