Some classes perform conversions or interpretations of a sequence of instructions. Most of them do so by accessing the instructions member of a InstructionBlock instead of the intended InstructionSequence object returned by InstructionBlock.compile_sequence(). This might be harmful in the case of embedded Blocks and needs to be changed.
Sequencer.build() should directly return a compiled InstrucitonSequence instead of the InstructionBlock used during construction. This is considered an error.
