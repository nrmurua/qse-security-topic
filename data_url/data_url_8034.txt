It seems that VS Code does not support render both basic texts and Latex together. On the other hand, the latex code generated by repr_latex is not compatible with Katex (the render engine of Latex used in VS Code).
I tried to modify the code, and the output in VS Code works.
(The style is not beautiful, waiting for someone else to improve the code~)

This code can also be compatible with Jupyter Lab.

Is anyone working on this? I see no assignee, and it would be nice to get this feature on a stable release.
@drodper If you would be up for creating a pull request with the code changes, we can review and perhaps including in 4.7.1.
@hiliuzheng Care to share the code you changed to get the renderings above?
