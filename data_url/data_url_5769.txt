I am executing circuit with different sizes and I want to know which is the biggest circuit that I can execute with the available memory.
I get this message:
qiskit.exceptions.QiskitError: 'ERROR:  [Experiment 0] Insufficient memory to run circuit circuit-10 using the statevector simulator. ,  ERROR: Insufficient memory to run circuit circuit-10 using the statevector simulator.'
The expected behaviour is to know which is the required memory to execute the circuit. Something similar to:
qiskit.exceptions.QiskitError: 'ERROR:  [Experiment 0] Memory available [SYSTEM_MEMORY_GB]  gb is insufficient to run circuit circuit-10 which requires [required_memory_mb] mb using the statevector simulator. ,  ERROR: Insufficient memory to run circuit circuit-10 using the statevector simulator.'
I suppose that it is just to get the value of the variable used to do the comparison (if required_memory > available_memory) raise exception. But I can't find the variable required_memory.
Thank you!
