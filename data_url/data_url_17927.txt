The tutorials mention three simulators available as part of QISKit: local, state vector and unitary simulators. However, the tutorials don’t detail their capabilities or limitations, so it is hard to determine which simulator best suits your application.
Recommend an explanation of each simulators’ function with examples of use cases be collocated with the tutorials to streamline the user experience.
The 3 types of simulators are:
1- QASM simulator (name might change): it simulates a generic circuit for a number of shots, and returns counts. Similar to an experiment.
2- Statevector simulator: gives you the statevector(wavefunction) resulting from the evolution of the 0 state through that circuit. Takes only 1 shots. no measure/reset.
3- Unitary simulator: gives the unitary equivalent of a given circuit. only 1 shot. no measure/reset.
These are described in the Medium blog post that accompanied the 0.5 release:

The source files in Terra also contain docstrings that describe them. See simulator python files in qiskit/backends/local/.
Perhaps we can do a better job explaining the simulators in the tutorials as well. But I'm closing the issue here as not related to Terra.
A couple of tiny comments:
Should we add this information to our docs and point to the blogpost in the docs? If that's the case we could keep this open to track those efforts. What do you think @ajavadia ?
@delapuente sure but I would open just a single epic for documentation improvement, and put in there a list of things that need better explaining. Because I think there are multiple enhancements needed in the docs, and opening individual issues can become messy.
I've opened #928 for tracking the documentation epic. Personally, I think keeping separated, small issues, is better for sharing and tracking the effort but I don't mind to keep this closed.
