Need of resizing the entire graph layout to make it more easier for the user to view. Currently the graph takes the whole page as dimension and sometimes goes behind the lattice side bar.
Plan of action:
1.Re-size the graph to make sure it is decoupled with the lattice side bar view
2.Secondary option would be to keep the lattice drawer closed and have the graph take the whole page size
@Prasy12  - Pls populate this issue with details.
Please add your planning poker estimate with ZenHub @Prasy12
@Prasy12 assume this is fixed as well?
