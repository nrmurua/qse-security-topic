When the buildbot builds the gateware (which embeds artiq.__version__): 8 characters
When installing the conda package and using artiq.__version__: 9 characters
When setuptools is not involved (importing artiq via PYTHONPATH): 8 characters
See also #738
For maximum obnoxiousness, the 9-character bug only appears when the conda package is built by the buildbot, when doing a local conda build it has the correct 8 characters.
Different versions of git locally and on the buildbot: git/git@e6c587c
Thanks.
