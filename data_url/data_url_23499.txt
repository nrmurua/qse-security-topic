The legacy API to be imported into the qcodes namespace:  https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/29646a80d63da3b1f1c54503e031ef5fcab59b5a/qcodes/__init__.py#L24-L50
qcodes not imported due to circular import in type annotations:
I realize I can just import the legacy modules directly, but this config option should probably either be fixed or removed.
It would be helpful to provide such information:
operating system
MacOS Monterey 12.1
If you are using a released version of qcodes (recommended):
qcodes version: 0.31.0
@loganbvh thanks for the bug report this should be fixed by #3781 (But that will also deprecate this option going forward so I would recommend updating the imports to not use this option)
