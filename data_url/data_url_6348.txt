Qiskit has published a new release, and our old version of their unit tests for our plugin use deprecated API methods. We should grab the latest version of their Aer unit tests and modify them to use the Qrack plugin, again, which should remove the deprecated methods.
This has been updated, but there are still some deprecation warnings in the unit test that I would like to fix, if the dependency tree allows it.
We currently fully support our Qiskit plugin, and pass all unit tests, based on PyQrack.
