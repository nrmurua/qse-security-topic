When trying to run this gallery notebook, at first execution of the line:
the kernel dies with the error:
Ubuntu Linux 16.04
Thanks @artix41. We've had this reported through other channels the last week or so, and it looks like a bug in TensorFlow v1.6; specifically, this bug is related to taking the tf.conj() function. While we're still tracking it down, a solution is to temporarily downgrade to TensorFlow v1.3
Ok, thanks for you quick reply, I will use TF 1.3 in the meantime.
