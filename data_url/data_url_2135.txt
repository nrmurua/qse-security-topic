For example, try pytest cirq/ops/fsim_gate_test.py:
I've narrowed this down to the line import qiskit inside of the qasm compatibility tests. I've confirmed that a python file containing nothing except import qiskit prints the segfault message.
Best guess: the version we are targeting has bit-rotted and we need to bump it.
I just ran that on my machine and didn't get a segfault. For reference I have qiskit 0.6.1 and qiskit aer 0.3.2 installed on my venv. What versions do you have ?
Those ones. Very strange.
I also wasn't able to update qiskit without blowing away my virtual environment first. Regardless, I'm not seeing the issue anymore after increasing the qiskit version to 0.13. So I'll consider this issue closed once that gets merged.
