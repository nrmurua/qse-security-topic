Thanks for the issue, this clip needs to be updated.
One needs to import SymEngine explicitly to use the symbolic features.
Got new one (error) after added SymEngine Pkg (at 03:40),


but the result it's fine (at 03:53)

@basernapairs you can't use a number as symbols, please refer to SymEngine README: https://github.com/symengine/SymEngine.jl#working-with-scalar-variables
Thanks for the issue, this clip needs to be updated.
@GiggleLiu have we updated the GIF?
bump @GiggleLiu can you update that GIF if it's not then we can close this issue?
The clip has been updated, please check the updated tutorial: https://tutorials.yaoquantum.org/dev/
