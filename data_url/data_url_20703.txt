Provide CI testing for the OQS fork
@smashra, are you planning to update the scripts you circulated on the dev mailing list yesterday?
I tried to enable travis on OpenSSL, but I can't figure out how. I logged in travis but the open-quantum-safe projects were not listed in the list of projects I could travis-enable. It might be because I don't have the right github ownership/permissions for this project? @smashra, @dstebila; can one of you can try to turn on travis? The OpenSSL project already has a travis test suites (and also an appveyor one); so we should turn these to make sure our PRs don't break the main OpenSSL functionality. As a step 2, we can add some OQS tests.
I've turned Travis on for this repository.
@smashra and I were discussing whether/how to trigger OpenSSL/OpenSSH integration tests when just a liboqs commit is made.  I noticed in the Travis settings it's possible to set a cron job to regularly build a repository.  But also we might want to add Travis target(s) in each of the liboqs master and nist .travis.yml files that runs the integration test script(s).
This is being handled by open-quantum-safe/ci-containers#9.
