When you're declaring a method using pybind, the define call can be given a string, which is the doc string of the method or the class. These doc strings can be viewed in editors like pycharm, or by inspecting the __doc__ of a class or function. This is generally a pretty handy way to document methods because it gives focused help. It also gives you the opportunity to define doctest examples. Those are just short snippets of example code that you can use the doctest module to run and verify that they work.
I've also found docstrings handy for autogenerating web documentation. E.g. stim's simple api reference page  is generated by iterating over the module looking for doc strings.
Thanks for the tip, agree that it would be good to add these
This is fixed in the PyMatching v0.4.0 release
