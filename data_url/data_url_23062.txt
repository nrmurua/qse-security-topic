See my question: ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues#2682
Answer: we should sooner or later upgrade to pyqt5 :(
or use this: https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy
qtpy is available from conda
I will try to handle the transition in a separate branch pyqt5
Done, I just made a pull request (also I allowed myself to push some minor changes on master because there were some annoying bugs left)
