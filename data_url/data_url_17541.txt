Using Aer instead of BasicAer works.
Hmm, I ran that exact script locally and got:
Which is the expected result.
Same as @mtreinish.
I get the failure locally (which doesn't bother me much, because I use Aer).
I also get it at Google Colab (which bothers me more, because I'm using it for exercise classes).
The same thing also happens in Trinket.
I've downgraded to 0.6 as a workaround, but obviously that's not ideal.
Can confirm that this is a bug in 0.7.  It does appear to be fixed in master though. I believe in #1624.
Any chance that this could be patched into stable? It's a bit embarrassing if I have to teach the course using 0.6, and it doesn't seem like a good idea to teach it out of master.
@ajavadia ?
I confirmed that #1624 fixes this issue.
@quantumjim It may be an option to use LegacySimulators instead of BasicAer. Although it shows a deprecation warning, it returns a correct result. Anyway, I think Aer is the best option.
@mtreinish can you patch this into 0.7 i think this should be as @quantumjim says.
I've pushed a backport of #1624 to the stable branch here: #1859 we can merge that and release it as 0.7.1.
Ok, this should be fixed in qiskit-terra 0.7.1, the wheels (ie binaries with the legacy simulator) for mac and windows are still being built and will be uploaded shortly. But as long as you're not on those platforms or you don't need the legacy simulators it'll work for you now.
Mac wheels are up now, just waiting on windows.
And now windows wheels are up.
