I ran into an issue where if I have a blank line after @kernel I get an error message with
However, if I have a comment with
That works fine for the rest of the script. I was just wondering why that was the case and if it was possible to get a more descriptive error message if there's a line between @kernel and the function proceeding it.
Reproduced.
No, not for 1.0. To solve this properly requires parsing the entire file, which means adding support for async/await to pythonparser.
How does fixing this require parsing the entire file?
Because right now methods are extracted with a hack that doesn't recognize almost all variants of decorators. Python doesn't give you an API to get an entire span of the method, only the first line.
My compiler used inspect.getsource and ignored the decorators without any problems. Why did you change this?
I didn't.
Ah, nevermind, this is just a bug in pythonparser. Easy to fix.
Well inspect.getsource handles spaces after decorators just fine. So why does it break?
@r-srinivas sidenote: proper coding style won't allow you to do that anyway.
Actually pythonparser is fine, this was just an embedding problem.
