cirq 0.4.0 has requirement matplotlib~=2.2, but you'll have matplotlib 3.0.2 which is incompatible.
You have matplotlib 3.0.2 but we use ~2.2. Let me know if it works after pip install --ignore-installed matplotlib==2.2.
As far as I know, we don't know that Cirq is incompatible with matplotlib 3.0.2; we just haven't tested it. If the tests pass then I think it's safe to ignore that message.
@Strilanc Any reason for sticking to ~=2.2?
Hey @jiapei100, did you run into a problem using matplotlib 3.0.2 with Cirq?
Closing. Feel free to re-open if you run into matplotlib version problems.
