I added artiq-full.novatech409b in my nix environment. I get the following error.
I see similar errors for artiq-full.korad_ka3005p and lda.
Please post the exact nix-shell file (and exact other commands if applicable) that can be used to reproduce the problem.
Looking at this bug, I'd assume that the issue is that the test directory of python3Packages.lda and python3Packages.novatech409b is being copied to the outputs ($out), causing a conflict. This issue is resolved on newer versions of nixpkgs with https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/development/interpreters/python/hooks/python-remove-tests-dir-hook.sh, but it apparently didn't make it to nixos-20.03 (actually, this hook still wouldn't resolve the issue b/c the test directory is called "test" and not "tests" as the hook expects).
This is probably an issue with the MLabs nix-scripts repo, and can be resolved with adding something like postFixup = "rm -rf $out/${python.sitePackages}/test" to those packages.
fixed
Confirmed. Thanks!
