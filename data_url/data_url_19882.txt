#1585 updates HQC to the 2023-04-30 (currently latest) version, but it only includes a "clean" portable C implementation. An optimized AVX2 implementation is available from https://pqc-hqc.org, although it has a couple of known issues (see #995, PQClean/PQClean#482) similar to those of the original implementation. We should patch these issues and pull the AVX2 implementation in.
Most likely we would want to go the same route as we did for the "clean" implementation: merge into PQClean and then run copy_from_upstream.
