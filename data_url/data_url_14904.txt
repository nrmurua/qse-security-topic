Hi guys,
Thanks for all of your great work. I wanted to point out something that I see might be an inconsistency in the Qiskit documentation.
In the documentation for Qiskit's DAGCircuit, there is a method called "successors" which is defined as:
"Returns iterator of the successors of a node as DAGOpNodes and DAGOutNodes."
This function in practice returns the direct successors to the node in question (i.e. nodes that are a single out-edge away).
However, for the class DAGDependency, there is also a method called "successors" which is defined as:
"Successors id of a given node as sorted list."
This function, while sounding analogous to the one for DAGCircuit, actually returns a sorted list of ALL successors for the given node, no matter how many out-edges away it might be.
The analog can be said for the "predecessors" functions of the two classes.
This is an issue since it is unclear which nodes are either iterated on or returned in a list: All successors/predecessors or just direct ones.
I think an easy/elegant solution would be to add a few words in the documentation of the functions stating specifically how many layers of ancestors/predecessors they return.
Thanks again!

Thanks @Jason-Ludmir. This inconsistency between the DAGCircuit and DAGDependency APIs was bugging me as well for a long time. Starting by improving documentation is a great suggestion. Would you be interested to submit a fix?
Hi @alexanderivrii sure, that sounds good!
@Jason-Ludmir, great, I have assigned you to this issue.
@Jason-Ludmir Let me know if I can lend you a hand.
Has there been any progress on this issue? If possible, I would like to work on this issue as well.
I want to work on it. Tell me how do i get started
