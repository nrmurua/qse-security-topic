Is there a best-practice way to manage credentials (for rigetti/ibm or other backend) when running xacc in a docker container?
Looking at the compose documentation it might be useful to just add a read-only volume and point xacc to that location to look for credentials. Is this currently something I can set from the python API? Like have a xacc_credential_dir variable or something?
Yea from within the docker container, just run
For IBM
or
For Rigetti
Make sure the xacc python module is in your PYTHONPATH
Alright, that sounds fine. I was just imagining something more streamlined, but this probably makes the most sense.
Thanks. I'm gonna close this.
