We currently resolve region (using Metadata API) during Client construction. If proxy or permissive_ssl options are required for Metadata API requests (in addition to SAPI requests), region resolution (and Client init) will fail as those options are not parsed in time.
Implementing #505 will fully resolve this, but we might want to address it with a partial fix sooner.
Temporary workaround is to explicitly specify endpoint, in which case endpoint/region is not resolved (and request to Metadata API is never made).
