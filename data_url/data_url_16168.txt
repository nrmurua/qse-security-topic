Opflow yields wrong results when calculating probabilities such as in the example below. As seen there, the results are always correct when converting into matrix form or (not shown below) when using a quantum circuit in place of phi.
Thank you for the issue. I am sorry. This is due to my mistake. This will be fixed by #5623.
Thank you!
