Module pyquil/quantum_processor/transformers/qcs_isa_to_compiler_isa.py requires the ISA to publish benchmark, including the "randomized_benchmark_simultaneous_1q" results for the purpose of informing Quil-C of fidelities. However, this information should be treated as optional; Quil-C can compile without fidelity information.
The error is reproduced by calling qc.compiler.quantum_processor.to_compiler_isa(), but is sensitive to the target device.
