In #540, we restricted the SciPy version to be <1.11 because it was breaking Qutip. Now that Qutip 4.7.2 was released with a fix for this, we can relax that restriction by enforcing that qutip ~= 4.7.2.
Why should it be qutip ~= 4.7.2 and not qutip >= 4.7.2 ? Because everything works with version 4 ?
Well, only because I'm kind of tired of qutip dependencies always conflicting with other packages, this way it is more controlled (since qutip ~= 4.7.2 is equivalent to   qutip >= 4.7.2, <4. 8)
Great ! I was just wondering haha
