Hello @amirebrahimi, thank you for your interest in Mitiq!
If this is a bug report, please provide screenshots and/or minimum viable code to reproduce your issue, so we can do our best to help get it fixed. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can also ask us on the Unitary Fund Discord.
Thanks @amirebrahimi. This is not a bug because, from the docstring of execute_with_cdr:

(The circuit in this example contains a CZPowGate.)
However, this is an important matter of usability. The long-term goal is support for any gates (e.g., by compiling the input circuit) so this example will work. In the short-term, I suggest we make the error message clearer here by checking if the circuit is compiled to the right gateset.
To use CDR with circuits that contain CZPowGates, you will need to compile the gates into {Rz, sqrt(X), CNOT}.
I also noticed the docstring for execute_with_cdr does not appear at https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#module-mitiq.cdr.clifford_training_data. This should also be fixed.
Thanks for the clarification. Feel free to close this or use it as an issue for creating a clearer error message / fixing docs.
This issue had no activity for 4 months, and will be closed in 2 weeks unless there is new activity. Cheers!
