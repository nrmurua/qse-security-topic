In #375 some functional abstraction was added around parsing/serializing rewiring comments to/from strings/vectors.
Perhaps a better idea is to represent rewiring comments as a structs and provider a PRINT-OBJECT method or some such so that they can be printed in PRINT-PARSED-PROGRAM (or anywhere else).

Alternatively (to much of this file), rewiring-comment could actually be a struct that stores the tag and the two vectors directly, and then you teach the printer how to turn it into the appropriate string. I don't think we often make the assumption that comments are literally stringsâ€”just that they're printable objects.
Note to the PR assignee: we already do something similar for PRAGMAs in the files define-pragma.lisp and pragmas.lisp. I'd look there to get started.
