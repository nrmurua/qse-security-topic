Importing Aer raises a ValueError when using numpy 1.18.1:
Install qiskit 0.23.5, numpy 1.18.1, import Aer.
Aer can be imported.
This error goes away after upgrading to numpy 1.20. Was the failing file compiled with numpy 1.20 and the requirement needs to be updated?
This is a duplicate of #1120 it should be fixed on master for the 0.8 with #1125 but for the 0.7.x series I'm working on #1123 to use a minimum supported numpy version for the release binary builds instead of the latest numpy release. #1125 isn't backportable because the 0.7.x series is directly using the numpy api via cython code in the pulse simulator (which is where this error is coming from) which has been removed from master.
