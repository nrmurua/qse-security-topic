Should print braket circuit w/o IndexError
It seeems like we're not correctly handling conversion of a cirq.ops.MatrixGate in _to_one_qubit_braket_instruction()
Because, converting the above qiskit back to cirq and then braket again seems to solve the problem. See below.
However, in this re-conversion, I believe the cirq gate is now a U gate instead of a MatrixGate, which is why it might work for this backdoor approach.
First attempt at a fix could be to try and add a conditional in the braket conversion function linked above that checks for the MatrixGate type, and handles it explicitly. Although, it's interesting how it fails on the print, rather than on the conversion itself. Would also be curious to see if this issue also persists converting cirq.ops.MatrixGate for > 1 qubit.
