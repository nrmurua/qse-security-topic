For an alpha release we'll want to ensure at least that:
It will be useful to have that version on PyPI â€“ it will also match the first Github release. We'll then update with the subsequent release signaling the closing of this milestone Alpha v4 (on both PyPI and GH, and possibly also on conda-forge if we wish).
@willzeng @rmlarose @andreamari can you please test locally that the Test PyPI version works for you or you can reproduce my error (I'm on mac)?
You can do in a new environment:
The following error appears:
both for python 3.7 and 3.8 fresh new conda environments.
I faintly remember encountering a similar issue for version 0.0.0.
When this is sorted out, I'll update also on PyPI.
I followed these instructions and got this error:
Am on Python 3.7.2
Regarding github pages vs. readthedocs. I'm fine either way, just pick whichever you'll find easier. $5 a month is no big deal
@nathanshammah I get for both cases (Python 3.7 and 3.8) the same error as Will:
@willzeng @andreamari please retry with
It looks like testpypi is looking for the required dependencies therein (indeed numpy is there only for v. 1.9) instead that on the real pypi.
@nathanshammah it works for me!
@nathanshammah This worked for me as well. Should we be thinking about upgrading our numpy dependency? We could make a separate issue for that.
