In tsp.py, a check for a valid route returns true if and only if (len(route) == len(set(G))) is true (line 214).  However, since route is initialized (line 104) as route = [None]*len(G), the statement will always be true.
The feasibility check is always returning true, regardless of whether or not the returned answer is a valid route.
