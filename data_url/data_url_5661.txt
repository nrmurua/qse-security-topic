Aersimulator run and estimator do not work when method=extended_stabilizer
This small script shows what is happening:
All of the above cases should run without any problem.
In all failure cases, the problem appears when trying to get the global phase of the circuit at a point when the parameters are unbound:
So probably it needs to be done before explicitly, note however, this would not explain why with other methods is working.
Thank you for your report. @ikkoham thankfully identified the root cause of this issue with a small test case as follows:
In transpliation with extended_stabilizer method, this global _phase is modified with parameterized values, but current Aer does not have implementation for this parameterization. I guess that this bug is since Aer began :-). Thank you for your reporting.
#1814 closes this issue.
