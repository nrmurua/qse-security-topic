Hello, I am trying to make a ConnectionPlus to a database. I am then using this to open a dataset by its id.
However when I run this I get an error.
When investigating this error it seems that the variable db I have initialized is a sqlite3.Connection object and not a ConnectionPlus object.
Am I using the connect function wrong? I want to be able to initialize this in a way that it closes to reduce the chance of keeping my datasets. If someone has advice about how I should handle this that would be greatly appreciated.
