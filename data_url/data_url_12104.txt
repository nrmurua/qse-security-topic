Running on IBMQ Experience,
When creating a new Qiskit Notebook, the tab is initialized to Untitled.ipynb, when renaming the notebook, the tab is not updated. Even after a refresh of the page.
Also, the notebook name does not get updated in the list view of notebooks unless you refresh  the notebook list page.
This is an issue for the internal IQX notebook team, and cannot be addressed here.
