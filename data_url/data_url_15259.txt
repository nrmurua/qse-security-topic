The deprecation warning raised from the Bit.index and Bit.register [0] tell users to inspect circuit registers to find where each given Bit is located, but it is not clear from the message how to do that, or that there exists a convenience method QuantumCircuit.find_bit [1] to automate this process.

The deprecation warning should inform users that they can use QuantumCircuit.find_bit to cover cases where they would need Bit.index and Bit.register, and potentially include an example of how to do so.
No response
tbh I think we need to be making it a larger priority to ensure that Bit.index and Bit.register aren't ever used in any Terra code - the deprecation warning has been in since (I think?) before I even joined, yet there's still parts of Terra that use it (I assume - there's still warning suppressions for it in the test suite, which is another thing I have a problem with!).
In the interim, it certainly doesn't hurt to give users more indication of what the correct paths are now, by adding this sort of error message.
From a technical perspective: their existence perpetuates a false model of how registers in circuits work now, and it makes it too easy to attempt to work with bits incorrectly; there's lots of extant code that assumes (in many forms, not just this) that QuantumCircuit(*qc.qregs, *qc.cregs) is a valid way to copy all the resources from one circuit into another.  That's going to hurt us with dynamic circuits more and more, where bits might be shared between multiple registers / not in registers at all.  The old form of "bits are owned by registers" isn't true any more, and Bit.index and .register are remnants of it.
I don't know why, but something triggered this issue to re-appear in my notifications.  It's especially pertinent, since there was an outage of Qiskit Runtime for dynamic circuits last month that was caused by the use of the deprecated functionality here.  I've made #9706 to update the error message, and I'll look at removing all usage of these methods from Terra as well.

It should be because of me. I posted a comment and deleted when I figured out the solution.
I was struggling with finding the index of a qubit using QuantumCircuit.find_bit() because Qubit.index was giving Deprecation warning. After some trials, I figured how to do it. Basically, QuantumCircuit.find_bit(qubits).index worked for me. Here, qubits is the Qubit class in qiskit, which contains information on number of qubits, name of the qubit and the index.
As @kdk mentioned, it is not clear how to do that. An example would be handy.
Thanks for the PR #9706 as well.

Ah that would explain it thanks!  No worries, I was just curious about what had happened, and I'm happy it did pop up for me, because I did need a kick to remember to do this.
