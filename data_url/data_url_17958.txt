Adding validation against the Qobj schema (#651) to the JSON payloads submitted to the backends revealed that Qiskit is producing non-conformant Qobj instances. In particular, Qiskit still does not use the bfunc instruction for boolean conditions and does not implement any extension mechanism. To fully use Qobj, Qiskit should:
We also need to provide some extension mechanism to produce the proper Qobj for instruction extensions such as snapshot:
See the status of #861 before sending bfunc instructions to backends.
Closing the issue after conversations with @jaygambetta , as we have probably diverged a bit from the plans about specs as a whole since the creation of the issue. In particular, having a generic mechanism for extending the specs (ie. not specific to the implementation in terra, but wider scope) appears to be less critical currently, and if needed it might be just easier to restart the attempt in another issue, with a fresh approach.
