Need to remove pyquil-protect decorator from the docs, as it is being removed from pyQuil.
I would hold up on this. While pyquil_protect is causing some speed issues, there are multiple solutiont to ameliorate this. One solution is to selectively enable/disable it for some functions. Another is a global flag to enable/disable debugging. Users should have a choice.
Good point, will scope out (and keep for now). Thx @tarballs-are-good
