At the moment, we can only call to_matrix on gates that have the method implemented and the matrix representation hardcoded. However we are able to return the matrix representation for any gate. We even have the functionality for controlled gates implemented in qiskit.extensions.unitary._compute_control_matrix. This would also support setting the state of the control qubits.
Why do we not add a default implementation of to_matrix in the gate class that uses this functionality?
This is the same as #3469. We can do it after adding phase to gates/circuits (#3930). Otherwise there will be discrepancy between "definition" and "to_matrix"
True, the matrix representation should be exact. Let's wait for the global phase PR, then üëç
global phase was added, I think, in #4565. Therefore, removing on hold.
I think almost all gates do have to_matrix now, only the multi-controlled ones don't have it. But since they should go to the circuit library anyways (right?) they won't have the to_matrix method.
