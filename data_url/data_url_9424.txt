cumsum evolution does not converge with dt
discrete evolution cache has trouble with running simulation
now #33 is merged, this should in principle be fixed, can you post the exact MWE of that error? so that we can test against
I'm closing this since it seems to be fixed in the adiabatic example, but please open a new issue if you find the problem still exists later in your own case
