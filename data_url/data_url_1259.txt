Description of the issue
Terminal measurements seem to affect the final state vector, which makes them different from the case when measurements don't exist.
How to reproduce the issue
Outputs:
The value depends on the seed I specify to the simulator.
I was expecting it to be
Cirq version
1.0.0
I might have misremembered things. The qsimcirq documentation says this:
simulate only executes the circuit once.
Sampling from the resulting state is fast, but if there are intermediate measurements the final state vector depends on the results of those measurements.
But this optimization seems to be specific to qsimcirq only. I tested the code above on qsimcirq and encountered the same behavior.
And so, the statement is inaccurate, based on my finding. "... if there are intermediate measurements  ..." -- it should be any measurements, not just intermediate measurements.

@tanujkhattar it would be great to know why the discussion outcome is wont-fix.
