Measuring two different ParametersWithSetpoints (say pws1, pws2) in one measurement fails when pws1 has p1 as setpoints and pws2 has p1 and p2 as setpoints. Individual measurements of pws1 and pws2 are running smoothly.
I will attach a jupyternotebook with an example.
Measurement should complete with measuring the 1D and the 2D parameter.
Measurement fails with the following error:
ValueError: Incompatible shapes. Parameter data1d has shape (3,), but its setpoint t has shape (3, 2).

There is a jupyter notebook in the zip file. I also post the code below.

Yes I think that is an unfortunate limitation of how the dataset is designed. I am not sure how straight forward this would be to solve. Going forward we are intending to make it easier for users create individual datasets for each measurement and encourage that a dataset only contains measured parameters with the same shape. This can currently be done with the measurement context manager interface. The intention is to add this to the generalized dond functions here #3186 as well. This should land before the next qcodes release.
Thanks @jenshnielsen for the rapid response.
But I am not sure if I fully understand correctly. Is it a general limitation that one can only measure parameters with the same shape? Because I am only running into the problem of the above example if they share the same setpoints. It seems to me that there is something wrong in the determination of the setpoints of a parameter during the measurement.
The two lines just differ in the order of the parameters to measure:
--> it seems registering the second parameter somehow overwrites the setpoint shape of the first one.
Example with a different setpoint but still different shapes:
