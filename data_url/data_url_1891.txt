Is it just me or is the name "study" confusing? I always forget what is and is not in it. Usually I confuse it with "value." Perhaps it makes sense to merge the two?
I find it confusing too :) Though there is some merit to naming it study: in a study of a circuit you parametrize the circuit, sweep through those parameters and when you measure it you have the trial results that you can evaluate based on each parameter combination, which then you can visualize as well. But it's probably too broad.
An idea could be to:
I just don't like how generic these package names are.
No objections on Cirq Cynque, suggestions:
param -> params
result -> results
@balopat I can work on this.  Since it would be a breaking change, should we leave deprecated wrappers to the new classes and functions in study?  I imagine flatten_expressions would go in params.
Thank you @thanacles - good question....
We might have to do this in two steps:
Adding triage discuss to this.  I think we should either rename before 1.0 or close this issue.
I'm fine with close this.
