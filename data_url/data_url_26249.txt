Given a collection of vectors, create two separate functions that calculate the inner product and outer product of those vectors.
This function should be placed in matrix_ops/inner_product.py and matrix_ops/outer_product.py. These should have a corresponding test suite in tests/test_matrix_props/test_inner_product.py and tests/test_matrix_props/test_outer_product.py
For inspiration, one can refer to the inner product and outer product functions as provided by Rigetti Forest. If these functions are used as inspiration or as templates, then proper credit should be included in the description of the functions.
Closing as complete.
