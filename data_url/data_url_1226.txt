Description of the issue
It seems as though cirq_google.Foxtail was deprecated with the XmonDevices #5483
but is still referenced once or twice in docs, e.g. 
follow-up from QCSE: https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/32782/attributeerror-module-cirq-google-has-no-attribute-foxtail/32785#32785
Can this issue assigned to me?
