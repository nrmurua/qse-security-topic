Many of the features in the pulse optimization module are difficult to use, or poorly documented.
For example, for the functions optimize_pulse and optimize_pulse_unitary there are 'params' arguments for many of the underlying classes, but it's not at all clear what count as valid key value pairs for each class.
As a further example, dyn_params is passed to a Dynamics object which stores it locally in self.params, but there isn't any checking of valid keys and values, and I can't find a function which actually uses whatever these params are set to. It's really difficult to run a top-level routine that creates all these objects which you have no clear control over.
