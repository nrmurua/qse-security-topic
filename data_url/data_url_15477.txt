Deprecate circuit_indices and observable_indices in the primitive base classes and reference implementation and replace them with actual circuits and observables.
Both indices and actual circuits and observables should be supported.
circuits=[0, 1, 2] or circuits=[qc]*3
observables=[0, 1, 2] or observables=[H1]*3

FYI: Hamamura-san is developing a PoC of a decorator approach to allow objects as indices. #8035
#8065 supports this.
