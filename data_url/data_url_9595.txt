I am thinking of adding a feature to the Sequence.draw() method in order to be able to export the generated figure like plt.savefig().
Looks like an interesting option. I personally tweaked the code when adding pictures for the ArXiv note in order to change size, resolution or output type; it was basically a matter setting kwargs in the plt.plot() method (which is hidden from the user at the time). Maybe adding that choice in _seq_drawer could be a way to proceed.
In fact, the same feature could be added potentially to all plotting methods. What do you think?

I think we should consider carefully what parameters and options are actually useful. I think that the ability to save the figure to a file is useful, and perhaps we should also give access to some of the relevant parameters of plt.savefig(), but probably not all indiscriminately.
What if we suppress the plt.show() at the end of the _seq_drawer and return the current Axes ? In this way it is an object that the user can later manipulate.
Yes, but it will break the existing usage. I say make _seq_drawer return the Axes, and then have a method that draws it (Sequence.draw). and one that saves the plot (Sequence.savefig)
It's (kinda) what's already done in Pulse.draw() and Waveform.draw(), without the method to save
It could be also nice to export the register figures
