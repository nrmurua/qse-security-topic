Cuda gives an invalid configuration error when using the statevector GPU simulator with a large number of qubits (more than 30 in my case).
Note that AerPauliExpectation is used and not until n=36 the memory becomes insufficient:
The simulator should be able to evaluate the QAOA energy like it does when n=30 or below.
This issue is caused because Aer tries allocating chunks in all free memory on GPU for hybrid parallelization. I will make fix to allocate chunks about 80% of free memory.
