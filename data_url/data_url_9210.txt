I attempted to compile and run a short example program using qcgpu-rust and received the following panic when creating a new state.  I don't have any experience using OpenCL, so I'm unsure whether my particular OpenCL configuration is causing this or not.
For reference, the sample program:
And here's the output of clinfo:
Hey, just checking that you are using qcgpu-rust = 0.1 in your cargo.lock?
I'm using qcgpu = "0.1"
Hm, this is weird - I reran the tests, all passing:
https://travis-ci.org/QCGPU/qcgpu-rust
I will have a look at this over the next few days
Closing as I couldn't reproduce the error
