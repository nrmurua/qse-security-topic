See _PayloadCoreSend1MB in speed_benchmark.py. Fails with this log since the new comms code:
Also, we should probably unittest this.
Do you suggest just increasing buffer size, or something more clever? It looks like the coredevice code won't yield to the latter without some serious refactoring.
Then increase buffer size.
But at some point the comms code will have to handle 10MB chunks of data to load into core device storage...
This will be hard to implement. The crux of the issue is that the entire session.c has to be rewritten in using coroutines. C is not a language suited for doing this without allocation, quite ironically if you consider how it's supposed to be good for embedded work...
receive_rpc_value and send_rpc_value are the worst offenders because they are recursive, potentially with unlimited depth.
