Hello,
I have tried to install PyRPL on a Computer. First everthing looks fine (the computer successfully connects to the Red Pitaya and at the pyprl-oszi I get an input signal, but when I am trying to switch on the output of the RedPitaya (e.g. a  simple sine signal) it does not work. Instead I am getting Error messages of the following kind:
ERROR:pyrpl.redpitaya_client:Error occured in reading attempt 0. Reconnecting at addr 0x40210000 to _writes value [    0     3     6 ... 16375 16378 16381] by client 12
It does not matter whether I start pyrpl from the "big-executable-file" (pyrpl-linux) or from a python script. Also I already have tried to install pyprl on a different Linux18 Computer. There it works completely fine. (But I can not use this computer in the laboratory...)
Since I have no idea any more, I made a nosetest, where this kind off Error messages appear, too. I would appreciate it, If someone could take a quick look at it. And maybe someone has an idea to help me.

If you need more information I will try to get them for you.
Kind Regards

Hello together,
the solution of my problem is found.
Although Internet was working normally, there was a problem with a network driver. Now not the latest version, but the previous version of the driver is installed and it works now.
So If you use Ubuntu 18.04 and you encounter such strange errors, this might give you a hint where to look.
Kind regards
Silas
