"QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) is open-source software for simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems." -- http://qutip.org/
Since QuTiP is already used in a variety of projects, it should also be integrated into the qc-toolkit, providing an existing implementation of quantum circuit simulation.
It might also allow for a direct reuse of its object-oriented representation of quantum circuit components or at least inspire a similar structure in this project.
Out of scope for qupulse. There are implementations of simulations that take qupulse pulses as input somewhere...
If you find this comment and are looking for this implementations contact me.r
