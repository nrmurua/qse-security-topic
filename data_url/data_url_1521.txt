Retroactively creating bug fixed by #4616.
The above fails with {'A'} != {'B:A'}. The parent path gets dropped.
Note this is different from #4618 (the repro above does not do mapped_circuit()), and simpler to fix. subcircuit._measurement_keys_() just needs to prepend the parent path before returning.
