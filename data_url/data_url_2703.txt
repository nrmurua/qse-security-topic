When the ascii diagram tool cannot show gates in a Moment without overlapping, it breaks them out so you can see them.  But then you cannot really see by looking whether they are in the same moment or not.  Suggestion: we can add something at the bottom to group moments?
Maybe something like
Or another suggestion is to tighten the padding for a single moment.
I think the current implementation has bugs. The following code produces a circuit diagram where the "padding forces" are not lining up with the indicators:
This is the diagram that comes out:
It looks like there's an indicator missing near the right side.
it looks like this is now fixed
