Balint has implemented a single-CPU version in channels.
The distributed implementation is embarrassingly parallelisable.
Note this is a less useful measure than the trace distance (which requires calculation of the sqrt of a matrix, which needs a linear algebra library to e.g. eigendecompose).
Implemented on new_gates
