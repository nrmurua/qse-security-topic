Integrate QFAST (Quantum Fast Approximate Synthesis Tool) into qiskit for unitary synthesis. @edyounis is QFAST author.

What advantages does this provide on top of the KAK decomposition we have in terra already? Is it faster, more deterministic, etc? I could see it easily being an improvement over the existing decomposition code, but I think we should make those advantages clear before working on integrating this.
Although, before we can include a dependency like this we have to make sure it's under a compatible license. Right now there is no license information available for the package (besides the copyright that says all rights reserved) so I don't think we can use this package without it being released under a compatible open source license.
Was about to say the same thing about the license. "Contact the Berkeley IP office" is not a good omen.
They recently added a license: BSD-3-Clause-LBNL
From what I understand, it is compatible.
What's the status of this issue and the PR #5573?
I can't speak for the Qiskit team, but I think the PR has been abandoned. QFAST has since been implemented inside of BQSKit, which is available on GitHub. There is also a tutorial on how to use QFAST and other BQSKit synthesis and optimization tools here.
Qiskit has created a synthesis plugin mechanism, and @mtreinish started on a BQSKit plugin which you can follow here.
Thanks for the reply and providing the additional information. In this case, should we close the issue and the PR #5573?
