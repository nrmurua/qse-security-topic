Currently, HilbertSpace in scqubits\core\hilbert_space.py contains two functions implementing the same thing, subsystem_list and subsys_list. The other returns a tuple and the ensures a list, but they are functionally the same.
Having duplicates is unnecessary unless there is some legacy deprecation going on.
HilbertSpace underwent multiple rounds of refactoring, and this is likely an accidental artefact of that.
Additionally, despite its name, subsystem_list actually hands back a tuple instead of a list which is problematic on a separate level.
All changes here will need to start out with deprecation warnings. These properties/methods are probably not heavily used as HilbertSpace can be used as an iterable over subsystems. Nonetheless, changes may break user code.
My suggestion: phase out both of the above in favor of a simple <HilbertSpace>.subsystems property that hands back the subsystems in tuple form.  @petergthatsme There are various other options, let me know what you prefer.
This is addressed by 093a265 which initiates deprecation of  subsys_list in favor of subsystem_list (consistent with methods/attributes including subsystem_count).
