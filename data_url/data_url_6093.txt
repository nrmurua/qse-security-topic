Hey folks,
During my work for Cirq alpine docker image creation, I came across error while building  image. I am running docker file on MacOs Catalina with docker version: 2.1.4
It seems like some dependency broken for qiskit-aer for alpine.
Any help is appreciated.
Library             Version
OS                    alpine:3.10
python             3.7.5
pip                    19.2.3
qiskit-aer         0.3.4
numpy             1.17.4
scipy                1.3.3
Trying to run install command on  alpine os with docker file.
RUN apk add python3-dev 
python3-tkinter 
&&  python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip 
&&  python3 -m pip install cython numpy scipy scikit-build qiskit-aer \
It should be install successfully.
Hi @jitendrs,
i've also tried to create an Alpine-based Dockerimage but ran into several issues. However, after reading a blogpost (https://pythonspeed.com/articles/base-image-python-docker-images/) i gave python:3.7-slim-buster a shot and i'm quite happy with it:
Closing this issue as latest versions of Qiskit-Aer don't link against libpython, so this should be enough for it to run Alpine and other Linux  distros.
Feel free to reopen if the problem is not really solved.
