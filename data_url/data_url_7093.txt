Apparently gl.getShaderPrecisionFormat returns null or undefined in some cases, so the current code just crashes when high precision isn't supported. The webgl code needs to be tested on lower capability machines. Ideally automatically.
Look for services that can run CI tests including webgl on a variety of machines.
The person who was reporting this bug appears to be able to use Quirk now, so this may have been fixed by accident.
