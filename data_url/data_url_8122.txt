Hi,
I'm trying to use mesolve using a sampled hamiltonian to be interpolated (list array format according to the doc) with a tlist that isn't the time list times of the Hamiltonian coefficients, but a sublist eval_times of times. This method works fine and returns the results at eval_times when c_ops=[], but if I specify collapse operators, I get a tlist are not compatible error.
Here is an example of what I'm saying.
Do you have any idea what might cause this behaviour ? I believe this might be an issue with the mesolve solver, since when you don't specify c_ops, you use sesolve.
I haven't checked, but I'd bet it's because we construct a new Liouvillian QobjEvo on entry to mesolve with collapse operators.  If so, this is definitely a bug - we should have detected that the collapse operators have no time-dependence, so don't need to overwrite the tlist.
As a temporary work-around, you can construct the Liouvillian directly and pass it to mesolve:
which should work fine for now.
Thanks a lot ! It works indeed.
