Behaviour:
This obviously gives weird results in the data acquisition (I don't know how the data acquisition is triggered in this scenario).
Fix:
Which program runs continously? name 1 or name 2?
This could be an error in the memory management. I will have to debug in the lab. Possibly the same bug as #174
This bug has only happened a few times and I do not know how to reproduce it at the moment
Likely fixed now
