Should pyquil allow the caller to specify complex-valued Gate parameters?  PyQuil doesn't complain if you pass a complex value as a gate parameter, but quilc will in some cases choke on it.
For example:
But
As pointed out in the discussion in quil-lang/quilc#313, the above example doesn't even result in a unitary gate, so maybe not the best example, but the question is whether pyquil should consider complex a valid type for a Gate parameter. The purpose of this issue to track the pyquil side of quil-lang/quilc#313.
Note, however, that quilc won't always choke on any and every complex parameter. For example:
