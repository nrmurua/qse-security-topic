docplex.get_qubitops produces Hamiltonian with ground state not corresponding to the solution of the classical problem
To confirm the issue, compare the solution of MAXCUT obtained by solving the same model using CPLEX and using ExactEigensolver on Hamiltonian produced by docplex.get_qubitops. The problem is the same as in: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/optimization/max_cut_and_tsp.ipynb , with correct solution [1, -1, 1, -1]. Note the use of minus in front of Laplacian matrix due to formulating the problem as minimization.
The output I get  is:
Note that QubitOps solution is incorrect!
Solving the same model using CPLEX and Docplex translator + ExactEigensolver should produce the same result.
Thank you for the issue, I will check it.
Any updates on this?
Hi rsln-s, I fixed it.
Works great. Closing.
