When trying to run artiq_browser on windows 7 a division by zero error is thrown in the scanwidget.py file that prevents artiq_browser from running.
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]

C:\Users\pdk1\artiq>activate artiq-2.1
(artiq-2.1) C:\Users\pdk1\artiq>artiq_browser
Traceback (most recent call last):

scale *= ev.size().width()/ev.oldSize().width()
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
Does this happen with 2.5 or 3.0?
It seems fine running on version 3.0.  I just changed environments to one with artiq 3.0 and artiq_browser opened without crashing.
Try deleting the artiq_browser.pyon state file from C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Local\m-labs\artiq\2
