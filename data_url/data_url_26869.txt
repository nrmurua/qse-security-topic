Testing CP2K (naively) with ELPA-2018.11.001 results in completely different (and very likely wrong) values and/or IEEE_UNDERFLOW errors:
Example:
Using the following
enable_elpa-2018.11.001.patch.txt to enable ELPA-2018.11.001 support.
Interestingly, the problem was not observed with Intel 19.0.3 while with Intel 18.0.4. it doesn't even compile.
ELPA 2018.11.001 works also with gfortran 6.4.0 and mpich/3.2.1. I note, however, that the ELPA 2018.11.001 library has been built with AVX disabled, since our local cluster includes still some old nodes which provide only SSE2.
I observe the same behaviour as @dev-zero now for the psmp version which could imply that the issue is related to OpenMP, since the popt version was fine. @dev-zero did you test also the popt version?
Using the ELPA 2018.11.001 library compiled without OpenMP support for building cp2k.psmp seems to be a viable workaround.
With the adaption to the new ELPA API in PR #477 I can't reproduce this anymore. I guess I was seeing the same thing as @mkrack
closing since not reproducible with new ELPA API and I just merged #477
