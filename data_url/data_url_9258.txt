I am using Bloqade on a cluster. Previously, I used the separate library in Bloqade as a dependency, which included BloqadeExpr, BloqadeODE, BloqadeMIS, etc. It worked well, although the first time precompilation on a cluster took about 20 minutes.
However, I switched to using the full Bloqade as a dependency this week. The precompilation process has been ongoing for over 3 hours, but it is not providing any information on its progress as it is essentially a black box.
Hey @ChenZhao44 could you tell me what OS is on this cluster? I'd like to recreate your environment if possible and do some profiling.
I'm aware it takes some time on initial precompilation but never run into a case like this.
Thanks @johnzl-777 . Here is the OS information
@ChenZhao44 could I get the version of Julia you're using as well? Much appreciated!
