@oschuett can you please update the documentation on admin:kohn?
We should also link to new download stats at https://www.cp2k.org/faq:usagestats. Maybe something like this, but it's not quite ready yet (Somsubhra/github-release-stats#41).
I created https://www.cp2k.org/static/download_stats.html.
I remove the https://www.cp2k.org/admin:kohn page. Since I switched to Ansible it's not needed anymore.
