Expectation:
1.The logs will exist as an separate tab on the UI. An icon will be present on the left side bar to navigate to the logs page.
2.The backend will read the UI logs present in .cache/covalent/covalent_ui.log or use the covalent logs command and return all the logs with appropriate metadata.
3.UI will display the logs in the format shown below.

4.Pagination will be introduced in the logs and a maximum of 70 records will be shown at a time, however the download option will download the entire set of logs and not only the ones in the current page.
4.Logs need to have a search option which will enable the user to search across the logs.
5.Logs need to have a sort option which will have the date/time field as default sort option in descending order. Sorting will be applicable for datetime and status columns
6.UI will have a copy button on each row which will help the user copy the individual logs
7.An option to download the entire log will also be present which will help the user download the entire log as file.
8.If the date option is not present on any log, default date will be blank.
Backend:
Currently the UI backend doesn't have the timestamp on the logs that is been inserted in the log file.
@santoshkumarradha Please review and let me know if I have captured all the contents and if there needs to be any change. Thanks.
