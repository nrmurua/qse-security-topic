The RandomBytes implementation for Windows uses CryptAcquireContext/CryptGenRandom which has been deprecated for years and has been claimed to have security risks. Microsoft has also specified in it's documentation that this API may be removed from newer version of Windows. (details below)

BCryptGenRandom is the recommended option as per Microsoft

An example implementation at (not production tested):

We're using https://github.com/dsprenkels/randombytes/, which is where this should probably be discussed instead.
I don't think any known security problems exist in the currently supported versions of Windows, so I'm removing "insecure" from the title of this issue.
