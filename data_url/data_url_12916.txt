The current set of primitive gates can be found at: include/tweedledum/ir/gate_lib.def.
Ideally, adding a new gate to tweedledum would require just modifying this file.  This, however, is really far from the current reality!  Indeed, adding a new gate is an annoying task.  There are too many places of the code that must be modified and things are not really intuitive.
