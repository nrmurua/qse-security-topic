Dask normally uses a custom serialization protocol for passing data between processes. This protocol fails to preserve some Python data types, leading to bugs such as #638. As a short term fix we can force Dask to use the "pickle" protocol pending corrections to the "dask" protocol. We will of course need to verify that other workflows continue to run with this change.
Dask bug filed upstream: dask/distributed#6569
A major strike against "pickle" is that it fails to preserve PyTorch gradients:
But the default "dask" protocol actually works here:
Obsolete.
