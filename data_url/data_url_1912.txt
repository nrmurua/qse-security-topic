In the installation documentation, there is a mention that you should install features in cirq/contrib by the command python -m pip install cirq[contrib]. This fails to install with the following error no matches found cirq[contrib]. This has occurred for both manjaro and macOS creating a virtual environment and using pip to install. pip version is 20.1.1  and 20.2.2.
This works for me on my MacOS with python3.7 and pip 20.2.2:
Can you try using pip install cirq-unstable[contrib]?
Can you try using pip install cirq-unstable[contrib]?
My bad, I did not realize it could be related to my shell.  For people using zsh, they would need to be careful about globbing for pip command. Once I disabled it, everything ran smoothly.
