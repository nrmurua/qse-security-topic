Description of the issue
External code that defined a _resolve_parameters_ magic method for Cirq 0.9 is broken by #3546, which changed the function signature for that method in a non-backwards-compatible way.
How to reproduce the issue
Construct a parameterized circuit in Cirq v0.10.0-dev, then attempt to run it in the latest version of qsim.
Cirq version
Occurs when upgrading from v0.9.* to v0.10.0-dev
Since _resolve_parameters_ is a private method (has a leading underscore), we can just make cirq.resolve_parameters backwards-compatible. This requires fixing some incorrect behavior in qsim (quantumlib/qsim#278), but is much cleaner to implement.
