Is there any detailed description about how to connect with Quantum Processor? I'm certain that I have run the 'pyquil-config-setup'. Does it mean that my account doesn't have the Privilege to access the QPU?
I run:
import pyquil.api as forest
q = forest.QPUConnection()
but I got :
! ERROR:
!   There was an issue validating your forest account.
!   Have you run the pyquil-config-setup command yet?
! The server came back with the following information:
{"status": "Error: user does not have access to QPU"}
! If you suspect this to be a bug in pyQuil or Rigetti Forest,
! then please describe the problem in a GitHub issue at:

In slack, the stuff told me that the public can't access the GPU for now. We have to wait for update.
