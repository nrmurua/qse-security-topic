creating a new design (say Q3D design) after connecting to a Ansys session that has an open design with a setup in it (say an existing HFSS design) causes a fail. Here below the one I experienced with add_q3d_design.


just execute the notebook 5.1 once cell at the time. it will show up on the cell that adds a new q3d design
should not be retaining the setup name, because users might want to do exactly that (create a new design and continue working from the new design).
reset the setup name variable somewhere in the code to prevent this error
Observe how this is connecting to a setup in the cell right before the failing add_q3d_design:

in fact if I delete the design right before executing this cell, the error goes away. This seems to indicate the setup name remains in memory
required a pyEPR debug and update.
Completed
