Once pull #648 is merged I am keen to get a v4.1 released.
The conda-forge packages for Windows currently do work. I am very keen to resolve this.
Also very keen to get a solution for qutip on MS Windows with Python >= 3.5 out there.
I am happy to do the admin work for the release.
The installation documentation will need updating, I am happy to this.
Is there anything else we would like to finish off, that can be done quickly, that we would like to get into a release of 4.1?
Let me do one more minor thing tonight and then go for it.  I will also add some more to the docs tonight.
Ready.
When are you thinking or branching a 4.1 release?
So far:
I have created the 4.1.x branch
Created the gztar and zip via sdist
(there was a problem with missing hpp files, now fixed)
I have uploaded the packages to the website and updated the links.
I have updated the conda-forge recipe. I am waiting to see how the packages work out before going any further. The Windows ones take about 24 before they get processed in the queue
I have released the 4.1 branch and uploaded new docs with the needed updates.
For some reason my docs do not load on git. They work fine if loaded directly from my computer though.  Seems some css files are not being found.  A brief google search pulled up a variety of things.  You seem to have had success with the 4.0.2 docs, so perhaps you can take a shot at uploading.
Nevermind.  Forgot about the underscore issue with jekyll.
@nonhermitian Hopefully you will see I pinged up on conda-forge/qutip-feedstock#18. There is a problem with the OSX build of QuTiP on the conda-forge
@ajgpitch I am trying to fix this will Pull #660.  I do not see this on any other compiler, so it is hard to peg down.  Hopefully, switching to a vector from a pointer does the trick.  The strange thing is that Apple's own clang compiler does not abort with this error, but somehow XCODE does.
Finished.
Finally
