I found a probably severe error in qutip 3.0.0 (worked fine in previous versions).
When using mesolve, a function in "rhs_generate.py" (_td_wrap_array_str) checks if arguments exist. So far so good, however the if clause using
if args:
....
does not work when the argument is a numpy array, which raises the error:
ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
Is not hard to fix, but an annoying error
Keep up the good work!!
Thanks a lot for finding and report this bug! I'll look into this asap.
I think it should work if lines 398 - 405 are replaced with this:
Yes, that helps! Thanks for the quick fix
