Description of the issue
When freezing circuits, Moment instances should be reused since they are immutable. This was previously the case, but seems to have changed recently (possibly due to #5332).
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
1.1.0.dev20220801180412
Yes, looks like it was from #5332. The with_operations below is what does it.  Moment.with_operations creates a new Moment even if the input list is empty.

You could either change the code here to skip the with_operations call if there are no operations to append, or alternatively, have Moment.with_operations return self if the input is empty.
From Cirq sync - this will be considered a bug fix as it returns the API behavior to the original intention.
