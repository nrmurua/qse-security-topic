I would like to remove all the multi-language documentation from this repository and add it to github.com/Qiskit/qiskit. I am not sure of the best way we do it and I let all discuss in that repository how we should do it. But we are not going to have documentation in the individual elements (only a readme about the element, contributing guidelines and other community files)
@alfrisch could you take the lead on the German
@rraymondhp could you take the lead on the Japanese
@hanheepaik could you take the lead on the Korean
@liupibm could you take the lead on the Chinese
Thanks
Discussed @diego-plan9 and @veenaiyuri a plan to test a doc directory structure to include translated content by adding a new directory level, /nl/ Translated docs can be included as comprehensive doc packages as subdirectories, for example /nl/ja/filename for Japanese translations of a specific filename.  For example:
This directory structure sounds good! For collaboration via git it is important to work on the translation on a file-by-file basis.
As long as we do not have this structure up and running, I think it would be better to link German and Japanese to the English doc by default as these versions are quite old and this might give a wrong impression.
Hitting a language button when there is no translated file I get a "not found" error. Maybe it is better to hide the link when no corresponding translation is present.
About the japanese translation, we do agree, but the naming of root directory nl may need reconsideration as it looks like the name of a particular language (netherland?). Will issue a PR about it soon.
You are right. 'nl' does stand for Netherlands. How about 'lang' instead?
can we move the discussion of this to Qiskit repo and start an issue there.
