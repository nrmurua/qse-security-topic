Placer fails when implementing artiq on Kasli v2 with Fastino log2_width=5 on artiq-7 and on master.
Artiq release-7, ff97675; also happens on master branch 68dd0e0.

In release-6 I can fit 10 Fastinos with log2_width=5 on Kasli v2. In release-7 I can fit 12 Fastinos on Kasli SoC.
There are 3 main gateware changes from release-6 to release-7 that I am aware of:
There aren't a good ARTIQ commit to separate the impact of 2 and 3, so I restore the 32-bits datapath to Kasli v2 on release-7:
And I can fit 4 Fastinos without timing violations, 5 otherwise.
Kasli v1.1 does not have the FPU nor the 64-bits datapath. It can fit 8 Fastinos, and may have to lose 1 to 2 Fastinos to pass timing.
The BRAM is exhaused in all these builds, so maybe downsizing the caches can help by releasing a bit more LUTs from the DRAMs.
