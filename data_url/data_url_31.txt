The DLI team set up a server sandbox environment for us to use (@bettinaheim and Efrat have access to this as well as me).  I have been testing out some of our notebooks in that environment.  When I attempted to run the multi-gpu workflow notebooks the output of the sample call did not print out with cpu_result.dump() but would print out if I used print(cpu_result)
copy the multi_gpu_workflows Jupyter notebook into JupyterLab and run the first three cells to get the expected outcome of a bell state run on a CPU.
expected the dictionary results to print, but nothing appeared in the output of the Jupyter notebook.
Not a regression
These are the docker images. that were used to create the container that the Jupyter notebook is running in
