Whenever i try to reverse some Circuit it throws an exception telling that temp does not have append method implemented.
I checked the source code and i think that instead o append the developers meant add_gate.
Could you please post the code snippet and the traceback of the error message ? Thank you.
Ok. I wrote a test for it. The error message can be seen below. I will open a PR to resolve this. Thank you very much for raising the issue.
It is a simple fix. Just replace "append" with "add_gate" in "temp.append(self.gates[self.N - i - 1])". I tested myself and it works like a charm now.
You are welcome. I love QuTip and it is an honor to help the developers.
Hi @mrcalixe, this fix has been implemented in the PR -  #684. After review, it should be merged and ready for use. Thank you very much for contributing and raising this issue. Enjoy working with QuTiP.  :)
