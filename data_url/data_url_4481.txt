Describe the bug
When creating a variational layer using one qubit gates that need more than 1 parameters like the U3, it does not matter how you input the parameters, it is not able to assign the required values for lambda or phi.
To replicate
liste = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
params_before = [[-3.298, 0.691, -1.91],
[0.691, -1.91, 5.057],
[-1.91, 5.057, 4.449],
[5.057, 4.449, 0.346]]
circ.add(gates.VariationalLayer([0,1,2,3], liste, gates.U3, gates.CNOT, params_before, params_before))
File c:\Users\Jacfomg\Desktop\pythonProject\venv\lib\site-packages\qibo\core\gates.py:692, in (.0)
690 def _calculate_unitaries(self):
691     matrices = K.qnp.stack([K.qnp.kron(

693         self.one_qubit_gate(q2, theta=self.params[q2]).matrix)
694                          for q1, q2 in self.pairs], axis=0)
695     entangling_matrix = self.two_qubit_gate(0, 1).matrix
696     matrices = entangling_matrix @ matrices
TypeError: U3.init() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'phi' and 'lam'
Expected behavior
It should assign more than theta value when the gate uses more than one parameter.

@Jacfomg thanks for reporting this, in #619 we have removed this layer given that it is equivalent and simpler to write the circuit and then apply fusion, so my recommendation is to use fusion following this guide: https://qibo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/qibo.html?highlight=fusion#circuit-fusion
Yeah, it may be simpler to write your desired circuit but I think that function could have some use trying different circuits, gates and placements in a fast way. At least, for the sort of VQE I tried using it for where I was exploring different options.
