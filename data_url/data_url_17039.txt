We dont have a test for plot_state_hinton in qiskit/visualization/state_visualization.py
on hold until #2968
Hi @1ucian0! I would like to start contributing to Qiskit and this looks like a good first issue to begin with.
I read the contributions guidelines for testing visualization and I'm able to run the notebook test/ipynb/mpl_tester.ipynb in Binder. All the shown tests run successfuly, in particular I see the following result for tests about the Graph Matplotlib Drawer.

However, not all the tests in test_graph_matplotlib_drawer.py seem to be considered here and I don't understand why. For instance, the test for the function plot_state_hinton is included in the file (lines 117-127):
but it does not appear in the notebook result as you can see in the image above. The same happens for all the tests which rely on the state_drawer function imported from qiskit.visualization.state_visualization. In the other 14 cases (related to plot_histogram or plot_gate_map or plot_coupling_map), the test are collected correctly and the results are shown in the notebook. Can you please help me figuring things out?
Hi @1ucian0 I'm looking to tackle adding these tests in the MPL drawer, from what I see plot_state_hinton is already being tested and I can see it in the binder.

Were there specific additional tests you wanted?
Thanks everyone for the heads up!
Indeed, this is already checked by snapshot testing. The next step is to add the snapshot tests as part of the CI/coverage, in the #6427 direction.
