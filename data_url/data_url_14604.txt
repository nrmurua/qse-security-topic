When exporting a Delay instruction with a unit other than 'dt' as QASM 2, the unit information is not exported.
The output QASM should include unit information so that, when parsed, a delay with the correct unit can be created.
Also, following #6510 (comment) , the delay instruction should be declared as opaque.
