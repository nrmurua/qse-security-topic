(Marco NOTE: subset of #110)
Unable to see the buttons below
Press Q3
Buttons should be clearly visible when I minimize or maximize the window.
Add a scrollbar to the right
Hi @manannarang,
Please provide us with a bit more detail.  You mention in the text that you are unable to see the button "below", but there is no further information and/or screenshot to help us reproduce this bug.

We can add a scroll bar for GDS, HFSS, and Q3D renderers.
The correct way to fix this is to make the two widgets resizable with the window, rather then current fixed size.
Indeed, the widgets already have embedded scroll-bar, so making them resizable will automatically utilize their scroll-bar as needed.....and in most cases it will not be needed because making the widget resizable will pull up the bottom buttons to as high up as possible.
it might be slightly more complicated than that in practice, but the gist is: we need to fix the widgets, not the window. Cheers.
note, this request is a subset of #110. The resolution limit is a problem affecting everything about the GUI, not just this specific window
Thanks!
@grace-harper-ibm , did we tackle this one yet?
