Adding context at the request of @rigettizach.
This issue isn't a bug, but an improvement in matching the machine model of the quantum abstract machine. The program counter is a piece of state in the machine, and the way it's described in the Quil paper is modification of this state.
The fact that qvm::transition modifies some state but not the pc is misleading, and also doesn't reflect what a real quantum computer does.
This issue is supposed to make the modification of state more uniform. The transition method currently returns the updated pc as a second value, but we ought to just transition the QAM as a state transition.
