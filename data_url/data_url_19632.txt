The StateTomographyFitter function only accept results from state_tomography_circuits execution. It is a good idea to allow arrays passed to this function. Because, as part of my project I need to extract the density state for different conditions. Therefore, it is easier to transform my results into an array and pass them to this function than execute a circuit for each time
But what about if I have a sequence of circuits
