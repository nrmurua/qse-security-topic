Recently I had some discussions about whether qcodes should also contain driver software required by some of the instruments to function. The motivation behind this is the new IVVI to PC communication boxes which require an FTDI driver to communicate over USB via a virtual COM port. It turns out that the driver downloaded from the official website has a default setting which significantly slows down reading data from the device. It made sense to include modified drivers where this setting is minimized so that other people don't run into the same problem.
This would provide a verified source of drivers (and correct versions) of which the functioning is known. I think it makes sense to include these kind of things in some drivers folder , perhaps alongside the instrument_drivers folder.

Seems reasonable to me to put these files right next to the relevant qcodes driver. The only disadvantage is if the user needs to do something with this file (copy it to C:\Windows\System or something) they may have a hard time finding it once qcodes is just an installed package.
Yes it's a bit weird to have drivers in a Python/Lib/site-packages/qcodes/drivers directory, but I think if people use qcodes they are tech-savvy enough to find their Python installation. Another idea would be to provide a link to a .zip with the drivers, or host them as a separate repository and let people download that as a zip via GitHub or something.
