A job that does not succeed still reports job.status() == JobStatus.DONE.
job.status() says DONE, however the result actually shows there was error:
Currently the job object only checks that the returned Result object is schema valid (and doesn't check if the result itself was a success or not), in that sense the job is "done".
The error messages are then contained in the result object. We used to have it aggressively raise a logger error if any experiment failed, but to match the IBMQ provider API we changed it that those error messages are now only obtained if you call result.data or get_counts etc. for an experiment that failed. In that case an exception is raised containing the error message for that experiment.
There is a bug with the Result object that result.status returns PARTIAL COMPLETED when in fact all the circuits failed, it should only do that if at least 1 experiment is successful, and at least one is failed.
