I create a circuit with a parameterized gate and bind the parameters to numerical values - 1, 2 and 3, say. Then I try to acquire these parameters from the circuit data, and I get [ParameterExpression(1),ParameterExpression(2),ParameterExpression(3)].
This causes problems in creating parameterized schedules from bound, parameterized circuits as this data is fed into the scheduler in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/1c89cc59c8ec45311748e3f4c37e843068155d51/qiskit/scheduler/lowering.py#L125.
from qiskit.circuit import import QuantumCircuit, Gate, Parameter
x = Parameter('x')
frank = Gate('frank',num_qubits=2,params=[x])
circ = QuantumCircuit(2,2)
circ.append(frank,(0,1))
bound_circ  = circ.bind_parameters({x:1})
bound_circ.data[0][0].params
It should output the relevant numerical values. Those could then be passed to the scheduler, and so parameterized gates could be converted into custom parameterized schedules.
I've had a look and I'm not sure where this problem is occurring exactly - it could take place when the parameterized gate is being appended to the circuit, when the parameterized circuit is bound, or when the circuit data is being extracted, but I think the first two are more likely
Can you include an example of the failing code? I believe the scheduler should be able to handle ParameterExpressions.
I see - so perhaps the problem is how the InstructionScheduleMap or ParameterizedSchedule is handling ParameterExpressions.
Anyway, my failing code is quite long and it looks like the issue is being discussed at length in thread #4940. So I will close this issue and follow along there.
