Describe the solution you'd like
Previously parameters of both model and control components were managed in a object.params dictionary. This should be modified so that the property is directly a field of the object. E.g. qubit.params["frequency"] becomes qubit.frequency.
Example:

For this to work each object needs to implement a get_parameters() method that exposes properties to the parametermap to be used instead of comp.params.items() in the following:
