I would like to add data to my SpectrumData object before writing it to a file, and then be able to access that data later when reading the file back to a SpectrumData object. Unfortunately the SpectrumData.create_from_file() function appears to ignore the presence of this additional data. Here is a minimal working example:
specdata has the attribute test_array as expected, however specdata_from_file does not.
OS: MacOS
scqubits: version 1.2.1
Python: 3.7
Manually added data was not properly recorded for file IO. This should be fixed with 3576e16
Indeed it is fixed by 3576e16
