Experimenting with QPager, it needs one particular improvement to be of any practical use: a paged measurement method. It was oversight that I missed prioritizing this. I'm implementing this, today, and then we can benchmark multi-accelerator loads with QPager on AWS.
This was definitely implemented, but I can't find the pull request to link.
