The unitary matrix of the QFT circuit does not match the DFT matrix definition. In particular, the imaginary part of the QFT matrix has its sign flipped.
The matrices have values:
Should the two matrices match?
The correct explanation can be found here: https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/17259/qiskit-qft-matrix-does-not-match-with-dft-matrix
According to the docs of scipy and qiskit, the first uses primitive root ω=e−2πin and the second uses ω=e2πin. This implies that one matrix is complex conjugate of the other (which is the same as inverse).
