Two problems in Different Variants of the Same Pass part:
1/ The initial look of the tutorial show drawing of circuit in color. Executing each cell results in a black-and-white representation as style is never defined in this notebook. Not a big problem
2/ stochastic_circ.draw(output='mpl') :
Initial look :

After executing this cell:

The result is confusing as after executing the cell we obtain something different and which moreover seems in contradiction with the defined coupling map.
For example despite a coupling map defined like (coupling = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6]]) (no direct link between 0 and 6) we obtain a first CNOT between qubits 0 and 6. I assume there is a change in layout but as it is never explicit it could be confusing.
Yes, the StochasticSwap returns the circuit in the virtual qubit space of the circuit.  As opposed to the physical space on the device.  See for example #1831.
Qiskit/qiskit#2463 should fix this.
the style was made "color" by default after the release. so with the pip release you will get black and white.
This should now be resolved
