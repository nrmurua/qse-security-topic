Hello!
I have a arbitrary function generator which I have connected to pins on Pipistrello. I am generating a square wave with the arbitrary function generator and am trying to use Pipistrello to count the number of rising edges in the square wave.
I am new to ARTIQ so I am wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how to begin doing this.
Thanks!
