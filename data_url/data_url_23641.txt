We still need to settle on an API for adding QCoDeS parameters as well as custom parameters and to hit it heavily with tests.
Some work items:
@QCoDeS/core I think the context manager is done, at least for a beta version. Comments and pointing out of blunders most welcome.
I'll put up an example notebook using some actual instruments including ones with ArrayParameters.
Closing this issue as it has outlived its purpose as a TO-DO point during a sprint.
