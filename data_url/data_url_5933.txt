Allow a user to add a list of quantum noise errors (depolarizing, thermal...) to all qubits with one function call.
In noise_modely.py:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/qiskit/providers/aer/noise/noise_model.py
define a new method (notice errors instead of error):
add_all_qubit_quantum_errors(self, *errors, instructions, warnings=True)
which accepts an (iterable) of quantum errors and applies all of them to all the qubits
can be written as follows with the current API:
I think the bottom is still simple and should not introduce complexity to API for such small improvement. Please reopen this issue with some examples if you have more significant usability issue with the current add_all_qubit_quantum_errors.
