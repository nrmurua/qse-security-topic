Would be neat to be able to batch a large number of jobs for execution.
h/t @kmrudin and @msohaibalam for suggestion. Please add context if you'd like specifics. Game to consider adding PBS & Slurm in QMIs or something of that flavor
I think this conflates two ideas:
use pyquil to submit a whole bunch of qpu runs at once. With the new access model, there's very little overhead in sending programs serially so I don't think this is worth the effort. Just write a for loop
Use an off-the-shelf scheduler like slurm on the QMI in addition to or instead of the existing scheduler.
