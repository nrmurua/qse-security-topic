I can't test phaser2 due to kernel hanging.
@jordens says this is due to lwip #598 and #637. Removing switch between Master and KC705 doesn't resolve. This Issue is blocking testing of phaser2.
I believe this issue has been resolved, @jbqubit can you test with ARTIQ master please?
Using conda dev here's what I see.
$ artiq_flash -t kc705 -m nist_clock
Flashes my kc705 fine. I can ping board at 192.168.1.50.
Run:
$ artiq_run repository/coredevice_examples/simple/blink_forever.py
Took > 60 seconds to return. But the LED flashing did eventually start.
Reboot board while monitoring serial interface. Run:
$ artiq_run repository/coredevice_examples/simple/blink_forever.py
No LED flashing observed until after "[   119294807us]  INFO(runtime::session): resetting RTIO". Then LED flashes continuously.
Repeat of previous test. This time with wireshark logging following reboot.
$ artiq_run repository/coredevice_examples/simple/blink_forever.py
After a delay flashing commences.

Could you please attach the dump data?
$ artiq_coreanalyzer --write-dump bigdump.txt

@jbqubit Can you recheck with the latest master?
Using latest build.
$ artiq_flash -t kc705 -m nist_clock
$ artiq_run repository/coredevice_examples/simple/blink_forever.py
LED starts flashing after delay << 1 sec. After a while of LED-watching I terminated with ctrl-C.

Looking better.
It now takes 200ms total to start a 8KB kernel. There is a number of ways to improve on this number, e.g.:
I am going to implement 3) in the normal course of moving the runtime further towards Rust, as I will implement the necessary support code (an atomic ringbuffer) anyway. For now, I understand the kernel load time is acceptable. Please test and reopen if it is not for your experiments.
