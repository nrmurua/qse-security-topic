Several functions (e.g. getters and calcs) in QuEST.h are missing...
Add these (straight into dev)
Also update exitWithError in doc (still technically correct, unless user redefines:) to invalidQuESTInputError
(completed exitWithError -> invalidQuESTInputError in eb71a95)
All doxygen fields were addressed in v3.3.0
