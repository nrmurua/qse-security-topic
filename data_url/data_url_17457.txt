Current the DenseLayout does not consider the cx error rates in the sub-graph.  Due to symmetries in the coupling maps of the devices there are several sub-graphs with the same connectivity to choose from.  The DenseLayout should be extended to optionally take a backend, or backend properties, and return the most connected sub-graph with the lowest average cx errors for the gates that are within the sub-graph.
See NoiseAdaptiveLayout (#2089) which we may be able to somehow combine with DenseLayout in the future.
I'm closing this as done because I believe this was already implemented in #3101. @nonhermitian please feel to reopen this if I'm mistaken and there is still something to do here.
Yes, I think I added that a while ago. Thanks for squishing these old issues.
