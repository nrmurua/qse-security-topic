It could be nice to try interactive graphics using Bokeh and QuTiP. I am not familiar with the tool, this could be a starting point.
These notebooks could be added to the QuTiP website at qutip.org/tutorials.
Maybe a first step could be to start from existing notebooks, such as the beautiful  Wigner functions gallery) and its Schr√∂dinger cat states that define also QuTiP logo. Also, in the future some of current and upcoming research material by @quantshah could provide a wow effect if interactive.
Hi, I made some of the graphs in Wigner functions gallery interactive using plotly because bokeh doesn't support 3D surface plot natively. You can drag and move the graph.

Is there any other improvement I can do related to this issue?
