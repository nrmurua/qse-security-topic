I'm working on a mac and use chrome. I want to delete and insert circuit layers in crumble. If I press crtl+delete or ctrl-insert nothing happens. All other commands I have tried work.
(As a work around, I just open the stim circuit and insert ticks or delete lines).
Does it work with command instead of ctrl?
No
