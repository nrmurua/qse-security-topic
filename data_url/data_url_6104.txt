Currently the developer needs to remember to update allowed snapshots in both the class Snapshots and the function alloewed_snapshots. Change this, such that there is only one location to update.
Same goes also for snapshotset_
In addition apply_snapshot independently throws an error for non-allowed snapshots, where it has its own list of allowed snapshots...
Note that the tests pass even when allowed_snapshots and snapshotset_ are not updated; this is although not updating them can cause failure to the user.
I'll try to do it soon
Actually, better do it after the refactoring of snapshots.
Closing since this method will be deprecated with snapshots, new save instructions are treated like regular circuit instructions which avoids this issue.
