PR #1021 added support for drawing a barrier line to the circuit drawer for the snapshot instruction. However, to make the visualizations for the snapshot instruction more useful we should add a label above the barrier line drawn.
For latex I think the pattern that will work is using \mbox in an inserted row above the barrier. Something like:
Works well in my local testing, although I've only tested with the barrier on the top row. The complexity will come in when managing the size of the matrix assuming this works for any arbitrary location. We'll still want to have this on text and matplotlib too, but I haven't investigated how to implement it there yet.
This issue only applies to the latex drawer?
I believe it applies to all of them (unless you implemented this for text), I only started working on it for latex originally since that was the first backend I added support for simulator instructions as barriers to.
The text drawer draws barrier, snapshot, save, load, and noise the same way:
Any idea about the expected output for the simulator instructions?

Re-reading the original post again, it seems that @mtreinish wants something like this:

What about the label? Does the representation make sense?
âœ… Circuit text drawer still has no differentiation! Issue #2303 has no reply for suggested fix as a solution.
Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
