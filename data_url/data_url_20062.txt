From https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dstebila/liboqs/build/job/scri82orbtjl5b9a :
@sebastinas FYI, I finally got around to check the issue: Setting up a clean Windows VM, updating cygwin via setup-x86_64.exe -qnNdO -R C:/cygwin64 -l C:/cygwin/var/cache/setup -P openssl -P libssl-devel -P ninja -P cmake -P gcc  and running this build: cmake .. -GNinja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DOQS_DIST_BUILD=ON -DOQS_ENABLE_SIG_SPHINCS=OFF -DOQS_ENABLE_SIG_RAINBOW=OFF -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DOQS_USE_OPENSSL=OFF (as per appveyor instruction set) suffices to reproduce:
Running ./tests/kat_sig picnic_L3_full immediately SegFaults. Same for L1_full and L5_full. All other algorithms (incl.  picnic_L5_UR etc pass).
As I have to work with a remote Windows VM, this already took me some hours; further debugging is prohibitively expensive for me in that environment, so I will leave it at that.
My recommendation thus is to drop Picnic from the cygwin test matrix and document it as no longer supported under cygwin until a person with experience with (and easy access to) Windows, cygwin and Picnic has time to look into this.
FWIW, result of a gdb run:
Edit: This is set up in a 'throwaway' AWS Win VM that I could PM you the RDP access password for debugging if you want.

Sounds like the right approach.

I will try to reproduce the issue with these flags after winter break.
