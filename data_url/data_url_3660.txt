I am running Ubuntu version 16.04 installed via crouton on an acer chromebook 11. I followed the docs and did pip install pyquil, which ran successfully, and then I ran pyquil-config-setup which gave the following:
This is what running pip install pyquil gave for output (it seemed to run successfully; I'm only putting this here just in case it is useful):
Upgrading pip may help with this: pip install --upgrade pip
@stevenheidel I updated pip before running pyquil-config-setup, actually, so I don't think that's the problem.
@stevenheidel I tried doing that and it's giving the same error - I might try completely uninstalling and then completely reinstalling PyQuil.
Okay, I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling, and then it gave an error just installing (I uninstalled/reinstalled using pip):
Looks like a Python permissions issue: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21093002/error-could-not-create-usr-local-lib-python2-7-dist-packages-virtualenv-suppo
Not sure if that link will help but it's worth a shot.
Alternatively, try using Python 3. Support for Python 2 will be dropped from PyQuil in the future.
@stevenheidel are we good to close this?
Yes I'll close it
