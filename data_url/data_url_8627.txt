It would be nice to have an easy way in options to suppress the mcsolve progress output.
Good point. It used to be possible to disable the progress bar when we still used Qt, but for some reason that feature got lost when we restructured the code to use the text-based progress bar. In PR #220 I've added back this feature. You should now (when the PR is merged) be able to do
to disable the progress bar.
Thanks!
