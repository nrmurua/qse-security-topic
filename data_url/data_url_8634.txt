As it stands now, all of the steady state solvers treat the solution vector as a dense array.  However, often times the steady state density matrix is sparse and therefore the current implementation is not optimal.  As of SciPy 0.14, the sparse LU solver can now access the underlying L and U sparse matrices.  Therefore, we should be able to do some kind of sparse forward and backward substitution to get the solution vector.  In particular, since the RHS vector has only a single nonzero entry, the substitutions are greatly simplified,and we could also see a speed up.
Having had time to explore the fill-in reduction reorderings, treating the RHS as a sparse matrix is a second-order concern, whereas fill-in is still the dominate memory issue in the solution.
