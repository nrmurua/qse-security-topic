Following #135, all gates_cirq gates are supported through qsimcirq except for matrix gates. These were excluded from the initial change because they require more complex translation logic, but going forward it would be nice to have support for them.
In a similar vein, there are some Cirq gates which are not in gates_cirq. This is basically unavoidable, as Cirq continues to add new gates. However, Cirq has a built-in decompose method to distill gates down to a target "gateset"; using this (with gates_cirq as the gateset) we can support any circuit sent from Cirq.
(Of note: decompose usually incurs a simulation cost compared to running the original gate. Having a fairly large target gateset like gates_cirq helps to minimize this cost.)
