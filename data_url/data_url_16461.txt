What content needs to be updated or replaced? (You can copy and paste)
Assuming the given form of U3 is correct, we can clearly see it will NOT factorise to U3(\theta, \phi, \lambda) = RZ(\phi - \pi/2) RX(\pi/2) RZ(\pi - \theta) RX(\pi/2) RZ(\lambda - \pi/2) as claimed. We can easily see this by taking eg (\phi, \lambda) = (-\pi/2,\pi/2) and expanding this expression and noting it does not yield RX(\theta)$as claimed (and can easily be shown to be true).
What new content needs to be added?
One possible correct answer is RZ(\phi) RX(\pi/2)RZ(\pi - \theta) RX(\pi/2)RZ(\lambda+\pi).
Issue originally opened in Qiskit/qiskit but I suspect this is the correct place for it now?
