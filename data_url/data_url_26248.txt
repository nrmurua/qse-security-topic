Given two matrices, calculate the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product between them.
This function should be placed in state_metrics/hilbert_schmidt_inner_product.py and this should have a corresponding test suite in tests/test_state_metrics/test_hilbert_schmidt_inner_product.py
For inspiration, one can refer to the function here as provided by Rigetti Forest. If these functions are used as inspiration or as templates, then proper credit should be included in the description of the functions.
Hi @vprusso,
I would like to take this up if no one else is working on it. This is my first time contributing to Toqito. Do you have any tips?
That's great, @AdithyaSireesh!
I'm not sure I have anything additional to add--if you have specific questions you can ask here!
Thank you. I'll get started. Is there any specific requirements for what matrices the function should accept?
Eg: do they need to be unitary/hermitian etc.?
The matrices simply need to be standard linear operators defined as np.array objects.
Let me know if you have any other questions!
Opened a pull request #134
Closing from #134 Thanks again, @AdithyaSireesh !
