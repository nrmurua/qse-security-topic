On both of latest and stable releases of the docs page, the links to the code of conduct and the links in contributing to docs section here are broken: https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html#updating-the-documentation.
Likely a regression of #211
Visit https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing.html and try clicking on the code of conduct link at the bottom of the page.
I'm going to fix it.
