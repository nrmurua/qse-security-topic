Loading circuits from input takes very long time when multiple experiments are given.
So the simulation time can not be improved well when using GPU to accelerate.
Here is an example for multiple experiments.
and here is a result. (Power9)
Simulation time takes only 0.1 sec but most of time is taken to load circuit in Qobj constructor.
Currently is seems loading circuit from json is not thread safe and can not be parallelized.
We need to parallelize to speedup this.
qobj is no longer used in usual path.
