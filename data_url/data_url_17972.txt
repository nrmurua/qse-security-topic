The changes included in #760 require a scipy version that provides scipy.stats.unitary_group, which is not available in the minimal version currently required for scipy:
We should look for the minimal version of scipy that includes that function (seems to be 1.0) and update the dependencies accordingly - otherwise we risk installations with broken qiskit.tools.qi.qi in some cases.
@diego-plan9 can you just update the dependencies as we don't want to write this function.
This is on its way to be fixed via #713
@diego-plan9 @delapuente this issue still has not been fixed: requirements.txt still lists scipy>=0.19, and qiskit.tools.qi.qi still tries to import unitary_group from scipy.stats
Thanks for reporting, @dtmcclure - can you paste the version of scipy you have installed that is resulting in a problem?
I'm reopening the issue so we can investigate further - and actually pinging  @ewinston as he might have more information. Based on https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/713/files#r214942849:
For some reason scipy 0.19.1 doesn't implement unitary_group although it does before (0.19.0) and after (1.0).
But it could be the case that the exclusion of 0.19.1 might not be enough.
I thought this was in 0.19.0 but I couldn't find it. Maybe just change requirement to >=1.0.0 or maybe Jay has other idea?
@dtmcclure can you check now
