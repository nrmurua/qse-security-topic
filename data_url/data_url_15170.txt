I was developing the distributed version of the QPE. For that I needed to use the cat entangler and cat disentangler circuits, which are the following:

The first square corresponds to the cat entangler and the second to the cat disentangler, the effect of this circuits is explained in [1]. That CNOT in the middle of the squares is replaced by the controlled phase shift, the first qubit is preparated for the phase shift using a Hadamard gate and the last qubit is prepared to $|1\rangle$. The resulting circuit is as follows:

In theory, the state of the hole circuit at the barrier should be:
$$
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt(2)}[|0\rangle + e^{\frac{i\pi}{2}}|1\rangle]|001\rangle
$$
And so, after reverting the phase gate and applying the Hadamard gate before the measurement, the result of the measure should be sharp, meaning that we should get $0$ in every shot. But, instead of this, the result is one half of the counts goes to $0$ and half to $1$, meaning that the qubit is some point of the ecuador of the Bloch sphere (it is important to say that the qubit is not neither on $|+\rangle$ state nor on $|-\rangle$ state). So, the if_test has some effect on the first qubit but not the expected.
On the other hand, if we implement the circuit with the c_if directive we obtain the desired results.

The cat entangler and the cat disentangler can be programmed as follows:
CAT ENTANGLER
CAT DISENTANGLER
Note that this implementation works if we try to make a distributed CNOT gate. Just doesn't work if we want a distributed phase shift.
As we said, the result of the measure should be sharp, meaning that we should get $0$ in every shot. That is what it should happen and what happens if we use c_if.
No response
Please can you provide a complete and minimal reproducer, including whatever you were using to generate the counts?  It would also help if you could provide the working version of the code.
Yes, of course! I am not really experimented on reporting issues, so thank you for the point out. First of all, the main file has the following appearence:
Then, the cat entangler and cat disentangler used are in the following zip file:
cat.zip
Note that the files ending in if_test are the ones using the if_test for the intermediate measures and the other ones are the ones using c_if. If there is something more needed tell me!
Sorry it took me a while to respond here.  Thanks for the extra code - it's helpful.  There's a lot going on here, though, and I'm not 100% sure that if_test is actually the problem.  I tried to run your reproducer with the current main branch of qiskit-terra, and it's telling me that there's some calls to QuantumCircuit.compose where the interior circuit doesn't have the number of clbits that are expected:
where repro.py is a file copy-pasted from your code block.
In Terra 0.22.2 (which is what you mentioned you've got), we didn't have that error-checking in place, so QuantumCircuit.compose could sometimes produce invalid circuits, instead of correctly throwing exceptions.  I think if you upgrade to Terra 0.23, it should help find the problems. Looking quickly to me, it looks like your CatEntangler doesn't create its inner circuit object with any clbits at all, so most like the problems you're seeing are related to that - Terra 0.22 was letting you build a circuit object that was internally inconsistent.
Could you try upgrading to Terra 0.23, fixing the places where there's the wrong numbers of bits in the circuits, and see if you're getting similar phase errors?
Terra 0.23 fixed the issues I was able to determine from this issue, so I'll close this now as fixed / can't reproduce, but please feel free to re-open it if I'm mistaken and there's still an issue here.
