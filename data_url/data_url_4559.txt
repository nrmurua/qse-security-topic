When drawing circuits of more than 10 qubits, there is a small misalignment due to the name of the qubits q10 and onwards being one character longer than q0 through q9. This can make controlled gates hard to follow, and the circuit to be misinterpreted.
Maybe the circuit should start at the same point regardless of the qubit name, or adding zeros if necessary to the first qubits eg. q00, q01, ...
(This happens both on a jupyter notebook display and terminal)
This is an example that I found:
