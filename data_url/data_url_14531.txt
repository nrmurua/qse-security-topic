We have quite a few tests that generate randomised data, without fixing a seed first.  This means very occasionally, the test suite can fail on unrelated PRs, if we get unlucky with tolerances.
For example, this recent CI run had a failure in test_isometry_tolerance, on a test case that used a random matrix.  For reference, the log was
and the test case is on a data element random_unitary(2).data, which is generated at collection time.
All generated data for tests should be done from a seeded position, so tests can be completely reproduced.
There's perhaps not one magic bullet that we can swap everything to; it's no good just monkey-patching random_unitary during collection to fix a seed, because then it will always return the same matrix for the same size.  With unittest, I think the order of test collection is deterministic (because it's based on the import order), so in the test_isometry case, we could generate the arguments to ddt.data in one block off a single seed at collection time.  I haven't really audited the rest of the tests to see any other cases, though.
This will also help with #7235
