There is a need to be able to support both an ipv4 and an ipv6 address for those setups that have a mixed bag of support for ipv6. This would enable gradual addoption of a fully public ipv6 setup.
This will mean that is possible to dev null yourself to hell so it needs to be very clear its possible.
