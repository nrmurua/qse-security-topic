Describe the bug
When using the tx_transfer command on the cli with a newly created and funded wallet, the command consumes OTS key 1 and will not advance automatically. After the first TX the command fails on key reuse. Manually adding --ots_key_index INTEGER flag of an unused OTS key in the tree will succeed.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Expected behavior
The expected behavior is to use the first key of the tree, then advance through the OTS bit field array consuming all available keys.
Desktop (please complete the following information):
Additional context
The transaction succeeds if you also supply the --ots_key_index INTEGER flag manually calling an unused key.
