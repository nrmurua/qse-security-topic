artiq.coredevice.runtime_exceptions.RTIOUnderflow: at 0 ps on channel 0, violation 0 ps
The bug happens when exceptions that are raised with parameters by the runtime are caught by a try/finally construct in the compiled code. The finally block re-raises the exception through the runtime's exception_raise, which clears the parameters. Fixing this properly needs making the compiler aware of exception parameters - not clearing the parameters when the compiled code raises an exception is not enough, e.g.
This bug is manifesting itself all the time at the moment, as the whole kernel code is encapsulated in a try/finally construct to handle RTIO handovers.
new-py2llvm does not exhibit this bug.
Please close when new-py2llvm is usable with the rest of ARTIQ.
Closing since new compiler was merged.
