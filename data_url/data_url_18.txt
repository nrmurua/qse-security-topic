In the REST remote platform test suite, the get_state_async test case resulted in sporadic hang when running the full llvm-lit test suite.
It ran successfully in isolation and the failure rate (when running as a full lit test suite) is quite small; hence it is difficult to debug. The test was skipped and needs further investigation.
