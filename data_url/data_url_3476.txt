Currently, running pytest pyquil/tests gives 375 passed, 5 skipped, 79 warnings. We should re-write the test code in a manner that avoids raising the huge number of Warning messages -- most of them (perhaps all?) related to declaring memory properly.
If this is still an issue I'd like to take a crack at it.

Go for it! I would pay particular attention to the deprecation warnings: deprecated stuff will eventually be removed, and so those warnings will become errors.
I too support going for it! Fwiw, the stats on the number of tests passed/skipped/generated-warnings etc might have changed since I first created that issue.
This was resolved in #950 yes?
Closing as is mostly resolved, and the remaining warnings are captured in other issues (e.g. #997)
