Minor request: when using Circuit.append_circuit, it would be convenient if the location parameter were optional in the case that the appended circuit and the circuit it's appended to are the same size.
Currently, this can be done with circuit + other or circuit += other. In partitioning, the append_circuit is used extensively when adding a subcircuit on a subset of qubits, so I think it is good to still have location required in this method. Nevertheless, thank you for the suggestion! Keep them coming :)
