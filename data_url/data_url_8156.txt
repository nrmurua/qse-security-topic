Describe the issue
Let us say Alice, Bob, Charlie share two entangled pairs among them. Bob creates two entangled pairs (A1, B1 is one entangled pair and B2, C2 another entangled pair). Bob distributes qubit A1 to Alice and distributes qubit C2 to Charlie. Now to create entanglement between Alice and Charlie, Bob has to create an entanglement between B1 and B2. Is there a possibility in QuTip to replicate this scenario and create entanglement between B1 and B2?
To Reproduce
If applicable, Please provide a minimal working example. For instance:
The terminal out put is
It is possible, using a tensor structure for the Hilbert space, with a subsystem assigned to each player. You can have a look at the documentation, where it shows the case of three coupled qubits. A library that specifically tackles quantum games is toqito, by @vprusso. You can ask more support in the google group forum, I am closing the issue.
Thanks for the mention @nathanshammah. @ganeshmylavarapu-qp, if you have any questions about how to make use of toqito for your particular use case, feel free to let me know how I can help out. Cheers!
