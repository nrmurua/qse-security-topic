As a part of #908, and as specified by the RFC we want to add a general concepts section to the docs about what backends Mitiq supports.
I was taking a look at the new executor section, and had a question about the backend section. @rmlarose I was looking back at the RFC and am not quite sure how the backends differ from the executor guide page. I think my best guess would be a short page linking to other examples that use the different backends as a part of executors? If not, can you help refresh my memory on what is needed here? Thanks!
Hey @crazy4pi314 absolutely. I suggest making a "core concepts" doc page on frontends and backends which minimally covers:
This then feeds into the Executors doc which covers program scheduling, results history, etc.
