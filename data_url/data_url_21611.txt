When explicitly or implicitly declaring a list/tuple/range variable inside a try/with statement which initializes to the return value of a function, the compiler crashes with an internal type error related to the IR.
See the following minimal examples. For the try statement I provided all three examples while I only provided one example for the with statement with the list. I assume the reader can imagine how the examples with the with statement and the range/tuple look like.
All example experiments should compile without problems.
The errors for all experiments are practically the same. See the message below. The only difference are the actual types in the error. List: {i32*, i32}* != i8*, tuple: {i32, i32}* != i8*, and range: {i32, i32, i32}* != i8*.
So far we found two workarounds for this bug, though we are not sure if these apply to all situations in which this bug can appear.
Probably related to #1531.
