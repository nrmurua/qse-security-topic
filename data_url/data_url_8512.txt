Solving time-dependent Hamiltonian problems, where the time array provided to mesolve doesn't have t[0]=0, gives unexpected results. This happens both for the list callback format and for the list array
format.
Example here.
Using qutip 3.1.0 and python 2.7
What exactly is the problem?  The example here:
https://github.com/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/examples/example-landau-zener.ipynb
works fine even though the start time is at t=-20.
There are two different issues and now I am realizing I should have filed them separately. One issue is that when I use a time-dependent Hamiltonian given in the list array format I get the wrong result.
Your example doesn't contain a time-dependent Hamiltonian given in list array format. To reproduce the issue in your example I replaced
with
For the other case (list callback format) I cannot reproduce the issue with your example. I am starting to think that this problem is not directly caused by having t[0] != 0. What I see is that for t0 > 5 in my example, I get a constant output from mesolve when I should get an oscillatory solution. Is it possible that the numerical integration is failing silently and the returned expectation values are just for the initial condition?
I am guessing this is closed.
