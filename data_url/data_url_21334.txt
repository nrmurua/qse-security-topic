For device drivers that perform conversions between machine-units and experiment/SI units the corresponding calibration data (shutter delays, aom power to dac voltage etc.) can reasonably be stored in the dataset database (for logging and tracking). Since device drivers don't currently get access to the dataset manager, we need a way to pass datasets into drivers.
A pattern would be to expose a configure() method on drivers (or pass configuration data in setattr_device("aom1", v2p=get_dataset("aom1_v2p").
