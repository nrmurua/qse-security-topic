With new Cirq 0.8 and Likely tf 2.2.0 on the way we should see about upgrading versions ourselves. This will be doable once we have #228 and #181 finished with tf.2.2 instead of the release candidate.
Going forward, now that we have an explicit dependency on cirq at a fixed version in setup.py we should be sure to remove the !pip install cirq==0.7.0 lines from the notebook tutorials since those will be redundant once we make this upgrade.
0.3 is out now.
