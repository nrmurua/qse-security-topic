Member functions std::vector<T, Alloc>::operator[] and typename std::vector<T, Alloc>::*iterator's are  slower than direct access to raw dynamic array and raw pointers.
Although this speed penalty is assumed to be mild, sometimes it is not ignorable in HPC.
For example, in K computer, std::vector<double> vec(n); for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) vec[i] = v; is 3 times slower than std::vector<double> vec(n); auto vec_data = vec.data(); for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) vec_data[i] = v;.
Commit 8ac4c9c doesn't change this problem.
This means this issue doesn't change the performance of the simulators.
Close this issue and make new issue #61
