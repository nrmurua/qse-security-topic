Now that qsim has open sourced and has enough features and tests, I think it's time we move to depending on them and having one version of qsim instead of ours and theirs. In order to begin the changeover this will roughly entail:
Once we get this done it should be easy to add new gate support since their qsim now has a gateset comparable to ours.

Tagging #171, TBD if this is needed or if external qsim handles this well
External qsim has fixed their fuser since we last saw it.
Now that we are on Step 4 and want to integrate qsim into our first op which @jaeyoo wants to take on, we need to do the following things:
Implement our own TFQFor to use with qsim that has the same Run and RunReduce function as this: https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim/blob/master/lib/parfor.h . The reason we need this is because openMP isn't supported in TF and we need to use TF threading: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/platform/threadpool.h (note this gets exported as tensorflow/core/lib/core/threadpool.h).
Rewrite the code in tfq_simulate_op.cc to use our new circuit_parser_qsim.
As a final note we want to change parallelization mechanisms to parallelizing in the same fashion as OSS qsim does now (see #255 ). This should make the rewrite of tfq_simulate_op.cc a lot simpler.
quantumlib/qsim#164 has just been resolved. Now we are waiting for qsim to push a new release and we can proceed with the transfer. The end is in sight :)
