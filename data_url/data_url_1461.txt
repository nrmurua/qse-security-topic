Description of the issue
Doing operations like __pow__, __mul__, __rmul__, __abs__, tensor_product etc. on a MutableDensePauliString return a DensePauliString because these methods are inherited from BaseDensePauliString which returns DensePauliString(...) instead of type(self)(...) in these methods.

Hi, I've opened a PR (#4892).
@tanujkhattar could someone quickly review my PR? I don't think there's anything complex or obscure here, but I'd still be happy to know if I have correctly tackled the issue. Thanks :)
