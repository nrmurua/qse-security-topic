In the do*d functions, after a KeyboardInterrupt or a BreakConditionInterrupt, the raised exception gets re-raised in the _handle_plotting function:
As a consequence, the data is not returned.
While this may be desired for KeyboardInterrupt, for a BreakConditionInterrupt it should not. Although I think, it doesn't harm to return the data even after a KeyboardInterrupt.
My proposal would be to return the data either way or only after a BreakConditionInterrupt.
Sounds reasonable to me. I would probably suggest that we simply log with a warning that the measurement has been interrupted and the data may be incomplete and then return it. @grothe6 Do you fell like making a pr with that change?
