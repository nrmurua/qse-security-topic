Similar to #34 . The advanced eQASM example should include compilation of "fast" feedback using the binary controlled gate.
Work on this should start after #34.
As explained in the CC-Light wiki page Conditional Execution, CC-Light can support two kinds of feedback control, one is the light-weight (LW) feedback control (also called fast feedback control). The other one is the comprehensive feedback control. The later one is not supported by CC-Light yet. For current experiment, we would require the LW feedback control.
The working principle of LW feedback control is already explained in the wiki page. Here, I list what should be done in the OpenQL side.
The support for this feature was already there. test_fast_feedback() in tests/test_cc_light.py has been added  and configuration has been updated accordingly to test it.
@imranashraf , I could not find the "cc_light_cond" in the operation specification.md file. I found it by going over the tests. I think we should add this to the documentation before releasing V0.3
I'm reopening this issue (we only need to add a single line to the documentation page).
@imranashraf It is important that when we document the use of fast feedback that we add that the opcode should be unique, similarly the codeword for conditional operations can still be the same as for the unconditional variants of these operations.
@imranashraf note that this debugging solved my problem.
@AdriaanRol sure will update it on Monday.
