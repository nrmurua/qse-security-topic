Optimization of model parameters can require certain re-computations.
We explicitly state when we optimize model parameters and implement the corresponding methods to avoid control flow during optimization.
Currently, the code checks every time a parameter is set if that parameters belongs to the model and triggers the appropriate re-computations.
