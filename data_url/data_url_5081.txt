The exaTN-Gen visitor to support two modes:
option for a reconstruct_gates: current behavior
option reconstruct_layers: counting layers (gates acting on disjoint subsets of qubits).
Currently, the visitor only supports reconstruction by 2-body gate counting.
Also, the reconstruction activation condition should become always true when reaching the last layer/gate.
