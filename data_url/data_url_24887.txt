In the online documentation, I believe the sign of the inductive part of the Hamiltonian for the tunable transmon is wrong (inconsistent with the code and with the documentation for non-tunable transmon).
Transmon:

TunableTransmon:

Implementation for Transmon...

...which is inherited by TunableTransmon:

Thank you for taking the time to report and post this, @loganbvh.
I suspect that, technically speaking, the sign in question is merely a gauge choice without consequences. Consider the map:
|n>  ->  |n>   for n odd,
|n>  -> -|n>  for n even
In any case, I agree that  consistency in that sign choice is valuable to avoid confusion, so I have made changes to the docstring in TunableTransmon (pulled for API docs generation) and the text in the User Guide/Qubits section. This has been pushed to scqubits/master and scqubits-doc/rtd and changes should be reflected in the online documentation. If you have a moment, please check and confirm before I close the issue.
Thanks for the quick response and fix! User Guide/Qubits looks consistent now, but I think that the docstrings for Transmon and TunableTransmon (which had the same sign in the previous commit, in contrast with User Guide/Qubits) are now inconsistent:


@loganbvh Should be fine now, but if there's anything left, please reopen. Thanks again for your time and help to improve this!
