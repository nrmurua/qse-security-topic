Most of the functions in random_objects.py take an N input and an optional dims. Those input are redundant as the size (N) can be obtained from the dims. However the way they handle this inconsistent:
Also some function have a default size, other not: rand_unitary(N, ...), rand_unitary_haar(N=2, ...).
The interface of these functions need to be unified.
Some options:
Hi, @Ericgig! I would like to work on this issue.
We cannot adopt the 3rd option in the master branch due to backwards compatibility, right? I'd rather avoid any single character variable wherever possible.
That said, I believe the second option you gave is the best one to adopt in the master branch. Once I finish, I can work on dev.major implementing the third option.
Hi @Leo-am,
Thank you for taking this issue.
Yes, with dev.major we can change the function call more easily, where as master should backwards compatibility.
So doing 2 first for v4.7 and 3 for v5 is the ideal.
Fixed in #1976.
