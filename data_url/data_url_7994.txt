The concurrence measure does not work with density matrix objects.

Hi @epelofske-LANL.
This behaviour in QuTiP is intentional for the following reason: If the dims of the system are [2, 2] then it's unambiguous how the system should be partitioned into two parts because the dims specify what the two parts. If the dims are [4] then one could divide the system in multiple ways depending on how one considers the four basis vectors.
If one knows that the four basis states are 00, 01, 10, 11, one can override the dims by writing dm.dims = [[2, 2], [2, 2]] or qutip.Qobj(dm, dims=[[2, 2], [2, 2]]).
Hope this helps. I agree this could be made more intuitive. Perhaps maximally_mixed_dm should allow specifying dims too instead of just N.
I'm closing this issue for now, but please feel free to continue the discussion in the comments.
