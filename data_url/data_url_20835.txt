The current SPHINCS code has an issue where the precomputation state array for SHA256 is defined in both sha256.h and sha256.c. This was caught when trying to link everything together in pqm4, but is not a problem when putting together the .a file in pqclean. The difference may be in the fact that pqm4 exposes all .h files through -I, but in pqclean it somehow disappears in the indirection created by the .a.
I'm not sure if this is a problem we should solve by adding the -Wredundant-decls flag to the building of the .a, or by changing the build process somewhat (i.e. by linking in the header files).
EDIT: See #167
Sounds reasonable to add this.
