BasicAer doesn't get the phases right (neither does Aer, but that'll probably be fixed within Aer). The tests using BasicAer, which I think is only test_to_matrix in test_extensions_standard works by coincidence because the rotation angles are 0 and thereby the phase difference is e^{i0} = 1.
Also this causes the tests in #4638 to fail, because there's a test using BasicAer where the phase is not 1.
Qobj global phase support was added to Aer in Qiskit/qiskit-aer#931
