When using circuit.measure_all() the "M" in measure is partially cutoff in the figure when using MPL drawer

Hi @nonhermitian , I'd like to have a look at this, if possible? It's my first issue. Thanks.
@nonhermitian @maddy-tod  Given this other PR which changed "measure" to "meas" ( #4079 ), I think we can close this issue and associated PR as there is enough horizontal space again. What do you think? It might still be worth thinking about the horizontal spacing and if/how we want to tweak it, as I described in this PR: #4087

I think this issue is already fixed after #4079. Reopen if disagree!
