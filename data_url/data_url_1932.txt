Thanks for opening @kevinsung! This is a real bug - collapse_wavefunction was deprecated but the code deprecation code had collapse_wave_function instead inconsistently. I opened a PR to fix it. What I'm puzzled about is how this worked on Python 3.7 and not in Python 3.8...maybe @deprecated_parameter doesn't work that well in Python 3.7...
