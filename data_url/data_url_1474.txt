Measurement error is one of the major sources of error when running circuits on the device. A common technique to compensate for the measurement error is to first compute a confusion matrix (aka calibration matrix) by running 2 ** n circuits to prepare all basis. Measurement outcomes from the i'th circuit becomes the i'th row of the matrix.
The resulting confusion matrix would be the transpose of a stochastic map from final states to measurement outcomes, s.t. M_obs = CM.T @ M_act. For 2 qubits, this corresponds to:
We can then use the computed confusion matrix to calibrate the measurement results of another experiment on the same qubits as:
Describe the solution you'd like
We should have utility methods / classes to
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters
Folks on the Mitiq project are also working on implementing measurement error mitigation: unitaryfund/mitiq#815 that might be a helpful example
We should add this to cirq/experiments. Look at potential collaboration opportunities with Unitary Fund.
