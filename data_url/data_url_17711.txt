A common case is that with a single swap, you get the job done. In this case, there is no need to do more trials. The current swap mapper does 20 trials regardless, however. The fix is simple.
I think this is fixed by the current StochasticSwap pass. @awcross1?
@1ucian0 yes, StochasticSwap breaks out of the trial loop now if the depth of the swap circuit for a given layer is 1
great, closing.
