Hello, there!
I tried to install Yao in terminal, and here is what it showed, (Julia version 1.5.3)
(@v1.5) pkg> add Yao
Installing known registries into ~/.julia

Looking forward to your reply.
That doesn’t seem like a Yao issue. Did you try and install another package to determine if it was Yao or Pkg?

Thanks, you're right. It's not a Yao issue. But I just still don't know how to solve it.
I think this is a PkgServer issue I've pinged @staticfloat on slack. Are you using it from China? Maybe there's something happening for the redirect?
I think it is an issue from the PkgServer. And I solve this it temporarily by changing the mirror of the PkgServer.
I'm closing this since it's not our issue, feel free to open new issues if you have any questions.
