Having lists of gates in Past and Past in each alternative for mapping a 2q gate
makes OpenQL quadratic in time/space on the number of gates in the circuit.
When not scheduling gates anymore in an alternative, these lists can be dropped
making the quadratic behavior linear.
This requires investigating past use and updating it.
Solved in PR #467 as described in the analysis.
