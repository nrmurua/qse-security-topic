Since some unit tests (eg. Quantum Channels) are as many lines of code as the actual package, it might be a good idea to move the unit testing frame work and unit tests to a separate package which isn't loaded by default. The package could then be loaded by a specific function to run the unit tests, and then be cleared.
Eg. Something like:
Moved unit tests to /test/ folder. QUTesting.m now loads the tests only when the function TestResults, or RunAllTests is called.
