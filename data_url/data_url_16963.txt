Calling dag_drawer() in the tutorial 4_transpiler_passes_and_passmanager.ipynb on IQX yields the following error:

Ran other code that calls dag_drawer() as well, and this results in the same error.
Draw the dag without errors
It's caused because of an incompatibility with networkx 2.4 and nxpd which is used to generate the visualizations. There are 2 fixes in progress for it, one in the upstream nxpd lib: chebee7i/nxpd#15 and the other in terra itself (which is to stop using nxpd): #3280 (this is blocked on test failures on python 3.5 with networkx 2.4, likely caused by assumed dict ordering)
In the meantime the only way to avoid this is to downgrade networkx to 2.3.0 (which is what we do for ci and test envs).
