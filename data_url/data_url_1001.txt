This came up in the review of #4707 that we could potentially write a heuristic for efficient state preparation using a single application of an entangling 2q gate by solving for surrounding PhsXZ angles and optimizing the fidelity b/w current state and desired state. The approach would be similar to approximate unitary decomposition approach proposed in #4362
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
Marking as after 1.0 as this is a feature addition
