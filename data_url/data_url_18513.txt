The compressor currently contains routines for generating circuits that carry a fixed complex line in the state space to another complex line. This restricts the applicability of compression by state preparation, and we could try to widen this by understanding how to send a complex n-frame to a complex n-frame.
I'm not aware of literature resources that address this specifically. This task will be made much easier by finding those.
