Wallet version 0 are decrypted by CLI but fails while saving decrypted file.
The issue is related to https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/blob/master/src/qrl/core/Wallet.py#L325 which triggers Exception before saving the file. The above line in code is missing check if the wallet is encrypted or partial encrypted.
