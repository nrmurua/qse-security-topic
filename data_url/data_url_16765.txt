Doing backend.configuration().to_dict() gives backend rep_times as [0] when the actual values are [0.001].
Do backend.configuration().to_dict() on a pulse-enabled backend.
This is likely something to do with the internal casting to Si. The schemas then grab the Si value when to_dict is called and cast it to an int. This related to the problem of mixing together the transport and Python object representations. @mtreinish
