Python 3.6 support was dropped in #3574, but Python 3.6.9 is the default version in Colab. So, after the next release, docs currently couldn't be run in Colab despite the prominent "Run in Google Colab" button in each.
For example, if I try to install from master on Colab now:
I get:
Apparently there are ways to install different Python versions in Colab, e.g. as described here.
Yeah, this is definitely a tricky situation. For now we still work mostly on 3.6. Colab will get their version sorted out sooner or later, they are actively working on it.
However, the particular error you pointed out only happens when you install from git as the python_require config is used by setup.py. However, the distributed wheel from pypi does not check for this - the solution is to use pip install cirq --pre.

That seems like a local runtime spun up to connect to. That's not something relevant for our use case - we need a hosted version with python 3.7.
I'm going to close this - given that we have a workaround for the actual issue. However, if this bites us in some way, we'll need to figure it out - we can reopen it again.

Ah! I didn't know this. Agree it should be closed - thanks!
