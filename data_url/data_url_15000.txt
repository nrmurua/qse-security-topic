While trying to parse a qasm2 string consisting of u0 gate call from the qelib1.inc gates, an error is encountered. The traceback for the error is :
The following code snippet would reproduce the issue :
The qasm2 string should parse correctly into a QuantumCircuit object.
I think u0 case should be handled correctly in the file ast_to_dag.py while calling the AstInterpreter._process_node(self, node) function
The new OQ2 parser (qiskit.qasm2.load{,s}) released in 0.24 should have fixed this problem, and QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str will switch to that implementation from Terra 0.25 in July/August.
Fwiw, u0(0.5) is logically invalid and the new parser will complain about it - u0 is a very old and now non-existent gate on IQX that represented an integer number of single-qubit-gate delay cycles, so its parameter could only be an integer.
Alright, thanks a lot for the clarification!
