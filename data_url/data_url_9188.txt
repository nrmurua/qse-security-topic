The Walrus currently uses eigen to do linear algebra in C++, this allows for flexibility. Typically linear algebra routines are optimised for dealing with big matrices, however, in the walrus one will never deal with a matrix that is larger than say 120. It would be good to know what are the best linear algebra libraries for "small" matrices.
Are there any important section(s) of the code involving small matrices that could work as testing grounds for an analysis involving different matrix libraries?
Hi Trevor --- Have a look at e.g. 
Also this issue: #36 deals with a somewhat related problem, whether to use matrix decompositions or the Fadeev-Leverrier method for calculating power traces...
Okay thanks I'll use that section.
