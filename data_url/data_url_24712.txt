Passing an indexed ExpressionVector to ForLoopPTs loop_index argument raises an InvalidParameterNameException. qctoolkit is fine with getting an indexed parameter for loop_range though:
This is no bug. The loop index is required to be a variable name. There is no support for expression substitution. Please open a feature request with a valid use case if you need it(a lot of work to implement).
