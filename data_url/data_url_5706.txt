It seems that the noise model from the backends that are freely accessible have prohibited values set in their noise model.
For "ibm_nairobi":
For "ibm_oslo"
Some of these values are truncated by 20%, which seems significant. I would check, if there are some serious errors involved either in the calculation or the way the values are processed.
#1639 stops printing this kind of warnings.
