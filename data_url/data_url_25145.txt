Currently, if one writes unit tests for workflows written with Covalent, there is the real possibility that the data is ultimately added to the user's production database, which would not be desirable. A better option would be to have a feature that could be used in the test suite that would switch to storing results in a temporary-in-memory database.
This isn't urgent or anything, but I wanted to log the idea here.
As noted by @wjcunningham7:
One option is to change the database that covalent uses by modifying the env var COVALENT_DATABASE.  E.g.,
You'd also want to modify the data directory,
so that pickles generated during testing don't end up with the production data.
