Hi!
I am unable to have two instances of the QDevil QDAC (qcodes/instrument_drivers/QDevil/QDevil_QDAC.py) in two different/separate Jupyter notebooks simultaneously. Initializing the QDevil QDAC in the first Jupyter notebook works fine, but when initializing the same QDevil QDAC in the second Jupyter notebook (with a separate kernel) throws a SerialException error, probably because it is connected to the PC through USB and it doens't seem possible to connect to it from two separate notebooks.
It would be great if it's possible to initialize a QDevil QDAC in multiple Jupyter notebooks/kernels, perhaps by somehow sharing the device/sharing the USB connection in a clever way.
SerialException error is thrown when the QDevil QDAC is already initialized in another notebook on the same PC.
OS: Windows 10 64-bit
qcodes version: 0.31.0
Would you have any suggestions for a solution? Thank you very much in advance!
Hi
Most of the instruments qcodes supports are not designed to be remote controlled from more than one connection.
You may want to have a look at https://github.com/toolsforexperiments/instrumentserver which is an instrument server that acts as a proxy to the instruments. We may eventually implement such a feature in qcodes but we cannot commit to any promises to when that will happen
Hi @jenshnielsen, thank you for your reply and pointing out the instrument server. In the meantime we came up with a temporary "hacky" solution for our use-case, but we might invest in looking into a cleaner solution.
It would be interesting to see an implementation in qcodes someday (though I can imagine it is not a priority for you/the developers right now)!
