Add the B gate, which is known to lead to optimal decompositions of 2Q gates into only two B gates. That is, let G be an operator in PU(4). Then
where Ln are one-qubit gates.
The definition in the paper is (verbatim):
In addition to defining B, write a few define-compilers for it, especially with respect to other 2Q gates.
Note: This would change the Quil spec.
