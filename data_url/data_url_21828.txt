Summary:
So, this is either some obscure HMC7043 issue or some obscure FPGA issue.
I'm away until Monday. @marmeladapk could you see if you can reproduce this on your board, both with current master and with current master with de7d64d reverted.
@hartytp I'll try to test this today remotely, but tommorow and next week I won't have external clock reference for RTM.
Thanks @marmeladapk (although I'm not sure how much you can do on this without an external clock).
The thing we need to know is whether these phase jumps occur on the HMC7043 outputs, or if there is some issue inside the FPGA. As far as I can tell, it's the latter, but I may be wrong. If you can reproduce this and do some probing, that would be a massive help -- beyond testing this with that commit reverted, there is not so much else I can do on it right now.
One other comment: it's worth getting an eye scan with 
replaced with
and changing the FPGA system frequency to 150MHz.
That allows us to simplify the example and check there isn't some issue with the RTIO counter.
Ok, applied patch linked in op against 0483b8d, board produced this beefy (almost 1 MB) log.
@hartytp Building with de7d64d reverted against 0483b8d. Check here if these are the changes you intended me to make.
Edit: log

Hmm...that looks okay AFAICT. And, you don't get any alignment errors.
Will have a more detailed look at this all on Monday.
The results on my board are not deterministic, it just "works most of the time".... maybe run it a few times.
move the SYSREF by one cycle of the 1.2GHz clock, so 34 delay taps (25ps each tap)
@hartytp Note that due to the combination of the analog and 1/2 CLKIN digital delay (which is made necessary by the limited range of the analog delay), some "taps" are not 25ps. The average is about 24.5ps per tap.

Okay, I didn't realise that.
Do you see any of the bad eye scans that I see? Here "Bad" = hysteresis between the eye scan and the value we measure at the "default phase" after the scan, or slips moving the transition by significantly more than 34 taps.

Yes. But should be very close to 34 taps.

@sbourdeauducq ping...
Updated to the latest ARTIQ and applied @sbourdeauducq's patch. Here is a log of eye scans over a few reboots: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XISSM9aPlzmweKNJxhf10-zSkfHIoZAQ
This definitely shows some issues. e.g. look at the way the first trace jumps from a transition here [    26.579247s]  INFO(board_artiq::hmc830_7043::hmc7043): 124: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to all 0s in a single slip. Then, later on we go from all 0s directly to a transition here: [    41.853690s]  INFO(board_artiq::hmc830_7043::hmc7043): 52: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. Again, that's not consistent with a slip being approx 34 taps.
Again, we see the hysteresis where during the eye scan we get [    30.325097s]  INFO(board_artiq::hmc830_7043::hmc7043): 35: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] but, going back to the default phase after the eye scan, we get [    31.152607s]  INFO(board_artiq::hmc830_7043::hmc7043): 35: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
So, this does not work on my board at the moment.
After reverting de7d64d I no longer see this: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fYrKuaXlRAZLdYwOmTLM0nqOYlmeDFoc (NB should have left more time between reboots in my script).
So, it seems likely that this is a symptom of the same issue that's breaking JESD when the GTP_CLK2 is used.
@gkasprow did you have a chance to look at SI on the GTP_CLK1/2 AMC FPGA inputs yet? @sbourdeauducq other than that, any ideas how we investigate this. Currently ARTIQ master is unusable on my Sayma, and IIRC the ones in WUT.
other than that, any ideas how we investigate this.
Output the clock as seen by the FPGA (output ODIV2 of the IBUFDS_GTE3 in jesd204_tools) on another FPGA output pin (e.g. the SMA), connect it to a scope and check for problems.
@sbourdeauducq or @marmeladapk can you have a go at that, please?
@hartytp Sorry, I won't be able to test this, I won't be in uni for at least three weeks.
@marmeladapk no problem, thanks for letting me know.
@gkasprow when will you be able to check the SI for the GTP_CLK{1,2} AMC inputs?
Provisionally, I do not believe that this or #1080 are due to errors.
@sbourdeauducq what is your plan for tracking this down?
@gkasprow it would be good if you could repeat that measurement and also probe the GTP_CLK{1,2} FPGA inputs on a board that's not working...
NB I'm building without SAWG and still see this and the PBRS issues.
@sbourdeauducq what is your plan for tracking this down?
Can this be narrowed down further, i.e. just use the IBUFDS_GTE3 as a clock buffer to the fabric, remove transceivers and all JESD204 stuff, and simplify the SYSREF logic into the minimum code that would demonstrate a problem?

Yes, that could be done. If you send me a patch that does it them I'm happy to test.
Alternatively, we could look at the PRBN issues first, as that removes any uncertainty over the HMC7043...
I'm also happy to post you the non-working board if you want to investigate this locally.
@sbourdeauducq It would probably be worthwhile to look at #1055 before spending more time on this. If the phases statuses bit behaves differently on the working and non-working bits, then that would be a smoking gun that would be easier to track down...
PRBS is a lot more complicated than a minimized repro of this issue.
Fine, however you want to approach it. I'll leave it to you. But, this is a high priority issue for me since it currently prevents me from using Sayma at all.
@hartytp Can you test again with the latest code?
@gkasprow I just tried to test the latest firmware, but my AMC has developed an issue. When I power it on, I hear a hum and only the 12V0 and 0V9 LEDs come on. The 0V9 LED is flashing and the current from the PSU is bouncing between a couple of hundred mA and close to 0A.
Any ideas what could be wrong, or should I send this back to you (I'm shipping other boards to TechnoSystems right now, so could combine shipments).
Please discuss this bug in the hardware tracker.
@sbourdeauducq #1055 is now closed. Please return to this issue. Have you located an oscilloscope scope to do basic tests like this in HK?
Things are working correctly on the hk board.
@hartytp Please close if there is no more problem after the hardware fix.
When I get my board back, I'll retest and close this issue if all works okay.
