The run methods in Engine, EngineProgram and EngineClient now include a parameter called processor_id. This parameter can be used to specify a specific processor for the run, and will substitute the deprecated parameter processor_ids , because allowing multiple candidate processors was not useful in practice.
Hey @jurruti , could I pick this up ?
Hi @SudhanshuJoshi09 , are you still interested in taking this issue?
