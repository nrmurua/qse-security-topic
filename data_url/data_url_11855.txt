Now eval method in the operator includes multiple steps, so intermediate might be useful for the users.
E.g., users want to get the cirucits for the evaluation.
It will be better we split the steps of eval into multiple methods and then users have higher flexible to do that.
We can split it into three steps:
With this enhancement, we create the potential to bundle the circuits of different parameters in wavefunction during the VQE.
E.g., in SPSA, we need to evaluate Operate against with theta+ and theta-. if we can bundle the circuits of theta+ and theta- together, we can submit them together, rather than run them separately.
