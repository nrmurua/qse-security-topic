The way colorbars are being managed is being shifted towards using ScalarMappable and so our current usage of set_clim raises a deprecation warning and also causes problems.
Below shows examples of the problem:
I think a quick workaround is to point qcodes_colorbar to the QuadMesh, but I think the proper thing to do would be to introduce an extra ScalarMappable somewhere, but qcmatplotlib is already poorly maintained it's due for an overhaul...
