From the best I can tell, it looks like execute tries to transpile the PulseQobj by default. I also tried providing the kwarg pass_manager = PassManager() to bypass the transpilation step, but it gave the same result.
The job should be submitted to the backend successfully.
This is an issue with execute attempting to trasnpile even if experiments are pulse schedules. I will submit a patch. In the near term the workaround is the submit the qobj directly through the backend.
Upon giving a second look at this issue. I realized that the reason for the failure was that you were trying to execute the assembled qobj. Instead execute should be passed the list of schedules directly. Qobjs can be submitted with backend.run as above.
