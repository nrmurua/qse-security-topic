May also want to switch SHA3 implementation to PQClean's, since OQS's is missing several things, including SHA3-384.
#517 started to use OpenSSL for some SHA-3 functions, but only the non-incremental API.  This issue is now about using OpenSSL for the SHA-3 incremental API.  Note that this may need a change in the PQClean SHA-3 API to use an opaque context object.
Closing due to #922.
