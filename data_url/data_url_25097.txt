The condition should ideally be that no more pairs are possible. But it is instead based on the number of qubits left unpaired. This causes a bug with the Rigetti device, due to their being only 19 playable qubits on a 20 qubit device.
It could be easily hacked around, but should be sorted properly.
Edit: Note that this issue is only relevant for manual play.
A solution is provided in this commit.
It's not wonderful, so we'll keep the issue open.
Better solution in this commit. Used fact that pos.keys is a list of active qubits.
