As per the discussion here it may be advisable to add to oqs-openssl111 the ability to set OIDs dynamically to integrate it into interoperability testing setups. For reference, oqs-provider already has this capability.
General question: Do we want oqs-openssl111 participate in interop testing? If no, this issue can be closed as "wontfix".
The OpenSSL project has indicated that OpenSSL 1.1.1 will reach end-of-life in September 2023.  As such, we are discontinuing development on OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1, and recommend all users switch to OpenSSL 3 and the OQS Provider for OpenSSL 3, which provides all the same functionality that OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1 does.  Hence we are closing open pull requests and issues in OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1 as won't-fix.
