Description of the issue
cirq.decompose on cirq.DiagonalGate should produce operations that add up to an equivalent unitary.
How to reproduce the issue
This fails on all qubit numbers on the assert_allclose_up_to_global_phase check.
Cirq version
v0.11.0.dev
Note
The current test_decomposition_unitary tests uses randn - which produces random numbers based on the normal distribution. This produces that are larger than pi rarely.
Also, we are not using a seed in this test - making it suspect to flakiness.
The above test is more accurate in terms of specification and tests a larger range of angles.
@ybc1991 can you have a look at this?
Sure, will take a look
@balopat Ah, the problem is the input of the diagonal gate is the angles in radians instead
of the [0-1] to represent between 0 to 2*pi.
In the testing code, just change expected_f into  expected_f = [np.exp(1j * angle) for angle in diagonal_angles] will be fine.
Oh, I'm silly.
It's the other way around though, I wanted the angles to "cover" [0, 2pi] instead of [0,1]:
Works :) Thanks for the quick check. Closing.
