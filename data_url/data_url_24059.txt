In my windows laptop, the resolution is 1920x1080, but the result is a pretty congested GUI. in the image i aded my notepad++ gui to offer a compare.

You can see that the main gui icons are gigantic compared to that of notepad++. you can also see that the text in the source code edit is much larger than notepad++ and that the help screen on the right is even larger.
Is there a way to minimize all this real estate? (smaller icons, smaller text, buttons to zoom in-out text size, etc)
Here is another image, you can see how small the realestate for the layout gets, even the numbers in the matplotlib are huge. The size of the basic text in the menu on the left is fine though, and the text size in the log box at the bottom is smaller but still perfectly readable.

Last but not least. Do you know of a way to make night mode consistent? having only part of the screen dark, makes the white parts pop out much more, so at the end of the day it might end up tiring the eye more than the original all white theme
Run on windows, load the edit component dialog
Normal sized icons and scaling
