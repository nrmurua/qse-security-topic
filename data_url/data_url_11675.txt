When a circuit library var for such as TwoLocal (RY, RYRZ) is used the outcome of variational algorithms such VQE varies despite the setting random seeds. Not only does it vary but supplying the optimal parameters of one run as the starting point for the parameters of a new run gives an entirely different result. This breaks things on a number of levels including bootstrapping along a dissociation curve based on prior result where we take the optimal parameters, trying to recreate final vqe state for use as an initial state to phase estimation etc.
