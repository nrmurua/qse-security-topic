What am I doing wrong?
That is the output.
array([], shape=(1, 0), dtype=float64) is the output from the script not part of it. Remove that line and it will return that.
This is a duplicate of: #1898 so closing it to track it there
Err I guess it's slightly different #1898 is for an array of registers and this is for an array of circuits. I'll keep it separate for now and we can integrate if the solution ends up being the same
It is different. in contrast to the title of #1898, you can create an array of registers:
the output is a bit funky though:
And what's the expected output?
A 1D array with elements that are QuantumCircuit instances:
It seems that happens because QuantumCircuit.__getitem__ pulls from QuantumCircuit.data.
This issue seems fixed already in Terra 0.11.
Feel free to repoen if that's not the case.
