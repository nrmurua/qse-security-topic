PR #741 added support for the Adaptive Profile, but it added a new test that did not pass yet. The test is marked as XFAIL, which allows the CI to know this is an expected failure. This issue captures that issue and is a placeholder for future work.
Run the commands captured at the top of test/NVQPP/qir_test_cond_for_break.cpp.
The unit test should be able to successfully run to completion without failure.
Not a regression
No response
