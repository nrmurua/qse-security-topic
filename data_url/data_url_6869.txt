Wouldn't it be awesome to be able to rearrange circuits by dragging qubit lines up and down? Suggest making the initial |0> a draggable object.
One of the tricky things here is what should happen to multiqubit operations.

Here's what I think the rules would be:
Alternative solution:
Most of the other dragging moves don't go out of their way to preserve functionality, so it would be unusual for the wire drag to be uniquely obsessed with it. Preventing the drag if it doesn't preserve functionality seems particularly perverse, because I imagine in most use cases the wire drag will save work by almost doing what you want (so you only have to do the tweaks instead of the whole task).
On the other hand, the wire drag is the easiest to make function-preserving. And if the user thinks of it as a qubit relabeling, they would expect that. I can definitely make the drag functionally neutral by judiciously introducing/cancelling swap/rotation gates. I would need to think carefully about this, so that reordering wires couldn't cause the swaps to grow without bound and wouldn't take away swap gates that the user actually wanted to keep.
Semantics preserving qubit reordering would be excellent.
Fixed by 7b1b065 , which does the simplest possible thing (gates associated with their top wire). Will be in next release.
