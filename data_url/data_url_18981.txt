Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Higher levels of the transmon have not been thorougly been tested for lindblad simulation.
The Lindblad simulation takes a very long tme especially for long sequences. It is therefore necessary to have a faster approximate version not involving full matrix exponentiation of the superoperator.
Describe the solution you'd like
Implement how noise scales for higher levels of the transmon.
Approximate faster calculation of the Lindblad propagation
Describe alternatives you've considered
