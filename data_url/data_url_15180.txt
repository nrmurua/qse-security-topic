I recently implemented a version of the Z2symmetry class working with SparsePauliOp. In an effort to avoid duplicate lines in the find_z2_symmetries class, we refactored how it runs through all three symmetry cases 'Z_or_I','Y_or_I', 'X_or_I'.
I'm realising that only the main case 'Z_or_I' was being tested and that one of the latest commit of the original PR introduced errors in the other cases (not tested).
In practice, an error is being raised when using these method for certain qubit operators
The find_z2_symmetries method should produce sq_list and sq_paulis objet with the same size as the number of symmetries.
This is due to a mistake in the use of break to escape a for loop. This cannot be seen from the test but from a comparison with the working implementation of find_Z2_symmetries for PauliSumOp.
