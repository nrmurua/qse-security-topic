(Moved from quantumlib/OpenFermion-Cirq#342)
On my linux machine, the following code runs to completion. But apparently it fails on Windows. @c-poole could you confirm that it fails on your machine and, if so, try to cut it down to a smaller amount of code?
Repro code:
Reported error text:
Not just windows. I run into this same error on Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.6.7
I'll have a look.
Using cirq.Simulator is somehow forcing this error while Xmon is giving attribute error of cos definition.
Root of the problem is in Sympy most probably, I'll look into it.
@HiggsBoson3310 This code is fine on cirq version 0.4.0 with cirq.symbol. A temporary fix would be downgrading your installed cirq version and changing calls for sympy.symbol to cirq.symbol.
My windows machine runs this code without error
I believe the error is a result of applying cirq 0.5 documentation to cirq 0.4, or vice versa. Closing is not reproduceable.
