Linux CentOS 8. Compiler in question:
Errors (warnings that are treated as errors):
Ping...?
This is a false positive: the bugprone-signed-char-misuse lint seems to aim to prevent errors with characters (text).
Here we're treating signed char as an integer type which I'm sure is what @pornin intended to do — and a signed-to-signed comparison is what's intended.
We should probably disable that lint.
