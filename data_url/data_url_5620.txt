This is how the definition looks now in the code:
void insert_sim_op(std::vector<Operations::Op> &ops, char *name, const reg_t &qubits) const
...but it's called sometimes with a const char*, for example in CacheBlocking::restore_qubits_order there are calls like insert_sim_op(ops, "begin_blocking", qubitMap_).
Compiling this with the latest VC++ fails.
I was trying to compile (actually, I succeeded after changing the above to const char* and having a little bit of joy with libraries) a c++ project to have the qiskit aer simulator available in it. Since I couldn't build the usual way (troubles with conan), I simply included the needed headers, linked the proper libs and included qv_avx2.cpp in the visual studio project and after making a proxy class I managed to have something working.
Compiling without an error.
Change it to void insert_sim_op(std::vector<Operations::Op> &ops, const char *name, const reg_t &qubits) const (both for the definition and the declaration, of course).
