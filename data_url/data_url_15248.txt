When building a transpiler target, the properties for added instructions are optional. The documentation of qiskit.transpiler.Target.add_instruction says Properties are optional for any instruction implementation, if there are no InstructionProperties available for the backend the value can be None.. However, it seems this claim is true for all instructions except measurement.
The below code snippet shows how to construct a very simple target with one qubit and measurement instruction associated with it. The measurement instruction does not have any properties (i.e. it is specified as None). Then, this target is used to transpile a circuit, which results into the error pasted above
The transpilation should not fail
