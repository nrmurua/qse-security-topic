I tried modifying the frequency of a periodic pulse using the init_pulse_params argument to qutip.control.optimize_pulse (GRAPE algorithm). I tried passing, for example,
but no matter what I choose for 'num_waves', I always get exactly one period (num_waves=1.0) for the initial pulse. Similarly if I try to pass a 'freq' key in the dictionary. Looking at the code, it looks like this is hard coded in create_pulse_optimizer (line 1942: pgen.num_waves = 1.0). Either this is a bug, or I'm misunderstanding how to use the interface.
Seems quite likely that there is a bug here. I will investigate further and try to fix now.
I have replicated this. The hardcode num_waves seems a bit spurious. I think it is best to delete it altogether. It does mean that it breaks backward compatibility, but I can't why anyone would rely on this (or why I coded it that way in the first place)
I am working on unit tests for this now.
