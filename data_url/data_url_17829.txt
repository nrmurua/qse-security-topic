After I acquired fresh token from https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/account/advanced
IBMQ.load_accounts() fails.

Would be better if  IBMQ.load_accounts() accepted me. All worked well w/ ver 0.5.
Can you try enable_account or regenerating the token. Your code should work. If you type IBMQ.stored_accounts() do you see the account.
@pacomf I can confirm this has happened to me today as well.
I cant reproduce the bug, i regenerate my APIToken and it works fine using qiskit terra... is it still happening? Can you send me more details?
It happened for about 5 hours on the weekend. However, @nonhermitian could run at the same time and then it started working again.
Mmmm, maybe an issue with the API... we will investigate it
I will add that, when it happened to me, I could log into some accounts and not others.
Hi @jaygambetta,
your tip helped. IBMQ.stored_accounts() has returned some  old token, not the new one.
Looks like IBMQ.save_account(myToken) is unable to replace token if it exist - I leave it to you to decide if it is a bug or a feature.
My hack around it is to execute first: IBMQ.delete_accounts()
to clear my old token. So this sequence always works:
IBMQ.delete_accounts() myToken='b6abe11442c9a...' IBMQ.save_account(myToken) IBMQ.load_accounts()
I can move on, closing thus ticket.
Thanks for help

Let's leave this open and investigate whether there's a bug with IBMQ.save_account() re-writing old tokens.
@diego-plan9 can you please have a look?
Yes - thanks @balewski for the information, which is spot on - currently, IBMQ.save_account() will just print a warning and do nothing else if old credentials are present:

Actually ... I can't decide if it is a bug or a feature either! ðŸ¤” In the original draft implementation, the .save_account() (.add_account() by that time) method was raising an Exception in the case of trying to store a duplicate account. This was later changed to a warning, I'm unsure if by design and as a hard requisite from Jupyter-users needs, or also related to the slight tuning of the method functionality (ie. not authenticating during the call, just storing in disk). So I'm actually de-assigning myself, as probably the rest of the team has a more fresh view of the design decisions related to #1000.
I think we have several options:
One way or the other, I think we need to make sure that the flow for updating an existing stored token is a bit smoother than the delete-save workaround proposed by @balewski, as it seems a relatively common use case.
I think save_account should not raise an exception. Overwriting is not bad behavior. Similar to overwriting a key in a dict or something. Should just work.
@ajavadia is there an update.
Hi,
there is some inconsistency between the devices status you show here:
https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/account/advanced
and actual avaliability.
At this moment, both ibmqx4 and ibmq_16_melbourne are reported to work.
However,. when I try to submit my circuit using  Qiskit ver: 0.6.1 I get the error below for either.
Got a 400 code response to https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/api/Jobs?access_token=VCgYWnMUUBaYeT5gSmGO14cX93Foo4rccsLUVvIjf3bwYEZNjxlDcRmPArS2wZ25: {"error":{"status":400,"message":"Generic error","code":"GENERIC_ERROR"}}
Note, my token is correct, because I can submit the circuit to your simulator
'backend': 'ibmq_qasm_simulator',
'jobId2': '1814808',
'startTime': '2018-11-09 17:53:28'}
Can you have a look ?
Thanks
Jan
@balewski the "GENERIC ERROR" you see is intermittent behavior on the cloud API, I think. You don't see it consistently right? It should be unrelated to the original issue.
The original issue about overwriting old credentials is addressed in PR #1295.
I read up on #1295. Am I supposed to add 'overwrite=true' as code somewhere? I was not clear on how to add that parameter. Thank you.
