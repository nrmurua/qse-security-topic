Describe the bug
qutip.random_objects.rand_ket does not work as intended
rand_ket(N=0, density=1, dims=None, seed=None) should be to figure out what N is, given dims is assigned when N is set to be 0 or None.
To Reproduce
The terminal out put is
Expected behavior
rand_ket should give you the same answer as rand_ket(2, dims=[[2],[1]])

Whoops, you're right.  That prod should say np.prod instead and there's a similar bug in rand_ket_haar.  Thanks for reporting it!
I also wouldn't be averse if someone wants to change the signature of rand_ket to
so that it becomes possible to do rand_ket(dims=[[2], [1]]) without needing to specify the first argument.  Obviously there'll need to be a couple more tests in the function to ensure that at least one of N and dims was passed.
