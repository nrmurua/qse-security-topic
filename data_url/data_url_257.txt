The tests in python/tests/backends are currently failing when installing aarch64 python wheels for all (tested) distributions. I haven't looked more closely than that they seem to be segfaulting after completion and pretty independent on what tests are run.
Search for # ARM: comment in the .github folder, and replace the hardcoded [amd64] platform id with the commented out code, then run CI.
Tests should pass.
Not a regression
Possibly related: #303
This was fixed in #557. Closing.
