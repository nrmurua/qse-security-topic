The following two molecules show significant energy differences with respect to reference code. This must be investigated.
Energies:
@Altaimorin This appears to stem from the initial guess. Can you please check what's going in the SAD guess code for HI example?
The difference in SCF energy for HI is due to ECPs. The def2-SVP basis set uses an 18-electron ECP for iodine. We do not support ECPs. Iodine was removed from the basis sets.
The difference in SCF energy for CaCl2 persists. This still needs to be investigated.
