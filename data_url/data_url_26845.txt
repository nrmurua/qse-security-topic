I found the following issues so far:

@mtaillefumier could you take a look, please?
It seems that n_rep_val does not quiet behave as documented: while it returns the number of variables it seems to consider an array as 1 variable. Using SIZE(...) of the array seems to be the proper way.
This patch should do the trick. I already updated SIRIUS in my local repo but wanted to finish another thing before making a pull request. If it does not work I will send it to you by mail.

@mtaillefumier unfortunately it doesn't. I fixed two of the 3 mentioned issues now (also including the same fix as your patch.txt), see master...dev-zero:feature/update-sirius but I still get the following error with NGRIDK 1 1 1 (e.g. the default, for example with regtest-1/H2.inp):
The last error you get is from sirius and related hydrogen pseudo potential. It will need an update of sirius when I find why it crashes.
Ok the crash is due to bad pseudo that do not indicate necessarily everything. This bug only happens with hydrogen not the others so far. I would sugget you to just remove this test from the list (not the input file) and go on with it. I am working on properly fixing the problem.
