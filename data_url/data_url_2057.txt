I'm always baffled by the members of this class. If you do a wavefunction simulation you need result.final_state but if you do a density matrix simulation you need result.final_density_matrix.
The state vector / wavefunction terminology rears its head when you're trying to use PauliString.expectation_from_xxx
Is your main issue with the naming?  i.e. is #2143 your beef?
Yes, closing as duplicate
