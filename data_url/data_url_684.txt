Hello,
Thanks for help.
I make small Hadamard test one qubit, run on PC is OK, how make run quantum computer for test?
Or this is only simulation?
How many max qubit can make on PC?
Thanks you.
This is a simulator, and the number of qubits depend on how much RAM you have. Typically, you can simulate around 20-24 qubits on a laptop.
Ok,
Can export to QASM to test if circuit is worng?
