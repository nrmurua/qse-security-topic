now conditional import of logging is run.
When Qcodes is imported in a python notebook which is build by sphinx, qcodes conditionally start logging.
The function logger.running_in_test_or_tool is evaluated after running logger.start_logging_on_import raising an exception.
The following error is raised.

do i understand correctly that "import qcodes" does not instantite "qcodes.config" when "Qcodes is imported in a python notebook which is build by sphinx"? this is very unexpected, qcodes' own docs have many executable notebooks that we build docs from and they all import qcodes, and that happens in CI (so, not in a "tool"), and some of the notebooks access qcodes.config and all works. I wonder what the difference is in our CI and docs building as compared to your project where you import qcodes...
It seems that this issue is related to the usage of sphinx-autodoc-typehints in combination with set_type_checking_flag = True source. Somehow it seems that enabling static type checking messes up populating the global qcodes.config parameter. I cannot explain why this would happen.
The error originates from building the following docs page, which shows the basic usage of Qcodes.
That seems likely. I think its a good fix to not start the logging when running within sphinx but I do suspect that you are likely to run into a similar issue if your notebook are trying to execute qcodes functions as there are plenty of other places in qcodes that rely on the configuration singleton being instantiated
@ovaar it would be great it you want to add a line or two about Quantify to https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/docs/community/related_projects.rst
