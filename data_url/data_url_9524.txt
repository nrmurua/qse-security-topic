We have been disregarding and accumulating warnings raised during the unit tests, mainly because they are not critical but also because they are raised by Pulser itself and are to be expected.
However, we are reaching a point where we need to clean them up, particularly because among all these warnings, there are some that we actually care about (e.g. deprecation warnings) and that become hard to detect.
