The 7th qubit (Q7) of the Melbourne device returns on some days wrong values for the T1 and T2 times as 865535.9, 706334.6, -1644438.2
Here are the last update dates where the Q7 data is wrong
For T1:
2018-12-07T13:46:45.000Z
2018-11-28T09:03:24.000Z
For T2:
2018-12-05T08:56:49.000Z
2018-11-28T09:03:24.000Z
2018-11-27T08:48:53.000Z
The usual value should at least not be negative, but values like 865535.9 are unrealistic high
The bug could be very likely outside of the scope of the qiskit library, but I hope this bug information can be redirected to the people who can fix this. I am not sure if the problem also appears in the readout errors, because the readout errors of Q7 and Q13 vary significant more than of other qubits.
This is outside the scope of qiskit so letâ€™s clossed.  I know the experimental team is working on this and it if continues please make an issue in the provider repo.
