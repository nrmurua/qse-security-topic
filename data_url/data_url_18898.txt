I'm not sure if anyone else is seeing this, but when I try to parse something like (this is taken from the vqe.qasm example)
I get the following tree
which is the incorrect ordering - note the final == operator is at a higher level in the tree. When I wrap the LHS and RHS expressions in parenthesis I get the expected behavior
Does anyone have any thoughts as to why this might be happening. I was able to produce this bug with both a Python and C++ Antlr parse tree + visitors.
Thanks for your help in advance!
@amccaskey, thanks for finding this. The grammar was not taking account of order of operations. I believe it should now be fixed here: #157
Great, thanks @zachschoenfeld33 for the quick turnaround. I'll pull it down and try it out.
Fix was merged, closing the issue
