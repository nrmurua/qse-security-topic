Instead, it prints out
Is there a reason this simple optimization was not implemented?
This is meant to direct users to QSimSimulator.simulate(). That method simulates once and returns the full state vector, allowing the user to sample as needed.
The goal of this was to force users to be intentional about which execution method they want to use, but if there's no purpose for one-by-one sampling when all measurements are terminal, we could redirect that path to a simulate-and-sample method. What do you think?
I think we should perform the optimization automatically. In practice, without the optimization, the run method is essentially useless for many purposes.
The redirect should now work at HEAD - I'll cut a fresh qsimcirq release shortly.
