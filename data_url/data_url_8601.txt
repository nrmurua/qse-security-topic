What exactly is the problem?
the structure of the states returned are different. A subtle difference is mcsolve returns a representation of state wrapped with one more square bracket.
I see the issue.  The mcsolver has the correct output format.   It is done that way so that if you change ntraj, the return values from the states does not change shape.  If ntraj > 1 then the results are the same when grabbing states from a given trajectory.  In the ntraj=1 case they are different.  It is a straightforward fix.
Thank you for pointing this out.  As it turns out, the mcsolve_f90 function will be a separate installation starting from QuTiP 3.2, so it is best to use the normal mcsolve function.
This has been fixed in #335.
