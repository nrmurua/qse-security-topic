Provide tools to easily insert pulses that:
This cannot be implemented by pulse templates as they are now because pulse templates are not context aware i.e. they behave the same independent of their surroundings. I would like to keep it that way.
I think there are two options to implement this. Both include Builder objects that are used like pulse templates during the construction of a pulse. Option 1 is that the builder objects remain in the composing pulse template and behave like pulse templates. This requires that they get their context provided for all actions. Option 2 is to add a dedicated final build step, that replaces all Builder objects with pulse templates.
Option 1 is easier to use because it omits the build step but option 2 is easier to implement and less error prone. I prefer option 2.
