Setup plotting common_hist1_* as histogram and default_bright_mean_* as xy plot.
Start and stop both the master and gui several times.
Observed behavior
std_include.py
default_std.py
How I start the ARTIQ stuff.
Run with "simulate ions" checked. The @kernel code crud and not needed to exhibit the problems with the GUI.
What do you mean by "real-time update of datasets breaks upon stop and restart"?
The rest looks like a pyqtgraph dock bug (which doesn't happen frequently here). Can you comment out this line (which will disable dock layout save/restore) and see if the problem still happens:

OK. I figured this problem out and the GUI is beautifully stable! The root of the problem lies with initializing new dataset entries. I propose making default a required argument for get_dataset(key, default).

That way there's always a well-defined result from get_dataset().
I don't understand. The GUI does not use get_dataset. If get_dataset raised an exception in your experiment due to the dataset not being present, this should not crash the GUI.
Is that different from #104?
I will look at this again over the weekend.
