We've had Majorana operators in OpenFermion for awhile now.  It would be great to have transformation functions from a FermionOperator to MajoranaOperator.
I would imagine there could be a simple substitution function that maps FermionOperators to their Majorana representation.  Maybe a more efficient implementation for tensor representation of FermionOperators would be doing the basis rotation associated with going to the Majorana representation.  See (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05395) for details.
@ncrubin can you please assign it to me.
@ncrubin can you please assign this to me also?
@GopiKishan14 To avoid duplication of effort we should have one person working on this at a time, unless you collaborate.
I've been working with MajoranaOperator, using custom functions based on substitution for now. What's the status of this?
@kevinsung can you please assign it to someone else. Apologies for such notice request.
I'm happy to take it
@ncrubin, @kevinsung can you assign it to me?
Implemented by #589
