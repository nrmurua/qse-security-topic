The output from the Matplotlib circuit drawer changes when the style kwarg is modified
circuit_drawer(circ) vs circuit_drawer(circ,style=qx_color_scheme()): (Here I show only the first pane of the circuit)


I would assume that the style does not change the circuit layout in the figure.
Hi. @nkanazawa1989 and I will check the code.
This is not a bug, but we applied a different style sheet setting from the default one.
will give the same visualization result. We changed 'compress' option True in qx_color_scheme() to fit in with the default style. Thank you!
The options available in the style sheet. You can check options in the tutorial.
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/reference/tools/matplotlib_circuit_drawer.ipynb
latexdrawerstyle (T*/F): change the appearance of cu1
usepiformat (T/F*): show the rotation parameters in the unit of pi
cregbundle (T/F*): group classical registers in one line
plotbarrier (T/F*): plot barrier
showindex (T/F*): show gate index on top
compress (T*/F): eliminate redundant spaces
reversebits (T/F*): reverse qubit order (numbering from bottom to top) - new option
margin [l, r, b, t]: margin around quantum circuit - new option
You can keep your favorite settings as a python dictionary (or json).
