All other time-based units have been converted to seconds/Hz. rep_times should also be converted. This may not be so straightforward because it is currently defined as an integer.
Hi! I have some downtime the next couple of weeks and would like to try working on this, but I'm quite the newbie - would you mind giving a bit of guidance on where to start? :)
I also suppose this also would relate to #3599 , or am I mistaken?
That would be great @eembees, this contribution would be a huge help! Currently, the rep_times is reported in the schema as an integer, this should likely be a float, see here.  It is also used in several places and we should make sure these are updated to be consistent
It would also great if a one-time warning could be raised when calling this by making it a property. This way we can properly warn users of the change. See here for an example.
and yes it is related to #3599.
