Will you have examples w.r.t. deep or machine learning with strawberry fields?  Thanks!
Hi there, thanks for your interest in Strawberry Fields.
There are several ML examples already available in both this repository and its sister repos.
For example:
https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial_machine_learning.html
https://qmlt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/numerical.html
https://qmlt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tensorflow.html
https://github.com/XanaduAI/quantum-learning
We also have several research papers for some of these topics, which are freely available:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06871
https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10781
We will also be releasing another repo with more example ML code sometime relatively soon. Stay tuned!
