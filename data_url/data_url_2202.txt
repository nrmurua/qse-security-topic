I ran the function
in cirq.experiments.google_v2_supremacy_circuit with n_rows = 1 and got trapped in infinite loops.
I think this is because when we have n_rows = 1,  _make_cz_layer would never return any cz gate, since there's only one qubit, thus in  _add_cz_layer, the loop
would never end.
My suggestion would be change assert 1 <= n_rows <= 11 in generate_boixo_2018_supremacy_circuits_v2_bristlecone to assert 2 <= n_rows <= 11, since it does not make anysense to have one-qubit cz layer in the first place.
