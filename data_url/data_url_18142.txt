After #435, there are a number of tests that result in DeprecationWarnings during _validate():
Can we update the tests accordingly so they do not produce such warnings?
Additionally, while looking at the _validate() methods:
This will be address by @ajavadia #422
@diego-plan9  I submitted patch #458 for the first issue.
The second one is resolved in #422, which i think we can merge soon after the release.
The third issue: no, that's why we distinguished the qasm simulator from statevector simulator. With qasm, the assumption is you are getting some measurement result. So with one shot, you only get a random number, which isn't useful at all. You would want to do many shots to get output histograms. With statevector simulator, you do get the full probability distribution so one shot is enough.
Both qasm_simulator_py and qasm_simulator_projectq calculate a classical state if the number of shots is 1.
What is the plan for the classical state, now that we distinguish between qasm and statevector simulators?
Possibly what makes sense is that the qasm simulators will provide the option of saving the classical state for each snapshot. Then the statevector simulators will provide not only the state vector in the final snapshot but also the classical state.
What do you think?
