Originally I had thought that we could get away with multiple simulation backends using MPI in a self-contained way via checks on MPI_Initialized(). This is not going to be possible due to the fact that MPI_Finalize will also need to be invoked, and while there is a MPI_Finalized() check, we don't want one backend finalizing while the other is still cleaning up.
I believe this to be done. @amccaskey Was there anything more to this than what the Open MPI PR covered?
Nope.
