Hello, I accidentally found the TensorNetwork.contract_compressed method and I tried to use it. However, I get this weird error message regarding Numba
I tried to fix the number of threads using numba.set_num_threads(8) unsuccessfully. I don't know if this is more a numba issue or a quimb issue.
Also, should I consider this method production-ready? I am asking since it is not documented.
Hi @maxtremblay.
Firstly, no - this is very much not production or supported in any way yet! its some experimental infrastructure but several other things are needed to use it accurately and it will undergo lots of changes / improvements.
Regarding the bug however, this seems unrelated to contract_compressed. I suppose NUMBA_NUM_THREADS is being set somewhere else but not via an environment variable, meaning quimb needs some way of finding that out before exporting the env var itself. Do you know which/if any other packages you are importing also interact with numba?
