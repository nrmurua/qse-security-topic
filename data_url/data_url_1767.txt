Sometimes things are indented with two spaces and sometimes with four. Python and Cirq use four. When you open this notebook in jupyter, the syntax highlighting looks very bad for the 2-indent cells
And sometimes with three. The block defining authenticate_user uses all tree indents.
Does it happen in more notebooks, or only in this one?
EDIT: It happens more often than I first thought...
Keeping open until we have a tool
We now have check/nbformat so this issue should now be resolved.  Closing.
