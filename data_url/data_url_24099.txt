By default, Qiskit Metal generates a ground plane from the edge of the die to the edge of a "substract" geometry. There are situations in which a user might want to completely remove the ground plane as shown below:

Right now, Gmsh Renderer generates a label for a ground plane in each layer irrespective of wether a ground plane exists or not. This causes issues later on when trying to simulate the structure in ElmerFEA.
The code below generates a geometry without a ground plane and prints the physical groups generated by Gmsh Renderer showing the item ground_plane_(layer 1), which should not have been generated:
No label should be assigned to ground planes that do not exist.
