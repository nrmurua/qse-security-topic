Hi, according to pyzx/circuit/gates.py, your decomposition and tensor of crz(pi/2) is shown below:

However, the correct form of crz(pi/2) should be like this:

Refer to this transformation:

May I submit a PR to modify this bug?
So a problem here is that different libraries and people use different standards for this gate. I believe I based the current definition on the qasm spec, but I can check
Yeah, I was right: the official QASM2.0 spec says that the current definition we have is the correct one. See page 12 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03429.pdf.
What was your intended usecase for the other definition? Your definition is the one that the QASM spec calls cu1 btw.
By the way, I do agree that your definition is more sensible, and it is also how I think of a crz gate. But that is not how it is defined in the spec.
Maybe it's the version of OpenQASM that causes the misunderstanding! According to OpenQASM3.0, the CRZ gate is more likely to be represented as the CU1 gate you've mentioned!
Yes QASM3.0 seems to use your definition. Which is annoying because now the specs aren't compatible apparently?
I don't really know how to deal with this now.
The definitions in the OpenQASM 3 header file are:
If I understand this correctly, crz is actually defined the same between OpenQASM versions 2 and 3 (and also the CRZ gate in pyzx). What actually differs between OpenQASM versions 2 and 3 is the definition of the rz gate. OpenQASM 2 uses what's maybe the more intuitive definition (diag(1, exp(i*phi))), whereas OpenQASM 3's definition quoted above makes it more consistent with crz. But since the CRZ gate is defined in the same way between pyzx and both versions of OpenQASM, I believe this issue can be closed.
PR #156 specifically adds a test to document the behaviour of rz and crz. I think this issue can be closed.
