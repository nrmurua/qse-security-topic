I am doing some research using QAOA and I got the following error:
I'm using pyQuil version commit sha: 26ae363e9f5c85dc3aab298daebc9ec5023a32a1 and grove e3fd7b9f3188e820dd19ff487dbf56c8faf43822.
I ran the same code for 9 and 16 qubits and it worked perfectly on 9 and I got the error for 16.
Looking at the size of the jsons which I send it seems that the payload is simply too big for the API to digest (98kB). That's, however, not clear from the error message, nor I was able to find any such information in the documentation.
If that's the case it's probably related to this issue #370, since the error message is not giving much information.
But it can as well be something else.

@mstechly Michal, can you please provide some more information so that we try to replicate this error? What exactly is it that you are trying to do?
The easiest way would be the following:
I also added examples of jsons I'm trying to push to Forest API, generated by the code above.

Thanks @mstechly - we really value your contributions to our community. Curious if the issue persists with the new SDK?
@ryankarle well, running it on local qvm doesn't involve sending huge json to cloud, so no :)
