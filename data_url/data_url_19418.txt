Describe the bug
Controlled gates that are created using the controlled_by method do not work with density matrices of 5 or more qubits if the defaulteinsum or matmuleinsum Tensorflow backends are used.
To Reproduce
leads to the following Tensorflow error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.UnimplementedError: Unhandled input dimensions 10 [Op:StridedSlice] name: strided_slice/
The issue appears only for 5 or more qubits and only with the native tensorflow backends only. The numpy backends and the custom backend work without problem.
@stavros11 thanks for reporting this. Do you think is something we can fix or tf related? If is the latter, we can probably proceed with the release, otherwise we fix.
