I have found a decorator of this form very useful for constructing pulse experiments from functions.
I suggest macro to represent a python function with an activated builder context that will be called and evaluated during program construction. I propose that we reserve function for support of pulse functions which will be analyzed and compiled as a function in the pulse IR with a signature, to then be loaded and evaluated in the hardware.
We should add this to the standard pulse builder library, document, rename what needs to be to be clearer and test.
how can i contribute to this?
Hello @Aniket049, to get started you could add the macro decorator to pulse.builder.py and add some documentation/tests. We could iterate from there. Would you like to me to assign this to you?
Hi @Aniket049, have you made any progress here?
Hi @Aniket049, any update here? ðŸ˜„
Hello @Aniket049, I've reassigned to myself as I needed this functionality. I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience.
