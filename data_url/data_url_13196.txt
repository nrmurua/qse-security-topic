A basic, minimal implementation of the calibration RFC.
A first-order implementation will be to accept simple ZNE parameters (e.g. scale factors), run the required circuits, and return the parameters which performed best.
Later iterations will improve the intelligence of the parameter selection process, but this ticket will track getting the piping lined up.
Previous calibration tickets: #1578, #1540
Great to see this listed. Even a skeleton PR would be good to look at before we discuss on Wednesday to make best use of the group meeting time.
@natestemen can we close this issue as scoped for milestone 0.21.0?
Sounds good. I'll plan to create some new issues for the calibration work by Friday so we can scope 0.22.
