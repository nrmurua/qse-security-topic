We need to support following workflow for saving and loading calibration instance in Qiskit Experiments.
This needs to add support for the Reference instruction to the qpy module. This instruction takes tuple of string (type key: b"s") as operands, which conflict with another operand of SymbolicPulse (type key: b"s").
This makes me think we need to support namespaced type key, e.g. vs for Value.String and ss for ScheduleInstruction.SymbolicPulse, for example. Seems like this requires module level refactoring since we need to support multi-character (at least 2c) key for every binary format.
