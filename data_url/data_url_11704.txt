I run the variance form and get the circuit like this:

I find the evolution parts are not expanded. I looked into the src code and find the following code building the circuit. I wonder how to visualize the this part of the circuit.

When you get the circuit from the var form, you can use decompose() on the return circuit, i.e. print(qc.decompose()) to see have these blocks broken down (decomposed)
@woodsp-ibm Thanks, exactly what I need!
