The AWSExecutor is a type of remote executor, so it inherits from RemoteExecutor.  This class contains authentication handling.
In the end, we want to put this class, as well as all AWS plugins, inside a repository called covalent-aws-plugins (i.e. the AWS plugin monorepo).  Each plugin should remain individually installable as well.
