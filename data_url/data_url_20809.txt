We improved the DFR analysis of our protocol: as a consequence, we managed to decrease the size of the public key by 3%
We introduced an alternative and more efficient encoding and decoding algorithm based on concatenating Reed-Muller and Reed-Solomon codes. This new decoding variant does not change the protocol nor its security and enables us to decrease the size of the public key (less 17% for 128
bits security). We provide a new set of parameters denoted by HQC-RMRS for this decoding variation.
Our implementations are now implemented in a constant-time way whenever relevant and they should not   leak any sensitive information with respect to timing attacks.
Our implementations no longer rely on third party librairies for finite field arithmetic
