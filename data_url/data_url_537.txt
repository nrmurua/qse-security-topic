We should integrate Quimb as a new Accelerator https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tensor-circuit.html
This can be done using pybind11 and its embedded interpreter.
Is there a documentation for doing something like this? i want to integrate https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes as an accelerator to execute pulses on our hardware. their API is in python
Yea I wrote this awhile back https://aide-qc.github.io/deploy/developers/implement_accelerator/
Is it possible to write this entirely in python? similar to https://github.com/eclipse/xacc/blob/master/python/plugins/cirq/cirq_accelerator.py
