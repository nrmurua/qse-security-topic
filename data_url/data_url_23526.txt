After this issue
#2815
is solved...
Sorry that I am still asking questions here...
Now I have a problem on which file is referred when qcodes are imported
On the "working" computer,
import qcodes.instrument_drivers.QDevil.QDevil_QDAC
qcodes.instrument_drivers.QDevil.QDevil_QDAC.__file__ 
gives
'c:\users\(Username2)\desktop\python\qcodes_cloned\qcodes\qcodes\instrument_drivers\QDevil\QDevil_QDAC.py'
On the "previously not working" computer, the same commands give
'C:\Users\(Username)\anaconda3\envs\qcodes\lib\site-packages\qcodes\instrument_drivers\QDevil\QDevil_QDAC.py'
Which one is correct?
Which one is installed wrongly now??
Hi @erikawa-e
This depends on how you install the package.
If you do:
pip install qcodes or pip install . from the cloned qcodes source pip will copy qcodes into site-packages
If you do pip install -e . pip will make a link to the cloned source code within the site-packages dir. You should see a file called qcodes.egg-link or something like that containing the path to your cloned source dir.
This is known as an editable install and is really handy when you are developing the code as you don't need to reinstall every time you make a change
Oh I see..
Thank you. I am learning a lot :)
I guess I should reuninstall and reinstall qcodes again if I want to have a link to the cloned source code..
Is that correct?
Yes.
Where the last command needs to be executed from the cloned qcodes repo
I see. Thank you so much!!
