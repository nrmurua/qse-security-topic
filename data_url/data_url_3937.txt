Hello,
I tried to compile OpenQL on a linux machine. I cloned the repository, checked out mapper (tried with develop too), ran cmake .. (which went without problems), but when running make I got:

Running ll on deps/lemon/lemon, I indeed have:

@jvansomeren can you please look why this installation is failing?
Hi Diogo,
I cannot reproduce this in the develop branch.
I did a fresh pull, mkdir cbuild, cd cbuild, cmake .., make
See the logs of this.
I also don't see the comments of the compiler on the register keyword use in random.cc,

Best, Hans

I freshly reinstalled C, C++ and make (from anaconda) and still have the same problem.
There was only one difference I could see: in Hans cmake, ghostscript was detected, while in mine it was not, but I installed it and the problem persists...
My cmake is now identical, while in my make the error appears right in the beginning.
This is the output of cmake ..:



And this is the output of make:


mapper is now merged to develop. since it can be built by Travis CI and wheels are also availabe, this problem should be resolved, right @Astlaan ?
