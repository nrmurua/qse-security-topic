Building qutip 4.7.3 for Debian unstable, all tests are passing with python 3.11. But a dozen tests using qobjevo fail with python 3.12:
#1084 notes that a major overhaul of qobjevo has been done for qutip v5.  Perhaps the issue is fixed. On the hand it could be an issue with python 3.12 that still needs to be addressed in v5, so I though I should mention in.
Tests should pass with python3.12.
cython3-legacy 0.29.36-3
@Ericgig It would be good if this was fixed in 4.7.4.
@drew-parsons Could you try with the qutip-4.7.X branch which has some fixes?
We don't currently test or build for 3.12 on the qutip-4.7.X branch. Probably we should since 5 isn't fully released yet.
Cython 0.29 is not compatible with python 3.12.
On debian, they have the module python3-zombie-imp which is a copy of the removed imp module, but it does not seems available on pip or conda. Thus cython jit (pyximport) is not working on 3.12 for almost everyone.
Adding cython3 to 4.7.X is not a quick fix and we already choose not to do it.
The best we can do is to run as if cython was not installed at runtime on 3.12 and release 5.0.0 soon.
If the issue is Cython support for 3.12, let's just leave it for now as you suggest.
In any case, these tests still fail with HEAD on the qutip-4.7.X branch (7a883d3)
I disabled cython support on python 3.12 with this patch:
