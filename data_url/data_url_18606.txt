We currently have the following standard gate definition in stdgates.quil:
This is the same as XY_{-\theta}, where the family XY is defined in https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10541, the only difference being the direction of parameterization:
It would make sense to include this definition of XY in stdgates.quil, possibly replacing PISWAP. We should also make sure that the parameterization is the standard one.
The discrepancy in parametrization ultimately stems from a typo in an internal note from 2017 + me not knowing what the standard choices of Pauli matrices is, & the discrepancy in notation stems from me not knowing that everyone else calls this thing "XY". I'm in strong favor of eliminating PISWAP and replacing it with XY.
I don't think we should spend much time hand-wringing about the change: this functionality has been around for a while, but there's been little user adoption.
We've apparently decided to embrace the typo. The weird sign (and, with it, the definition of PISWAP) is here to stay.
Re-opening just to ask some more questions and maybe make Action Items (TM).
