The current grammar for the rangeExpression rule is:

This rule is only used in 2 rules:
The first rule, forStatement, requires both the first and last expression of the rangeExpression rule to be matched as explicitly written in the documentation:

The second rule, indexOperator, is used in indexedIdentifier and the expression hierarchy. The only place I could find in the official documentation that mention this use of range is:

and it also requires that both the first and last expressions are present.
This means that, if we follow the official documentation, the following OpenQASM 3.0 statements should be invalid
but all of them are accepted by the grammar for the moment.
I understand that this grammar rule mimics Python's indexing (or is inspired from it, the central position of the step argument being different from Python), and the parser code

If the grammar and the parser are right and indexing should work like in Python then:
If the documentation is right, then directly modifying the grammar rule to
or another equivalent rule and updating the AST typing would be the easiest path.
