Hi,
When I was building the bitstream, there is an issue:
P.S, Maybe that's because I didn't installed Vivado properly?
Please look at it, thank you!
Pipistrello is a Spartan 6. That needs ISE and doesn't work with Vivado. See the ARTIQ manual.
The error message should clearly state this.
The manual already states it in great detail.
The rest is a migen issue. Feel free to reopen there.
