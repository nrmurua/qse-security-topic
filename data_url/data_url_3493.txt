i.e. what if you don't pass memory_map. Should this default to zero? Error? Is the behavior consistent between qpu and qvm?

I think classical memory in Quil is still supposed to be initialized to zero. For the QPU, in _build_patch_values, the values are initialized to 0 (@karalekas) and I'd bet the QVM does the same (@ecp-rigetti)
Yeah: the Quil specification is that classical memory is initialized to zero, and the QVM conforms to that. The QPU hardware doesn't guarantee this on its own, but the software that sets up the QPU does. I'd advocate for defaulting to zero without a warning.
Can we document this somewhere?
