The Picnic datasheets on master refer to parameter sets named like Picnic_1_316_FS, whereas the code refers to parameter sets named like picnic_L1_FS, so they are causing .travis/algorithm-datasheets-check.sh to fail.
I've temporarily disabled signature checks in .travis/algorithm-datasheets-check.sh, so as part of this issue, please re-enable that.
Fixed in PR #405.
