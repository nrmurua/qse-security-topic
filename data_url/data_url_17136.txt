Terra should do from math import pi at init since it is used everywhere.
I suggest from qiskit.constants import pi, so we can easily change if we prefer numpy.py or others...
Based on the PR I understand better what do you mean. The point is to save the from math import pi line by from qiskit import *? Is this something we want?
We use pi everywhere, so why not save the repetitive step of importing pi all the time?  To posit it another way, what is the harm in doing so?
Because "explicit is better than implicit". I just would like to hear what others think.

Do we have a jupyter widget (or maybe in iqx) to provide a default set of imports? Maybe this can be added there?

Sure, it can be added there
Based on this. Renaming this issue.
No, will just do this in IQX.
