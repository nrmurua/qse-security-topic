After running the tests on a clean clone, the following import error occurs, failing the tests:
All tests should pass
Just adding on - I'm able to repro this as well. But only if I run make test.
tox works fine for me - no errors.
@menehune23 did you do pip install -U tox ... that's needed to make test
Anyway, @menehune23 I'm getting same failure. I guess @mtreinish has put his finger on the spot.
This works for me with the major component directories all under one DEV directory:
Should I submit this as a pull request or does it need a more sophisticated setup?
Oops, I see there's already a PR. "Never Mind" :)
