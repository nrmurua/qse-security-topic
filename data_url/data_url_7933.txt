Looks like sesolve with list func time-dependence and rhs_with_state option will fail.
psi_list_td and psi_list_td_with_state are exactly the same. However, looking at def of constant_func, in the latter, H_td, should take a third parameter, assumedly psi
Maybe no-one ever tried this.
Found this by accident when doing something else. Just raised here as a reminder to investigate more some other time. Probably an easy fix.
Maybe this is addressed now in 4.4?
