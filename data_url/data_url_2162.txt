Contrib is explicitly for things that are unstable and changing. We should not be referencing things from inside the more stable parts of the library. Particularly serialization, which must remain compatible indefinitely.
I caught this is because it triggered an actual test failure when I was attempting to verify the next release.
Something to do with dataclasses and 3.7 vs 3.6.
