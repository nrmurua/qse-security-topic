The function sf.apps.similarity.orbit_cardinality does not work, when the second argument (i.e. 'modes') is larger than 170. The issue happens because of the function scipy.special.factorial, which, in the way it is used, calculates factorials only up to (including) 170.
Example:
Expected behavior: Output 29070
Actual behavior:
The reason behind the issue is, that the function scipy.special.factorial with default second argument (i.e. exact=False), calculates the factorials in float variables. The factorials of numbers larger than 170 do not fit into a float, hence the function returns inf. On the other hand, python can handle large integers, so if we force the factorial funcion to use integers like this
then the issue goes away. Here is the description of the argument 'exact', from scipy documentation:
exact: bool, optional
If True, calculate the answer exactly using long integer arithmetic. If False, result is approximated in floating point rapidly using the gamma function. Default is False.
Thanks @hay-k for the detailed report and the suggested fix. We'll work on this!
After a chat with @trbromley, relabeling this as the main issue is more of an inefficiency rather than a bug.
