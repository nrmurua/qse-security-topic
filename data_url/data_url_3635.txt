I don't think people actually use this, it's undocumented, and it provides no additional functionality as far as I can tell beyond what you can do with simple functions.
This has been slated for deprecation for a while now. I am reminded that @QuantumVerd said something about using it at the meetup. Have you been using it?
We used to have .exponentiate return a parameterized program, but this has been changed for a while now so I think it is good to remove.
We made some use of it, but ultimately agreed between the two of us we didn’t really need to have it and subsequently stopped using them. I also agree it’d be worth seeing how things go if they were dropped from the library
removed in #619
