Type: Enhancement
Priority: Low
When launching QRL (start_qrl), if another application/service is already using port 8080, QRL fails to launch.
Instead of failing, can QRL [automatically] use another port instead?
Port 8080 will not be used anymore one we complete the migration to grpc. Nevertheless, we may need to evaluate if it is possible to move grpc 9009 dynamically to other ports.
hey @jleni
what's port 8080 for?
I can telnet to it and it gets connected (of course, being a TCP port on listen), but any character I type in gets the session ended and triggers this in the log
Here is the summary:
2000- telnet - Will be removed soon
8080 - REST API - Will be removed soon (this was used by the old webwallet and the old block explorer)
9009 - grpc API - That is the new API. It will be the only open port one the migration is finished
webwallet is already using grpc
blockexplorer will move to grpc soon and we will remove 8080
cli will soon move to grpc and we will remove telnet (2000)
Port 3000 is the connection between the webwallet frontend and backend. It is not related to the node in anyway. That is basically the standard port for meteor. You will typically do not need to open that port.
If in the next few days you still want to play with 8080, it is the obsolete REST API. You can check it with curl or any other tool that works for REST.
I'll wait for a nice CLI :)
This is not applicable anymore. The node is not using port 8080 anymore.
