One of the uses of LinearDict is the representation of Pauli expansions. Currently, _pauli_expansion_() returns NotImplemented for parametrized gates. @dabacon pointed out on #1614 that we can do better if we add support for symbolic coefficients to LinearDict.
Can assign to @trevormccrt if he accepts invitation to be collaborator.
