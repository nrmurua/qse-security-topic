I can't quite figure out if this is simply due to the DeprecationWarnings or something else but all tests are failing due to atol not being set for the gmres solver. I will try to set atol and check if the tests pass.
Error log: https://api.travis-ci.org/v3/job/379109482/log.txt.
Attempted fix in #870
On investigation and reflection I would say that the issue here is that gmres in scipy 1.1 returns an array of NaN when it fails to converge. It should return the (outside tol) solution, as it had done previously.
I will raise this with scipy
Somehow I cannot recreate the NaN issue today. I have no idea why. I am just gonna drop it and move on
