Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
As discussed in https://tinyurl.com/cirq-visualizations#heading=h.7ouifl2o8dff, it would be nice to have cirq primitives for density matrix visualization
Describe the solution you'd like
Method to plot density matrix, whose output should look similar to the density matrix plots generated in Quirk.  Note that plotting changing density matrix based on parameter sweeps is out of scope here.

What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters
@AnimeshSinha1309  is working on this. Please assign it to yourself (I'm unable to assign it to you).
This is part of the roadmap item #3642
I am unable to assign it to myself too. Anyways, will work on it starting 10th of this month.

Does this look okay?
