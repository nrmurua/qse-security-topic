I just tried to run the test suite and pytest kept getting stuck on test_qvm.py and test__wavefunction_simulator.py. After digging a bit deeper it seems like the asynchronous calls are getting stuck on the server side. Here's a minimal example that reproduces the problem:
Instead of returning the results it gets stuck in the queue and prints something like:
and the time until execution never changes.
Hi @markf94, sorry for the late response. You likely already know this by now, but asynchronous run methods are no longer necessary with a local QVM endpoint. Thanks for surfacing the issue!
