This led to a bunch of warnings when we tried to install an updated version of cirq because we have numpy pinned to a somewhat older version (1.11) that is hard to update for various reasons (because python). It would be nice if we could relax cirq's requirements to the oldest version that actually works with cirq (pytest passes with numpy 1.11.3, for example). Clearly this complicates the testing story, because it's impractical to test all combinations of dependency versions, but it will make the library installable and usable by more people who have other version constraints on common libraries like numpy.
I did a bisect looking for the lowest version of numpy we can use.
... it's 1.14. Well, sort of. We need numpy 1.14 in order for the snippet tests to pass; the other tests pass as early as 1.10. The problem is that before 1.14 numpy fails to print 3 digits of precision when a number is rounded to 3 digits of precision.
Consequently, I'm going to tentatively close this.
