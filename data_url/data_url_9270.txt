Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Most websites (including documentation pages) have a favicon that helps make it easier to distinguish the website is open in a certain tab (especially helpful if there are many tabs crowding each other out) and is the icon that pops up when a user bookmarks a page.
Currently Bloqade doesn't have one but from a UI perspective it would be a nice (and hopefully) easy addition to existing docs.
Describe the solution you'd like
It should be possible to create, potentially using the center "Q" in the current Bloqade logo, a smaller version, both light and dark favicons and haveDocumenter.jl serve them upon loading the docs.
