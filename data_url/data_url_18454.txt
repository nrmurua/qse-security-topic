The following error occurred for me while running the quilc test suite several weeks ago, but I have not been able to reproduce since.  It recently came up in a slack discussion thread @ecpeterson also ran into this error while attempting to run the make test-tweedledum target.
Reproduction steps are unknown.
Here is the failure from ecpeterson's run, copy/pasted from slack:
I managed to tickle this bug again, this time while running make test-tweedledum.
Seems to consistently happen in TEST-COMPILER-HOOK, but this time when testing commuting-blocks.quil (last time in parametric-gates.quil).
Immediately re-ran the test to see if it would reproduce, but no luck. On the second run, the tests completed successfully.
Accept the mystery.
Maybe we need the equivalent of pytest-rerunfailures, but for fiasco. Then I wouldn't even have to think about it :-D
That backtrace ought to be enough to reproduce the bug. Let's see!
I should have mentioned that that last backtrace came from a local branch with my gate-modifiers reversal changes applied.  I assumed it was unrelated because the error is so similar to the others above, but you never know.
It isn't enough. For whoever it happens to next: save the contents of the arguments to CL-QUIL::COMPRESS-INSTRUCTIONS-WITH-POSSIBLY-UNKNOWN-PARAMS, frame 8 in the above.
I observed this today when running tests, but could not reproduce. It popped up in TEST-COMPILER-HOOK on the commuting-blocks examples under state prep compression.
