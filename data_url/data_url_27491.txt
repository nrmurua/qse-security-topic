For some reason, a T1 acquisition using the AcquisitionParameter only acquires about five points per trace. The duration is 0.5 ms, which at a sample rate of 500ksps would mean many more points... Changing the value to something else fixes the problem.
Issue was because the ATS segmentation did not start at the start of the first pulse that should be acquired. Fixed.
