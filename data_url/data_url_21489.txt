ARTIQ experiments are unable to use kernel after reflashing gateware.
Experiment should run all the way through and finish.


TTLs are also still accessible through the dashboard
Sometimes, flashing the gateware hangs halfway through, nearly always after sector 43. In this case, we get the following warning repeatedly for longer and longer times: "Warn : Haven't made progress in mpsse_flush() for 4109ms"
Probably a bad USB cable.
Probably a bad USB cable.
I tried replacing the cable, using a different USB port, unplugging other USB devices, all without any success.
It really looks like some USB problem, look at the errors in the UART output as well (missing characters). Try another computer and/or without the VM.
There are Linux live-CDs and live-USBs that you can use if you don't want to wipe your Windoze installation.
dual-booting ubuntu and reflashing the gateware from there fixed the issue.
thanks!
If your hardware and BIOS support it (it's hit or miss with consumer PCs), you can also try to redirect the USB controller to the VM at the PCIe level using the IOMMU. This works around most VM USB redirection related bugs in my experience.
