In sticking with the theme of making TFQ better for less powerful machines, it would make a lot of sense if we could have  tfq_simulate_samples not depend on tfq_simulate_state for memory reasons. Having to store all the states in memory in order to sample isn't a behavior we want ideally for users where memory is a severe limitation. If we wrote the sampling op ourselves we would go down from O(batch_size * state_size) to just O(state_size) which is much more favorable. This would roughly entail writing a new C++ op for sampling that looks somewhat similar to the
