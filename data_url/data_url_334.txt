For the vqe runs (both cpp and python), the program keeps going even after hitting ctrl^c. It keeps printing the optimal values and moving along. Usually, I have to cancel the process explicitly to get around this issue.
The runs I have done are 8 qubits and higher, not sure how it behaves for smaller #qubits (H2 is 4 qubits and simpler and that seems fine). I have been noticing this for a while, so it's not due to any recent changes.
#include "cudaq/algorithm.h"
#include "cudaq/domains/chemistry.h"
#include "cudaq/optimizers.h"
int main() {
}
The program should quit running after hitting ctrl^c
Not a regression
Here is a possible solution I found: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14707049/allowing-ctrl-c-to-interrupt-a-python-c-extension.
@amccaskey Did #495 fix this issue?
Implement global SIGINT handler to catch CTRL-C better and quit the program.
I quickly double checked and it looks like this is indeed fixed.
