Running this code with main from June 29th,
produces

and using current main produces

All other gates with params seem to properly display pi.
Should see pi/2.
Not sure what changed. The param in this case is a ParameterExpression which follows a different path in pi_check. For some reason, either a change in tolerances or a change in sympy perhaps, a trailing zero was being added to the sympy expression. This meant the param would not match the sympy expression and the pi string was not substituted.
Should be fixable by a str(float(sym)), but it might be good to know what changed in case there are hidden issues.
Follow up on the above. In the first case from 3 weeks ago,
param_str: 1.57079632679490
syms: {1.57079632679490}
Current main
param_str: 1.5707963267949
syms: {1.57079632679490}
So question is, why the reduced precision in param_str which comes from a ParameterExpression?
