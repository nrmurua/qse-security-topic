Description of the issue
Gateset.__contains__() should continue to check other GateFamilies instead of failing when the operation matches the instance type but isn't accepted by the current GateFamily being checked.
How to reproduce the issue
The order of GateFamilies matter here; flipping them will make it succeed.

Gateset.__contains__ does two checks:
The O(1) check assumes that the type and instance gate families do trivial isinstance(g, gate_type) or g == gate_instance checks. This was true before tags_to_accept and tags_to_ignore flags were added to the base GateFamily class.
Now, because of tags_to_accept / tags_to_ignore; the default type and instance gate families also have the additional complexity of dealing with tags; and hence should be considered equivalent to custom gate families (i.e. do an O(N) check instead of O(1) check).
I've sent a PR to fix this. PTAL.
