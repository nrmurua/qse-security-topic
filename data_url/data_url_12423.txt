Both first order derivative of tfq layers and higher order gradient of non tfq layers work with GradientTape as follows:
However the following doesn't work, with tensorflow error as
InvalidArgumentError: Operation 'cond' has no attr named '_XlaCompile'.  ValueError: Insufficient elements in branch_graphs[0].outputs. Expected: 6 Actual: 5
Is my code wrong or tfq layers have special issues in terms of higher order gradients due to the way AD is implemented in these layers?

Please see the section 3.4
It is not implemented in TFQ yet.
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
