Importing a dataset with import_dat_file fails for simple datasets.
A minimal example:
The code fails with error AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'isidentifier'
@WilliamHPNielsen @jenshnielsen @sohailc
The example notebook works as expected.
Without a few more details it's hard to figure out whats going on. Could you provide a full traceback so we can see where that error comes from. Can you check that the location1d actually points to a folder congaing dat files
@jenshnielsen The full traceback is:
The location1d is indeed a folder on disk. Does the minimal example work for you?
Yes for some reason that .dat file has much less metadata when loaded than the dataset the example uses. I am not yet sure why. The files look the same to me
This looks like to be due to a missing snapshot that contains metadata about the array relations
@jenshnielsen The import_dat_file does work when I add qcodes.DataSet.default_formatter=qcodes.data.hdf5_format.HDF5Format() on top of the script. So it is relate to the GNUPlotFormatter.
@jenshnielsen, indeed, the problem was the missing json snapshot. Came across the same error, pointing to a folder which had both the .dat and snapshot worked without adding the HDF5Format line above.
