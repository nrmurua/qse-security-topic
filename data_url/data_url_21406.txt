With the stack guard enabled, trying to clear L2 cache causes an Exception(LoadFault).
L2 cache is cleared, no panic.
With L2 cache flush inserted right after gateware ident:
Panics.
If pmp::init_stack_guard is commented out, the cache flush works fine.
Implementing boot::start_user as runtime does (and cache flushes on runtime fine) does not alleviate the issue either.
Just wondering if this is similar to #1775. (In the sense of firmware size vs address range touched by flushing L2)

I somehow missed your comment ðŸ˜… yeah that was exactly it
