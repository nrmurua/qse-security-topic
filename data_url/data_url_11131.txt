From discussing with Joseph Carlson, people want to study a Hubbard model where each site splits up into not only 2 spins, but more. For instance, 3 represents some quark model, 4 some nuclei maybe. We should implement these too. This would be very helpful for the nuclear physics community.
I suggest they implement this!
I'm happy to take a stab at this. Would it be better to generalize the existing single-band Hubbard class or create a new one?
I'm open to you doing it either way.
After rereading Kevin's initial comment, I think I may have misinterpreted what was wanted here. In #465, I implemented a Hubbard model with multiple degrees of freedom per site, but still assuming either no spin or spin 1/2. In any case, what I wrote can easily be extended to the case of larger-spin particles.
@kevinsung Could you provide some links to the types of Hamiltonians you had in mind?
I actually don't know anything about this, but I asked Joe, who said that he would provide us with some.
@bryano Joe provided me with these notes: multi.pdf
Thanks. #465 allows those types of Hamiltonians to be expressed, with two exceptions: it's just fermionic as is, and is limited to 1- and 2-body interactions. These are straightforward extensions.
Can we close this now?
We should wait until the extensions you mentioned are implemented.
