@Gabriel-in-Toronto can I ask why you closed this?  I confirmed that it's an issue on my machine.  If you've got a workaround, I'd encourage you to submit a PR.  This is a low priority issue for me, but it is a bug.
@boothby Sorry for the confusion. Yes, it is a bug and I have found a way to solve it. I am not sure if I will submit the PR later but here are the changes I made for your reference.
Excellent, thanks!
@boothby Hi, I try to submit a PR to close this issue, but it seems that it is failing on some test cases. Can you teach me how to run the test cases to help me further revise my code?
The easiest thing to do is to update the code in the PR (I've made some suggestions there) and push them to your repo.  The tests will re-run.
The c++ tests are a little involved to run (sorry, I'm just running out the door), but the python integration testing is easily run through python -m pytest . in the root directory of the repo.
