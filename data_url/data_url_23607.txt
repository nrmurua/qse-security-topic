The ":read:" command and possibly others does not work when output is off but fails with an error. This is called when getting volt and current are snapshotted
We should wrap these calls in checking that output is off
I ran into this. For now the easy workaround is to add keithley.output.set(1) before adding it to a station or reading any values. Otherwise you'll see error 803 and it'll be borked until you restart it.
