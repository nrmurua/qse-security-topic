Description of the issue
I saw this on two PRs today:
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/runs/3011265236
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/4004/checks?check_run_id=3011531826
It is probably related to actions/setup-node#268
@95-martin-orion Can this issue be closed now?

Unclear, though note that #4004 was not intended to fix it - it merely hit the same bug.
I was able to trace links back to here, which suggests that it's a super-generic npm error message for "something unexpected happened". Probably fine to leave alone unless we're seeing it frequently.
