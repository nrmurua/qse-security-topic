Currently task 1.3 (Validate inputs to QPE) is covered by two types of tests - Q# test TestAssertIsEigenstate_True that checks that the solution doesn't throw exceptions on inputs that are a valid unitary-eigenstate pair, and C# tests that check that the solution does throw exception on inputs that are not a valid unitary-eigenstate pair. The first part of the test can be invoked via %kata magic, as usual, but the C# part cannot (see #166).
We can enable this task in the Jupyter Notebook frontend for this kata as follows:
This is not the best user experience we can offer, but fixing #166 is not trivial, and a temporary solution is better than none.
