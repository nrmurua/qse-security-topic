It's working fine for me, can you update the description with the qiskit version, and some steps to reproduce the issue?
@haqenam786 have you imported plot_histogram from the qiskit library? You need to run this line of code from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram if you're doing it locally.
If you're executing on the qiskit textbook website directly, you need to run the cell that contains that line of code before you can use plot_histogram.
are you running on a jupyter notebook?
It seems related to #4397
duplicated #4397
