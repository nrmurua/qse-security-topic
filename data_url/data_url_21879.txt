When Sayma does successfully boot it often does not subsequently work with artiq_run. This is using Sayma_AMC (TS190717-6) sent to Duke from HK -- now temporarily being testing at UMD. This is using Ethernet components validated to work in HK: SATA cable, SATA-SFP adapter, SFP-Ethernet module. Using my Ethernet cable and switch. Builds I've tested include db4d187 and bcb9c3 and 8fd57e6. See attached for wireshark log.

Apply TRST rework (@gkasprow) and/or use another switch.
Switched to using Netgear GS608 v4. This is same switch used at M-Labs. @trxw points out that this switch is currently selling in two version v3 and v4. What version did M-Labs use?  Only two hosts attached to the switch. ARTIQ Master PC and Sayma. Still see packet loss.
OK. I'll apply the TRST rework as described here.
Only two hosts attached to the switch
Try without the switch then.
Anyway, with that level of packet loss it is expected that you get that error when running kernels.
I actually had packet losses like this when using certain media converters, which is why I shipped the SFP/RJ45 that resulted in no packet loss, but it seems there are other factors in the equation.
the ping time is very high. I'd expect below 10ms.
After you connect the switch, 2..3 first pings can be lost because it may take some time to discover the correct MAC address using ARP.
I applied TRST patch with a helping hand from @restelli. Very tricky! Helpful tools we used that were not available in my lab.
Now back to running Sayma on fs.com switch. Ping reports 0% packet loss.
Ping time is often < 1 ms. But on occasion I see that it jumps to > 10 ms. Any idea why @sbourdeauducq ?

No, I've only seen low ping times.
