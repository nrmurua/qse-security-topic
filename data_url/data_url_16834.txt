The qiskit scheduler mutates the input circuit, see here
The qiskit scheduler should not mutate the input circuit.
Either remove this mutation, or copy the circuit before operating on.
Hi!
Sorry, I'm just beginning to contribute to Qiskit. I was wondering -- can this fix be as simple as deleting the barrier method line? It seems unnecessary (not in the 'as_soon_as_possible' method). If so, I can take care of it :)
I believe it is necessary to align the ending of the circuit. It may be as simple as taking the input circuit and copying it and then appending the barrier. Maybe @lcapelluto could provide more information?
Cool. Well, if it's safer I'll just make a copy of the circuit and add a barrier to that.  Working on the update now but got a little worried about an error message when I was installing ibmq-providers from the source code ("spyder 3.3.6 requires pyqt5<5.13: python_version >=3 which is not installed.") However, I ran the install again and didn't get the error so I'll try to keep moving forward with it
Perhaps rather than a direct deepcopy, create a quantum circuit with a barrier and then combine it with the input quantum circuit. That way we can let the Qiskit implementation choose how to do the copying.
ok! I can do that
Hi! I submitted a change but I ended up using a copy instead of combining circuits. If combining would definitely be better, I can replace the code -- somehow the way I was combining must've screwed up the circuit because I had a lot of trouble passing the tests.
Thank you!!
