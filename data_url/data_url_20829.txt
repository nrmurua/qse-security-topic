The  test Makefile claims that it can be used with BSD make. However the rule for the common tests uses a percent pattern which is not supported by BSD make.
Thanks very much!
Perhaps we should also add a BSD container to the build process, if only for operating system coverage (don't think there's much value in running BSD-ppc etc).
It's not possible to run FreeBSD containers on Linux as far as I can see... ðŸ˜ž
