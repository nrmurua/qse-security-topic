Mitiq users can currently apply probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) only in the following cases:
In many practical situations the user doesn't know what are the noise channels associated to the hardware gateset.
Noise characterization tools are beyond the scope of Mitiq. However, it would be helpful to show an example in which an external noise characterization library (e.g. pyGSTi) is used to characterize gate noise channels in order to apply PEC.
Write a new documentation example (i.e. a myst notebook) in which:
This issue had no activity for 4 months, and will be closed in 2 weeks unless there is new activity. Cheers!
(we have ongoing plans about this)
