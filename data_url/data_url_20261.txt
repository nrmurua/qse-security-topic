Nightly build has been failing on ubuntu-xenial-x86_64-gcc5. I was able to reproduce with gcc-5. Although avx2 is supported on the machine, the non-avx2 qtesla KAT values are generated; the unit test expects the avx2 values and therefore the test fail.
I still need to investigate why the qtesla avx2 code is not used.
