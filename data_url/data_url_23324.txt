I want to change the physical coils of the magnet, and I would like to update the safety limits accordingly.
I use the code:
(unfortunately traceback is lost, but the exception originated from _set_ramp_rate method, it's the ValueError that that method may raise (see line 369 of AMI430.py).)
It seems that the reason for this exception is that field_ramp_limit was not updated when I set current_ramp_limit above. Hence, the driver thinks that my ramp rate is out of bounds even though it is not (because i set the current_ramp_limit before).
Then, i tried the following:
And this time there was no exception raised.
However, setting field_ramp_limit seems to overwrite my current_ramp_limit (because coil constant has not updated yet, i.e. it is not "0.01490" yet but some other previous value), so current_ramp_limit apparently gets set to a value which is out of my safety limits.
My proposed solution is a method of setting all safety limits and constants in a single function, and sending those to the instrument in a single call, preferebly in init.
Moreover, I would even propose to make the coil_constant, current_ramp_limit (and thereby field_ramp_limit) and current_limit to unchangable after init (so that when coils are changed, the user has to reinstantiate the magent driver).
Along the way found the following bug:
