The AD9910 DDS on Urukul has a digital ramp generator that is not exposed in the coredevice API.
Abstract/Expose it.
Similar level of abstraction/exposure as the RAM methods.
Details TBD.
I will start working on this feature in the upcoming days.
Are the DRG control pins exposed to artiq in any way? The Urukul schematics imply that they are at least connected in rev 1.5.
You will probably need to change the Urukul CPLD gateware. Making it backwards compatible would be key.
thx for the hint. Did not think about that üëç
