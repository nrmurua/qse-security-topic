Via @nathanshammah's report on the SciPost paper:
in the table that is printed when running krotov.optimize_pulses, words could define the quantities at the beginning of the columns. Like, over "J_T" have "final t. functional", in the next column "running cost", or similar, and so on.
Issue #64 can be addressed by adding the ability to customize the format of the table and the column headers with new optional col_formats and col_headers arguments to print_table. This would also address the desire for more human-readable column headers as well. However, the defaults would be set to exactly match the output of the example script as shown in the SciPost paper.
