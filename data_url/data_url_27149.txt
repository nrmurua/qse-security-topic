The recent update of QCEngine breaks its Turbomole wrapper for most purposes. This leads to failing Pysisyphus tests for Turbomole. The problem is quite specific, as it only affects the combination of Turbomole with QCEngine 0.20.0 and in our case this partially breaks Pysisyphus. @eljost investigated the issue and opens a PR against QCEngine, but until I can backport this fix into nixpkgs and it is migrated to nixpkgs-unstable, Pysisyphus is broken.
