ImportError: cannot import name 'ignis' from 'qiskit' (c:\users\xxxx\anaconda3\envs\qiskit_0_9\lib\site-packages\qiskit_terra-0.8.0-py3.7-win-amd64.egg\qiskit_init_.py)
firstly install qiskit-ignis from sources code
cd qiskit-ignis-master
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python setup.py install
then in python:
from qiskit import ignis
a file with ".egg" extension is created in the directory of Anaconda3  after the installation of qiskit ignis: "C:\Users\xxxx\Anaconda3\envs\qiskit_0_9\Lib\site-packages\qiskit_ignis-0.1.0-py3.7.egg". I added the ".zip" extension to this file, and unzip. Finally i have a folder "qiskit_ignis-0.1.0-py3.7.egg" containing the ignis modules and i can use them in anaconda.
Did pip install qiskit-ignis work?
This command works, but i didn't use it because i installed the new version of terra 0.8.0 from sources instead of using pip that installs the previously version.
Same solution as #175
