The QISA that is generated is correct.
The errors get printed after generating the QISA.
No exception is raised in python (I think every error should raise an exception ), explaining why it passed by the tests.
Example below is from me testing in PyCQED. I expect the same problem in the OpenQL tests, however the code needs to be run by hand as the test will conclude it passes.
DiCarloLab-Delft@893e291 fixes the issue. actually the error messages were printed in C++ without throwing exceptions.
Now some more tests are failing but that is because of instructions not available in configuration files which you should probably fix it as you know what you intend to do in tests.
@imranashraf I agree that these error messages should throw exceptions however I am quite worried by this change (and as such have not updated). I am mostly worried because I know that the QISA  I currently get is correct, however I still see these messages all the time.
I have the impression that the problem you are getting (and you can see in the messages you see) is because of a double conversion of an instruction at the "user" level to an "instruction" at the eQASM level.
I currently do not have the time to provide a detailed example but both the config and the tests should be correct and if what you are describing is happening this is a mistake in the compiler.
@imranashraf I have tested this and can confirm that this indeed is incorrect behaviour on the compiler side.
We should resolve this as the commit intended to solve this issue has introduced an error.
DiCarloLab-Delft@97dd4fc should fix it. Please confirm.
@imranashraf confirming fix. Closing issue.
