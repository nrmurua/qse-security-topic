I've been playing around with the qite_example.py file, but I haven't been able to get anything more than the ground state eigenvalue.  Is it possible to obtain the expectation value of an arbitrary observable after performing the quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm? Or is it possible to get the final state itself?
