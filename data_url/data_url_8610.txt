The mcsolver generates a freeze_support() warning for each traj in the mcsolver.
This seems to be independent of the logger as it occurs for qutip 3.0.1 as well.
It seems that this is a warning that is generated only on Windows due to the multiprocessing not being behind a __name__=='__main__' statement.  Oddly though, this should not be needed as our multiprocessing code is inside a class method.  The unit tests still pass, so perhaps just disabling the warning for the mcsolver function and then reenabling at the end is a suitable workaround?
I guess disabling warnings would be OK, but I don't particularly like putting win work-arounds in the general code base.. multiprocessing on windows will always be a pain in the neck..
Anyways, is there anything we can do on this now for 3.1 or should we just kick this can down the road?
Well, the mcsolvers multiprocessing under windows is broken (at least it was before you rewrote it), so these warnings are second-order worries.  With or without the warnings the code hangs.  I still need to do some work investigating, but I am all for not worrying about this at the moment.
OK, I see. Oh well, I guess we should trying to restore multiprocessing windows.. Do you have a windows computer to test it on?
Yes. Sadly having a windows machine is a requirement here in Korea :(

This seems not to be an issue when using Anaconda.
