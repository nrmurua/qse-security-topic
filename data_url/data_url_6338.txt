I have reason to experiment with the Intel HD, and I notice it's intermittently bugged on certain units tests, with some frequency. As I have an HD alongside an NVIDIA, I will experiment more running the OpenCL unit tests on the HD, and we'll fix any bugs, in the next couple of weeks, logged in this issue.
The Dispose() unit test fails, for QEngineOCL, at least intermittently. I'll target this, first. (QUnit tests pass.)
It looks like the HD now passes all unit tests. test_probmaskall takes far too long, but this is because it attempts to fully saturate the use of that method for OpenCL accelerators, and the HD maximum allocation is actually typically larger than NVIDIA GPUs, (residing in general heap,) with much slower execution, (i.e. this test is actually just taking as long as it's expected to take). I might enable detection for HD accelerators and use that to skip the test, but I'm not doing that for now.
Just skip the test on the HD, for now, (./unittest ~test_probmaskall) However, the HD works. It might make sense to spend some time testing and debugging Raspberry Pi variants again, now, as somewhat in the same vein.
