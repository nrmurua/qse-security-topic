Application
In some scenarios, the BQM that is returned by the stitch function has a small energy gap, which results in multiple low energy states being returned by the solver, reducing the frequency of the lowest energy state being returned.
Proposed Solution
Include the energy gap in the BQM returned by the stitch function.
Alternatives Considered
Automatically optimizing energy gaps is not always trivial or practical.
Additional Context
By including the energy gap in the BQM that is returned from the stitch function it will allow the user to understand the results returned, and why they might be seeing non-optimal results compared to simulated annealing.
