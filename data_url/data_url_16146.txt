For 1) run, for example:
Circuit contains the letter „θ“ (U+03B8) but works fine apart from this issue.
For 2) run, for example:
This circuit is saved to file without error, but cannot be parsed successfully from it. (It intentionally has unassigned parameters which seems to be part of the problem.)
Circuits should be saved and parsed without error.
For 1) it seems to work when I store the qasm string manually to file. I.e. run only qasm() on the circuit and write the result to a file using utf-8 encoding. This is probably an encoding problem somewhere.
An example issue:
String parsing doesn't play nice with 1 of 2 of the core OpenQASM gates, U, however if you wrap it in a definition it works just fine:
Problem 2) was already resolved by #5705 which raises an error when parameterized circuits are converted to qasm. Hopefully, OpenQASM 3 will be able to represent parameterized circuits soon.
@dahlend This worked for me: qk.QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str('include "qelib1.inc";qreg q[1];U(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) q[0];')
I just included qelib1.inc. but I think you're right that this should work without including anything since U is a core gate.
I'm going to close this issue now, because the exporter reliably emits a correct error that circuits with unbound parameters can't be represented in OpenQASM 2.  For what it's worth, the OpenQASM 3 exporter (qiskit.qasm3.dumps) successfully exports both of these circuits, and the importer (qiskit.qasm3.loads) can load them back into Qiskit again.
If there's more to say, please feel free to open a new issue.
