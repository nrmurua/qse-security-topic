Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
In the propagation and creation of the Us everything is written by using python for loops. These should be replaced by the tensorflow equivalents to increase performance and actually make use of tensorflow workload distribution.


Currently every du is calculated by itself and no parallelization is done, which could/should be improved.
Describe the solution you'd like
Make the progapagtion with native tensorflow functions.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Additional context
One thing to keep in mind is that the python structure is not necessarily the tensorflow structure. The examples above use decorated @tf.functions which means they will be parsed as a for loop but not executed that way. It all comes back to the fact that we need a proper software engineer to find the best tensorflow network representation for the propagation.
Below is an example notebook but that's about as far as I got investigating this.
@GlaserN Is this issue fixed in #34?
