Currently, I search a local directory of the rst files, then sometimes read the relevant files in the online version, because it's easier to read.
Making the online language spec searchable would be quite useful. For example when adjudicating the behavior of implementations.
Of course each page is searchable in the browser, but not all of them. The old, but easy way to fix this is write single web page rather than several linked pages.
There should be a search bar on the left of the page? It's a regular Sphinx build, so it should already be possible.
I'm trying now in a few browsers. Most show nothing on the left. One browser (some firefox on some fedora) looks like it's trying to render something there, but it's garbled.
Copying some invisible text from the browser into my editor, I see:

Introduction
In firefox I see button on the left edge [Go]. I click on it and do get a new page titled Search that does have a search box.
But I wanted to search for the physical qubit $0. I get no hits. Tried escaping the $ and a few other things, but no luck. Of course searching for $0 in the html via the browser does work.
It appears fine on Firefox on my phone, both in mobile and desktop modes, and my recollection is that it works on Firefox desktop as well. The "Go" button is for the search bar - it's right next to it.
The difficulty of searching for terms with sigils is in somewhat different, and a hard problem in general - I remember Google themselves only in the last couple of years made it much easier to search for sigils in pages. The search we use is the one built into Sphinx.
I'll have to look into this more. I used three browsers on linux. I'll try a mac and phone. I guessed the Go button is supposed to be under a search box. But I don't see a box.
The problem with sigils remains. I mean this is a language spec, so these kinds of searches are not uncommon.
