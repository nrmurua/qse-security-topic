Report communication failure with core device at two locations.
It is already reported in artiq_gui log. What is artiq_main?
Sorry, I meant artiq_master not artiq_main.
Regardless, I can unplug or power off the Core Device and there are no messages that appear in artiq_gui's log.
I observe the scheduler can be put into an inconsistent state.
Upgrade.
Also, don't expect any error message to appear about the core device being disconnected when nothing is using it. This is not an error.

But I expect that the following is undesirable behavior. Right?
with the Core Device attached start a program
disconnect Core Device
in artiq_gui tell scheduler to delete program
it keeps running on the Core Device
reconnect Core Device
deleted program continues to run even though the scheduler things it has been stopped
Looks like binstar may be stuck again... Last build was 2 days ago.
OK. Waiting for next binstar build... It looks like its stuck again...
https://binstar.org/m-labs
Just FYI, after 31st of August binstar.org will be deprecated, everybody should use anaconda.org -> https://anaconda.org/m-labs/.
Maybe we should say officially that my own anaconda repository is not to be used any longer?
@jboulder I uploaded all the useful old packages from fallen to m-labs account FYI.
