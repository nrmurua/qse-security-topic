Is there a reason that there isn't any make.bat for building the sphinx docs on Windows? It should have been auto-created by sphinx-quickstart. Currently just has Makefile, so only able to build docs on Linux/Mac. If there's no objection/reason not to, I'll add a make.bat in a future PR.
It's just that all developers so far have been using Linux. Adding it is OK.
