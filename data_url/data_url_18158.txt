When executing a quantum program without explicitly specifying a backend, qiskit or IBM Q API should perform automatic selection of the least busy backend.
For example, without specifying the backend when executing the program, qiskit or IBM Q API will wisely choose the least busy device. Imagine when we have many real devices (identical 16-qubits devices etc.)
The backend below must be specified to a specific backend. But in some cases, users may just want to run the program on any available devices.
But must be careful with limitation of numbers of qubits and other restrictions with regards to program.
