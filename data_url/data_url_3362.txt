After reading docs, I found no way of assigning qubit registers to a Program() during the initialization. So that if one was running WavefunctionSimulator() on this empty program, it would return not |0> but rather |0000...>.
The only solution I found so far is to use
Is there a more appropriate way achieving this?
@mavzolej You can do something like p = Program([I(i) for i in range(n)])
@mavzolej You can do something like p = Program([I(i) for i in range(n)])
Yeah, I was using this trick before learning about the 'reset'. I'm not sure which one is faster. In any case, both look quite strange. In the case of adding I(i), the circuit also looks uglier for printing purposes, for it contains all those unnecessary gates.
The identity gates introduce a delay of the order 40e-9s. I forget what the duration of RESET is, but I think it's longer than the identity pulse.
Whether the program is ugly because of extraneous identity gatees... probably, but I also don't think it's too offensive. I think this kinda "feature" is probably not something that should be implemented in pyquil, but in extensions / user code.
