There should be at least one Urukul/Sampler set up for use with suservo in the CI system. Basic unit tests for the driver should be really useful, as the recently fixed issues show.
(Actually including a dummy feedback loop with a diode detector would be a nice touch, too, if you have the hardware to spare.)
