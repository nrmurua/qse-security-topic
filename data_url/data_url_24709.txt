It is currently possible to create a ForLoopPulseTemplate with parameter constraints affecting the loop index variable. However, the validation of the constraints is performed before the loop unrolling in the build_sequence() method, such that a ParameterNotProvidedException is thrown in this case.
We should either
I think the place for such a constraint would be the body template or the user formulates it in terms of the loop range.
I would not raise an exception but maybe a warning if there is a constraint for the loop index.
