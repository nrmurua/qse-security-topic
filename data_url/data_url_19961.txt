@Martyrshot @bhess See this code: 
It is a) weird (as already stated in your own comment) and b) makes (remote/CI) debugging see e.g. this error log hard.
--> Would you be willing to do a PR to call python code the way it should be called from within python? That way it should be possible to get python stack traces/more easily understand the errors in code called (update_cbom.py in this case)?
@bhess: This is ultimately triggered by #1337 for which I already had to do a workaround to #1406... All this --also due to very long CI run times-- by now cost me 2 hours and I am unwilling to invest more time to debug & work around these issues. Please let me know whether you'd be willing to fix this issue, #1406, and find the CBOM-generation error in #1405, currently visible in the error log.
I'll look into the issue next week.
Fixed by #1412
