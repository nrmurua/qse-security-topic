Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
When attempting to execute on quantum hardware, circuits may be rejected for a variety of reasons such as the presence of unsupported gates or requiring interactions incompatible with device's connectivity.
Describe the solution you'd like
It is desirable to have a tool that can test or dry-run a circuit to check for all such rejection conditions before sending the circuit for execution on a quantum device.
