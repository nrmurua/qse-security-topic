In this readme file for GroversAlgorithm:

The link to the Q#
Q# Samples repository has an implementation of Grover's search.
https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/tree/master/Samples/DatabaseSearch
Returns a 404.
I believe it needs to include the src directory.

Thank you for this great set of sample code.
Nice catch, thank you! Do you want to open a PR to fix the link? If not, I'll get to it later.
@tcNickolas  - I will try my hand at a PR in this repo, as I would imagine there are many other things for you to work on.  :-)
Resolved in #100 - thank you!
