Currently, if a number of pauli-lists for expectation value is N, qiskit transpiles N circuits though their prefix are the same. This is because operator-flow generates circuits before transpilation.
A possible solution will be that operator-flow transpiles a circuit and then combines pauli-lists. This solution will still remain deepcopy issue to generate multi-circuits.
Another solution will be that provider supports snapshot operations such as Aer-provider does.
qiskit-terra f104bbf: first 12 minutes, include_custom=False

When we set include_custom=True, this program finishes within few minutes.

Primitive will resolve this issue.
