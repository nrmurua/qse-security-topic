When pulling the qcodes repository on Windows, there is a filename collision between the uppercase and lowercase Keysight folders.
The error message is as follows:
I propose we remove the lowercase keysight folder as it has now been deprecated for over 2 years.
Windows/OSX and other OS's with case insensitive file systems.
i'm working on macOS and haven't seen this problem. But i'm all for removing that lowercase directory if it is possible in a clean way.
@astafan8 Please see the discussion of the issues in #1710
@jenshnielsen thanks, already curiously following it :)
