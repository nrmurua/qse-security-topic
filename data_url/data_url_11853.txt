we need to setup travis
I will talk to @diego-plan9 to see how it was done in Terra. May need to talk to @pistoia  to get the script he uses to tie aqua and chemistry docs together and then  I will set it up.
@jaygambetta, thanks for raising this issue.  We need indeed to automate the process of generating and uploading the documentation.
@manoelmarques and @diego-plan9: automatically generating the Aqua documentation is a bit tricky because the Aqua and Aqua Chemistry documentations are merged into one single documentation structure.  I have documented how to replicate this process in the two Aqua docs and Aqua Chemistry docs readme files:
Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you.
Travis is currently setup and working in Aqua. Just unit test for now. Documentation generation is next.
Travis has been set up for both Aqua and Chemistry
