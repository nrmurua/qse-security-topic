The snapshot object contains all the parameters present in all devices in the setup. I guess for most setups that would mean hundreds of different parameters. Of these, we generally have special interest into some. I propose to add an extra property to the DataContainer, i.e. MetaFilters. This property has the following form:
{'filtername_abc':
['path_to_a_meta_data_end_point', ['path_to_b_meta_data_end_point', ['path_to_c_meta_data_end_point'],
'filtername_def':
['path_to_d_meta_data_end_point', ['path_to_e_meta_data_end_point', ['path_to_f_meta_data_end_point']}
The metadata filter can be used to identify the important parameters active in a setup. For example, we have voltage source with 50 channels, but for the presently loaded sample, we only use a subset of channels. In the filter we can identify the used channels so, later on, we can easily ask for only those metadata endpoints.
