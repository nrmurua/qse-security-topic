I can successfully install qiskit by
conda create -n myqiskit python=3.7,
conda activate myqiskit,
pip install qiskit.
However, when I try to import qiskit, I got the error message,
import qiskit

I tried to reinstall the conda environment, and tried higher version of the python 3.9, none of them worked.
It seems that there was a problem installing one of the dependencies of qiskit called Tweedledum.

Here are a few things you can try in your Anaconda environment:
you can install it this way
Closing this issue as not relevant to Qiskit tutorials and it seems OP has a solution now ðŸ˜„
