Pull request #221 starts a comprehensive list of features which we will merge once completed (help on that welcome, especially if making additions which explain your contribution). This should help raise awareness about the many functionalities currently implemented in OpenFermion.
However, the best way to show people a new feature is to write an example. I believe these are best demonstrated through ipython notebooks. Currently we have one huge demo but I think we should creating smaller, more specific demos. For instance, perhaps we should have a demo called "transforms" which discusses the many transforms currently implemented. Perhaps we should have a demo called "models" which discusses how to generate different Hamiltonian models. Any help in this regard would be appreciated.

We have a specific request from @Konjkov to add a demo for compiling phase estimation circuits.
is there a plan to divide the huge one into smaller pieces?
Not currently but there should be such a plan!
I'm working on a transforms demo! See my work in progress here: https://github.com/kevinsung/OpenFermion/blob/transforms_demo/examples/transforms.ipynb. Comments welcome. I'm taking a very (too?) pedagogical approach.
Ok I made my demo only about Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev. If others want to make a demo about Bravyi-Kitaev Superfast and/or the Verstraete-Cirac, please go ahead. It might make sense to put those in the same notebook.
