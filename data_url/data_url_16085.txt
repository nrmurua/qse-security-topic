After qiskit-terra 16.1, applying an Amplitude Estimation circuit, followed immediately by it's inverse fails to return me to the same initial state.
Output:

I would first look into why evaluating <0| U†U does not equal the conj-transpose of U†U|0> when computed via Opflow (as shown above). Note that if you do not use Opflow, and instead execute the circuit directly, you will see the same error. I was only able to get the correct output by fiddling with the order in which Opflow was evaluating terms.
