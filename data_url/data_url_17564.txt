I have updated qiskit module but unfortunately, it doesn't work it says "C:\Users\Aman\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\lib\site-packages\marshmallow\schema.py:364: ChangedInMarshmallow3Warning: strict=False is not recommended. In marshmallow 3.0, schemas will always be strict. See https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrading.html#schemas-are-always-strict ChangedInMarshmallow3Warning" What shall I do?
This is a Just a Python warning about deprecated usage. It will be fixed in the next release. It should not prevent you from upgrading Qiskit or writing any code today.
Yes this is fixed via #1652 which will be visible in the next release.
