These methods should be removed so creating new Qobj instances enforces a semantically-rich syntax.
These are my findings:
from_dict is still needed because of two legit uses: one for loading JSON-persisted objects and another for transforming the output of the DAGUnroller into QobjExperiment.
However, regarding the first use case, if we still want JSON-based persistence, we should provide explicit and external functions to serialize and deserialize Qobj instances in JSON (#721). For the second use case, it is worth considering a new backend for the DAGUnroller returning ObjExperiment instances directly, instead of plain dictionaries (#720).
as_dict is currently required by the conversion utilities we are using right now for easing the transition to Qobj. When the backends will move to Qobj and after retiring the conversion functions, we will remove as_dict. It is also used in a test to compare if two ways of compiling produce the same result but I think #721 will solve this case too.
FTR, DAGUnroller does not exist any more.
