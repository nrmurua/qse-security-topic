Today you can get device availability programmatically using ‚Äúdevice.properties.service.executionWindows‚Äù. See an example here. However, there are multiple ExecutionDay values such as EVERYDAY for Rigetti and WEEKDAY for IonQ, so you have to parse all patterns.
Objective Create a function that shows current availability for a certain device (Available/Not available). The function should base the response on both the execution windows and the actual device status (device.status).
Note: We expect a SMALL task to take hours or a few days to complete dependent on your level of familiarity with the Braket SDK.
This has been released in v1.12.0. Huge thanks to @surfkansas for this contribution üéâ !
