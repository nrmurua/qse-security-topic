Using a Kasli master and satellite based off 2edf65f, I see that the timing of SERDES outputs on the satellite relative to the master changes over restarts across a window of 8ns.
The phase relationship of the master and satellite si5234 outputs stays the same over restarts.
If I replace the serdes outputs with ttl_simple outputs, the timing alignment does not change over restarts.
@cjbe Does it work correctly now?
I tested ce2b5a9 - this did not fix the issue.
I could not see any relevant commits since then.
I suppose that you tested between a SERDES TTL on the master and a SERDES TTL on the satellite, correct?
@sbourdeauducq correct
The satellite was resetting the SERDES, but the master was not (this may also cause problems on non-DRTIO targets). Hopefully fixed now!
@sbourdeauducq this fixes it. I observe no change in timing alignment between master and satellite serdes outputs over 30 restarts.
