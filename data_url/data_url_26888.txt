The test QS/regtest-kg/H2_H2O-kglri.inp, touched in the commit ebf37dd,  fails on Daint with the farming regtest for 8 ranks. It doesn't crash when farming is not used and with fewer ranks. The log is:
For the time being, I have removed the test from Daint.
Closing this issue because it is not possible to reproduce it anymore.
