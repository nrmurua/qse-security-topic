Thank you for the great tutorials. I have noticed a bug:
An issue with the CNX gate in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/47a0a30949f41c7cf901d5562b225e7fc8f45c21/community/games/game_engines/composite_gates.py#L57
The problem is that when I run the cnx with an unitary simulator I also get complex number in the unitary, which should not be the case when you run
-line 73, 79
I guess that when you call cry it should not have (qc) among the arguments
-line 76, 82
cnx cannot be called as qc.cnx because it's not an attribute of QuantumCircuit.
Just create a circuit and run it with more than 2 control qubits (i.e. more than Toffoli)
Aside from the minor bugs, I don't think it should return imaginary numbers.
Imaginary numbers on the resultant unitary: I don't know how to solve that.
The simple bugs: remove qc from cry arguments and qc. from cnx
It looks like there is a mistake in that tutorial / circuit and it is implementing a multi-controlled -iX gate instead of a multi-contrlled X gate. This is likely due to the use of crz gates and global phase issues when you control the gate.
