works just fine but h is not in the basis set.
The fake backends work like a real and error if the circuit is not composed of gates only in the basis set.
The issue is for the execution of the circuits on the backend we just pass it to aer (or basicaer if aer isn't installed), see: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/test/mock/fake_backend.py#L118-L159 We configure the noise model for aer to match the stored properties and that updates the basis_gates in the BackendConfiguration but doesn't actually enforce anything at runtime. I think this might be an aer issue where it doesn't reject gates outside the noise model.
The other option is that we enforce basis gates in the circuits in the fake backend's run() method manually before calling the simulator.
