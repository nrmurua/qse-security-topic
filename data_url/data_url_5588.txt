We released Aer 0.13.1 but only GPU binaries are not published on PyPI.
Here is a log of the deploy action.
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/actions/runs/6977865439/job/18988325464
The binary packages were built successfully but uploading to PyPI is failed as following.
Any update on that?
We still can not publish GPU package to PyPI https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/actions/runs/7551126426/job/20557873811
This is fixed by PR #2034
