When a text width calculation method was first added to the mpl circuit drawer, the method was called whenever it was needed. This has caused excessive load times due to repetitive method calls for medium to large circuits (100-1000+ gates), especially for gates with parameters.
Caching the text widths will eliminate the repetitive calls.
i am interested to work on this issue.
