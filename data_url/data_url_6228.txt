I get a SchemaValidationError
Closing and moved to terra issue.
I believe it is intentional that you cannot have an empty circuit, though someone from the terra team can comment on the new issue.
If you add a trivial instruction it will run as you expect though:
will execute and return [1.+0.j 0.+0.j] on the Aer or BasicAer statevector simulators.
