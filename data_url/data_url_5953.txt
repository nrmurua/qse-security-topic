Running python setup.py install on my local system in a clean python environment fails trying to find the numpy package
Looking at this error my assumption is that scikit build isn't handling the setup_requires arg early enough and numpy isn't getting installed in time for cmake to look for the headers. Normally setuptools.setup() would pull the setup_requires and install the requirements early in the process so that numpy would be present for when extensions are built.
Run python setup.py install in a clean environment without anything installed.
Aer builds and installs correctly
Figure out why numpy isn't getting installed and fix it.
@mtreinish , fyi, when I tried to install on a Raspberry Pi, I needed to install the following packages (plus Rust and libcint) before qiskit to make it work.
(See https://gist.github.com/JanLahmann/5ef71cfc11e3a08f9edc58ef94c692e0 for an install script that work on a RPi.)
I see that CMake is taking Ninja as the default build tool, we haven't tested builds with Ninja at  all (even though it might work). Can you test this?
@atilag this was on a clean environment. In a fresh venv I ran:
If we don't test ninja why does it end up being the default build tool? We should have it default to what we know works.
That being said I tested it using the unix makefiles generator and it still failed the same way:

I think you are right. It looks like requirements are installed after cmake process finish. I think the only thing we can do is check at the beginning of setup.py if numpy is installed and install it if it is not (as we do with scikit-build).
