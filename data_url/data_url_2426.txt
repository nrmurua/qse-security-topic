The unitary returned by ParallelGateOperation._unitary_() is incorrect. For example, for XX it returns a 4x4 singular (hence non-unitary) matrix and for XXX it returns a rectangular 16x4 matrix.
Unit tests don't check internal consistency of the operation.
Found when trying to use the operation in a new unit test for #1612.
