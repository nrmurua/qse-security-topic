Goal is to "modernise" QuantumInstance and run_circuits logic for execution of circuits on the backend given advances in capability of Terra and IBM Q Provider since some this aforementioned logic was written. This includes areas such as
These are related to improving execution etc too
Algorithms have been refactored over to use primitives and circuit execution etc is now handled by these. As such I am closing this issue.
