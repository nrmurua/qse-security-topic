From #461, notebooks are included in the documentation using simple hyperlinks from the examples.ipynb notebook and show as html pages. However, nbsphinx allows to use both table of contents, RST-like links and the use of thumbnail galleries similarly to sphinx-gallery. Implementing both would be great. The catch with respect to TOC links, is that they should be linkable also if someone is opening the examples.ipynb notebook, and not only looking at examples.html from the documentation (on Read The Docs or built locally). Probably keeping both the hyperlinks and rst-like links could work fine.
My plan for this is to start using JupyterBook as the front end for the docs build, which is basically just adding some more custom options to Sphinx. I started on the crazy4pi314/jupyterbook branch but will need more time to make sure there are no bugs. Since it is not urgent and an easy enhancement, I will bump for now.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
@nathanshammah, is this up-to-date?  (We now have sphinx gallery)
Ah sorry, I'll close again. Idk why I thought there was still things we wanted from this... New achievement though, forgetting this even though I actually implemented ðŸ˜“
