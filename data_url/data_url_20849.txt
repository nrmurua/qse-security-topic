Hello Prof Stebila,
We are about to start some work to bring Dillithium and Falcon to liboqs/openssl this summer to do some testing. Do you happen to know if Dillithium will make it to PQClean soon so we avoid duplicating work?
Thanks
Hi Panos, it is definitely our plan to get all of the Round 2 algorithms including Falcon and Dilithium into PQClean over the next couple of months, and use the PQClean implementation to add them to liboqs.  As far as I know we haven't assigned Falcon or Dilithium to any one of our developers yet, so if you wanted to have a go at adding one or both of them to PQClean, you'd be welcome to do so, just post a comment here so we know someone's working on it.
My student will start in June, so we will update this Issue accordingly, unless @cryptojedi completes the work in the meanwhile.
I can take care of Dilithium now. Should be done by the end of the week.

Thank you Matthias, I will keep an eye for it.
