When you hover over a QComponent file in the Library tab, it says Library of components

Instead, have the tooltips display the name of the QComponent in the file over which the mouse is hovering.
Hover mouse over any file in the Library tab
Hovering the mouse over any file in the Library tab should display the name of the QComponent in the file
Possibly look into QHoverEvent, but I haven't used this myself and this may not be the right lead.
