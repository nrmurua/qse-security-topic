There are several places in the code base that loop over a series of operations while calling cirq.apply_unitary and managing the workspace-vs-state buffers. One in Circuit, one in sparse_simulator, and soon to be on in ParallelGateOperation.
It's relatively easy to get this code wrong, so we should have one common place that handles it consistently. Basically I'm picturing a method with this signature:
though I'm very open to suggestions on how it could be designed better. E.g. maybe an apply method on ApplyUnitaryArgs that does the right thing somehow.
The piece of code in density_matrix_simulator is also conceptually similar, except that it applies a channel i/o applying unitary. Is the utility method expected to cover apply_channel too?
Can this be closed now that #1650 was merged or is there more to be done @Strilanc?
Yup, it can be closed!
