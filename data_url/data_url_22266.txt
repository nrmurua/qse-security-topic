We should probably specify that one needs to change the KC705 VADJ rail using PMBus in the "common problems" listing in the core_device.rst documentation file, instead of/in addition to having it where it currently is at the bottom of the QC2 documentation.
That seems to imply that the QC2 documentation is usually not read or ignored when setting up a QC2 system. Is that the case?
Doesn't the "clock" design also require the same PMBus programming by the way? The doc currently does not say that.
Yes, the point is that this is required for CLOCK and QC2, not just QC2, and so it should be mentioned in a place where people doing CLOCK also will look for it.  I don't know of anyone using KC705/QC1 currently -- I think we should move to deprecate it pending a check that nobody is using that combination.
What is the Penning lab using?
HFGUI :P
Penning confirms they are not using KC705/QC1 anymore. @jboulder are you using KC705/QC1 in any of your experiments these days?
What's their excuse?
They are too busy writing rubbish like this: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6291/1297
I missed that this was directed at me. I'm not using KC705/QC1. If Penning
moves to use ARTIQ I'd guess it will be after Sayma-Metlino become
available. Justin, thoughts? -Joe

Justin has confirmed they are not using KC705/QC1, so it should be removed from the CI.
For completeness, I will confirm we have no plans for QC1, and are setting up to use QC2 when we make the switch.
Do we drop AD9858 support as well or is someone using it (or planning to)?
That being said, if you want to give ARTIQ QC1 a quick test, it should work quite easily. Many of the first tests were done on it.
I don't know of anyone planning to use AD9858.  That said, I don't think it is necessary to remove it from ARTIQ in case someone changes their mind.  It just won't be instantiated in any of the currently-compiled bitstreams.
You are forgetting that there is significant work involved keeping and carrying the code around.
