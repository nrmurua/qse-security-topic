BQM.to_numpy_matrix() was removed in dimod 0.10.0, however creating a dense matrix from a BQM is still of interest to some users. It can currently be done with
Proposals
The main barrier is handing the linear terms, because the expectations should be different for binary and spin bqms. I think this leads to a few options
and raises an exception if the binary quadratic model is SPIN-valued. This would not have an equivalent implementation on quadratic models.
This has the advantage of being valid for both BINARY and SPIN, as well as for quadratic models. Folks who just want the QUBO matrix can then do
I like this because it's very explicit about which part of the model is being turned into an array. It also allows for some nice construction like np.array(bqm.linear).sum()
Did you mean bqm.to_numpy_matrix here?
Sure did!
Whatever we do, we should also keep in mind SciPy sparse matrices (there is already an issue for the inverse).
