After the fork this is what I did (On a raspberry pi3, with python 3.6.0):
sudo pip3 uninstall qrl
sudo pip3 show qrl
Then it was empty, so uninstall seems to have worked.
Then:
sudo pip3 install -U qrl
start-qrl
It started loading, but even though the qrl block explorer says the last block is 1405, it loads past that number.
You have not deleted the old chain from your disk. It is stored in ~/.qrl/data
You need to remove that. Although we will add the fix, so that you get informed because of invalid chain.
Great, staking now
Too many people are having problem with stale .qrl data. We should probably detect and show an appropriate message
