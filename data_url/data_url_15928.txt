While looking into #6468 , Optimize1qGatesDecompositions will remove runs of (non-parameterized) single qubit gates if their net operation is sufficiently close to the identity, but will not do so for runs of only a single gate.
This may prevent the transpiler from making subsequent optimizations (without KAK) like
We probably just need to add some tolerance to this line: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/transpiler/passes/optimization/optimize_1q_decomposition.py#L83 basically just swap that with numpy allclose instead of equals (using approximation degree for the tolerance might make sense too)
Hi, i am new and would like to work on this if thats ok.
@mwessling90 sure, I've assigned the issue to you. Feel free to reach out if you need any help
I want to work on this issue if thats ok.
Thanks @fs1132429 but this issue has already been assigned to someone else, I saw you volunteered for a few other issues so I've assigned a couple others to you ðŸ˜„
@javabster @mwessling90 would it be ok if I took over this issue?

Hi @mattwright99 sure I'll reassign to you as @mwessling90 is unresponsive ðŸ˜„
Is this fixed by #6553 ?
@levbishop I checked the logic and ran the tests again - same result as before. I will resolve the conflicts and update my PR so that this issue can be closed.
