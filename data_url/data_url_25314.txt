Consider the following trivial workflow:
I cannot print the result object:
This happens because when Covalent encounters an exception when processing a task, the transport graph node's output property is set to None; for any task that completes normally, the output is a TransportableObject (tasks that don't return a value have output TransportableObject(None)).
A simple fix is to convert all None node outputs to TransportableObject(None) in the Result.__str__ method; the idempotent TransportableObject.make_transportable() method is convenient for this.
