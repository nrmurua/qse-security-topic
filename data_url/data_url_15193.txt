ComposedOp's to_matrix() returns a wrong answer.
In addition,  ComposedOp's to_matrix() raises an exception if it contains a state vector.
Run the following code:
Then, the following will be printed:
In addition to that, the following code is also buggy:
This code raises the following exception:
The former result should be:
The latter result should be:
This bug is caused by the lack of implementation of to_matrix() for ComposedOp.
ComposedOp doesn't have its own to_matrix(), so it calls to_matrix() of the superclass ListOp.
However, ListOp assumes it is distributive w.r.t. coeff, so the former problem is caused.
The second problem is also caused by the lack of implementation of to_matrix() for ComposedOp.
ListOp assumes all elements of oplist will be converted into the same size matrix; the latter problem happens.
I used the following patch to address this. But I am not sure my patch is correct:
Thanks for reporting this @y-masaomi! The linked PR should fix this ðŸ™‚
