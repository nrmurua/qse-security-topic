For all classes in the Circuit Library the docstring from the __init__ method is placed just after the Class one but they don't always mesh well together.
For example in the XGate page you are given a full explanation of the gate (from XGate Class docstring) and then, just before the list of methods and out of nowhere, there is the message (from __init__ docstring)
Create new X gate.
All of this can be better seen in the following image:

Agreed this looks weird. In many places we already omit this first sentence in the docstring of the initializer to avoid this setting you show here.
