artiq_ddb_template doesn't work for a default installation because jsonschema is missing from the requirements.
It is not missing from the development shells though, and it is a development tool.
Similarly, artiq.gateware.targets.* do not work in regular installations. We can remove all these if it causes confusion.
Fair enough, makes sense - I'll close.
