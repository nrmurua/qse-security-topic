Instead of restricting the qbraid.device_wrapper to take the qBraid device ID as argument, allow passing an Amazon Braket device ARN or IBM backend ID.
If the argument passed to the device_wrapper function doesn't match any qBraid device ID, then we should look through all of the Amazon Braket device arns, e.g.
and then look through all of the IBM backends ids (names), e.g.
If a match is found, we should then enter at the entry-point corresponding to that device wrapper. Since we won't have the qBraid ids (i.e. objArg) to pass to the device wrapper classes, this we will also need to modify the qbraid.devices.DeviceLikeWrapper, qbraid.devices.aws.AwsDeviceWrapper and qbraid.devices.ibm.IBMBackendWrapper classes to account for the missing qBraid Id and other data fields.
Alternatively, after a vendor device ID is identified, a request to get_devices (or equivalent, shown below) could be made to try and retrieve the qBraid ID, if one exists. E.g.
and from there, we could enter the entrypoint as normal.
