As a part of #908, and as specified by the RFC we want to add a general concepts section to the docs about composability of multiple error mitigation techniques.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
Is this still something we'd like to do? @andreamari @nathanshammah

I think so.  Maybe it's not urgent, but it would be nice to show how to combine two techniques e.g. by mitigating an  executor twice with different techniques.
Woohoo! Feels good to close old issues!
