Once a file is commited pytest-changed-files works as expected.
It seems like this is an issue with git diff not applying to untracked files. If the file is staged or committed, ./check/pytest-changed-files works.
What would be the preferred way to handle this? Keep as is and update the documentation, or add a script to stage untracked _test.py files before git diff in pytest-changed-files? Or something else?
