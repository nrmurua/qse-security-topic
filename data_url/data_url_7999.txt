I try to install Qutip on my macOS (m1 pro, Ventura 13.0.1). I typed pip3 install qutip in the terminal, and get the following error message:
No response
It should be installed successfully.
I tried pip3 install pyproject but it doesn't solve the problem.
There isn't a QuTiP build for Apple ARM CPUs on PyPI because we don't have the hardware to build it.
I recommend installing from conda-forge by following the instructions at https://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html#installing-with-conda.
You can also compile from source yourself by installing all the necessary dependencies, but I think try conda-forge first.
