Some of the matrices in Workbook_MultiQubitGates.ipynb are not displayed properly:

That's odd, I just double-checked them and they look as expected to me (exercise 1 I'm assuming):

What kind of environment are you using? We've had reports of the math in the notebooks rendering incorrectly in VS Code (#313) and I think the consensus was that VS Code support for notebooks is not mature enough to support our notebooks yet.
This is indeed exercise 1.
This is happening in chrome and Safari on Mac.
Hmm, I don't have easy access to a Mac to reproduce... Can you try to find a way to fix the display? If you do and send a PR, we'll be able to check that it doesn't break display in other environments easily.
I looked at the code, and couldn't figure out why it renders this way.
To be clear, this happens when pointing the above mentioned browsers on mac to: https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas/blob/master/tutorials/MultiQubitGates/Workbook_MultiQubitGates.ipynb
I now checked, and the same happens on Chrome using Windows 10.
Ah, you're looking at them on GitHub! GitHub's rendering of the math notebooks is very basic, so it's not going to render properly no matter what we do :-)
The intended way to use the notebooks is to run them using "jupyter notebook" command from command line (you need to install Jupyter and IQ#, as the installation guide suggests). Alternatively, you can use the zero-install version at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/master?filepath=index.ipynb which can be a bit slower and doesn't preserve the state between runs, but is a good way to take a quick look.
OK - thanks.
I will close this.
