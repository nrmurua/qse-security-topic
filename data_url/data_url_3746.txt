Is this expected behavior?
A tuple can represent an instruction. For example, ('X', 5) represents the Quil instruction X 5. The method inst also takes lists of instructions. ['X', 5] is malformed since it's not a list of instructions. It doesn't error earlier, however, since pyQuil allows raw instructions insted as strings.
You can get this error more straightforwardly by doing:
I would say this is an issue because of bad condition checking / bad error message.
