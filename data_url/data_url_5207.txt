I am trying to get the API, for my config file setup, but even though I have successfully downloaded the forest-sdk and installed it and ran, but the API hasn't been received in my email. with which I have signed up in the website (twice I have done so) , and I have been waiting for 2 days now, still no response.  I have followed http://docs.rigetti.com/en/1.9/start.html#connecting-to-rigetti-forest this instructions, firstly the page link given there is outdated and doesnt work, I navigated to this page, https://qcs.rigetti.com/sdk-downloads .  and there used the sign in(up) , got nothing. NO resources online has helped me still, please suggest.
Hi @am610. Sorry for the trouble.
The link you are referencing is for an older version of pyquil / forest sdk. The current docs can be found here: http://docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/index.html
I will forward your question internally to see if your QCS cloud services sign-up request was received.
In the mean time, if you already have the latest version of the forest SDK installed, you actually don't need a QCS account to start working with QVM or the forest SDK locally. Just follow the instructions here to get started with a local environment: http://docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/start.html#getting-started
If you like docker, we also provide an unofficial docker image pre-installed with quilc, qvm, and pyQuil. You can find instructions on using the docker image here: https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#using-the-docker-image
Finally, we also provide a set of tutorial notebooks that might be useful for getting started: https://github.com/rigetti/forest-tutorials
Let us know if you have any further questions.
Hi @am610, I raised the issue about your not receiving a QCS email internally. If you don't mind posting your email address here, I can pass it along to the relevant people and they will send you an invitation email directly.
Regarding the above error: unfortunately, it looks like the version of quantum-grove on PyPI (1.7.0) is not compatible with the latest version of pyQuil. You will need to install the quantum-grove package from source by cloning the repository here: https://github.com/rigetti/grove
and then, from inside the grove repository, run pip install -e . to install from source.
See the second option in the Install section of the README here: https://github.com/rigetti/grove#installation
Alternatively, you might consider instead using forest-benchmarking, which also includes tomography-related code and is more regularly updated.
See for example the BellStateTomography notebook in the forest-tutorials repo.
Hi @am610, your QCS invite email has been sent. Let me know if it doesn't arrive.
Hi @am610,
As @jmbr mentioned in the grove issue, it looks that notebook is using a pyquil API that has been removed.
In general, the rigetti/grove repo has not seen much activity in the last year or so. PRs are always welcome, but you might also consider trying the notebooks in forest-benchmarking or forest-tutorials, which are more actively maintained.
For example, here are a couple of process / state tomography notebooks from forest-benchmarking that have some overlap with grove's Tomography.ipynb.

https://github.com/rigetti/forest-benchmarking/blob/master/docs/examples/tomography_state.ipynb
HI, Many thanks for the invite. I have received it and I am going to complete the process now. thanks Ayan Le ven. 20 mars 2020 à 23:17, appleby notifications@github.com a écrit :
Great! I will close this issue out, then.  If you have any further questions about using pyquil / grove / forest-benchmarking, feel free to open another issue.
Thanks again for reporting this @am610
