Hello,
I am a new starter and trying to produce the simplest case for the surface code by using qsurface.
I will be appreciate, if you can check the code:
I will put no error to the simulation
1)I want to create the surface code for distance 3
2)I want to initialize all the data qubits in 0 state
3)I want to put X and Z stabilizers
4)Then I want to measure all the X stabilizers. In this case they will randomly change and commute with Z stabilizers and Z stabilizers will not change
With this scenario, I want to see how mwpm is working
As code:
code, decoder = initialize((3,3), "planar", "mwpm", enabled_errors=[], plotting=True, initial_states=(0,0))
run(code, decoder, error_rates = {}, decode_initial=True) #"p_bitflip": 0.1, "p_phaseflip": 0.1
But I could see nothing. Could you help me for my first code?
