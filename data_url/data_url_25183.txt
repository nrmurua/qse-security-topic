Recently, Pennylane has removed the operations attribute from their DefaultQubit class which means the following error might be thrown for users installing covalent in a new environment with the pennylane version > 0.31.1 - we've observed 0.31.1 doesn't have this issue:
This can be solved by installing pennylane==0.31.1, but for now we'll need to restrict the limit of pennylane from >=0.31.1 to ==0.31.1 until we switch to the new method, so that it doesn't break covalent.
