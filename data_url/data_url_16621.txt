These gates should all move to the new qiskit.circuit.library.generalized_gates folder:
MCRX, MRCY, MCRZ, MCU1, MCX
UCRX, UCRY, UCRZ, UCPauliRotGate, UCGate
I think @Cryoris has them on radar just wanted to open a tracking issues.
MCU1 should also be MCPhase as well.
The current implementation we have for mcrx and mcrz are equivalent to using RXGate(theta).control(n). Should we still wrap this into a library objects to have a complete set of the multi-controlled operations? If we do this, then we can also extend these default implementation with more efficient ones. E.g. mcry has one implementation using ancillas.
‚ùì We now have MCMT class (PR #4028) and in the generalized_gates which can achieve all of the above functions OP mentioned . Unless there is any other function which OP intends to add in or provide an update on the same, we can close this! üòÑ
Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
I agree this issue makes little sense in the current situation of main. Closing as it is. @ajavadia please, submit a new one if you think it is not fully addressed.
(there is still a qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates.u1.MCU1Gate, should it be deprecated? New issue just for this in that case!)
