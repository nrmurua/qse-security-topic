The pulse scheduler implemented to address #1921, worked in conjunction with the basic PulseSchedule where the internal representation (IR) was essentially a composite tree of schedules. With the introduction of the unified DAG/CFG IR (#1923). The scheduler should be redesigned to operate using passes of an extended PassManager.
I believe this was taken care of as part of #4555 . Please feel free to reopen if there are still changes needed here.
