Sometimes experiment subwindows open off-screen, so that one has to scroll the main window to find them.
This only occurs on multi-monitor systems. If the monitors are horizontally arranged, with the main window on the left monitor, experiments open off-screen to the left of the main window view. This reverses if the main window is on the right monitor. Similarly behaviour with vertical symmetry occurs for vertically arranged monitors.
I see this frequently on both Linux and Windows systems, but I have not found a reliable reproduction yet.
We don't handle the placement of new QMdiSubWindow s. Presumably this is a Qt misfeature/bug. Help appreciated.
This seems to only occur when the main window is not on the primary monitor of the system.
Oh dear - it looks like this is QTBUG-1645 : https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-1645
The bug has been open since 2008 ...
We could dodge this problem by using a tabbed view instead of multiple sub-windows for the experiments. But then you would only be able to display one experiment at a time in the main window (and switch between the open ones using the tab bar). As another advantage, the GUI becomes easier to use on small monitors. But as far as I know, it is desirable to support displaying multiple experiments side-by-side. Is this still true?

Yes. It is desirable to display multiple experiments side by side.
