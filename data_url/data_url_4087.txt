Scheduling openql code and extract parallelism to generate parallel cc-light code.
Hi @gtaifu. OpenQL compiler can now generate cc-light qisa. For the following OpenQL test:
I can generate the following:
Testing it with qisa-as gives error with bs 0. This is also what is under discussion https://github.com/DiCarloLab-Delft/ElecPrj_CCLight/issues/24.
At the moment I can generate masks for single qubit gates, but most of the machinery is there to extend it to support mask generation for two qubit gates.
@imranashraf  Thanks a lot for this. I will test it today.
@gtaifu most welcome.
Two gubit instructions are also supported now. This work is available on cclight_eqasm_compiler branch. In my last commit, I have also added a couple of tests in test_cc_light.py.
Example: For the following qasm:
following code is generated:
