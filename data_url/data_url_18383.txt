I am a student who want to know more details about the process of the Quilc. My question is whether there are any files except the optimized instructions that I can see after run "cat test.quil|quilc",which means that after I compile a quil program?
here is test.quil
after run "cat test.quil|quilc" we can see
after run 'cat test6.quil|quilc -c -b quil -o test.txt' I will find the above instructions in test.txt,will some other files be generated after compilation,like a intermediate file? And where can I see these?Looking forward to your reply,thanks!
I wonder about that, too. Are there some intermediate files generated by quilc compiler such as QIR generated by qsharp-compiler to help us understand quilc's compilation process?
You can use the option quilc --verbose to look at what quilc is thinking about during compilation.
(Sorry for the late response!)
