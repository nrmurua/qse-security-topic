Occasionally in CI we're encountering failures caused by test.python.quantum_info.test_states.TestStates.test_random_state generating nan instead of a value converged to 1/8. For example see:
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py/builds/20165445/job/r5t0rtgv445hcuqt#L927
It's occurring in CI occasionally, see the referenced failures.
The test passes 100% of the time.
Figure out the source of the failure (likely something with calling randint in the test) and fix it so that it always passes.
I had a look at this. I'm not sure what I found is the bug that is causing the CI failures but I believe it to be a bug at least!
I can't see an issue with the use of randint (other than the issues raised in #205). However the random_state function which is called has the line x = np.random.random(1 << num)+0.00000001 followed by some numpy array manipulations. It's quite rare but I believe that line can give arrays with elements greater than 1 which result in a nan value being returned and hence the AssertionError.
This test can't be deterministic but it converges to a known value.
I agree with you lets make sure that this is not greater than one.
Ill open a PR later on.
great -- when you have done just ping me and i will look.
