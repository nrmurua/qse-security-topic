this passes with cirq == 1.2.0, but fails for cirq == 1.3.0
Do you have any leads on what changed?
Just looking at the release notes it's looks like there were some PRs related to EigenGate which this QFSG inherits from (e.g. quantumlib/Cirq#6231), not sure if related yet.
I see quantumlib/Cirq#6275 and I see that the test is trying to make a shallow copy of the gate with __copy__. I would bet money that this is the source of the issue
fixes
Fixed in #867
