Internal transfer function is only flat to +-0.5 dB -> where does this problem come from?
-> very likely artifact from lookup-table iq_fgen, but not clear whether this is normal for finite-size LUT's (and should be corrected by calibration factors for each frequency), or whether this is a bug..
to reproduce, check the data returned by
f, tf = r.iq1.na_trace(start=1e3, stop=50e6, points=1001, rbw=1000, avg=1, amplitude=0.2, input='iq1', output_direct='off', acbandwidth=0)
plt.plot(f,20.*np.log10(np.abs(tf)))
any ideas?
solved!
