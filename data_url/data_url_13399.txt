It seems like many of the helper functions for folding only work for Circ circuits, but seem to pass some tests when given Qiskit circuits with seemingly no conversion. See https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/blob/master/mitiq/zne/scaling/folding.py#L509 for example, which says it take only Circ circuit types but seems to work with the Qiskit ones. I know type hints are not binding, but we can see that one of the functions called by fold from right/left fails when given a Qiskit circuit.

@rmlarose is this correct? I also couldn't work out exactly how existing methods supported Qiskit circuits ðŸ˜“
_create_weight_mask is a helper function specific to cirq.Circuits. The public folding functions 
I think this can be closed. Please reopen if appropriate.
