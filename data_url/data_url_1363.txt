Description of the issue
cirq_google prerelease is broken - see error message below
How to reproduce the issue
Run the following code in a fresh Colab:
Cirq version
0.15.0.dev20220512003129
As the error message suggests, getting a matching protobuf version is a valid workaround. If you are experiencing this issue, adding !pip install protobuf~=3.13 before the cirq_google installation line resolves the issue.
4.21.0rc1 is a pre-release; the latest protobuf release on pypi is 3.20.1: https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/#history. I guess passing --pre to pip causes it to fetch prereleases for all deps, not just for cirq-google itself. We could change the protobuf dependency on cirq-google to add a <4 clause like tensorflow has.
This appears to now be blocking our CI.  For reasons I don't quite understand yet, our isolated notebook tests have not been running during CI, but now appear to be and failing.  See #5383
Ended up that a notebook test with --pre was what was causing this.  Definitely need to fix before next release.
