QuantumCircuit methods need inline examples in their docstrings and, in some cases, much better descriptions, e.g. "Apply X to q." -> "Apply an X-gate to the specified qubit.  An X-gate corresponds to a pi rotation about the x-axis on the Bloch sphere."
I will be taking this up and provide some examples in docstrings for QuantumCircuit methods located in qiskit/extensions/standard/* folder.
