those are old.
But the bug exists separately. It's related to ARTIQ firmware wishing to know the hash of the git checkout.
conda create -c m-labs/label/dev -n artiq-dev-test artiq-dev works fine here.
Conda was stuck on an old version artiq-dev package. That is, conda update didn't work. Nor did conda install=version-no. So, erased ~/anaconda3 and reinstalled anaconda from scratch. And addressed #785. Now I can build. Closing.
