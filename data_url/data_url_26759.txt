As described in #652 (comment), some of the benchmarks are outdated. For example:
https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/benchmarks/QS_mp2_rpa/32-H2O/RI-MP2.inp
gives
Also, the file
https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/benchmarks/QS_mp2_rpa/32-H2O/RI-RPA.inp
wants to include the file
H2O-32-RI-RPA-TZ.inp
that doesn't exist...

I guess it should include H2O-32-RI-dRPA-TZ.inp (with a d) instead.
I guess these issues mostly come from input changes #806 - @JWilhelm could you have a look at it?
I think @shoshijak is right! I have that file: H2O-32-RI-dRPA-TZ.inp currently in /scratch/snx3000/kabicm/cp2k-master/benchmarks/QS_mp2_rpa/32-H2O/H2O-32-RI-dRPA-TZ.inp if needed.
In #806 a new benchmark was added - could this be included in the performance tester?

Sure, I think this is the benchmarks/QS_low_scaling_GW/GW.inp... I wil do once the other problems are fixed...
Update: Performance tests on Daint are back. Thanks @shoshijak , @JWilhelm , @pseewald
Leaving this issue open, I will add the other benchmark...
I added a check to the CI to catch unknown keywords in the benchmark inputs (#822).
@alazzaro Could you already add the test
https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/tree/master/benchmarks/QS_low_scaling_GW
to a performance tester? I couldn't find it on https://dashboard.cp2k.org/archive/cray-xc50-daint-mc-psmp_perf/index.html
Did I overlook something?
