In addition to cleaning the code itself, we'll need to scrub the commit history and any issue/PR comments referencing confidential data. Examples of how to remove files from commit history (and other history-modification operations) are given in Stanford's Git Magic docs.
Update: the new plan is to sync the qFlex release with the public release of the currently-confidential data. That way we can preserve the full commit history.
It's probably still worthwhile to verify that all confidential data in this repo will be included in the upcoming release, but AFAIK that's a valid assumption.
Sergio, would you be able to make this check? I'm not familiar enough with what's currently confidential and what's been publicized to be confident I would get this right. Thanks!
No confidential information once the paper is published and the circuits are public.
