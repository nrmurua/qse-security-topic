I noticed that in the current version, you can click the ‘Download Screenshot’ button in the UI to obtain the diagram of this task, but there are some inconveniences. When debugging code in jupyter notebook, you must switch to the web interface and click the taskname. Here is a small suggestion. Can you add visualization functions, such as ct.get_result(dispatch_id).draw()
Then you can get the corresponding visualization diagram in jupyter notebook, which will be conducive to code debugging.
