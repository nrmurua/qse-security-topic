Description
I reran dwavebinarycsp.stitch() on my old multi-gate circuit for the first time in months.
It now outputs a lot of warnings:
Steps To Reproduce
Given above
Expected Behavior
Previously it ran silently. It can be a good thing to present users with more information about the construction of the BQM and its limitations, but I am concerned that this will be more scary than useful for most new users. They won't know what to make of these warnings and might conclude that the method failed or gave bad results.
Maybe any non-critical warnings can be suppressed unless the user turns on a verbose flag?
Environment
Additional Context
dwave-ocean-sdk==1.5.0
dwavebinarycsp==0.0.12
penaltymodel==0.16.2
penaltymodel-cache==0.4.0
penaltymodel-lp==0.1.0
penaltymodel-mip==0.2.1
I believe this is caused by dwavesystems/penaltymodel#102
Since dwavesystems/penaltymodel#102 has been resolved, this issue can be closed.
