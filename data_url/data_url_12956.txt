Without turning on any extra valid inequalities, the basic compact formulation decomposition for this input
is coming as
while the optimal solution has to be:
Either a bug in the formulation or in the way gates are eliminated. This issue appears only when the eliminate_identical_gates is true.
Looks like ,the issue with the CPLEX's presolve. Turning it off solves this issue!
