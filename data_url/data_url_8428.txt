I'm woundering what is the reason for doing this partial trace

would it be possible to implement an Option in settings to dissable this behavior? I would be willing to provide a PR.
AFAIK this error only manifests if you have a space of dimension 1.
and a space of dimension 1 is trivial.
Is there a use case where this actually manifests?
I use the qutip to do some Grover simulations. having a Hilbertspace of Grover an an additional entangled Hilbert space. In a simpler version there is only one state in the entangled Space so the program automatically chooses dimension 1.
And then there are allot of errors coming because of this qutip error.
At the moment I fixed it using a patched qutip version.
And I think there are more cases when one has dynamical dimensions of a space, that there are cases in which the dimension is 1.
This issue can be closed since the PR #886 is merged or?
