In the ibmq-provider version 0.4+ it is possible to assign a job a name via backend.run(qobj, job_name).  It should be possible to assign a name via execute as well.
It seems to me this already works(?!)
test_jobname.py:
Partial output:
... etc.
The backend itself doesn't note the job name in the result, but the _name key in the Job is certainly set.
Closing. See #3625 (comment)
