For the following experiment,
I get the error message,
Is there a way to use elements of numpy arrays in the kernel? Could be useful to have that functionality.
I guess I could have a separate function that takes int(self.points[0]) as an input on the array and call that in run, with run outside the kernel. The issue I had was if I wanted to quickly append an element of array to store results of counts, but I suppose that would work on a list instead?
Yes, numpy is not supported in kernels.
