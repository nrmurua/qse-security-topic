I am trying to implement a circuit to do eigenvalue estimation for some QubitOperator. When I run the circuit with 2 control bits, the circuit works fine. However, when I try using 3 control bits, I get the following error:
Mapping without SWAPs failed! Sorry...
Additionally, I get this error message when only apply a controlled gate to one of the qubits in the 'wave function' and not the other. Any ideas? Thanks!

Mapping without SWAPs failed! Sorry...
IBM's hardware has a limited connectivity between the qubits, i.e., there are only certain pairs of qubit ids which can perform a two qubit gate such as a CNOT. This error message means, that for this particular circuit, the compiler cannot map it to the hardware layout without using SWAP operations. Currently the hardware is too noisy in order to perform such swap operations and run a reasonably large algorithm, hence you get this error message instead.
Another mistake I have spotted is that you are specifying to run on the 16 qubit chip (ibmqx5). Therefore, you need to do all the mapping manually as opposed to the 5 qubit chip for which the compiler automatically tries to find a mapping (without using SWAP gates). An example is shown in the examples folder:
ibm16.py
If you are interested in algorithm development,  I would suggest to use the standard simulator in ProjectQ as you won't run into mapping issues.
By the way a few other mistakes in your code:
