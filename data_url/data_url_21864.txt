This should cause a sequence error, but it has gone unnoticed due to #998.
Using 16 lanes instead fails timing at the output of the RTIO core, even with this patch:
The problem, at least for reset, can be avoided this way, but I am not sure if it overly restricts the SAWG capability, as you can only change 8 out of the 9 splines at the same time (@jordens ?):
That patch is fine.
