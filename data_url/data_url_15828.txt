Skimming through the pass manager code and reading the documentation (which is quite lacking) for building pass managers I do not see an option to nest flow control. The FlowController class is only attached to a set of passes which makes it impossible to apply an additional flow controller on a subset of those passes. For example the use case I have in mind is to have a condition in a do while loop, for example something like:
which at least I couldn't find a way to represent in the current pass manager structure. It would be very useful as we make the pass manager more sophisticated to have nested flow control like this. If I just missed it we should improve the documentation around this (which honestly we need regardless).
Do you think this will be a good issue to get familiar with the transpiler code? If yes, I would like to try it.
This seems related to #5772 . Let me have a look first, it might be more complicated than expected.
