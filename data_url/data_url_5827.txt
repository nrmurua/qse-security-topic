raises:
when using the aer or qasm simulators.  However, if I remove the label kwarg then the code executes without error.
Run the above.
It works.
It looks like maybe using counts is just a no-no as it works with other labels.
Yeah as it stands, counts will conflict with the default outputs (think Result.get_counts) in Aer and BasicAer.  I expect you might get some weird behaviour if you use "statevector" or "unitary" as well, especially if you later try to retrieve the statevector or unitary.
It does perhaps raise the question of whether we should be namespacing parts of Result, to alleviate some of this sort of thing?
"counts" is reserved for measurement counts. If you try and use it for something else you will end up passing some other raw data structure to initialize the qiskit Counts object which is going to error.
I think that discussion was concluded that this is not an issue. Please reopen this if this is still a problem.
