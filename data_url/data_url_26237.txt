The feature in #141 will be fixed by PR #165.
These functions only accept pure states as input. This issue is to work on allowing mixed states as input states.
More info about the hierarchy is in Doherty et.al (2003) - A complete family of separability criteria
Closing from #165
@vprusso I think this one still needs some work.
I had been having trouble getting the same results as what was in Ref [3] for mixed states. This is why I thought mixed states might need some additional procedure for purification. I noticed there was a new version uploaded for that paper. Those results are similar to what I got. So, I might need to remove the check for mixed states for the functions added in #165.
Thank you for your due dilligence, @purva-thakre . If you think it makes sense to create an issue for the mixed state case, I'd say go for it! Let me know if I can provide any help on the mixed state stuff, and thank you for taking the time to look into this!
