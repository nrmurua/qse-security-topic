The traditional CPP employed by Fortran has some limitations when it comes to handling newline/spaces in macros, making it necessary to explicitly use CALL cp_abort when using longer comments since it can't introduce newlines itself.
Fypp has facilities to introduce automatic line breaks which would resolve that.
Together with this change we could also introduce a number of restrictions/improvements:
I believe our current error reporting routines have proven to be sufficient.
While we could use Fypp to add a more convenience it would also make the code less self-explanatory, which I think is not worth it.
