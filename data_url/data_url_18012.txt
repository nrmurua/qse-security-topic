The format of the results is going to need some changes due to the introduction of Qobj in 0.6. The Result class needs to be updated to be able to cope with the changes - actually, it will need to understand both the new format and the old format during the transition.
Self-assigned and expanded a bit the description. The slightly trick part is going to be being able for both formats to coexist during this phase, as the Result class is too tightly coupled with the old format - I'll take the chance to decouple it a bit, while keeping the public API of that class intact (hopefully ðŸ¤ž ).
Assigning to myself per Ali request.
