Describe the feature you'd like
This should return False:
The call stack for circuit equality ultimately relies on equality of gates. However,
The current __eq__ only checks if the instructions are of the same type/name. As a result, c1 and c2 are considered equal, even though they have different arguments.
How would this feature be used? Please describe.
Like #209, this would help with unit tests and also be good for general circuit construction sanity.
Thanks for providing your input. This feature does not currently exists but we will add it to our queue for future consideration. You are also free to create a pull request that we will review and consider merging.
Will be fixed in #216
#216 has been merged; angles are now considered for equality
Thanks!
