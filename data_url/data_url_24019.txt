Currently dockifying the QLibrary menu as done for source_editor will make toggle arrows invisible and won't let the CollapsibleWidget fully collapse.
This is because dockifying QLibrary involves GUI inheritance which naturally inherits the Dark Mode.
Using similar strategy to source_editor, dockify QPCE and see how the UI is difficult to use because of the idiosyncrasies of Dark Mode.
Visible toggle arrow
Fully collapsable widget
Trying to overwrite the StyleSheet for the docked QPCE with  a blank stylesheet ( "" ) did not work.
