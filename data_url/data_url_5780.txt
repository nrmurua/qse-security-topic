A statevector simulator can be initialised with an arbitrary Statevector using the QuantumCircuit.initialize method. Would it be possible to allow the same behaviour for the density matrix simulator?
I found a nice way to do this using the qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix class. That class can be initialised with an arbitrary matrix to create the initial state, then that state can be evolved using the .evolve method which accepts circuits as well as more general quantum channels.
