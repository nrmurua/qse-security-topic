Transactions before being signed are hashed with SHA2_256.
Descriptor's hash function is not considered or applied.
Relabeling after internal discussions
What is the status of this?
We had a discussion on this with @jleni and he had discussion with Leon and it doesnt make much difference at the transaction end what hashing type do we use to calculate transaction hash, as long as the signature scheme is using the hash based on descriptor.
