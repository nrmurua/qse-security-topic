For consistency with the conventions used elsewhere, the reference time argument used for phase tracking in the AD9910 driver should probably be ref_time_mu instead of ref_time, as it is in machine units. Better fix this now, before the driver is really widely used.
@rjo: Agreed?
Agreed.
Hm, this has already been released as 4.0, and additionally also exists in the older AD9914 driver. Should we just rename them in 5.0, and leave 4.0 as it is?
Yes.
