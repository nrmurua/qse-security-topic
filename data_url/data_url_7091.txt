There's a bunch of code intended to work when webglcontextlost/webglcontextrestored happens, but it's not exercised.
(Every once in awhile I leave Quirk alone, come back later, and the canvas is blank until I interact with it. This might be related?)
This was tested as part of the shader-coder-switching that now happens in every test run (to exercise both code paths).
