There is a timing problem with the FPGA. The current version fails compilation. I need to add more delay in the output summation.. The problem also makes that with the current bitfile the outputs remain zero whatever is done to them. Internal signal processing works however.
This problem has been solved with the adder tree. However some problem persists (some mistake in 2's complement probably), as the output doesn't look ok.
outputs ok. Problem was $signed gotcha in verilog
