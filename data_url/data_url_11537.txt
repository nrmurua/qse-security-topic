I am not sure if it is an error but i wanted to clarify.
Adding a noise_model from a real backend on the ibmq_qasm_simulator on the cloud using the QuantumInstance produces an error: The noise model is not supported on the selected backend ibmq_qasm_simulator
But when i diretcly run a circuit without the QuantumInstance on ibmq_qasm_simulator the noise is taken into account.
This works:
The noise_model should work with the QuantumInstance
