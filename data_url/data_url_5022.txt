Using cmake 3.5.1 and GPUACCELERATED=true, there is a bug where a library added with cuda_add_library won't pick up the include files in target_include_directories. See -- https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/16571
This was patched and does work using cmake 3.10.2. I haven't tested earlier versions of cmake.
Possible solutions are either to use include_directories rather than target_include_directories (bad practice) or to increase the cmake minimum required version
Looking at the bug report and the resulting commit this seems to have been fixed earliest in version 3.7.
CMake 3.7.0 is at this point 3 years old, so it should be reasonable to increase the required cmake version.
I created a pull request at #261
Well spotted, cheers!
