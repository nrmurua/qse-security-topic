All error mitigation techniques in Mitiq have the associated mitigate_executor function. E.g. mitiq.zne.mitigate_executor().
The current implementation for ZNE, PEC and CDR assumes an executor that is not batched, i.e., that takes a single circuit
and returns a single result.
Only for the DDD technique, mitigate_executor is now compatible with batched executors.
I would like to work on this issue.
