Hi @hema-ted, I am naively following the recommended installation method. After I successfully installed pyzfs with pip install .,  I encountered the following error when I tried to run the program:
From what I know, pip install . copies your local packages to site-packages and install from there. But it only copies those folders that are explicitly specified in the packages argument of setup(). Since packages=["pyzfs"], the subpackages of pyzfs were not copied.
Of course one can avoid my mistake by add the pyzfs source folder to PYTHONPATH. Or,  you can save this step by either:
Hi @xwang862,
Thanks for your comment. In commit 8914384 I used find_packages in setup.py, as you suggested. Now it seems like the code will work by directly executing "pip install ."
