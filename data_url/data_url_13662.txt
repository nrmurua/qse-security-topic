@karalekas and @rmlarose I'll let you fill in details of the approach to this here.
Thanks Will. Copying links from the engineering meeting schedule here:
Also link to the pyQuil ANTLR parser. @karalekas is this what you were referring to?
I was going to ping to partially support QUIL Cirq issue but I think maybe we should just give it a go first. With the ANTLR parser (QUIL string --> List[AbstractInstruction]) I think we just need to translate from pyquil instructions to Cirq operations.
Since this will be a PR to Cirq I'm not sure logistically the best way to organize. @karalekas maybe if you fork Cirq we can both contribute there and communicate here or by email?
Sounds good, I'll fork Cirq, and we can communicate here or in a PR in that forked repo
Draft PR for Quil to Cirq conversion: karalekas/Cirq#1
@karalekas What is left to be done to close this issue? I copied these from your comment on #278
Are these still open? Are there any others that should be on this list?
@willzeng those are still open yes, they require a PR to Cirq which Iâ€™m working on. The only other thing to do after is to update mitiq to use those changes to Cirq once they are in, and this issue is done
Merging #291 will address the third point in the bulleted list above.
As for the second point, I can make the change in Cirq, but it's looking like @andreamari's PR #283 will also address it.
I have a PR to address the first point which is ready for internal review before I submit it publicly to Cirq: karalekas/Cirq#1 @rmlarose @andreamari @willzeng
As for the second point, I can make the change in Cirq, but it's looking like @andreamari's PR #283 will also address it.
Indeed #283 fixes the weird inverse issue for self-inverse gates in Qiskit. Ultimately it would be good to upstream this to Cirq if possible, though. I believe @karalekas' conversions of self-inverse pyQuil gates doesn't have this issue.
@rmlarose I think we can try to get it into Cirq eventually, but it feels weird to me to change it in Quil export and not QASM export, and I'd like for our PR to Cirq to get merged ASAP and not give them any reason to hold it up.

Ah gotcha, yeah I agree with this.
