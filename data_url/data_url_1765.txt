Might be the same problem, just different numpy version etc. Mine is
It fails during "drop empty moments" by trying to figure out if the measurement gate is an identity operation.
It tries to figure out the unitary(?) matrix of the measurement gate which involves tensoring up a 2^32-sized identity matrix.
Should DropNegligible call cirq.is_measurement and never drop measurement gates? Or should measure gate implement _trace_distance_bound_?
(Edit: I wrote this before seeing the other replies.  I agree with @maffoo.)
Looking at the stack trace, I see two issues that combine to cause your bug:
When trace_distance_bound falls back to using the gate's unitary, it should give up for gates larger than 3-5 qubits (or have a flag to give up). Here it tries to generate a 2^17 x 2^17 unitary matrix.
Or we need a way for gates to declare that they do not have a unitary representation. We should be able to declare this for a measurement gate regardless of number of qubits.
Does defining _is_unitary_(self): False work?
This is still embarrassingly an issue.
