At least on the load-from-yaml branch. What is the intended behavior?
It should promote to CompoundGate, as it's basically the highest one in the hierarchy. Not sure why it produces a PulseBlock right now...
It's because CNOT is set by default as a CNOT_simple, which is a Pulse instead of a CompoundGate.
Usual config issue, I believe... 
Looks like you fixed this in #131
