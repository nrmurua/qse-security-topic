PulseDefaults.from_dict() would fail if the pulse defaults contain parametric pulse:
Call PulseDefaults.from_dict(defaults_dict) where defaults_dict contains a parametric pulse. For example
Existing pulse defaults do not have parametric pulses, but that's being introduced.
PulseDefaults.from_dict() loads correctly.
The marshmallow schema for the PulseQobjInstructionSchema has
which is probably why marshmallow didn't convert amp from list to complex (the _deserialize() for DictParameters doesn't do any conversion)
Given marshmallow has already been removed for PulseQobjInstructionSchema, the solution can be to just ignore it and tell people to upgrade if they encounter this issue.
FYI @taalexander @mtreinish @zachschoenfeld33
@jyu00 Is there also an issue to update this for the new version without marshmallow?
@zachschoenfeld33 Yes there is a general issue open for marshmallow removal that I'm slowly chipping away: Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider#553
If I understand #7318 correctly, this technically isn't fixed, but the path being requested is obsolete.  I'll close the issue now as stale, but if there's more to say, feel free to re-open.
