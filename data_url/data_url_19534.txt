While from qibo import gates works, doing from qibo.gates import * fails with ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qibo.gates'. This is probably because we there is no file named gates.py in the source directory and gates is imported indirectly in __init__.
I think we should try to fix this problem because this includes an asymmetry in the code which is not ideal.
