Similar to the complex labels of the Z box that are now supported
Since H-boxes also work with the current phase infrastructure, where a Fraction is used to represent a complex phase, I'm not sure what the best way to do this would be.
Can you clarify a bit more about what the difficulty is?
The way the complex phases currently work in Z-Boxes is that they use the vertexdata field instead of the phase field. Using a phase on Z-boxes is then considered to be ill-formed. The complexity is that the logic using H-boxes uses phases and not the vertexdata field.
