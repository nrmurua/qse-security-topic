We depend on CVXPY only in the tests:

However, because of its transitive dep qdldl, it is required to have CMake on your machine to compile from source the package (since wheels are only available for MacOS x86).

I'm pointing out this isolated dependence, because it increases the number of upstreams project. However, there is no priority for this in the short term.
A reasonable alternative could be:
