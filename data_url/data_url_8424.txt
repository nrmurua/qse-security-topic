Hi There:
Should one expect that calls to propagator  with unitary_mode='single' and unitary_mode='batch' lead to the same results? I am finding there are some differences in the resulting unitaries and am not sure which one I should take more seriously.
thanks.
What differences?  Should be nearly the same as the only difference is that all basis vectors propagated at same time in batch mode.
@petergthatsme if you want to give us an example, then I am happy to investigate further. I am doing some work related to the propagator at the moment.
I filed an issue (#807) about normalization in batch / single modes recently that was promptly fixed; perhaps this was your issue?
@petergthatsme could you try with the dev version of qutip and report back?
I'm very sorry for such a slow response on this - have been busy. I will try out the update on the weekend hopefully and report back.
thanks for looking into this!
hey guys.. yes, things are fine now. Below is simplified code that shows this problem:
and here is the "bad" output with the older version of qutip that I was running before (Note, the difference between the 'batch' and 'single' has terms of order 1e-6).
and here is the result of running with the latest version (note, now difference between the two propagators respects the required tolerances):
This can be closed. Thanks.
EDIT: this seems related to: #843
... that can probably be closed as wel.
How to update to the latest version: qutip-4.3.0.dev0+489fd41 ?
you can just build the latest master - the update is there.
