A lot of time is spent formatting output (especially floating point numbers and instructions) used to trace the compiler. Currently we just set the *compiler-noise-stream* to some null output stream when we don't want to see anything. Almost all uses of *compiler-noise-stream* use format. I propose we do the following:
(1) Rename *compiler-noise-stream* to *compiler-noise*, to give the subtle hint that it may not be a stream. It will now be a generalized boolean, specifically (or stream null). Document accordingly.
(2) Create a macro that looks something like this:
(I suggest using (values) just so accidental nils don't float around, not that they're common.)
(3) Change all instances of writing to *compiler-noise-stream* to use this macro. In cases where something other than formatis used, do the(when compiler-noise` yourself.
Oh, and (4) run the test suite before and after the change, and report on the performance difference.
