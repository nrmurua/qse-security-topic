To run this example I need to install and run Quantum Espresso.

Hi @malramsay64,
Thanks for your comments. I have included more explanations in the run.sh scripts in the example folders, including how wavefunctions are generated and a reference to the installation instructions for Quantum Espresso.
After addressing all your comments and suggestions, we have boosted the version number of the code to 1.1. We would like to thank you again for your time and efforts. We will surely acknowledge you in the paper after the review process is finished.
I can't get quantum espresso working, which is a problem of quantum espresso rather than this package. I can see that the instructions are present so I am fine so I am fine with that. The main reason I wanted to test this example was the MPI part of the library, however I modified one of the other examples to test that functionality.
