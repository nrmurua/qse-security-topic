Reduce latency of check_pause() when called from @kernel methods.
check_pause() is currently implemented as RPC. This incurs a cost of about 4 ms when called via kernel. This is one source of latency between experiment runs.
AMPSoC mailbox for check_pause()
It's not a significant contribution to the latency between experiment runs. The kernel overhead is orders of magnitude larger.
But scheduler.check_pause() could be accelerated by pushing a flag to the comms CPU and querying that instead. Would be useful if an experiment never has enough slack to call check_pause() for free.
