Topic:
The measure(state, ops) and measurement_statistics(state, ops) functions in the measurement PR #1274 have different return types based on whether ops is a single observable or a list of POVMs. For e.g. the measurement_statistics returns
eigenvalues: List of floats
The list of eigenvalues of the measurement operator.
eigenstates_or_projectors: List of Qobj
If the state was a ket, return the eigenstates of the measurement
operator. Otherwise return the projectors onto the eigenstates.
probabilities: List of floats
The probability of measuring the state as being in the
corresponding eigenstate (and the measurement result being
the corresponding eigenvalue).
if ops is an observable and
collapsed_states : List of Qobjs
the collapsed states (density matrices) obtained after
measuring the qubits and obtaining the
qubit specified by the target in the state
specified by the index.
probabilities : List of floats
the probability of measuring a state in a the state
specified by the index.
if ops is a list of POVMs/PVMs. Is there a good way to specify a numpy docstring for the function given that the return variables can vary !
It was decided to describe the returns summarily in the dosctring for measurement_statistics and refer to the measurement_statistics_povm and measurement_statistics_observable functions returns (in the respective docstrings). Similarly for the measure function!
Just for the future reference, I found this example in NumPy: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.unique.html
