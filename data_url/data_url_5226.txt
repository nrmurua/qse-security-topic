I get the following error when attempting to run make cleanall && make test-app.
This appears to be due to the following test, which was recently added to app/tests/suite.lisp:
Perhaps test-server-startup-behaviour is meant to test the option processing in qvm-app, not quilc? Otherwise, I guess quilc needs to be added as a dependency in qvm-app-tests.asd.
You're right, of course. This is embarrassing for me. The testing pipeline is out-of-whack, and not catching stuff like this. Though mostly this is on me for even committing such obviously wrong code.
@notmgsk No worries. Happens to the best of us :).
