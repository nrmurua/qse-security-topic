I think ResultDict is new enough that we don't need backwards-compatibility tooling for this, but only if we can resolve it before the rapidly-approaching v0.14 release.
@95-martin-orion, I'm happy to take this if you're busy.
Thanks @maffoo, that would be great. Note that this needs to be wrapped up before the v0.14 release, which is slated for sometime next week.
I'd noticed a related thing here: #4555 (comment). Should we have Result.measurements return the most recent measurement for each key, if there are multiple on that key?
Should we have Result.measurements return the most recent measurement for each key, if there are multiple on that key?
I'm open to that but I worry it might be confusing that there are two supported ways to access the data (as opposed to one supported way via .records and a backwards-compatible .measurements property that we can deprecate in the future). If you want the most recent measurement for a key you can get this explicitly from the records with results.records[key][:,-1,:].
