Plot histogram doesn't always display output in a Jupyter notebook. I've discovered at least two cases:
Suppose we have multiple counts from some execution
The following produces no output plot:
The following only returns 1 histogram (for counts1):
All the plot figures to display in the jupyter notebook
This is because Jupyter is displaying the histogram via the returned Figure object from the function instead of being drawn by the ipython matplotlib backend when the function returns (because we close the figure in the function). So Jupyter is treating the display of the plot like it would display any output from a variable in a cell.
This was a trade-off made for the 0.7 release as all the plotting functions now return a matplotlib figures instead of having no return type. If we didn't do this everytime you're getting a plot displayed now would print 2 plots. @nonhermitian and I looked at several options and this was the best tradeoff we found.
@mtreinish Is there a way to display multiple per cell using the figure object? Something like:
Or do we just have to ensure we only have one plot_histogram per Jupyter cell?
For me doing fig.show() prints the error:
Unrelated but another feature that would be nice for the plot_histogram is to have a kwarg to add a title above the plot like plot_histogram(counts, title="Results from experiment X")
@chriseclectic can you try:
I think that should do what you want. (which will change the backend to an interactive/GUI backend for jupyter so the show() method will work) I'm having trouble getting that backend to display on my system (with errors in the jupyter logs)  but it might just be an issue with the versions of everything I have installed.
As for the title kwarg, I'll quickly throw a patch together for that. It's a very easy change to make.
See #1459 for the PR adding the title kwarg.

Also works
