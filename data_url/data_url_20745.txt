Hello everyone,
during the code review of the functions PQCLEAN_DILITHIUM5_CLEAN_polyz_unpack and PQCLEAN_DILITHIUM3_CLEAN_polyz_unpack I noticed a discrepancy.
The positions r->coeffs[2 * i + 0] and r->coeffs[2 * i + 1] are filled in the for loop. However, the &= 0xFFFFF is only made at position r->coeffs[2 * i + 0]. Could it be that the second &= 0xFFFFF is intended for r->coeffs[2 * i + 1]?
Best regards
Henrik
It appears this question has also been asked upstream, and I think the comment there addresses your question: pq-crystals/dilithium#63
