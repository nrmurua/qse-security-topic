I would like to run scan2Dfast sweeping with a vector parameter and stepping with a generic instrument (in my case with a MW source for PAT measurements).
Currently, once the scantype gets assigned as scan2dfastvec, the code assumes that both parameters are vector, assigning the gate names to the AWG (for the sweep) and the DAC gates (for the step). By definition, scan2dfast should sweep with AWG, but I think it should be able to step with a generic instrument.
I modified some functions in scans (multi_instruments branch)  so that I could run the PAT measurement, but I'm not sure it's a very elegant way to do it. Could you guys have a look at the branch and tell me what you think?

Just realised that @CJvanDiepen had already opened a PR with this same issue. Closing this.
