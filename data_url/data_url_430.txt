I've attached two files: input and output QASM files
input_output.zip as a result of running this:
./staq  -S  -m  -O1  -d  tokyo  -M  swap  -l  linear  -f  qasm  -o  output.qasm input.qasm
The input is as simple as this:
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg a[4];
qreg b[4];
CX b[0], a[0];
CX a[3], b[1];
But the output.qasm file has something like this in it:
qreg q[8];
//...
CX q[4],q[8];
Since only 8 qubits are available, we cannot have the CX q[4],q[8];, can we?
Thanks for the bug report, I just pushed a fix. Only the number of qubits used were being "allocated" rather than the number of qubits present on the device. Closing.
