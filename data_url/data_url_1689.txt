This came up on the cirq.google extraction PR.
Root cause analysis
I didn't figure out the exact issue yet, but it seems that the environment creation in isolated_notebook_test.py is broken somehow: while /tmp/pytest-of-runner/proto_dir (the template env for the environments to copy) has decorator 5.0.6, however somehow the virtual envs for the specific tests - that were supposed to be the clones of this template env - have decorator 4.4.2 which is problematic, and that's why this issue is triggered. e.g. /tmp/pytest-of-runner/quantum_volume.
I suspect that something is wrong with virtualenv-clone but not sure what yet.
I'm making this issue as a reminder to fix this behavior separately from the cirq.google extraction PR.
