Hiho,
for sharcV21 two issues arose:
The variable $SHARC pointing towards the relevant python skripts has to be set.
Sharc does not work with Openmolcas 21.
In general, it seems to only be designed to work for versions 18.x
There are two options:
i) pair it with Openmolcas 18.x
ii) allow read-write manipulations of the SHARC_MOLCAS.py to circumvent this restriction manually. However, it has to be seen if this would cause actual problems with Sharc.
Thanks a lot
Hey @ziechys ,
If this solves your issue, I will open a PR.
I haven't looked at it but do you have an idea how much work it would be to patch SHARC for newer molcas version?
Thanks @sheepforce

@markuskowa  It would be nice to use the newest version of OpenMolcas. As written above one could just alter SHARC_MOLCAS.py (if Nix allows) to allow the newer version and then see/test if Sharc can run with it. I think, it might not be a problem as long as OpenMolcas did not change some output structure.
Ah sorry for the mistakes. I've just tested with MKL, not with OpenBLAS. Please try again with the current commit from my sharc branch. Regarding the nix-shell it should also have been shellHook = "export SHARC=${qchem.sharcV21}/bin". Sorry!
We cannot make something in the nix-store writable, but I've tried with a recent OpenMolcas version and did not encounter an issue so far. If you want to test this out, please try my sharc-newmolcas branch. This is the relevant patch.
Regarding the $SHARC variable: SHARC seems to work fine, as far as I can tell. If you follow the tutorial, where they use something like $SHARC/molcas_input.py, this is just used as they never set a $PATH correctly during their SHARC installation. You can ignore the $SHARC/ prefix in front of the commands and just execute e.g. molcas_input.py.
Thanks a lot @sheepforce
I am using the sharc-newmolcas branch now. So far all seems to work.
I need the shellHook not for executable like molcas_input.py, but because Sharc itself creates scripts that use $SHARC as variable hard-coded in it. This then leads to errors. The shellHook solution works, tho.
OK, I've had a quick look at the python code and the $SHARC references are scattered everywhere. I guess it is not a good idea to patch them all. I've added a setupHook instead, which sets $SHARC, whenever you load it. @markuskowa I will open a PR.
