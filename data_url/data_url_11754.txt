The components provide registerless instruction.
In this case, it is more flexible to concatenate different components rather than passing circuit or register object around, and there is no need to pass the register with hard-coded name, etc.
When all components are able to provide the instruction, the algorithm is in charge of combining each instruction and align the registers at the highest-level rather than asking each component to concatenate and guess which register is using.
There has been an ongoing change with the circuits, that now support lazy construction. And several components/circuits have been moved over to a circuit library. I no longer think this specific issue is needed any more so am closing it.
