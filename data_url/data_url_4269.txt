Installing with python -m pip install --user projectq
And then running: https://github.com/vtomole/qchackers/blob/master/software/projectq/epr.py
Gives me:
On: Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
Do you have gcc and g++ installed? Could you send me a detailed output of the installation process?
Also, could you check if there is a .so-file in the installation dir projectq/backends/_sim/ ?
I used pip to install this; I didn't download the repo. Where do I find projectq/backends/_sim/?
To find out where it is installed, run python and then do
Yes. It's there
Okay, that means that your python version was compiled using gcc version < 5.1 or something like that (i.e., they are not compatible). I would download an older version of gcc right quick and re-run the installation after having uninstalled projectq.
What does python say when you run it? It should say which version of gcc was used.
Or are you using conda? In this case, try conda install libgcc as an alternative to installing an older version of gcc.
@thomashaener  conda update --all solved it. Thank you so much!
Great! Enjoy :-)
