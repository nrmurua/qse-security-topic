Currently, the test_parameter_operations integration test in the test_parameters_integration.py` file this is very hard to understand. It should be split up, and separated into many individual tests that ideally test one thing only. Furthermore, it doesn't make any assertions - these should also be added in to ensure that, not only does the test run without error, but it is also doing what it is supposed to do.
Another small note: in the original test suite, this test appears to work on the Gaussian backend, even though it never explicitly ignores non-Gaussian operations - something to double check.
In addition, the parameters unit tests need to be expanded, to verify more of the Parameter class functionality.
