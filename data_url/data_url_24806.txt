Travis CI is a continuous integration tool for github projects, performing tests on each push to ensure that code is working as intended. It should be used by our project and must configured accordingly.

The configuration of .travis.yml is not good yet and the tests need to return the correct exit code for success or failure. Maybe something like this:
