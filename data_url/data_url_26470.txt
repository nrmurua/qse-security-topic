Hi,
I just compiled version 2023.1 with libxc 6.0.0 and I'm getting this error at start up.
It's failing on this assert:

As far as I can tell it's happening because CP2K is getting an empty name from libxc:

Any clues on what might be happening?

Apparently, you compiled LibXC yourself because the current toolchain has a patch. Alternatively, you may switch to LibXC 6.1.0.
Yeah, I'm updating Spack's recipe for CP2K 2023.1. Sorry I missed that!
I can confirm it works fine with the patch.
