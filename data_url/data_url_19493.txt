This follows what was discussed in #98 and in one of our previous calls. The idea is to have a mechanism in Circuit that merges all gates (up to two-qubits) that act in two specific qubits before applying them to the state vector. This generalizes the VariationalLayer and should work automatically for any circuit without the user specifying the gates to be merged explicitly (like in the VariationalLayer).
The method is described in section II.F.2 of the TFQ paper. Based on the benchmarks for the VariationalLayer this will speed-up many circuits, particularly variational ones.
