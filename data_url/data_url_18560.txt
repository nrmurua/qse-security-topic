There seems to be confusion between 'schedule' and 'scheduler' throughout sources and doc. They seem to be used interchangeably, which seems confusing. Is a "schedule" the same as a "scheduleR"?
For example, consider the following code snippet in src/compressor/compressor.lisp:
The variable lschedule and the comment refer to a "schedule", but (make-lscheduler) refers to a "scheduleR", and it creates an instance of logical-scheduler, i.e., scheduler with an R.
This sort of confusion seems pervasive throughout the system. A review and cleanup of the two usages may be worthwhile.
In case this helps, here are two grep commands I found useful to find 'scheduler' (with the R) as opposed to 'schedule' (without the R), from the root of the repo:
This actually led to a bug (which has now been fixed) where, when SAFETY was sufficiently low, SBCL wasn't checking that a class slot type was a valid type. At some point somebody had written logical-schedule as a slot type, which doesn't exist, because it (the type) is called logical-scheduler.
