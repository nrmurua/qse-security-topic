Hi,
I think you write a wrong import or the files Qconfig_IBMQ_* are not at the same directory as the file you have.
For the latter case, please place the files Qconfig_IBMQ_experience at the same directory as your notebook/program file.
And, with IBMQ module, you do not need to import Qconfig files anymore. For the new way of using account, please refer to the tutorial below:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/jupyter/jupyter_backend_tools.ipynb
Here is the more detailed tutorial that shows how to use the IBMQ credentials:

I am closing this issue, but feel free to reopen it if you still encounter similar problems.
