Providing any PassManager to the execute method will throw an exception as it fails the _check_conflicting_arguments call - this method fails if a backend (a required argument) is provided.
This should not throw an exception since there are no conflicts here.
Remove backend from the list of arguments checked for conflicts. Or, alternatively, deprecate the use of the pass_manager argument (it is currently unusable anyway) to encourage users to use PassManager.run() and assemble instead.
Can I help with this?
I think it is, indeed, a bug. I will remove backend as conflicting.
it is currently unusable anyway.
I'm curious. Why?

Only because of this bug preventing any attempt to use the pass_manager option
In that case, fixed!
