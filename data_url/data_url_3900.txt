The tutorials expect a <program-name>.qasm file to be written to the output directory. Apparently that's not true anymore; now it writes a few differently named qasm files for the various passes. This is IMO a breaking change. Why doesn't it just output the final qasm file after all passes with the original naming?
@razvnane I'm assuming this is due to the modularization changes? Is this a permanent thing (i.e. docs should be updated) or should the code be fixed?
