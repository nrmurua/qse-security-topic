We need a proper way to explicitly specify timings in our circuits. For the moment we have a workaround that is a bit dirty.
We should also discuss how to specify parallelism.
Postponed until after October 1st deadline.
This get's resolved by a proper implementation of #19
This is a proposed implementation which would be based on #19 .
@AdriaanRol Timing can now be specified using wait gate. This can be easily extended to properly implement #19, but IMHO this is not a show stopper at the moment. This current implementation should help you reduce the number of instructions you use to hack the wait. To keep it consistent with the other gates, the following syntax is supported:
The feature is currently available on feat/timing-specification branch. test_wait.py documents the use. All tests passing.
This has been merged with develop
