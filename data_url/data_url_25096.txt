The conjugation of past rounds is done with random single qubit rotations, intended to be in the X and Z axis. But QISKit uses X and Y. Not a huge issue, but it is inconsistent.
This does not affect current simulated data for IBM devices, since that was done using the ProjectQ implementation. It does affect the real runs, though. Probably not noticeably, but they should be rerun anyway.
Upon reflection, it has been decided that the Y rotations are better. ProjectQ and Forest have been changed accordingly. See commit 203258b.
Still to do before the issue can be fully closed:
