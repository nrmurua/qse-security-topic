Build an interactive and up-to-date Jupyter Notebook tutorial for QRAND v1.0.0
The tutorial should at least include:
This has to be targeted for v1.0.0 â†’ QiskitBitGenerator deprecated in favor of QuantumBitGenerator
Hello, I had few hours ago seen that this was a part of unitaryhack. Even though it is not a part of it now, can I still try this out with Qiskit? I am new to open source and I thought this task would be something I could start of with.
Hi @gprs1809!
I removed this issue from #unitaryHACK because I do not think we will be able to complete a full tutorial at this stage of development. However, feel free to try. Before the start of the hackathon I will be merging the new structure of QRAND to master. If you need any guide, we can chat via discord!
I will retag it.
Thanks!
@pedrorrivero I guess contributing to this issue will still be counted for Unitary Hack, right? 'cause it has the good first issue tag.

Sure @pedrorrivero, I will try
Hey @gprs1809 can we team up on this ?

Hey @pedrorrivero, I will continue to work on this. Thank you, for answering my question on Discord :). I have a couple of more questions: In qrng.py, there is a deprecation warning, should I still use that in the tutorial I will be creating? Also, I see that QuantumBitGenerator inherits UserBitGenerator from randomgen. I am reading about it, but are there more resources to understand it better?
Hi @gprs1809! Awesome! Let me get to your questions:
Also, instead of looking at the code inside the master branch, I would suggest looking at dev. That is the most up to date code you can find!
