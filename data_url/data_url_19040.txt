Describe the bug
The API for optimizer algorithms defined in our library takes as optional argument a dict where one can specify things such as the maximum number of function evaluations or algorithm iterations. In the current implementation, the tensorflow optimizers treat maxfun like maxiter and this creates inconsistencies when comparing/benchmarking these algorithms.
