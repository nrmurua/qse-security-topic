Do we want to support that or we should discontinue supporting that?
For the declarative approach, it will be unrealistic to support all kinds of noise setting.
We will support basic options for the declarative approach, like the noise model of the particular device, like ibmqx4. For advanced users, we already accept the customized noise_model in the programmatic API.
close it since we support device noise model in the declarative approach now. see the notebooks in qiskit-tutorials/community
