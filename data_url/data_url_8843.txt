It's kinda dumb that there's one file per shot in a batch. It makes us go close to system file handle limits (forcing number of samples in a batch to be lower than optimal).
While we're on the topic, the whole "write shot to disk" part of code could use refactoring. There need to be more convenient methods that work on entire shots, both transposed and untransposed in memory.
