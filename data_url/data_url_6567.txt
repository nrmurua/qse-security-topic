Need to put together a release process that allows cirq to upgrade independently of qsim
Our current strategy for this is to keep qsim pinned to a specific Cirq version in its requirements.txt file, and follow up after each Cirq release with any required qsim changes.
For other recent improvements to the release process, see PR #126
