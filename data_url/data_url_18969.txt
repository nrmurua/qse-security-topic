The c3_qasm_physics_simulator is now in pretty decent shape with increasing support for most of the native features of the c3 simulator and integrates seamlessly into workflows. The c3_qasm_perfect_simulator is no longer necessary, which was a stopgap solution while building the backend is no longer necessary and should be removed. Keeping it around leads to unmaintainable duplicated code. Instead, providing a dry_run option to the backend.run() call would be useful for the user to check that the code runs all fine, and everything has been correctly configured without having to perform the compute intensive full physics simulation. This dry_run path should have a complete API coverage with the standard interface and check as much of the code as possible without running the actual simulation.
How have you tried to resolve it in the current version of the code? Have you considered non c3-toolset alternative solutions? Please elaborate.
