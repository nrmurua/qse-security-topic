Hi Ben!
There are just two small bugs that I found in your sample code that you may want to change:
both are in Getting Started and both are just variable names being inconsistent, so not big.
First I believe
Should become
Similarly later
should become
Thanks for pointing this out -- that must have been left over from when I changed a lot of the syntax to be PEP compliant. Before I finish writing this whitepaper, I'm also going to change the way that agents get initialized to directly take a QStream instead of having to awkwardly use the shared_hilbert_space function every time.
Ah that's a good idea! Indeed it is a bit clunky to have to make the Hilbert space each time
These have been fixed in the latest commit
