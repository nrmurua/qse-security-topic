I'm trying to use fsim gates without success. Could you provide me with a circuit that uses fsim's to test the code? If we cannot make fsim works by today, I would simply drop fsim for the first release.
Working on this right now
#155 handles the qFlex half of this; Cirq half is in #154.
All tests pass now.
