For an initial state for which the elements of the density operator sum to 0 ode2es returns an empty list. Minimal example below
from qutip import *
H = sigmaz()
psi0 = (basis(2,0) - basis(2,1)).unit()
L = liouvillian(H, [])
es = ode2es(L, psi0)
To fix we need to change the checks in ode2es to be
if abs(rho0.full()).sum() < 1e-10 + 1e-24:
which then checks the sum of the absolute values rather than the absolute value of the sum
