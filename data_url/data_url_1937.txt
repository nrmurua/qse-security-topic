There is a method called this on Circuit. It would make sense to live on Moment and then the circuit method could dispatch to it
This sounds like a reasonable and simple improvement, though moment can be indexed with the qubit (moment[q] returns the operation on that qubit), isn't it superfluous to introduce operation_at?
Oh I didn't realize you could index into it like that. In any event, Circuit.operation_at should use that functionality
That is true, we could use moment[q] in Circuit.operation_at - just to clarify do you think it would be valuable to add operation_at to Moment as well as it might be more discoverable than the indexing?
I can't speak for everyone, but I would have found it if it was called operation_at :)
Hi, would it be possible for me to try and add operation_at to Moment? I might need to read the relevant codes first as I am not entirely familiar with them.
You got it! Thanks for volunteering!
ping @exAClior - are you looking at this? Thank you!

Yes, I finished adding the feature, but I need to add tests for that piece of code. I will update it tonight.
