Hi! I was looking at the example with the variational classifier (thanks for the useful tutorial!) and I found a line of code which looks wrong to me. In particular, the training set is defined in these lines:
https://github.com/Quantum-TII/qibo/blob/1d27fb2c49d5b7e992eee65f6994e7b60acdc7ee/examples/variational_classifier/main.py#L43-L45
while the test set is defined in these ones:
https://github.com/Quantum-TII/qibo/blob/1d27fb2c49d5b7e992eee65f6994e7b60acdc7ee/examples/variational_classifier/main.py#L79-L81
I think that data[49], data[99] and data[149] are not included in the slices in line 80, so data_test ends up with 42 elements while labels_test has 45 elements. The accuracy is computed with zip, which works anyway, but labels and predictors are not aligned anymore so the test accuracy (e.g. the 67% written in the corresponding README.md) is underestimated.
@mlazzarin thanks for reporting this issue.
@DiegoGM91 could you please confirm if the interpretation is correct?
@mlazzarin thanks for spotting this. We are happy to hear that you find the tutorials useful.
I think you are completely right, so I will open a PR to fix it @scarrazza.
