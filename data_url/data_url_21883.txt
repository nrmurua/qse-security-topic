It would be helpful to document:
IMHO, it's not worth documenting that a clock is required for Urkul
To a new user it may not be clear if clock is derived from DRTIO or external or from XO. Never hurts to reiterate frequency range and power.

Right. I'm not saying that it's a bad thing to document this -- in the same way that we should definitely document Kasli's power supply requirements properly at some point -- just that it's not a SU-servo issue, but rather a more general Urukul issue. IMO, the SU-servo documentation should say "these are the servo-specific settings, everything else is a standard Urukul setup." I don't consider fully documenting Urukul to be within the scope of the SU-servo project; it's a separate project.
That makes sense. Keep the SU-servo docs to the diffs.
