Currently we have several functions that crate benchmark circuits, i.e., circuits that can be used to test error mitigation techniques.
The existing functions are:
All current benchmarks are based on Clifford circuits. It would be nice to have a new function called e.g.:
generate_random_clifford_t_circuit().
The output should be a random non-Clifford circuit composed of Clifford gates (H, S, CNOT or CZ), and T gates.
Note: this issue is very similar to #1229 .   The main difference is the specific gate set and the possibility of controlling the number
of T gates.
If having all the three options is not practical, at least we should have the possibility of setting the number of T gates.
I would like to work on this issue.
This issue had no activity for 4 months, and will be closed in 2 weeks unless there is new activity. Cheers!
