Hi all,
I found the following problem when I tried to solve an optimization problem with the functions in this link https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/examples/Optimizers_in_TensorFlow_Probability
I found the error:
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.NotFoundError: Could not find valid device for node.
Node:{{node AddV2}}
I have seen that this may have something to do with the matmul procedure, but I do not know anymore. Do you have any idea why this is happening?
Could you please post or send to us the code you are using?
Sure, I am using a VQE-like program and the only new lines added are
These lines are included in the minimize function of the VQE
Do you want me to upload the whole code? I can do it in a new branch for instance
Could you please paste here your self.cost_function?
This is my self.cost_function. h are hamiltonians as defined in the VQE
Closing this issue as it is not related to the VQE in qibo.
