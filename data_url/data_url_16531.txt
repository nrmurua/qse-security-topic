#4509 implements a circuit.reverse_bits method for circuits. This can change from little-endian to big-endian and vice-versa.
We should have this for State and Operator too. Then we should have:
Operator(qc.reverse_bits()) == Operator(qc).reverse_bits().
I know these can be defined on qudits as well, so if the name is not appropriate then we I am open to other ones.
I think for operators and states this should be called reverse_qargs() and has the property of reversing the order of input and output subsystems
