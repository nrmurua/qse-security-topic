The live plot should complete without throwing an exception. In some cases, the threading exception is thrown before the rest of the sequence can be completed.
The exception thrown is:
Win 10
Master
Thanks for the report .
Can you elaborate a bit more on how you run this? Are you running the Tutorial from the jupyter notebook or copying it to a prompt?
Is it the syntax highlighting of the code that changes to black or the output of running the notebook?
Does this happen every time or randomly? I cannot reproduce it on my setup.
The output of conda list and pip list to see your installed packages would be useful too.
Thanks for the quick reply!
Some quick background: I was creating some scripts to run some qcodes for a measurement setup and this thread exception was thrown after live plots were completed (the code has no issues when live plotting is disabled). I then ran the tutorial live plot to determine if the live plotting feature was indeed the issue (testing the tutorial was recommended to me). To run the live plot tutorial, I copied the code into my text editor, saved to my local machine, and executed the code via anaconda environment prompt.
The output of the anaconda prompt window is normally black background and white text. When the threading exception is thrown immediately after a live plot is completed, the text changes to black as well so it cannot be seen on the anaconda prompt. I copy/paste the text into a text editor so I can read the error message (same as posted in my original report).
This happens every time I run live plots. The live plots work, then after completing a scan and closing, the exception is thrown.

one thing i noticed is that you have both pyqt5.6 and 5.9 installed likely from conda and pip respectively. We have previously seen that leading to odd behaviour similar to yours.
You can try creating a fresh env from the  environment.yml file in the root of the qcodes repository with conda env create -f environment.yml and install qcodes into that
Is there a way I can run qcodes without having both installed? I find that when only one is installed, I have a matplotlib issue. At the moment, I need both pyqt and pyqt5 to run qcodes.
Is there an advantage to creating a fresh environment within the root of the qcodes repository? I was intending to run qcodes at the measurement station using the anaconda prompt.
You cant have both installed. It's the really the same package so that is going to leave you with a broken mixture of both. QCodes should work fine with either. I suggest that you set up an environment with only conda packages as I suggest above and we then focus on resolving any issue you have in that
Looking at your lists you might also have matplotlib installed twice which may be the root cause for your isses
OK, thank you very much for the feedback. I will create a fresh environment with only conda packages and ensure none of them are doubled. I'm traveling abroad for 2 weeks so I may not follow up on this very much until I return.
I returned and installed a fresh environment being careful not to duplicate any packages and sticking with conda packages where possible. After running the live plotting, I receive the same threading exception as before. Here is conda list from the fresh environment:

There are still some odd looking duplicate packages could you try putting
in a file called env.yml and then creating an environment with
activate the env and only installing qcodes in that env with pip install qcodes and then run the notebook from that env.
conda list for the env should be
I suspect that there is some incompatibility with one of the other packages that you have installed. Lets see if we can track it down
Thank you for the feedback! I followed exactly what you said and still receive the same threading exception even running the 1D loop example.

OK, so I have it working now. I thought running from cmd and jupyter would be 1:1 but apparently not (this is strange for me since I go back and forth, typically). By staying only within Jupyter there are no threading exceptions. What is the reason for the exception to only appear in cmd?
can you try
and let me know the result
by the look of your traceback the function picks the wrong branch in cprint.py
No, I am saying it does work in jupyter but not from cmd.
The reason I am worried about running from jupyter, is that if I have a hybrid control, I will issue commands to the system via cmd and live plotting could have an issue. I'm starting with jupyter so there won't be any immediate issues.
Thank you very much! I will continue from here and stay within jupyter at least until my scripts are running measurements.
There should be no difference between running it from the jupyter notebook or otherwise. By cmd I assume that you mean Ipython or regular python launch from a cmd window as cmd in it self is a windows batch script interpreter and not a python one
Ok I can reproduce it now. I misunderstood your original description. I thought you copied it to an interactive session. If I put it in a script and run the script I can reproduce it
OK, at least this means I am running something similar to your setup. Thank you for looking into this. I will keep progressing from here and run within jupyter.
It's a bug in pyqtgraph and specifically the remote process plotting that we are using. This is known to be flaky and we are planning to replace it as soon as possible.
The warning can be fixed by inserting
Just before the line 76 in cprint.py but that does not really fix the issue it still prints black text on a white background and hangs the process
Oh interesting! I'll add this into cprint.py as a band-aid for now.
Note my last addition, it fixes the warning but not the real issue
Yes, noted. I want to avoid the warning for now if running through anaconda cmd. I'll still keep working with jupyter. Do you normally run all of your qcode work through jupyter?
Most of our users tend to use spyder https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/ at the moment
Spyder doesn't have this issue either
OK, do you recommend jupyter or spyder? I'm new to qcodes therefore I don't know of the pros/cons.
If you are familiar with Matlab or other ide like envs then something like spyder will feel very familiar. Here you will probably write code in scripts and execute it interactively.
The notebook allows you to write text mixed with code as a document so it's really a different style.
We have found that the ide interface is better for experimental code
Ah OK, that makes sense and I am familiar with ide like envs therefore I will give spyder a try. Thanks!
I am going to close the issue.
I don't think we should close the issue as it's not really resolved we merely found a work around
