We recently launched our native gates, and are looking to add support in ProjectQ.
Qiskit implementation: https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners/qiskit-ionq/blob/main/qiskit_ionq/ionq_gates.py
Cirq implementation: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-ionq/cirq_ionq/ionq_native_gates.py
We are considering sponsoring this for unitary hack if we can tag things appropriately :)
I would not mind helping, I don't know how to start though.
Hi,
Sorry for my late reply.
In order to support a new type of gate, you simply need to define a new class that derives from BasicGate. If you define the matrix property (or member function), then the simulator will know how to deal with it.
Have a look at the definitions for X, Rx for example (can be found in projectq/ops/_gates.py
