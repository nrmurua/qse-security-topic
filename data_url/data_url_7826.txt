qutip mesolve gives me different population evolve depending on that initial state is state vector or density matrix. And, in some situation, it gives me negative population. It doesn't make sense...
Does anyone encounter this problem?
Population evolvement with State vector as initial state

Pupulation evolvement with Density matrix as initial state

Here is my code: I'm just producing Rabi oscillation by applying microwave whose frequency is the difference between eigenenery［1］ and eigenenergy［0］.
It looks like your parameters are a bit challenging for the ODE solver (the Rabi frequency Omega is much much smaller than the energy splitting omega).   If you change the ODE tolerances using options you will find it gives the expected result, e.g., something like:
If you use a ket instead of a density operator mesolve() will pass the problem to sesolve(), which I guess for some reason is more robust in this case.
It is a little annoying it is just failing silently.  I am curious if you tried in v5?
It gives me correct result when I change the ODE tolerances as you mentioned, in mesolve(). Thank you so much.
I tried in v4.7.3, now, after I upgrade it to v5, still same result as v4.7.3.
Now I can try my original calculation, your suggestion should work then.
Thanks.

yes, I agree....
