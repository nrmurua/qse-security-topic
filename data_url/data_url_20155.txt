I'd support this proposal from Basil Hess and solicit further feedback to the below from @dstebila , @xvzcf :
Using kyber-upstream is now indeed a simple task thanks to what you already prepared.
I really like the copy_from_pqclean mechanism. The META.yml definitions are obviously a pqclean-"invention", but they are a nice way to make an easy path for integrating also other implementations/libraries. Perhaps it could be renamed to copy_from_upstream.
I'm slightly updating the script with the following features. Please let me know if anything doesn't make sense here:
That all sounds good to me!
Same here.
I like the "verify" idea. Does liboqs maintain any patches on upstream code? If so then verify needs to apply those patches before the comparison.
If there are not any patches on upstream, and we intend to have a "verify" option that does not apply patches, then I'll have to take a different approach to silencing false positives in #881.

For all the things imported via copy_from_pqclean, no, we do not add any patches.  (Things directly imported, like SIKE, Picnic, FrodoKEM, do make patches before being added.)
I also thought about adding the possibility to apply patches before the comparison, if necessary. But if there is an alternative this might be cleaner.
For now the updated copy_from_pqclean script is on this branch https://github.com/bhess/liboqs/tree/feat.copy_from_upstream
The script is renamed to copy_from_upstream to reflect that other upstream sources are possible.
For now pqcrystals-kyber and pqcrystals-dilithium are added as additional upstream sources to pqclean. They are defined in the copy_from_upstream.yml file like this (ideally the commits will be a tagged version):
copy_from_upstream has two options: "copy" and "verify":
Copy checks out the git-repos and copies the upstream-sources to the src/ folder. The implementation folders in src/kem and src/sig are prefixed with the upstream names.
Verify creates a temporary folder and copies the upstream-sources there. It then does a diff of each implementation-folder with the corresponding ones in src/.
For example, if saber_avx2 differs from pqclean-upstream (just an example), it shows a follows:
I plan to open a PR for review later.
Closed via #883
