Application
The stitch function generates a BQM's penaltymodel by cascading thorough Cache, LP, MIP, and finally, MaxGap.
Proposed Solution
Make problems of varying "difficulty" so that we can observe that the proper penaltymodels are catching said problems. (Ex. LP should be able to catch an OR-gate, but not an XOR-gate. XOR-gate needs auxiliary variables and LP does not handle that, therefore the problem should be passed to MIP.)
As of version penaltymodel 1.0.0 penaltymodel only has one factory that uses SciPy.
