Kernel occasionally hangs indefinitely when reading from Urukul CPLD
This experiment should either return after execution or cause an underflow error.
I can reproduce this. Initializing the CPLD (cpld.init()) prevents it. I'd have to look at what part of init() is needed exactly.
This is an RTIOBusy error triggered triggered by the io_update pulse nudging colliding with whatever the RTIO fine timestamp was before starting the experiment. The cpld.init() heals it by doing some nudging on its own.
It is arguably enabled and obfuscated by the problem that would be addressed by #1237.
