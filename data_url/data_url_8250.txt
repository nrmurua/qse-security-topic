I want to install qutip on the linux (ubuntu 18.04 LTS), but I got the following issue. I wonder whether anyone has encountered this problem before.
No, we usually have no problem on linux. How did you install it? pip, python setup.py install? Did you have a prior installation? Some time, if you install qutip without openmp but installed it previously with openmp there are errors.
Thanks, i think that is an openmp issue.
Finally, here is the temporal solution for those who might have the same issue.
My bug report is
There is no src/zspmv_openmp.hpp in that folder, i.e. /home/abc/.pyxbld/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7/pyrex/qutip/cy/openmp/.
One can download this folder and put this src folder into the target folder /home/abc/.pyxbld/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7/pyrex/qutip/cy/openmp/.
This file is now correctly distributed in the 4.6 sdist release (see #1449), though do note that people who want to use OpenMP will probably have an easier time of it if they are installing from the latest git source.
