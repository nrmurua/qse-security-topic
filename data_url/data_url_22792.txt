Noticed this with the recent fix of the calc_current_using_line_voltage,  _Smj will always return true, need > 0 to get it to correctly print "(-)" when appropriate.
Currently:

Should change to something like:
f'\t{j_name:<15} {pmj_ind:>8.6g}{("(+)"if _Smj > 0 else "(-)"):>5s}        {pmj_cap:>8.6g}') 
👏👏👏 You are awesome! Thank you for making your first issue to pyEPR ' first issue
