Locally executing make docs in a conda environment on a freshly installed development version of mitiq (make install),  prompts debugging warning or freeze at the build of documentation.
I think this might be a duplicate of #1826

Refer to andrea's comment here for disabling validation in a user's device.
Might need to update the docs for how to enable PYDEVD_DISABLE_FILE_VALIDATION=1 in make docs if the user wishes to disable the warnings.
Not able to reproduce at this time using rm -rf docs/build && make docs. Maybe we no longer need PYDEVD_DISABLE_FILE_VALIDATION=1 either?
Ahhh okay this seems to be a python 3.11 performance improvement (using frozen modules). Some more information can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75114841/
