Individual part problem upload should be retried 2 times in case the upload fails due to any unhandled exception (e.g. SAPI returns 502 Bad Gateway during overload). This is achieved with the retried decorator.

The problem is not all arguments are immutable. part_stream (uploaded part data binary stream) should always be at the beginning.
We can either always rewind the part_stream, or instead to pass in an immutable "chunk/part stream factory".
