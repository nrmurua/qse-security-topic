#What is the expected enhancement?
Unrolling a controlled gate constructed via .control method with the parameter ctrl_state might result in very long circuits. Take the following example:
Let unroll it:
The expected result is the same as when ctrl_state is implicit:
I tried to reproduce this as:
The result is the expected with current main. Therefore, closing as fixed.
