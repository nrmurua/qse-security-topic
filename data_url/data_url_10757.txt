Description
There are no install instructions in the code so there is no install target for make.
Environment:
Hi @yurivict , there are instructions for using cmake to run the tests. Otherwise this is intended to be used a header only library.
@arcondello  Header-only libraries should also be installed. Packages are created for them and then used to build other packages.
The include folder contents should probably be installed into include/minorminer.
Yuri,
The person who wrote the CMake files is no longer a contributor to this repo, and that's not my area of expertise.  If you're able to contribute an installation recipe, I'll be willing to maintain it.
Ok, I will submit a PR for this.
