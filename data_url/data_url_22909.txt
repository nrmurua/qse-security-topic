Hi!
I spent a whole day - actually more, but could not resolve the problem (but believe there is no hardware limitation for that),
is there some simple approach to get on-trigger signal acquisition using PyRPL bypassing GUI etc.?
Just like it should work in the scope widget but get the waveform directly to the python to work with it further.
Thanks in advance
Best regards
