I got an exception on two different machines, but I'm not sure if it's related to qiskit-terra or python itself. The exception arise when I invoke the job.result() method.
File "/home/simone/LinuxData/virtualenvs/qiskit_env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/qiskit/providers/aer/aerjob.py", line 39, in _wrapper
return func(self, *args, **kwargs)
File "/home/simone/LinuxData/virtualenvs/qiskit_env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/qiskit/providers/aer/aerjob.py", line 98, in result
return self._future.result(timeout=timeout)
File "/usr/lib64/python3.7/concurrent/futures/_base.py", line 432, in result
return self.__get_result()
File "/usr/lib64/python3.7/concurrent/futures/_base.py", line 384, in __get_result
raise self._exception
concurrent.futures.process.BrokenProcessPool: A process in the process pool was terminated abruptly while the future was running or pending.
I found other similar issue which suggested to use the if __name__ == "__main__": statement, but this is already there: the whole program code is under this statement.
The problem appears randomly when I run my qiskit program. It's a huge project, and sometimes the program works seamlessly, while others fail with this message.
The program should always run without problems.
I'm closing this issue and opening it in the Aer repository: Qiskit/qiskit-aer#6
