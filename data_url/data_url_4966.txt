Hi, I try to run the tutorial_example.c in the example folder using GPU, but I got an wrong answer.
EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT:
Running locally on one node with GPU
Number of ranks is 1
OpenMP disabled
Circuit output:
Probability amplitude of |111>: 0
Probability of qubit 2 being in state 1: 1
Qubit 0 was measured in state 1
Qubit 2 collapsed to 1 with probability 1
It seems to be wrong , because the correct answer should be the answer that the MULTITHREADED mode generates:
Circuit output:
Probability amplitude of |111>: 0.112422
Probability of qubit 2 being in state 1: 0.749178
Qubit 0 was measured in state 0
Qubit 2 collapsed to 1 with probability 0.717714
Can anyone tell me how I can get the correct answer using GPU mode? By the way, the code I use is the latest released version 3.1.1. Thanks!
