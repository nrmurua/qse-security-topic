Out[8] in https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx/blob/master/demos/gettingstarted.ipynb shows compare_tensors returning False, when I think it should be True.
It returns True for me? The cell looks like this for me:
Do you have that as well?
Is this fine now? Can I close the issue?
I also get "True" on a fresh install of pyzx
My Code:
However, the result is False. Isn't it weird?
The problem is that extract_circuit expects the diagram to be in graph-like form (only Z-spiders, all spiders fused). If it isn't then its output is just wrong. I thought extract_circuit was doing this normalisation step itself, but apparently it doesn't. I can imagine this is quite confusing, so I should probably just add this preprocessing to extract_circuit
Closing this, as you made a new issue #84
