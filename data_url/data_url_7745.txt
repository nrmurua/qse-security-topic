Hello.
I just successfully installed qumib but getting the following error after running the example codes mentioned in quimb:
Code:
import quimb as qu
import quimb.tensor as qtn
import numpy as np
L = 44
zeros = '0' * ((L - 2) // 3)
binary = zeros + '1' + zeros + '1' + zeros
print('psi0:', f"|{binary}>")
psi0 = qtn.MPS_computational_state(binary)
psi0.show()  # prints ascii representation of state
H = qtn.ham1d_heis(L)
Error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
AttributeError: module 'quimb.tensor' has no attribute 'ham_heis'
I really appreciate any help.
Thanks
Ah yes there is a missing underscore it should be ham_1d_heis - https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/quimb.tensor.tensor_gen.html?highlight=ham_1d_heis#quimb.tensor.tensor_gen.ham_1d_heis. Docs need to be updated.
Thanks for the reply.
I changed it to ham_1d_heis. Still getting the same error
Are you on the most recent version from github?
yes
Actually, there is no function called "ham_1d_heis" in tensor_gen.py produced in my quimb folder.
This is my quimb version:
(cotengra) (base) user@amst4:~$ pip show quimb
Name: quimb
Version: 1.3.0+368.g9c26756

I can't recreate with a fresh install from github: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UAcO8pQUIU_kuHDuXXImSSojewRDL-Td?usp=sharing.
My hunch would be that the installation has somehow broken (can happen quite easily) - try uninstalling including manually deleting the quimb folder from your site-packages and re-installing.
Ok. Thank you. I will do that and update this comment.
Thank again
Thank you the problem solved after reinstalling quimb.
Hi,
I have installed quimb on my system via Anaconda 3 (python-3.7).
All quimb dependencies have been installed, as well.
I am trying to test quimb to draw a tensor tree by running the defined code:
from quimb import *
import quimb.tensor as qtn
Lx = Ly = Lz = 4
D = 2
tn = qtn.TN3D_rand(Lx, Ly, Lz, D=D)
tn.add_tag('CUBE')
color = ['CUBE'] + [
f'I{i},{j},{k}'
for i in (0, Lx - 1)
for j in (0, Ly - 1)
for k in (0, Lz - 1)
]
but I get the error:
AttributeError: module 'quimb.tensor' has no attribute 'TN3D_rand'
Could you please help me to resolve this problem?
By the way, whenever I add line:
%config InlineBackend.figure_formats = ['svg']
my python does not recognize it.
Hi @HamidArianZad, please consider opening a separate issue if the fix in this one (i.e. a fresh install from github) does not work for you.
By the way, whenever I add line:
%config InlineBackend.figure_formats = ['svg']
This is just for jupyter notebooks (the format the docs are largely written in).
