Hello,
I followed the instructions on how to install the tutorials for qiskit v0.7.2.
Before creating a virtual env with conda I updated the environment.yaml file to look like this:
After that I created the env and everything looked successful but this line
To put it in context, the final lines of the conda env create -f environment.yml output are
So, even though it looks like the build failed, it is reported as successfully installed
If I try to import qiskit after activating the env, it works
And running the Hello Zero code also works (with warnings).
Any idea why the installation would be successful while reporting Failed to build qiskit?
Thank you.
I had the same problem. It was so confusing. I spent like one hour trying to figure out how to solve the problem only to find that everything worked fine later.
I had an additional problem. A python package called sympy could not be updated by pip.
The problem was solved by updating it using conda:
conda update sympy
After updating sympy, I could install qiskit and used it without problems. But the "failed to build qiskit" showed up during the installation.
See Qiskit/qiskit#1641
Still that does not answer my question.
The Failed to build qiskit message seems to be there for multiple users even when using clean environments correctly. And the message does not directly relate to a failed installation, as I can use qiskit just fine now.
It is not a problem, for me, right now. But I would say it has to be solved for users trying to install and use qiskit.
The release note of 0.7.2 says that
During installation, failing building the qiskit wheel is expected. This is intended.
