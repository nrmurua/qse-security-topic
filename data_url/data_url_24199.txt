Don't know how, but this commit shows the difference.
Expect Ansys to give same results.

The shot below shows the comparison of the results after running the south korea hackathon tutorial.  The differences are shown a little clearer here.  On the left is the output after the first run, the on the right is the output after the second run.

The first few passes won't be too useful.  Line 8 above is where we should focus, they clearly converge.  These numbers are "close enough".
