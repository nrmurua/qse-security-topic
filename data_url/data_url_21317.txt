That's not Sayma, the code clearly doesn't format the exception message.
The reason this isn't done is because Rust's format! facility does not support providing a format string at runtime. I could do something like .replace("{0}", args[0].to_string(), but that will miss valid cases like {0:#p} and result in an even more obscure message.
