Dear John,
I really appreciated your introduction to the framework of the method to_clifford_normal_form_grap
It indeed works and brings to the normal forms introduced in your article.
Stil the properties of the normal form hold only in the ZX-calculus form,
whilst when attempting to extract a corresponding circuit, this can lose its normal form.
As an example I tried with
rn.seed(6), qubits = 8, depth = 50
and extract_circuit either with optimize_cnots set to 0 or 3.
The output is something slightly different from the normal form.
You can see an exemplary picture below, obtained by setting the parameters as follows:
zx.extract_circuit(g, optimize_czs=True, optimize_cnots=3, up_to_perm=True)
