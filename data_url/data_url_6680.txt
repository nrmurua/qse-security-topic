Hi, brief question: does Liquid.CSMat "sparsify" the matrix if given a dense CMat? Or does it keep explicit entries for all the zeroes?

Yes. It will remove all entries sufficiently close to zero as defined by Complex.Tol (complex tolerance, which is settable). The default value is 1.0e-18.  In addition it will sort the row and column values (which is required for the other sparse routines to work). This also happens after every sparse matrix multiply.
