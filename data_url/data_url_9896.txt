ConstrainedQuadraticModel.add_variable(v, vartype) vs QuadraticModel.add_variable(vartype, [v]). IMO we should switch the CQM version to match the QM with a deprecation period. Something like
Additional Context
The other obvious comparable is BinaryQuadraticModel.add_variable([v]). In that case the vartype is implicit to the model.
While we're at it, we should officially support None as an option for ConstrainedQuadraticModel.add_variable()
