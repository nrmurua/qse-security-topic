#2736 added a QuantumCircuit.layout property and sets it with the layout determined during transpile. With the current naming, it is ambiguous as to where this property is generated, and whether or not it is user set-able. (e.g. demo code #2781 sets circuit.layout but this would be ignored if that circuit was passed to transpile.)
We should add some documentation to the layout property, and consider making it read-only. We should also consider moving it to a location that better describes it's origin and purpose: e.g. circuit.transpile_history.layout = { 'layout': Layout(...), 'source': 'DenseLayout'}
ok can we call this circuit._layout and update the drawers to read from this field? It will remain private until a stable API is decided on. The user interacts with it through drawing.
circuit.layout ->circuit._layout in 576c243 PR #2781 In PR #2928
Need to modify the plot_circuit_layout routine as well.
