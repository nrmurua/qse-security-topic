1st bug: ASG outputs signal during setup, i.e. some artifact/fraction of a sine. This is a consequence of the way that setup_attributes are written before _setup is called. A proper setup would turn off the output, setup the properties, and then setup the output. So question: Should we add a _before_setup() function slot that disables the output before doing anything else?
2nd bug: the code of the _setup function is full of bullshit activity in my opinion, and I do not remember how it got there. Any reason for this? Otherwise Ill clean it.
@SamuelDeleglise any comments on this?
cleaned this up, working fine
