At the moment, creating the initial set of tensors (while reading the circuit) has a comparable time with the actual contraction for large circuits:
We should definitely improve that part.
See #265.
With the improvements in #265, loading time has been reduced from ~11s --> ~3s. This improvement is mainly given by avoiding the creation/copy of temporary objects:
