We should consider putting some logic in to handle this case.
Other numpy objects are also not serializable, for instance np.int8. This can be problematic if you provide advanced parameters like anneal schedule or x_initial_states that were built with numpy types. Consider expanding this issue to all types?
So, @arcondello, you were referring to numpy bools passed as values for params to solver (keyword arguments to Solver.sample_*)?
