See #461 for some context. Thoughts, @dabacon?
I like this idea a lot. We need to think about how to make it clear that "run" will barf on post-selection.
No! Even better! Run accepts post-selection, but the number of repetitions that comes out is mysteriously smaller.
Ooops, I changed the previous discussion to this.
