I ran the test03_Hartman6 test on the SNOBFIT implementation within the test_snobfit.py file with a number of required points per iteration of 1 and no initial points given. This causes in issue with line 331 in snobfit.py when calling snob5.py.
Run test03_Hartman6 with options = optset(maxmp=1):
I get the following error:
_snob5.py returns a one-dimensional array if nreq=1 and no initial points are given.
Change line 73 in _snob5.py from x5 = xnew[0,:] to x5 = [xnew[0,:]]
Fixed in repo in a slightly different way.
Thanks!
