Hello,
I am an Associate Professor at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and the creator/developer/maintainer of several GNU packages which can be found here:
https://www.gnu.org/software/archimedes/
http://www.nano-archimedes.com/
https://www.gnu.org/software/gneuralnetwork/
In particular, nano-archimedes is a simulator for the quantum transport of electrons based on the signed particle formulation of quantum mechanics (which I came up with a few years ago). A paper on this formulation can be found here:
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999115003708
It turned out that this formulation is computationally very advantageous (compared to other formulations). As a matter of fact I have been able, for example, to use it to simulate systems of indistinguishable Fermions on relatively small computing systems (actually a single-CPU computer):

I also used this formulation to depict a quantum system exploiting interacting electrons which can solve a system of linear equations reformulated in terms of an optimization problem:

Many other papers can be found here:

Since, as far as I understood, the flux qbits used on D-WAVE systems can be considered as one-dimensional devices, it would be useful/interesting to solve the sub-QUBO problems by means of a simulated system by means of the signed particle formulation. For example, for relatively small sub-QUBO problems, one could embed nano-archimedes into qbsolv and solve these problems by means of a simulated set of one-dimensional electrons. This could bring to a more realistic simulation of the whole optimiziation process. What do you guys think?
I hope, somehow, this suggestion helps. I look forward to hear your opinion.
Thanks,
JM Sellier
Hi everyone,
I was wondering if anyone has something to say on the comment above. I personally think it is not a bad idea and I would like to give it a try. But before I do anything, I really would like to know what you D-wave guys think about it.
Thanks!
JM
