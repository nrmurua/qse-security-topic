I'm trying to follow this tutorial with the current version of qutip, but ran into a bug in mesolve.
If I do from qutip import * at the start of the notebook, the following error occurs:
If I do import qutip as qt, a different error occurs:
This notebook
No response
Evolve the system without incurring any error.
No response
@haoyudoingthings It looks from your error messages that they are caused not by the import cells, but by later cells, and are the result of having modified the notebook. For example, H = qt.qobj_list_evaluate(h_t, tau, args) is a modified line from cell 13 of the original notebook.
I would suggest starting again from the original notebook and continuing from there.
Some of the notebooks are out of date. We're setting up automated tests to correct that as part of this year's Google Summer of Code, but that has only just started so it might be a few months before we have everything set up.
I'm closing this for now, but please feel free to update the issue if you encounter more problems.
@hodgestar
This notebook is not in qutip-notebooks, but in jrjohansson/qutip-lectures (which does not have a license...)
Are you also looking at does with GSoC?

@Ericgig Yes -- we've asked Robert's permission to import his lectures into qutip-tutorials (qutip/qutip-tutorials#14).
