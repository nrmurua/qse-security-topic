note: quantum optics doesn't solve at discrete time steps ... it solves it using non-discrete time steps, then interpolates the values using a DiffEq solver. So if we input a "noise vector of values" we'd have to interpolate to those values.
test: input sine function, and see if interpolation is good (vs stopping at each timestep).
