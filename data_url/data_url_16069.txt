As parameters now have a defined order in parameterized circuits, see #5759, the explicit sorting in algorithms that take parameterized circuits, such as vqe and the variational base class, to present these in a known, defined order to a classical optimizer, should be removed.
Is this a bug in current Qiskit about the order of the initial_point in VariationalAlgorithm such as VQE?
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/algorithms/variational_algorithm.py#L107
@ikkoham calling QuantumCircuit.parameters returns sorted list of parameters now.
This issue suggests that explicit sorting can be removed, e.g. instead of https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/algorithms/variational_algorithm.py#L107
you can only have self._ansatz_params = ansatz.parameters.
@molar-volume Thanks. I understood the issue.
But, isn't the current state until sort is removed creating a bug? So I suggested to label the bug to this issue.
If you do not put ParameterVector in the mix, then the sorting provided in QuantumCircuit is same as https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/algorithms/variational_algorithm.py#L107
So if there is a bug now, this issue would not solve it.
I hope I am not misleading you.
@Cryoris can you confirm please?
There's no bug right now. The point is that VQE used to manually sort the parameters, which is now not necessary anymore, so we want to remove that manual sorting.
Now there's a small problem: If we use the ordering provided by circuits, it differs from the manual sorting VQE did. That means that hardcoded initial_states will produce different results. I don't see a way around that though.
Thanks @molar-volume!
@molar-volume @Cryoris My only concern is the order of initial_point in VQE. If there are no bug, it's ok. Thank you so much.
@Cryoris @ikkoham maybe this can be solved with initial_point being dictionary (used in bind_parameters for circuits or operators)
I don't think there are any left, so I'll close this issue ðŸ™‚
