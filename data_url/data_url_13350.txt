Currently mitiq.benchmarks contains RB and mirror circuits, and needs more benchmark circuits.
GHZ circuits provide natural scaling with the number of qubits, are structured (in contrast to random as with RB and mirror circuits), and have additional nice features for benchmarking error mitigation:
GHZ circuits were used in https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09197 as a benchmark, see Fig. 2(c) - (d). Also see this paper (page 3, left column, 3rd paragraph) for a nice discussion of expected results for assumed (but realistic) error models with local/non-local observables.
Thoughts or objections @andreamari?
No objections.
GHZ circuits are interesting since, as you said, are very non-random and very empty.
+1 for GHZ.
Can I take a crack at this?
Hi @Rahul-Mistri, could you come to the Mitiq community call to discuss more? It's today (as every Friday) at 6pm CET/9am PT on the Unitary Fund Discord.
@nathanshammah definitely!

Thanks @Rahul-Mistri, it's all yours!
You can check out 
The simplest function should look something like
You may wish to take the quantum computer topology (as a networkx graph similar to the mirror circuits benchmark function) into account, but I think the above implementation is sufficient for now.
@allcontributors please add @Rahul-Mistri for tests and code
@andreamari
I've put up a pull request to add @Rahul-Mistri! ðŸŽ‰
