For example, in #320 a docs test failed because "1.-0.j" changed to "1.+0.j".
A simple first pass might be to just create a way to canonicalize these minor variations before doing the comparison. Like a regex replace list.
A more complicated approach would be to segment the text into numbers, then do approximate comparisons on the numbers while comparing the strings.
Fixed by #410
