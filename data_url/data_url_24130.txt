@ray Parker was using non default chip name and could not create a gds file as desired.
add_qgeometry needs to have to updated chip name and layer number.  If the chip and layer number have not been added, then use the latest values from options, not the default.
Conversation in Slack #metal.
As an afterthought, I think there should also be a check for the chip name existing with design.chips.  If the chip information is not there for that chip name, need to give an error.
I added an error for the pull request.
