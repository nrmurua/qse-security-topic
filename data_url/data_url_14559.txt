Instruction.validate_parameter is called by the Instruction.params setter (and elsewhere) to allow Instruction subclasses to define custom validation logic for their parameter types (e.g. https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/deebd5cce63601f5a6bb4aa762baedd9cb4876b3/qiskit/circuit/delay.py#L69 ). However, validate_parameter is applied once for every argument in params, so if one wanted to have parameters of different types, e.g. a List[float, str], one would have to either:
Two possible suggestions for implementation:
Can I have a go at this?
Sure thing @TheGupta2012 ! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
So from what I saw understand, here:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/f59a1fd4bca6c92683d9487c94db10e6c730ebfd/qiskit/circuit/instruction.py#L217
if a kwarg index would have been introduced, then the validate_parameter that the user overrides would handle the cases that you had mentioned correctly. Something like :
But then again, won't this have to be handled majorly on the user side? Because even if the user-defined validator is executed with the index argument, the function would need definition from the user. Or maybe I am missing something?
