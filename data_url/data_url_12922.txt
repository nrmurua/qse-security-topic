The test case in branch msoeken/gray-synth-segfault in e5e049c leads to a segmentation fault.
I wonder what the best behaviour for this case should be. Should we assert the the input is not empty, or, as you seem to assume, simply return a network without any gates.
I think we should simply return an empty network with as many qubits as requested by the first argument. This method could be used in some other algorithm, so the case in which there is no parity term can occur in corner cases.
