For example, if a too big upload size is requested (during multipart upload initialize), SAPI responds with:
but the exception raised is HTTPError('400 Client Error: Bad Request ...').
The expected behavior in this case is to fail with ProblemUploadError("The proposed upload is bigger than ...") or similar.
