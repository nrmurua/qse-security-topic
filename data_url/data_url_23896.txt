For example:
we count as 1 measurement, but
we count as 2 measurements. The num_measurements calculation should probably be done on a per channel basis. Then we have the new problem of choosing a value when the number of measurements is not uniform over the set of channels, but requires more infrastructure to solve.

Note that Diego mentioned one more case to fix in #83.
