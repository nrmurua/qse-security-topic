The numeric value of floats is not rounded off, as it should be by the following line: param = get_param_str(op, "mpl", ndigits=3). This occurs only for bound Parameters.
The following code

This circuit without parameter binding

The number of digits seems to be rounded to 3 as indicated in the code link, but clearly it's being set somewhere else (in the working example) and not at all (in the bound Parameter example). Thanks @nkanazawa1989 for looking into it.
is this also a bug?

@poig The text drawer doesn't support latex, that only works for the matplotlib drawer. Try for example
I think the bigger thing here is that bind_parameters creates a new circuit.  It's not in place.  But the issue is getting a bit distracted from Nick's original point.
The bug is probably that bound parameters are still Parameter instances, just with no symbols present.  It probably gets treated by the symbolic printer, rather than getting converted to a float and passed to the float printer.  This type of thing has (unfortunately) come up a whole bunch historically, and it's quite the wart.  I'm still hoping that our greater look at how compile-time and run-time parameters in Qiskit will iron out some of these.  Thanks for the report.
