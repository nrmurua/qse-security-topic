Something I just ran into in the docs - when we use a noise channel in a simulator does this occur per gate, or per qubit per moment?
I can't seem to find this anywhere, perhaps it should be added to the docs in a few places, as it's pretty relevant.
Yes I agree this is very unclear.  Different noise models handle this noise differently, they basically transform the moments by adding extra noise operations.  These can depend on what is in the moment, for example.  So you could have a noise model that depends on which two qubit gate was executed.
Aaaand reading over the code I just realised how this is implemented and that it is well-documented.
Nevermind my stupidity.
