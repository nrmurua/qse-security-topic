Scikit-image 0.17 was released with some non-backwards compatible changes to peak_local_max (scikit-image/scikit-image#4501). The qtt tests are broken, and probably the functionality as well.
@QFer @sldesnoo-Delft
The unit tests that used peak_local_max result didn't take into account that the order of peak_local_max is not defined. The same peaks were found but were returned in a different order in the new version. Adjusted test in #741
