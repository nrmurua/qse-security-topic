Should be able to come back to a circuit later, or on another machine.
Current idea is to just have an auto-updating anchor element that always points to the "current" circuit, so saving is just a matter of bookmarking. Most of the code is already done, but it was de-activated by the ES6 rewriting noise.
The editor now updates the address bar's URL to always point at the current circuit, injects a history transition when moving away from the initial circuit, and updates the title with a pseudo-hash of the circuit contents. The save system is the browser's bookmark button.
