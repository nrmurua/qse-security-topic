This should at least be optional; I have one use case in which one would like to keep empty moments: when preparing a circuit with swap gates for qcircuit so that they look like crossed lines, if there's something other than another swap immediately after then the next moment should be kept clear.
(In a previous iteration of this idea, I was using an invisible DummyGate for this purpose , but now I think it's cleaner to avoid that if possible.)
