Trying to start code with inexistent version, like OPENQASM 10.1; does not throw an error and appears to default to 2.0. This can be misleading if user expects, for example, 3.0 to be live.
In Qiskit code, create QASM string starting with OPENQASM 10.0; and create a circuit with circuit = QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str(qasm_string). The code does not error with incorrect OPENQASM version.
If inexistent/unavailable version of QASM is requested, the code at least throws a warning or, preferably, an error.
Throw an error/warning when cannot find requested QASM version.
This is valid
It's funny, there is code in Terra to note such a mistake:
but it's never invoked anywhere.
The fastest way to get this fixed @3yakuya is to fix it yourself and PR it :)
