Our tutorial page (cirq/docs/tutorial.md) is empty. It might be nice to add some tutorials that shows how to use cirq end-to-end using some non-trivial circuits or algorithms, a step up from hello_qubit.
(Capturing discussion from 4/11 meeting) some ideas discussed:
Scott Aaronson's CHP simulator has these examples listed:
I think the epr, ghz, simon, densecoding, qecc, and rand (but smaller) examples are good ideas.
The paper Quantum Algorithm Implementations for Beginners was published just this week and is very relevant.
[...] We survey 20 different quantum algorithms, attempting to describe each in a succinct and self-contained fashion; we show how they are implemented on IBM's quantum computer; and in each case we discuss the results of the implementation with respect to differences of the simulator and the actual hardware runs.
Suggestion: everyone who picks up an algorithm to implement creates an issue for it (to exclude double work).
For the tutorial I think we want to come across as something that is "more advanced".   Sort of in the spirit of how every tutorial for a web app framework is "build a blog in under and hour".  I will take on the task for the tutorial, thinking of doing a simple variational algorithm.
