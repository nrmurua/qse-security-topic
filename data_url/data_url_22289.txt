Using 1.2 on Windows, we have the following script,
We generated the vcd file following the instructions in the manual. Viewing the VCD file on GTKWave, the pulses from TTL0 show up as 40*us long instead of 50us. We're using an external clock of 100*MHz, so our ref_clk period for the core device is 1.25ns instead of 1ns, which is probably the cause of the discrepancy.
I've attached a zip file with the VCD file.
