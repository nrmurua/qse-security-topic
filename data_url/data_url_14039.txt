If you supply a Qubit to the QGL2 compiler where the qgl2main wants a QRegister, it should complain or convert it.  Currently it appears to work until trying to run the compiled program.
It ends up with something created using Qubit() which is a new thing, not the one from the ChannelLibrary you want
If QGL2 recognized it had been given a real qubit, could it use it as is, rather than trying to create a new one? IE, could we make it work if you pass a real qubit?
