Intermediate representations like QASM have creg c0[1]; to initialize classical registers and measure q[0] -> c0[0]; for assigning measurement results to classical memory. Are there equivalent procedures in Cirq?
My understanding is that there was a conscious design decision to not support this because current hardware can't do intermediate measurements.
@bryano is correct. We don't know what the limitations of feedforward will actually be, so for now we've avoided codifying it. The closest thing we have to any kind of classical processing at the moment is the invert-result mask on measurement gates.

Related #3231.
@vtomole I think all the work in classical controls means this can be closed.
