I started from a fresh Xubuntu install to get a demo up and running at the JQI, and followed instructions in doc/manual/installing.rst (@1d052095ee5143255922319a32110a1dd00f45ec) using conda. At the point I go to flash the pipistrello, the bash script errors at line 136. Two comments:
Hopefully it's easy to include xc3sprog in the conda package to make this workflow easy! Otherwise a hint in the install documentation would be useful... For a while I was convinced it was a problem with the USB device not being seen in my virtualbox image.
Hi, thanks for reporting these issues :)
I just fixed the first one in 813a2a2
The conda packages for linux-32 and linux-64 have been generated and uploaded to binstar.
About xc3sprog, @sbourdeauducq : do we package it in a separate conda pkg which will be a dependency of the artiq pkg? Or do I just put a link in the manual pointing to where we explain how to build it from source?
Not sure if we should bother too much with xc3sprog - it is shipped with many linux distributions, and replaced later. Making it clear that it should be installed separately is enough.
Ack
