I've been running an algorithm for the last couple weeks and keep getting a 'RemoteDisconnected' error. The linked issue claims that the main cause of the issue is the large batch size. Through the logger I've confirmed that my posts are only 1 at a time, and the total size is less than 105KB (~1KiB). After reading through the other issues linked I'm unsure if they would help either, nor exactly how to implement them.
Is the connection error simply something that must be solved by fast, stable internet?

Extending read timeout after we implement #440 would be worth trying in cases of low bandwidth and/or high latency. We'll have that available soon for you to try (if you don't mind installing from source on master).
