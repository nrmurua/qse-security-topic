The hellinger_fidelity works by comparing key values of a dictionary for looking if two computational basis states are the same.  With the introduction of quasi_dists in the runtime, this means that one needs to work in integers, and older code written for bit-strings gives 0.0 as the return if one is not careful.  Although one can do quasi_dist.binary_probabilities() (or represent the target state as ints, it would we nice if internally all of this was handled for the user.
