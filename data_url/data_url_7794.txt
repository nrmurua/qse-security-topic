It seems that tqdm is required to run a few tests in tests/test_tensor/test_tensor_tebd.py. This dependency is properly listed in deps\requirements-py3.yml, however it is not listed in setup.py. So I guess that you should either add tqdm in extra_requires/test in setup.py, or update the testsuite to skip tests requiring tqdm.

Thanks for noticing this! tqdm is a pretty light (and useful) dependency so I've just decided to add it to setup.py.
