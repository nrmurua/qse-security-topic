Version Info
Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here.
I think this issue be in repo: https://github.com/Happy-Diode/GraphTensorNetworks.jl ?
Also, can you please show the complete error message and the output of Pkg.status()?
It is because CUDA.jl also exported context function , while CUDA is a conditional dependency.
Thanks for finding this bug, it should be fixed in the latest GraphTensorNetworks@v0.2.4
