The API documentation (https://cloud.dwavesys.com/qubist/downloads/09-1007A-B_SAPI_REST_WS_Developer_Guide.pdf) is not clear on this point, but only active qubits should have bias values set/sent (for inactive qubits, user must send NaN in the lin list of biases, of course only for existing qubits). Similarly, in the list of couplings quad, only active couplings should be specified.
So, the lin should be of length N (where N is number of working qubits <= 2048 on D-Wave 2 system). Inactive qubits are encoded as NaN, active as 64-bit floating point number.
The quad list should contain coupling strengths for all existing couplings between all active qubits.
