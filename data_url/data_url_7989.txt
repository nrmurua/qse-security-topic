Printing a QobjEvo does not show any useful information:
It should show at least the dims, shape,  type, superop if a super operator.
isconstant and num_elements properties could also be interesting.
Similarly none of the Coefficient have a __repr__:
Hello, I am interested in this issue. Can I be assigned?
Definetely! We suggest though that you try to tackle only the __repr__ for QobjEvo in a single PR. We are looking forward to your contribution!
Sure thing, I have started working on it!
I was able to show dims, shape and type for QobjEvo.
I am unable to understand from where to get superop, isconstant and num_elements.
Hi @lklivingstone superop is indeed not an attribute, but you should be able to get the information necessary from the attribute superrep. The other two, isconstant and num_elements are attributes  in the latest branch. We recently update the master branch with the new pre alpha version of qutip. I hope this helps!
The two attributes were in the code, but I failed to find them. Thank you for the help!
I am getting the following output now, Kindly let me know if the formatting is correct.
I would suggest to change the | for , and also add a space after type and others, for example: type = oper. This is so that the fomating resembles that of Qobj. Nevertherless, feel free to open a Pull Request as giving feedback there is usually more conveninent.
Thanks for your effort! I am looking forward to your contribution ðŸ˜„ .
@AGaliciaMartinez I have created a Draft PR but I have some doubts on some things. Kindly check #2111 for more details. Thank you!
