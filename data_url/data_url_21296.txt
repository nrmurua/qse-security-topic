Currently in the HDF5 results, there are get() datasets in the "archive" group and set() datasets in the "datasets" group. This is a bit confusing and doesn't seem necessary since we assume/warn/enforce that get and set datsets share a namespace and an entry is never both.
Merge the groups. The browser already builds a merged namespace of the two groups.
I also find this very confusing.
@hartytp @jordens  Are there code bases that heavily rely on the datasets/archive split? If so, what's the use case?
Merging the two sets would also nicely simplify the code in master.worker_db.
@airwoodix @dpn is a better person to ask than me (I typically only interact with HDF5 results via tooling he wrote so am not really conscious of its internal structure).
I think it's only browser and maybe the experiment load-from-hdf that would look at it. As I said. I don't think it's necessary. It's a remnant from before #1171
