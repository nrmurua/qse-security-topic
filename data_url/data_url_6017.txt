When running current version of pulse simulator in master in a jupyter notebook nothing happens - execution seems to halt/stall at qiskit.tools.parallel_map. All unit tests work however.
Run the simulation portion of either pulse simulator tutorial notebook located here.
@vvilpas  This issue seems to have been introduced in the "Pulse sim initial refactor" commit (91840b4) - the problem is present in that commit but not in the one immediately before.
Edit: Also, I'm using the current terra master.
Execution seems to hang exactly at line 122 in parallel.py, when the parallel execution is supposed to begin.
