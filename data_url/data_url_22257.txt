Analogon to the frequency output TTL channel.
For O(1) counting with gateware support ignoring timestamp data.
This could well use either an IOSERDES to sample at 1 GHz and then count edges or (on CC pins)

The former would be closer to the existing phy but would be limited to <=8*f_RTIO_coarse/2 ~ 500 MHz the latter would be restricted to CC pins but could count up to 1 GHz. Also all the current LVDS pin drivers are < 500 MHz toggle rate.
Maybe even faster with undersampling.
/cc @npisenti
#1244 implements this, albeit only at the RTIO clock rate.
Thanks for cleaning up the old issues!
Adding short pulse support to the edge counter (the timestamper supports short pulses since a while) would be a nice little project as well.
I know that some pmt pulse in the 10ns range.
