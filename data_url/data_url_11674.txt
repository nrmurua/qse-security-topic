Currently, the IsingToQuadraticProgram converter in qiskit.optimization.converters is translating all single qubit terms to the qp.objective.linear and all two qubit terms to qp.objective.quadratic. This may cause problems since the resulting objective matrix in the quadratic program has a zero-diagonal and might not be positive semi definite, i.e., the problem is considered non-convex by CPLEX, even if the original problem was convex.
Since we consider only binary variables when converting from an Ising Hamiltonian, and $x^2 = x$ for $x \in {0, 1}$, we can also write the linear part on the diagonal of the quadratic part.
Both options have their pros and cons, but the latter seems to be more robust as a default in our tests.
It should be an option to be set in the constructor of the converter (linear = False) whether the linear part is used or not.
I got it. I will make linear option for the IsingToQuadraticProgram converter.
