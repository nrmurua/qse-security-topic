When using a with statement with multiple items, the behavior is incorrect.
The first two nested with statements should be semantically equivalent to the last with statement with two items.
Therefore, the printed results should also be the same (two times a 0).
Exit functions are called incorrectly:
Reverted due to #1547.
We should also have regression tests for all these things...
I am not sure if a fix is planned, but an alternative could be to throw a compiler exception when using a with statement with multiple contexts, basically not supporting the syntax. That will at least prevent silent incorrect behaviour. Unfortunately I am not familiar enough with the ARTIQ compiler at this moment to propose a coded solution myself.
