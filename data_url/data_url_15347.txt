generating preset pass manager for ibmq_qasm_simulator fails
It shouldn't throw an error.
No response
Same issue with AerSimulator backend. I think that the code should be able to handle being passed a simulator. Of course optimization is not as important with a simulator, but just having it be handled would be a nice convenience.
With BasicAer you still get an error, but it's different.
