The documentation indicates that there may be some subtlety about rho being vectorized. However, it is not clear how to then handle input with tensor product structure such that propagator doesn't fail with a ValueError.
In my given input, vectorization of rho is not taken into account. However the documentation could use clarification how input must be provided to avoid this error.

I see from #1585 that this issue is fixed in version 4.6.3. Sorry and thanks!
No worries -- glad we already fixed this.
