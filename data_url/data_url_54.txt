We currently only test our python API on the simulator that is set within each individual test (most use the default). We should extend this to run across the same targets that our C++ suite runs on. This will require sorting out issues wherein certain tests have hard-coded count values that we assert against. E.g
The actual count values will have minor variations across backends, so a new strategy will be needed to either better generalize these asserts, or to have different checks per backend.
