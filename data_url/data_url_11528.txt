Given a simulator backend that can accept a seed, wrapping it in a QuantumInstance and giving it a seed_simulator value still gives non-deterministic results.
Running this several times gives output like the following:
The output when running via the QuantumInstance should match that of direct execution, giving the same result for the given seed deterministically.
More investigation is needed to see why passing the seed through QuantumInstance.assemble to incorporate it into the qobj is not enough.
That's actually a bug only occuring for the seed 0, since in the QuantumInstance it says:
when instead it should say
If you change the seed to something nonzero it works ðŸ™‚
