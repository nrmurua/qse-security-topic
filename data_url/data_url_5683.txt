Under AerBackend.run, input circuits get their metadata edited in place.
ouputs:
(*) This is the behavior on a freshly initialized environment. The behavior seems somewhat erratic nonetheless if the kernel in my jupyter notebook is not restarted, occasionally preserving the metadata intact.
Metadata should not be edited in place (i.e. by reference).
Make a copy of the metadata before handling it.
@pedrorrivero Thanks for your reporting this. #1717 will resolve this issue. All of metadata will be backed up before simulation and restored after simulation without modification:

#1717 can not resolve this issue. I would like to add another fix for this.
#1772 fixed this issue.
