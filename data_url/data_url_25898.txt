We need to add a test in the GitHub workflow to check that the image runs before pushing it to ECR. I imagine this will go in publish_master.yml.
The test should start the container using the method specified in Getting Started:
https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/blob/master/doc/source/getting_started/index.rst?plain=1#L48
And then do some very simple dispatch example.
Some ideas on how to do this properly are on Stackoverflow:

The original attempt to do this was https://gitlab.com/agnostiq/nimbus/-/merge_requests/72
Some of that might be able to be reused

I think I've found the source of the Docker issues.
With UI and dispatcher running on separate services, they can't run in the same container.
We'll need to either combine them into one service or package 2 different images, one for dispatcher and one for UI.
Building 2 different images will likely require API enhancements.
