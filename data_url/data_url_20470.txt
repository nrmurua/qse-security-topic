I see two memory leaks present in the current code. To setup reproduction:
Modify sshd_config to listen on 22222. Start server:
kex_ecdh_dec_key_group allocates new memory and saves a reference in *shared_secretp. The function is called twice:
sshbuf_putb does not free ecdh_shared_secret, even if fully consumed. Hence, memory leaks at function exit.
Trace with valgrind
EC_KEY_new_by_curve_name returns a pointer to newly allocated memory, referenced by ecdh_client_key. On the error path, ownership of the memory referenced by ecdh_client_key is not transferred to the caller kex and therefore leaks when exiting the function.
Impose deliberate error to trace error path
