As some backends like ibmq_16_melbourne, qasm_simulator and  ... dont have a default setting, I am getting this:
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'buffer'
IBMQ.load_accounts()
backend_name = 'ibmq_16_melbourne'
backend = IBMQ.get_backend(backend_name)
device = pulse.DeviceSpecification.create_from(backend) - > throws
to handle the AttributeError case in case backend has no backend.defaults()
in qiskit/pulse/channels/device_specification.py:
try except clause has to either be expanded to cover AttributeError in the outer try clause or some other idea...
try:
backend_default = backend.defaults()
buffer = backend_default.buffer
except ModelValidationError:
try:
buffer = backend_config.defaults.get('buffer', 0)
except AttributeError:
buffer = 0
except AttributeError: - I added this
buffer = 0
Thank you for reporting this.  Since those backends do not support pulse they do not have that attribute.  This pulse support should be checked and an error thrown when DeviceSpecification is called.
If this hasn't been fixed yet do you mind if I take this one?
Following along the idea of @nonhermitian would it be sufficient to add
to the factory method device_specification.create_from(cls, backend) before the try block that concerns buffer?
Yes that would be very helpful @eggerdj. I cannot assign directly as you are not currently a member of the qiskit organization. I think the approach you suggest is good.
Great. I suppose I should join the qiskit organization.
Closing as #2586 has been merged.
