The code like this:
looks somewhat fugly, because it seems strange that one has to specify the canonical ordering even if it's the same as the order in which the qubits were added during the construction.
The reason for that is that internally, qubits() returns a set with no ordering (moments within a circuit are stored as a sequence, but qubits within a moment aren't).
A way to fix that would be to either store the order in which the qubits were added and use that as the default, or to store the qubits within a moment as a list as well.
(It's also not clear why the qubits within the moment are stored as a set, but the moments within the circuit are stored as a list).
Agree it isn't quite where we want it.
Some notes: making it related to the order in which you apply the gates is also kind of strange.
Our plan for this was in #167 where we use the string of the qubit name (modified to make numerical strings order correctly), or you pass in a function that takes keys to a string for ordering, or you pass in qubits.  I think the default will make things pretty good for most of the qubits people will use (for example the qubits from the devices all have nice names).  Thoughts?
