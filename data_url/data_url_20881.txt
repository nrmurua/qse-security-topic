As a consequence of #69, we need an incremental hash API: if we do not have the sm buffer available, we cannot keep the message in place and prefix it with other values as input to a hash function.
This means maintaining a slightly more complex state. In particular, for SHAKE, we need to be careful to not allow mixing of absorbs and squeezes. Block-level incremental squeezing is significantly easier, but insufficient (as that would put the burden of byte-wise increments on the scheme implementer).
