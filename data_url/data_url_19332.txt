Now that more people are starting to learn and use Qibo, I think it is time to rethink/rework how we approach the initial documentation and the tutorials that ease a new user to the way Qibo works.
I will start compiling some ideas below, but I would like to encourage participation on this issue by everyone that has any feedback. This includes developers, but more importantly new users less familiar with the code.
Hopefully some of the proposals (and more to come) are useful, and that together with extra comments from users we can fully flesh out the Qibo documentation.
I'm not sure this is an issue for the external public, but, internally,I guess most people tend to use the dev version while the documentation is written towards the stable version. This leads to some discrepancies sometimes.
