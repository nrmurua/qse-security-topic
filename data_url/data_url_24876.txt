If the bug manifests in unexpected behavior (as opposed to a crash), confirm that you have consulted the
API documentation
When constructing a split-junction transmon from explicit circuit elements (not using the pre-made class), no external flux variables are created. Thus, flux biasing the transmon is impossible.
Expected one external flux variable to be able to bias the split-junction transmon.
Here's the code I use to create the transmon:
I tried this both with a floating and with a grounded transmon and received the same result. When I replace one junction with an inductor with $E_L = E_J$, I get the expected external flux variable, but not the expected eigenspectrum. I was hoping I could just define this using only junctions and a capacitor, to avoid making extra nodes, but perhaps that is just not possible?
EDIT: I guess I'm not sure if this is a bug, it's just not what I expected. What's the correct work-around?
Also do you want me to keep posting issues to get help figuring out scQubits or is there a discord/slack/somethingelse channel?
I can confirm that issue, and we are looking into a bug fix.
There's a temporary workaround: switch the order of nodes in one of the two JJ branches:
EDIT: The workaround for the YAML definition did work to get me the external fluxes I wanted, thank you.
Updated to latest version and offset charges are appearing correctly now, too.
This issue has been addressed with 1dab4f1 and released with v3.0.2.
