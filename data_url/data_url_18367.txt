There is currently no way to define a gate based off of a sequence of other gates. Let's prototype syntax and semantics for something like this:
Parameters could also be specified. The AS GATE-SEQUENCE is just a suggestion. Perhaps AS GATES instead?
The point of this feature is to define a gate, and not to define a circuit. While the compiler might decide to expand the given gates, it doesn't need to, and can treat it completely opaquely.
There are a couple questions that arise in implementing such a feature:
Note: This would require a change to the Quil spec.
Note: For prototyping, the syntax is pretty close to AS PAULI-SUM in terms of the declaration, and so that code path may be able to be used.
