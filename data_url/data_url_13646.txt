In the digital ZNE paper we use the following names and notation:
What about we make everything consistent with the notation of the ZNE paper? This would mainly correspond to minor changes to the docs and to the mitiq paper. At the level of code, the only function which would be renamed is global_folding --> circuit_folding. The current functions fold_gate_from_something are already consistent.

Can we still edit the digital ZNE paper?
I actually prefer local/global folding as opposed to gate/circuit folding. Local is more precise I think since we're folding gates in each.
I saw this a bit late after our paper submission. I'm supportive of the update @andreamari suggests
