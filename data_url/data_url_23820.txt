Upon instantiating my instrument I get an error
command:
Wines("Wines", server_name='')
Error is posted below.
When I run the same command again, it suddenly works.
I have the feeling that qcodes tries to connect to the new instrument server before it is fully instantiated. I guess some timeout needs to be set, such that the first connect is allowed to take a little bit of time.
in server.py
Else I would not know what the problem is, anyone else experiencing the same problem?
error traceback:
I pretty sure I have seen this before.
I still find myself restarting the kernel often when something doesn't work out well..
I never looked into this though.
@alexcjohnson
The error I'm getting right now, might be related to this, I actually get this often.
Something is empty...?
@damazter does Wines put anything on the server that would make it take a long time to start up? I can't see any problem with putting a query into the queue while (or even before) the server starts up... but if it's just taking a long time and timing out, #144 should fix it.
I cannot reproduce the error on #144
The init of the wines instrument is very fast, so I think starting the server itself might take too long on my slow computer.
Can we close this issue now that #144 is merged?
@damazter ?
