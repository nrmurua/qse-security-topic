The DDS panel is blank on the dashboard as if I don't have any dds when connecting to urukul. There is no error message.
I use the following device_db.py to connect to urukul. I'm not sure if I write it wrong.
I guess I should see the frequency of each urukul dds channel, like other device.
A blank DDS panel shows up without error message.
The DDS panel is simply not supported for Urukul; just for the old NIST AD9914 (?) DDSes. Since this is quite a frequent question, I guess we should just make sure the DDS panel is hidden by default if there are no DDS MonInj channels.
