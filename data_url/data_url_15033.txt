but at the same time qiskit.primitives.Estimator take options as keyword.
Please do something!

Just look at this
Inconsistency
keep consistency
There is an issue against Qiskit Aer Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1787 to have it be consistent with the primitives here and the IBM Qiskit Runtime which, as you point out use options not run_options, which Aer is still using.
As there is already an issue against Aer to make the interface consistent I am going to close this here since its not needed.
