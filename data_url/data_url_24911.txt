The disorder term in the FullZeroPi Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian. The disorder term should be
\sum_{l,l'} (g_{l,l'} | l \rangle \langle l'| a + h.c.). However, the implementation is instead \sum_{l,l'} g_{l,l'} | l \rangle \langle l'| (a + a^\dag).
If dC=0, the current implementation is fine, but in general, when dC!=0, this should be fixed.

Fixed with ea57413 and 90ca57d .
