Some Python tests in the repo (python/tests/backends) fail to execute unless executed with CUDAQ_DEFAULT_SIMULATOR=qpp-cpu. The failing tests report:
Note that the tests pass if run with CUDAQ_DEFAULT_SIMULATOR=qpp-cpu.
The tests should pass even if running on a machine with a GPU.
Yes, this is a regression. Last known working version is: b074f47
A workaround was provided above (run with environment variable), but this should still be fixed.
Also note that the cudaGetDevice(&dev) call in CuStateVecCircuitSimulator.cu should be wrapped in CUDA_ERROR as well, because while starting to look into this issue, I noticed that was the first call that was failing, but the error wasn't reported until a few lines later in the code.
Closed via #986
