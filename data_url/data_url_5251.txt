I noticed that some features of backend SimulatorMPI given in the HiQ documentation don't work.
For example:
engine.backend.get_expectation_value()  is missing, with error message:
cpuset: 0x00000003 nodeset: 0xf...f Traceback (most recent call last): File "/nfs/hiq/mpi/SOUT1564222561662", line 52, in  expectation=eng.backend.get_expectation_value(operator,qb_array) File "/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/HiQsimulator-0.0.1-py3.5-linux-x86_64.egg/hiq/projectq/backends/_sim return self._simulator.get_expectation_value(operator, AttributeError: 'hiq.projectq.backends._sim._cppsim_mpi.SimulatorMP' object has no attribute 'get_expectation_value'
while the same test code works correctly with ProjectQ backend simulator.
The function is indeed missing. I believe someone from us is already working on this and we will hopefully be able to address this soon.
Yes, this function has been implemented, and it will take a while to push the code.
