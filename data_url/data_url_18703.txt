Under certain bounded simplification assumptions (e.g.: all 2Q gates can represented using three CZs) as well as certain gateset assumptions (SWAP takes three CZs to represent), it becomes advantageous to schedule SWAPs onto link lines which already have 2Q gates on them, so that (at least) the 2Q gates preceding the SWAP become "free". This is not reflected in the current "stopwatch depth heuristic" that the addresser uses to select SWAPs. Refine this heuristic to take advantage of this.
I think this issue is easy for someone with surgical familiarity with the addresser and fairly hard otherwise.
