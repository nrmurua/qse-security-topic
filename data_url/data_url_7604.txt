Batched registers can be parallelized on the last dimension (batch dimension).
For CPU arrays, there is two options:
There are too many parallism schemes, a better question would be "what kind of problem do we expect to solve using parallism?".
To me, MPI support to parallelize the functions to get gradient (i.e. opdiff, opdiff and statdiff) is important to our goal "Quantum Software 2.0". This is also an achievable goal in Yao.jl 0.3.0.
By this consideration, I suggest to put the parallism on Blocks rather than Registers.
in dup with QuantumBFS/YaoArrayRegister.jl#19
It is implemented, but we need to wait for that bug fix...
