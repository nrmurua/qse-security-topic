To prepare for #291, we need a simple notebook that shows how to create:
Concentric Transmon (Qubit)
This notebook may already be done, if so please point me in the direction of it so I can verify it's what is needed.
Please put the notebook in the placeholder directory docs/tut for now.  You do not need to add the notebook to the docs, I will complete that step as part of #291.
Please ensure that one of the outputs is a zoomed in view of the component that can be used as an automatic screenshot in the docs.
