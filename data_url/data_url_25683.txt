Include in Covalent tutorials a version of the Pennylane variational classifier tutorial which is updated to dispatch computation using Covalent.
The tutorial should be a Jupyter notebook similar to the other tutorials in the tutorials folder linked above.
The example code in the Pennylane tutorial will need to be decorated using the Covalent SDK. For example the Cost function might look like
The tutorial should include execution using ct.dispatch() and how to retrieve and visualize results.

Hi @scottwn ,
I would like to work on this issue.
thanks @RamAIbot go for it!
Hi @scottwn ,
I am implementing a classifier for parity as like in the Pennylane. It runs fine but after completion, it shows completed in dashboard but it still runs in my notebook. How do I solve that?
Can you open a draft PR so I get look at the notebook and try to see where the problem might be?
Hi @scottwn ,
I have sent you a draft PR of my code for parity generator which gets stuck in result object even though the dashboard shows completed. Can you look into it and let me know?
@RamAIbot are you still facing the same optimizer type conflict error that we were looking at on Saturday? If so, can you post a comment here describing the problem?
Hi @scottwn,
Yes I’m still facing the issue. I’m trying to use a Nesterov optimiser from the penny lane library to perform the gradient descent optimization. I’m using the square loss function as the cost. But while training it shows that Nesterov optimiser is being treated as integer somewhere in the training function.

@RamAIbot the team discussed your issue and we think it's related to known issues with positional arguments. You may remember we discussed using keyword arguments in your trainer functions instead of positional arguments. Try that and let me know if it works.
I have finally solved the error. It's due to same issue which you have mentioned. Once after I applied the fix mentioned it worked.
