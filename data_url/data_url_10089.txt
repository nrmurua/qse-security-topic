returns 1000
looking at the samples, there is a single unique sample [1,1] as expected. Since we are asking for histogram mode, there should be a single entry for sample,energy,num_occurrences with num_occurrences = 1000, energy = -3.0 sample = {0:1,4:1}.
instead of
1000 x {num_occurrences = 1, energy = -3.0, sample = {0:1,4:1}
so above code block should return 1.
Just to confirm, this is a bug in dimod, since cloud client returns the correct result (one sample with num_occurrences = 1000).
