To unblock #321, I'm transferring the discussion about passes and pipelines here. My point is that we have already identified a need to improve how we handle/build pipelines.
Eric's (@schweitzpgi ) comment about it:
We could certainly make more/better use of prefabbed named pass pipelines. Certain collections of passes should be run together in certain orders.
The driver is the right place to build pipelines in general. That's a central "reason to exist" for a driver, which translates the combinatorics of command-line options into compiler actions. The runtime needs to assemble a pipeline as well because of late compilation, supporting Python, etc. Still using named pipelines and maybe a common "config" file could get us closer to a SPOT ideal. The early and late compilation steps aren't going to be completely identical because they're serving different purposes.
