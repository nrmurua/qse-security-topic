OpenQASM code blocks can be displayed with syntax-highlighting on GitHub:
For instance, the example from the root's README.md file:
However, the syntax highlighting matches the OpenQASM 2 grammar and isn't updated to the OpenQASM 3 grammar (return, def, bit, while are just a few examples).
The source of the current syntax highlighting is here:
It can be beneficial to update the grammar to support OpenQASM 3.
This suggestion relates to #272.
@jond01 ... Are you volunteering to write such a tool or tools (e.g., GitHub / LSP) .. great contribution to Qiskit!
If anyone's interested in taking this up, a lot of the logic and regexes should already be in the vim plugin, which might make it a bit easier.
This sort of tooling is something I'm super keen to get off the ground, I just don't have time to do it all myself.  Along a similar vein, it would also be great to get a grammar written for Pygments, so we can get syntax highlighting working correctly in the built Sphinx documentation.
In this case, the first step of the process is to get a new grammar file written (ideally that can support both OQ 2 and 3 simultaneously).  After that we can petition GitHub to vendor it in linguist to get web-level support for the syntax.
