One thing I've noticed is that it's a bit annoying to remember of "QubitLoc" is under "circuits" or "devices" or "ops". A solution to this problem is to flatten the whole library down to a single-level module in the way that numpy does: there's still some internal structure, but for the most part everything is just at the base level.
This would improve the learning curve significantly, I think.
Decided not to after discussion.
