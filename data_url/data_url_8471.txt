Hello, i discovered an error in the implementation of the QFT. Namely when i want to obtain the gate sequence. The is when tha code runs this
if swapping is True:
for i in range(N // 2):
qc.add_gate(r"SWAP", targets=[i], controls=[N - 1 - i, i])
it gives an error because the swap  gate needs two targets and it is only passing one.
Here is a test code
qft.qft_gate_sequence(N=2)
I solved the problem by changing
qc.add_gate(r"SWAP", targets=[i], controls=[N - 1 - i, i])
to
qc.add_gate(r"SWAP", targets=[N-i-1, i])
