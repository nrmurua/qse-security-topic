Currently labels only have an index (e.g. contrast ESR 0). It would be nice if this would become contrast ESR 39.65GHz.
I think this should only hold when multiple ESR frequencies are used
On second thought, I don't think this is such a good idea. If we sweep the frequency, the plotting label will only show the first frequency.
