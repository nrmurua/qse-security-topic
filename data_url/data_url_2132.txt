At some point it became harder to work with the typing of cirq.I, for example:
This is confusing behavior. Possibly related issues: #2517 #2515
EDIT: circuit.findall_operations_with_gate_type(cirq.IdentityGate) now behaves as expected  case as of #2515 but the better solution is to remove IdentityOperation entirely
The root cause here is a historical accident where we introduced IdentityOperation before IdentityGate. It can be fixed by adding a gate property to IdentityOperation that returns an IdentityGate instance. It can also be fixed by deleting IdentityOperation, which is strictly redundant at this point and so that's probably the better approach.
@MichaelBroughton brought up the same issue in person recently
Ah that makes sense; #2515 fixed the above but I agree that removing IdentityOperation is a better and simplifying solution
This has been deprecated. I think @Strilanc removes deprecated functions during a release so I'll close this.
