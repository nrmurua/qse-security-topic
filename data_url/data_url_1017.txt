Description of the issue
This is a highly typical pattern recently, which almost defeats the purpose of automerge and quite annoying -- as it fails after merging master into the branch!

--- I think the issue might be with the recency logic determining whether a PR was modified recently or not:
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/dev_tools/auto_merge.py#L784
The threshold is 30 seconds currently - we might have to raise that or find a better logic.
I think "recently modified" threshold should be moved to 30 minutes instead of 30 seconds - with our PR CI suite running for 20 mins, it is quite likely to have unfinished checks.
Confirmed locally that increasing the threshold works.
