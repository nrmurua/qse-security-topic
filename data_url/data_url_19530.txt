Hello,
I was trying to implement my own VQE (custom hamiltonian) as based on the vqe branch. I noticed that there is a sigma parameter passed to the abstract _build function, which from what I understand only makes sense for building a Heisenberg hamiltonian. Maybe consider having a _build signature of _build(self) and using internal variables, or _build(self, *args, **kwargs)?
As a side note, the master README already mentions VQEs, even though the PR hasn't been merged yet.
Cheers
@mikeevmm thanks, I have applied the fix in #17.
Requesting a reopening of this issue, or migration to a new one, as I have a follow up:
I have a function that takes some input and produces a hamiltonian as a numpy matrix:
based on a custom Hamiltonian object
This is producing a wall of errors (attached at the bottom), which I assume is coming from some malformed input, but I can't really understand what. I would suggest:
On that second point, I've noticed that currently the construction of the XXY hamiltonian is split between __init__ and _build. Maybe consider moving all logic into _build and make __init__ self-sufficient so that a custom implementation does not have to override both functions.
Finally, is there some documentation info on the options keyword argument for VQE.minimize?
Thanks.
