Hi, I recently published an article on Medium titled "How to Classify Encrypted Data using a Quantum Neural Network Model?". In the article I have used MNIST images and quantum circuits from the tutorial (differet digits and quantum circuits and not the exact same as the tutorial). So, I wanted to ask whether or not I have the permission to do that?
As long as you sufficiently attribute credit (i.e. cite properly) that is usually fine. When it comes to MNIST images, those aren't owned by Tensorflow. I don't know who owns them (they come from NIST so maybe the US government?) but they are so widely used that there should be no problems in using any MNIST images (with a citation of course).
