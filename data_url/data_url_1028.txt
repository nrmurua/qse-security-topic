IIUC, the size of the sphere could be radius 1, but will be various sizes on the screen depending on the distance of the camera. In the DOM, it's common to align on 'pixels' as the absolute unit of distance on the screen, and I think that makes sense for the radius here. WDYT?
Here is a case of someone trying to align pixels with the three.js world space.
@balopat  - do you have any preference whether this gets punted to a new issue vs completed now?

@balopat's response:
While theoretically correct to set the radius to be 1 (as it is mathematically!) - that only works in isolation. If the Bloch sphere will be combined with gates though in the 3D circuits, this geometrical correctness will get in the way.
I love the discourse experiment you linked - but still lives in a forum thread - taking that on will require designing it properly. Let's open an issue around this.
