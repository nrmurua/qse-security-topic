Issues in implementation order:
1 - chop only in one representation at a time
2 - make sure summand operator is not updated in additions
3 - set to None other representations when using add or chop functions in one representation
4 - initialize diagonal representation as sparse
Items 1 and 3 still need to be fixed.
