Hi
I am trying to get reproducible circuits from BQSKit for the same qiskit circuit but I keep getting circuits with different depths and gate counts. I have tried setting a seed using both seed_random_sources and SetRandomSeedPass but I am unable to reproduce the same results each time.
Is there any way I can achieve this using BQSKit?
This is what I am trying to run:
Thanks for the bug report. The SetRandomSeedPass should handle this as you would expect; however, it has been a while since we implemented it.
To try and understand what is going wrong, can you try setting the seed at the instantiation level by changing the associated line to the following:
If this works, there is a disconnect in the passes. Otherwise, something more serious is happening.
Thanks. I think this worked, the output is a more consistent that before.
I didn't get time to verify programatically if the circuits are identical. But it seems like they are.
I am glad to hear that this workaround works. Thanks for checking.
The original workflow you provided should have this expected behavior without setting the instantiate option; I will continue investigating and update here.
The problem is that the SetRandomSeedPass only runs on one dask worker. So with small jobs, everything is on one worker, and everything works as expected. However, with bigger jobs, only one worker has its seed set. To solve this, we need to tweak how we pass instantiation options between passes, which we had planned to do in the 1.1 update. For now, we have a workaround that works, and I will add a failing test in the 1.0.4 update to keep track of this in the future.
This should now be fixed in the 1.1-dev branch and soon the 1.1 update. However, I think we should go further and add a seed parameter to the bqskit.compile function.
