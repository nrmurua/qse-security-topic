I installed QRL on Ubuntu 16.04, running inside a docker container.
Wallet and slaves generation went fine but after moving slaves.json inside .qrl and running start_qrl I get the following:
[Errno -8] Servname not supported for ai_socktype
I'm running v0.61.2
Solved by adding "ntp 123/udp" to the /etc/services file
