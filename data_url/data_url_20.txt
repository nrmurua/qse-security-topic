CUDA Quantum currently finds some of its dependencies (cuQuantum, cuTensor) via the rpaths configured during build.
These paths are absolute, making the installation non-relocatable. As a consequence, installing pre-built binaries requires admin privileges to install the dependencies in global locations.
It would be nice if it was possible to install CUDA Quantum in a user directory without requiring building CUDA Quantum from source.
Specifically, the cuda_quantum_installer should take the installation location as argument. It would also be nice if the installer checked
the system pre-requisites before proceeding with the installation.
