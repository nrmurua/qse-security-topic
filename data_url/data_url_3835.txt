requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='qfe.nas.nasa.gov', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /sapi/problems/062013ca-8f32-499c-8498-dddd01398ca2/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x114771320>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 60] Operation timed out',))
To Reproduce
Just run several connections simultaneously or run a three hour simulation.
Expected behavior
Keep connected.

Additional context
In the Python 2 version SAPI2, I did not experience such a problem. This seems coming from Ocean Tool.
This looks like network issues on NASA site.
Can you try running the same program using D-Wave cloud API?
