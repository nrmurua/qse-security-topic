Related to the popcount gate ( #260 ).
I can implement an operation like x -> popcount(x), frequency(components) but it's not clear to me how to order the results. The frequency range depends on the number of states with a given popcount, which varies. Maybe just working correctly on the 0'th frequency is correct...?
This gate isn't feasible for Quirk because it takes so many ancilla that 16 qubits isn't enough workspace for useful cases.
