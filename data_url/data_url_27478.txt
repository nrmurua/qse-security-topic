How should this be configured from a user perspective?
The Keysight M3201A is capable of waveform level sample rate scaling, which could help optimising the number of data-points generated for some pulses, however this would mostly be hidden to the user (in PulseImplementations)
The safest option is to have a global sampling rate per channel so the user can specify the minimum time resolution needed in their PulseSequence, but this could lead to extremely large AWG waveforms. e.g.
A DCPulse for 1 s followed by a short SinePulse of duration 10 ns would require about 100 million points.
This has kind of been resolved by using a default sampling rate, per channel, which can be overriden by a specific sampling rate. This is the most appropriate solution.
