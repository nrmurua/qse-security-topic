When setting the MAGNETIZATION keyword I get:
For NUM_MAG_DIMS 2  as documented on the other hand:
with SIRIUS 7.2.7 and CP2K b48b44a.
This issue was also recently reported on the forum.
The solution for NUM_MAG_DIMS is 3 for full non colinear magnetism, NUM_MAG_DIMS = 1 for colinear magnetism and we can remove it for simple DFT.
MAGNETIZATION is a parameter that needs special care since it is used to polarize the initial density. Too high and things get completely imbalanced which lead to the reported error.
I also corrected the typo in the wiki page. NUM_MAG_DIMS should 3 for non colinear magnetism.

Ok, clear, but even with a "minimal" distortion of +/-0.5 which works for QE it crashes for SIRIUS.
unless it is research would it be possible to get the coordinates of the atoms.
After discussion with and investigation by @mtaillefumier and testing done by myself that the respective GTH pseudos work with magnetization enabled when converted to UPF beforehand it seems that there may be a bug in how CP2K sets things up for SIRIUS when using GTH pseudos.
The problem may come from the generation of the radial part of the pseudo-wave functions because CP2K set the radial part to zero when the magnetization is on. As @dev-zero said one workaround is to use upf files but I admit it is a temporary solution.
