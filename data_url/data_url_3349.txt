I tried building pyquil 2.32.2 on openSUSE on i586 microarchitecture. I suspect that this error is due to the limitation of 32-bit arch. The test pass for x86.
I use oython 3.8.5 and pytest-6.0.1.
Do the error indicate that this is the case?
Full error log here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/home:andythe_great/python-pyquil/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/i586
The build somehow pass now, not sure why.
