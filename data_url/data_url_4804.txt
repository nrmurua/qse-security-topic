Utilizing tensorflow-gpu v1.6 with strawberryfields-gpu sometimes results in unnormalised states.
The hardware is an Nvidia V100, but I've also reproduced it on an Nvidia K80.
Operating system:
ubuntu 16.04
Strawberry Fields version:
v0.9
Python version:
3.6.8
NumPy, SciPy, and Tensorflow versions:
numpy 1.15.1, scipy 1.1.0, tensor flow-gpu 1.6.0 and CUDA 9
Installation method:
pip
I can reproduce it, but the code is fairly long, definitely not a 'snippet'
I have tested 19 versions and builds of tensorflow. The bug appears on 1.6, 1.7 and 1.10, but I'll ignore 1.7 and 1.10 because in any case they're not supported by strawberryfields.
Thanks for the bug report @ziofil!
I'm hoping having it here might make it easier for us to track down the source of the bug.
Since we no longer support TF v1.6 with release 0.11, marking this as closed.
