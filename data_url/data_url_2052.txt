This bug appears to be due to the ignore_measurement_results, and not the noise.

I don't think it makes sense to call simulator.run when ignore_measurement_results has been set to True. We should just raise an exception in that case. Or, should we return the empty result?
If you start with an exception, you can relax it later if people clamor about it. It's hard to go the other way
At Cirq cynq we decided to make it raise an exception.
If I understand correctly this issue is simply adding this to _run and modifying the docstring:
@mpharrigan @kevinsung I don't think I was present for this discussion - can you confirm?
@Ashalynd are you planning to work on this?
Yes, that's correct.
@balopat I'm happy to contribute here
Thank you @akushnarov! It's all yours!
