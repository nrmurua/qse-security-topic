Describe the bug
I'm trying to get the spectrum of a qubit inside a cavity. For certain values of coupling it works, but for others not. I think this is a problem of tolerance for small numbers, i have set qutip.settings.auto_tidyup = False and  qutip.settings.atol = 1e-100.
To Reproduce
When it doesn't work it returns:
Expected behavior
The expecter behavior is the normal returns of the spectrum, as it happens with other values of coupling.
Your Environment
I think i found the origin of the problem, but i don't know how to fix it correctly. I noticed that in the essolve.py file (line 149) there is this instruction
which ( i think) should return zero eseries if the sum of all components is less than that value. However, if i increase the limit from 1e-10 to 1e-05 it work, that is it returns a zero eseries.
In the original case it doesn't enter into this if and than returns an es series which es.ampl[0] returns that error.
I replaced the return estidy(out) in line 205 of the same file with return out, and it seems to work!
More precisely the problem is on the tolerance of tidy. I modified lines 315-316 of eseries.py file with
and now (with return estidy(out) as in origin), it's working.
