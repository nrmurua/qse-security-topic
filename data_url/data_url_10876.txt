What is the expected outcome when running the examples (eg examples/1of5.qmasm) in qbsolv mode (classical solver, no DWave)? Could you add a couple of lines in the doc/readme about that (command line + output)?
I've tried something, but it seems it ends with an error (see below).
Disclaimer: it's my very first steps, and clumsiness on my side is highly probable (shame on me)...
BTW, I think it's a great project/tool; thanks a lot for sharing this contribution!
It looks like D-Wave changed qbsolv's output format since I last tested qmasm-qbsolv.  I just modified the way qmasm-qbsolv parses its output, which I believe fixes the problem.  Please re-open the issue if it it's still not working for you.
Thanks for the bug report!

P.S.  qmasm output should look pretty much the same whether or not --format=qbsolv is used, except that qbsolv returns only a single solution.  See the README.md file in the examples directory to get an idea of what that should look like.
