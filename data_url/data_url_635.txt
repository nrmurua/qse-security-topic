Problem is that currently xacc::error exit()'s the process, killing the jupyter kernel.
My thought here is that we could provide an is-py-api command line option, setup pyxacc.py to always initialize the framework with this option, and then in xacc::error() check if this is-py-api and throw a runtime_error if it is.
