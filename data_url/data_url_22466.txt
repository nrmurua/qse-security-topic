Using v1 prerelease candidate of artiq, installed via conda.  Trying to run artiq master -g causes a very long error, which starts with:
@whitequark Seems the problem is the pygit2 package is attempting to use the (incompatible) system libgit2 instead of the libgit2 from conda.
This is easy to reproduce on the build server (just import pygit2 from conda python).
Why on earth is pygit trying to compile stuff when it is imported?!
Probably another libgit2 in the mix. Either on your machine and getting noticed and built against by cffi on the fly or the one that I just uninstalled on the buildbot.
Should be fixed. @dleibrandt, please conda install pygit2 (or your usual artiq upgrade routine), verify that it installs 0.22.1-py35_3 and try again.
@whitequark , @sbourdeauducq I uninstalled libgit2-dev from lab. We might either have to dig deeper in the search order for headers and libraries and the recipe or keep it uninstalled.
Yep. It's the local presence of a system libgit2-dev that is problematic. @dleibrandt could you also uninstall that package if it exists?
That's wrong, the conda package should ignore the local libgit2-dev. If it doesn't it is broken.
Yes it is.
Should be fixed with libgit2 and pygit2 0.24.0 now. Could not reproduce it anymore even with system libgit2-dev around.
Please complain here if it is still broken.
