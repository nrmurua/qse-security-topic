As we saw recently that even though things were working as expected when covalent is installed using the GitHub repo, if someone did pip install cova they wouldn't have been able to use covalent. We should add tests/actions in pypi.yml to check whether installing from pip works as intended before every merge to develop or master.
For starters we can add a diff check between what is built by python setup.py sdist and what is there in the repo barring files/dirs containing docs, tests, tutorials, etc.
