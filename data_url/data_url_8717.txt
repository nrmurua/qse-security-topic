Hello,
I added PYTHONPATH = "/Users/Username/simulaQron:${PYTHONPATH}"
export PYTHONPATH
to my bash_profile on Mac. Even then I get the error message Module sinulaqron is not found. Please let me know how can I resolve the issue.
Hello @ganeshmylavarapu-qp, the easiest is to install using pip. You can either do pip3 install simulaqron to get the latest version from the pypi server. Alternatively, if you also wan't to be able to modify the source-code, you can in the root of this repo do make install.
Thanks for your response. One more query, if I have to find the concurrence between two entangled particles, do we have any package to find the amount of entanglement like concurrence and fidelity??
