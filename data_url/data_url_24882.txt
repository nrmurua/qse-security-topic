The conda forge channel has two platforms for osx: osx-64 and osx-arm64, while scqubits is only available on the osx-64 platform right now. Do we have plans for including scqubits for the osx-arm64 platform as well?
I tried installing scqubits with pip on my Apple M1 computer, with all the optional packages, and ran the test by scqubits.testing.run(); all the tests were passed.
Also would it be better to mention that the optional packages are required to pass all the pytests?
@pacosynthesis The following blog post may be a good starting point: https://conda-forge.org/blog/posts/2020-10-29-macos-arm64/. The fact that the conda-forge bot did not create an automatic PR makes me wonder whether there is actually still a problem we are missing. It is encouraging that qutip already has osx-arm64 versions (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qutip/files).
@pacosynthesis It appears that there's a long list of packages in queue to get osx-arm64 support: https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/blob/main/recipe/migrations/osx_arm64.txt
I have added us to the queue: conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock#2865
Thank you, sir! It's quite astonishing that Autodiff is just two packages earlier than us in the long queue; perhaps the golden age of M1 chips has not yet come...
This is done now.
