NIST IT security has just pushed a new policy that any and all software developed by outside contractors must be in C or C++ only.  Apparently they are going to run some sort of scanning software on the source to look for malicious code and this will only work on code written in C or C++.  All other programming languages are banned.  So we will need to reimplement the entirety of ARTIQ in C or C++.
I agree. This will make using Qt much easier.
It's already done because Oxford requested a MS-DOS port. Will release the sources soon.
