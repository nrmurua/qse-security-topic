The AMI430 magnet power supply produces an error while setting the units (either field_units or ramp_rate_units). Below, an example is given for the field_units.
Initialize power supply:
ix = AMI430("x2", address="192.168.0.101", port=7180)
Read units from power supply (example given for field_units):
ix.field_units()
This produces the following expected output:
'tesla'
Set unit (example given for field_units):
ix.field_units('kilogauss')
This does not work as expected
The error can also be reproduced by:
ix.field_units(ix.field_units())
It should silently set the field_unit to kilogauss (or tesla). Without any error.
It produces a key error:

I think this is the issue resolved by #1599 which is just waiting on a test on a real instrument.
Yes, it looks exactly like this. Sorry, I didn't find  #1599 before. I think one can then close this issue.
No worries. If you have a chance to do so it would be great if you can test the code from that pr and confirm that it resolves the issue
The code from #1599 fixes the above mentioned issue. Tested with real hardware.
@simonzihlmann Thanks a lot. I will go ahead and merge :)
