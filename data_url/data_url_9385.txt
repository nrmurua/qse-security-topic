@jon-wurtz found out: full-space with 12 spins and subspace with 20 spins have similar Hilbert space size, but somehow full space is much slower than subspace (before improving the full space performance). Please find out why.
I think this is because the benchmark was not using the same number of threads. I tried to benchmark update_term again (the only operation that is different for subspace and space), and the result seems correct
fullspace (4096x4096)
subspace (6126x6126)
I don't think this is very helpful for addressing the potential proformance issue, on the other hand, I realize when matrix becomes large for fullspace, multithreading can cause cache conflicts on some machines, which could be one of the reason why fullspace is slow.
okay, sounds good! After we fix the performance issues, if we still see some performance disparity for full space versus subspace (with similar Hilbert space size), we can then come back to this. @jon-wurtz @Roger-luo
