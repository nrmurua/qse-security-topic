QuantumCircuits with parameters associated with Parameterï¿½Vectors generally have their parameters re-ordered upon serialization/deserialization. This is because qpy_serialization interprets the elements of ParameterVectors as Parameters, rather than ParameterVectorElements, which leads to the parameters being re-ordered according to their ascii name values.
I believe qpy serialization should maintain the underlying parameter ordering of the input.
