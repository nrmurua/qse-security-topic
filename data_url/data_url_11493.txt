Aqua 0.8.2 includes some workaround for Docplex 2.20, but it has another issue that it does not work without cplex.
See qiskit-community/qiskit-optimization#24 for the details.
I recommend to pin docplex version (2.15 might be the best).
Sorry. I missed that Aqua 0.8.2 pinned docplex==2.15.194. It has no problem.
