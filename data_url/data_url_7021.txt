Because the amplitude display can't distinguish the global phase of one qubit from the global phase of the whole system, it either has to show drift as other qubits get modified or lock one of the shown amplitudes to a particular value.
I think locking an amplitude is a better tradeoff than not, because otherwise people could easily be fooled into thinking they could use the global phase of a single qubit as some kind of FTL communication mechanism.
Currently, Quirk locks the first amplitude, but it doesn't really give any indication that that's happening and it doesn't switch to another amplitude when the first amplitude gets so small that it's dominated by noise. So...
