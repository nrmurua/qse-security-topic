Hi @Raghav-Bell , thanks for volunteer! If you don't mind, let's first close some of the open PRs and we can leave good first issue to new comers. What do you think?
Yes @1ucian0  I agree.
If this issue still needs attention...Can I be assigned to this? I am new comer.. I wanna try this out. Thank you
I am also interested in contributing as a newcomer, please let me know if this task can be assigned to me
@Ak-ash22, assigning you! Thanks!
Hello @1ucian0 ...This is my first time contributing.. kindly help me verify if this is correct :
I have removed all the '@deprecated_func(additional_msg=(..........)) ' and also the line 51 'from qiskit.utils.deprecation import deprecate_func' from the parametric_pulses.py file.
Also utils.py file doesnt seem to have line 113 in it?. Am I missing something here?
The line numbers in the original post might be out of date. I removed qiskit/pulse/utils.py:113 in #10881, so no worry about that one. The rest, sounds good.
@1ucian0 I noticed that all the classes in the parametric_pulses.py have been deprecated, so I decided to delete the entire file. Also I noticed a bug in the related test.... in the qiskit/test/python/pulse/test_pulse_lib.py, there is a test class named TestParametricPulses but it calls all the Gaussian, Constant etc waveforms from the symbolic_pulses.py and not from the paramteric_pulses.py. So I changed the name of the test class to TestSymbolicPulses(..). Also I made sure that there is no test case for symbolic pulses, just to be sure I am not duplicating it.
Let me know if these changes are ok?! so that I can do tox tests and move forward with submitting a PR.
