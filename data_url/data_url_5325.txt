Hi, I was trying to run some files through ddsim_simple and I came across a strange error. On two systems I tried (macOS Big Sur and Linux Ubuntu 20.04), running build/ddsim_simple --simulate_file <file> --ps --shots 1000 on this file produces the following error:
What's strange is that if I delete the last line in this file (swap q[1], q[15];) then there is no error.
One potential problem is that I'm using swap and c3x gates, which I didn't see in your example circuits... but simulation seems to work if I delete that last swap gate, so that doesn't seem like the problem. Any thoughts?
Hi, thanks for reaching out.
In the code you linked, there is a declaration of a qubit register qreg q[14]; with only 14 qubits (indices 0 to 13, inclusive), so the swap q[1], q[15]; fails as q[15] does not exist. Chaning the declaration to qreg q[16]; makes the code work as far as I can tell.
(Next time we touch the OpenQASM parser we'll add an actually helpful error message.)
I'll close the issue but please do not hesitate to re-open if this does not fix it for you.
How embarrassing! Thanks for the help :)
