The test case H2O-dft-ls.inp seems to either hang or seg fault for NREP >= 8, at least partially due to this overflow:

In my run the hash becomes negative, which is clearly unexpected and leads to thread deadlocks. However even after fixing this line, other segfaults appear, so I suspect it is not the only issue.
Build configuration:
The most likely culprit is the OpenMP refactoring in 63f2e15.
However, I made a follow up commit where I moved force_thread(3, natom) from heap to stack in order to satisfy  OMP REDUCTION.
I'm wondering if we could somehow add a test for this. Maybe a box with 1M ghost atoms?
Should have be fixed via #812. @LStuber, can you confirm?
I gave it a new try with the master branch 08691cf which includes the commit you're referring to, and the issue did not seem fixed (It still hangs for NREP=8). I will try to investigate it further tomorrow.
Hang stack trace:
will need the followup #813
I confirm the issue is fixed now on the current master branch (that includes #812 and #813 fixes).
