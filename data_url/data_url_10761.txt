Failing tests: test_lib.test_headless_interrupt and test_lib.test_interactive_interrupt.
See test-osx-3.9.
@boothby, would you prefer we keep shaving that yak (from 6dcee69, test_lib.py#L855-L884), exclude osx-3.9, or remove kbd int tests altogether?
To unblock the release, I patched these tests to skip on osx-py39 as well. That means we're now testing for keyboard interruptibility only on Linux and macOS py35-py37.
This issue is to be closed when a proper fix is implemented.
That's best for now.  I would like to get to the bottom of this, but I've been busy with design work.
