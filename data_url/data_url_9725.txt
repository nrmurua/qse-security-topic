Application
Currently, when one converts a cqm to bqm, labels of the constraints are discarded and generated from scratch, resulting in slack variables with the new label. Also, in case a warning is given, it is given with the new label making it impossible to understand for which constraint it is about.
Proposed Solution
Instead of generating them from scratch, old labels can be kept, which will make easier issues mentioned above.
So I think there are a few cases that we should distinguish:
As denoted by the ✔️ I think (1) and (2) are fine, but it's not clear to me what the ideal behavior for (3) would be. A decision on (3) does not block working on (2) though.
In case 3, even though there are no slack variables, there might still be some warnings about the constraint in which case it is better to use the actual label in my opinion. Currently no such warnings are given in case of equality but in the future they can be implemented. (For instance if the constraint is not feasible for any assignment of values)
