serwb related
This is what we have:
sys4x is only used by the IOSERDES, i just made it reset_less, but we still have the timing error. @sbourdeauducq, @jordens: Are you familiar with TPWS errors? How are you solving them?
This is related to serwb linerate of 1Gbps.  (The error is really not clear with Vivado, with ISE it was the "Component switching limit" error). The maximum BUFG frequency for a -1 speedgrade is 464Mhz (2.155ns). This the 0.155ns slack we see. The only buffer we can use is a BUFIO and only very specific schemes are supported. I'm looking at that.
Done. (05955bf)
Thanks!
