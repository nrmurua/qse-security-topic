The code in qiskit/visualization/counts_visualization.py needs testing. Current coverage is:
(This is a follow up from #300 (comment))
This is still true: https://coveralls.io/builds/24960860/source?filename=qiskit/visualization/counts_visualization.py
on hold until #2968 is decided.
Hey! Is the issue still open?
it is!
Removing on hold. The testing should be on binder, like in #4544
As there are currently no other snapshot tests for counts (only circuits) I suggest creating a new file for count visualisation tests.
More specifically, I suggest the following steps for working on this issue:
@tgag17 are you still interested in working on this?
Hi! Yes, I would like to work on it. I am fairly new to unittests, so are there any pointers that I could follow?
Thanks!
Great thanks @tgag17!
If you follow the steps I commented above that should give you a good outline of what to do, there are examples of snapshot tests  in test_circuit_matplotlib_drawer.py that you can use as reference. test_circuit_matplotlib_drawer.py is testing the functions in qiskit/visualization/circuits_visualization.py, but your file test_counts_matplotlib_drawer.py should test the functions in qiskit/visualization/counts_visualization.py.
As for general pointers make sure you name your tests appropriately, using the prefix test_ and add a short description. Try to think of a range of test cases (e.g. trying out different arguments), not just the obvious ones.
Hi! Sorry, I was a bit preoccupied with some work and so wasn't able to make a PR. I will make at least a draft by this weekend. Thank you!
un-assigning due lack of activity.
Hi @1ucian0, if this still needs to be done, I'd be happy to do it
assgined @epelaaez !
Just before starting with this, I noticed that in qiskit-terra/test/ipynb/mpl/graph/test_graph_matplotlib_drawer.py there are tests for plot_histogram which is in counts_visualization.py. The only other functions on counts_visualization.py are _plot_histogram_data and hamming_distance, but I guess these are indirectly tested when testing plot_histogram.
If I understand correctly, what I have to do is add more tests for plot_histogram with different arguments, as right now the only tests is:
I just want to make sure this is the right approach. And one other thing, should this be done in another file like stated in @javabster comment a while ago or should I add these new tests into test_graph_matplotlib_drawer.py? Thanks!
you are right! the coverage from the original issue is outdated, the current coverage percentage is 71%. There are some branches to cover yet, if you are up to it. Otherwise, I think the issue can be closed.

Sure, I'll be happy to work on this. But it'd be great if I can get some pointers about the specific things that need coverage. I looked at the link you provided, but I'm not completely sure how to interpret it. Do the lines highlighted in red mean that those are not called on any tests?
Also, new tests would go into test_graph_matplotlib_drawer.py, right?
Yes, the lines in red means that the tests do no longer execute them. Search for the condition branches and parameterize the call parameters for those branches.
Also yes. Add the new tests should go into the same file. Thank you!
I added a simple test so I could make sure everything worked the way I think it does. However, it doesn't go as expected. Even though I pushed the change into my fork of the repo, my new test and other tests are not running in the binder. To make sure this was not only happening on my side, I went ahead and ran the binder for the orignal repo. However, some tests are also not running there.
In test_graph_matplotlib_drawer.py, there are 19 tests. However, only 14 are showing up when running the tests in binder. Also, some errors seem to happen, but I'm not able to get the whole traceback for them. Since this is happening when testing the main branch from the original repo, I don't think it has to do with something I've done.
Hi @epelaaez it's hard to guess what the issue is you're facing without seeing how you've written your test or how you've been trying to run them, could you share a code snippet of what you've done? Or even better open a draft PR and link it to this issue so we can see the code changes you're making. When I run binder for main in my fork I can see all 19 test results ðŸ˜„
Hi @javabster, thanks for the comment! I've opened #7096 that contains the small sample test I did.
When I go into https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/epelaaez/qiskit-terra/patch-1?urlpath=apps/test/ipynb/mpl_tester.ipynb, I only see 14 tests instead of the 20 in that file. The same happens when I go into https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/qiskit/qiskit-terra/main?urlpath=apps/test/ipynb/mpl_tester.ipynb. Maybe I'm using an old link? For reference, I tried in Chrome and Opera browsers.
