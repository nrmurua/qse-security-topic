When I do the folllowing
get_devices(as_dict=True)
I get
{'19Q-Acorn': <Device 19Q-Acorn offline>}
I'm not sure if Acorn is really offline, or if I just don't have a valid API Key.
Hi Joe! Hope you are doing well. Thanks very much for bringing this up. We are in fact doing maintenance on the device and so, the device is offline.
To verify if your API key is valid: can you access and run programs on the QVM? Also: for future reference, to use the QPU, in addition to the API key, you will need to request for special access and also schedule some time on the calendar to use it. Please let me know if you have already requested for that access. Thanks again for using Forest!
Thanks.  My key works with the QVM, but not QPU.  I've requested increased access.
Thanks.
