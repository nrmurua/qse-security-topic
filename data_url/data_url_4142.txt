Hello, I have some questions for Time Evolution gate. i'm learning VQE( variational quantum eigensolver).  Through the second quantization, I get an interaction term(U) with one parameter(θ),for example U = exp(-iθZ0Z1) . Z0 and Z1 are Pauli operators acting on qubit0 and qubit1 respectively.  I want to achieve  U = exp(-iθZ0Z1)  by Time Evolution gate.
wavefunction = eng.allocate_qureg(2)
ansatz = QubitOperator('Z0 Z1')
TimeEvolution(theta, ansatz) | wavefunction
Is this ok?
The most important quesion is i wonder how to achieve U = exp(-iθZ0Z1) by some universal quantum gates in quantum circuit?  In other words, Is there any way to decompose u into some universal quantum gates?
