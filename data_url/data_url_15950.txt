For the following code to execute -
from qiskit.algorithms.linear_solvers import HHL
hhl = HHL()
result = hhl.solve(matrix, vector)
result.state.draw('mpl', style='iqx')
matrix and vector have to be declared as numpy arrays like below but ideally they should just be python lists
import numpy as np
matrix = np.array([[1, -1/3], [-1/3, 1]])
vector = np.array([1, 0])
This problem is in the text book also
Since the textbook explicitly uses lists I agree. Thanks for reporting this! 👍🏻
Hey! Maybe I could try a hand at this issue?Also, isnt HHL part of Aqua? So this issue should ideally be in that repo right?
Hey @charmerDark, were you able to fix this? If not then, I can give it a try
@charmerDark feel free to work on this! HHL used to be part of Aqua, that's right, but we recently refactored Aqua into the application modules Qiskit Nature, Qiskit Optimization, Qiskit Machine Learning and Qiskit Finance. With that refactor HHL moved to Qiskit Terra.
So this change would only be in Qiskit Terra.
@Cryoris  Could you please tell me where the tests for HHL are? I cant seem to find them
Sure, they're in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/test/python/algorithms/test_linear_solvers.py 🙂
