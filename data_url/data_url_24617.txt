Currently the changes are tracked in ReleaseNotes.txt. Unfortunately, this means there are likely to be merge conflicts if parallel changes occur.
Solutions can be a changelog.d directory where each substantial change creates a file. If a new release is created, the files are merged automatically via a tool like towncrier:
https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/
