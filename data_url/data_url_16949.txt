This is fixed by applying tight_layout to the figure which was previously removed.
Is this still an issue? I can't seem to reproduce, even though I haven't applied tight_layout:

We can expand the plot by just passing the width and height of it.

@krutik2966 I think this issue is in reference to the bitstring labels on the X axis, rather than the frequency labels in the plot
I'm unable to reproduce on Ubuntu 18.04.4 either
If this issue is resolved, can it be closed? If not, then @nonhermitian could you provide a general list of steps for reproducing this issue? Would like to check it out if that's okay.
It is 9 months old so if people are now reporting it fixed then it likely is.
@nonhermitian I tried to reproduce the issue. I couldn't do it. The issue is already fixed. Looking up more issues for contributing then :)
