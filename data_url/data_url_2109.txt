The same Simulation runs without this error for 36 Qubits
You are trying to allocate memory worth (562949953421312 * 64) bit = 36028797018963970 bit =~ 4.5 Petabyte, whereas my guess is that 36 qubits would require approx 550 Gigabyte (still a lot but within reasonable limits for a big machine).
@ccalaza oh, i thought of something like that.
true, for the 36 qubits, the machine crashes with out-of-memory, but without that specific MemoryError from cirq.
i guess i am sorry for wasting your time. @quantumlib you want to close this?
