For tests it's a good idea to configure matplotlib to use a "headless" backend like "Agg". It can avoid a lot of issues like this (also avoid spurious windows popping up on dev machines when tests are run locally).
I just ran this test on my ubuntu subsystem for windows with gui-backend disabled and this test in addition to two others failed. The failing tests were:
In linalg/decompositions_test.py:
test_kak_plot_empty
test_scatter_plot_normalized_kak_interaction_coefficients
In cross_entropy_benchmarking_test.py:
test_cross_entropy_benchmarking
All of them failed with "_tkinter.TclError: couldn't connect to display ":0"". I hadn't previously attempted testing with the gui disabled so this hadn't come up before. I ran these two files in pytest on a native windows environment and the cross entropy benchmarking test opens a spurious window but the decomposition tests do not appear to. I hadn't noticed these before as the window closes itself before the testing is done and I had only ever looked at the results.
