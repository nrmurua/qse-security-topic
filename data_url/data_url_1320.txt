Currently simulators have to explicitly invoke a decomposition strategy in _act_on_fallback_. Should we just add this to the base implementation so that it's there by default? (For instance MPS simulator doesn't have it, and thus fails on decomposable ops). This would all third-party contrib.CustomSimulator subclasses inherit that behavior by default as well.
