As a newcomer to QCodes I had some difficulties to get started with some simple instruments. One difficulty was owed to non-stringent naming of quantities. As an example consider the line
Here we loop over a channel of the QDac and read values with the Keysight34465A. I find it quite confusing that we are once using "volt" and once "v" and in other places "voltage".
I suggest we make a naming convention for commonly used properties, so that the drivers form a more integral code base.
👍 I think part of the problem is that we really need a good way to provide aliases for parameters.
Some users prefer short names as v over more verbose ones such as voltage, while other users finds it convenient to be able to address parameters by their physical connection to the sample i.e. plunger_v or some such thing. It would be useful if they were the same (taking snapshotting and so on into account so we dont get duplicated metedata)
I totally agree.
I just noticed another point we can add to the list of driver conventions:
Naming the module:
instrument_drivers/Manufacturer>/Model.py
vs
instrument_drivers/Manufacturer/Manufacturer_Model.py
(as eg for Keysight_33500B.py)
