Hi, what would you like to do with the develop version? The fact that there is a develop.exe at all is only for testing reasons (i.e. to see whether something in the automatic binary file creation workflow is broken without taking down a previous working version (aka pyrpl-windows.exe).
Ok sorry thanks.  I was just trying to check if differentiators were making it into the PID module or not.  I've tried "additional modules" in the lockbox module but cannot get it to work yet.
