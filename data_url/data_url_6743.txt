We currently measure qubits independent from each other.
Therefore, BellTest fails. If a single qubit is measured, the probabilities on the others need to be recalculated.
Example:
if P = 1/sqrt(2) [1,0,0,1]
And we measure q[0] to be 0, q[1] should be 0 too.
Measuring a qubit can not be done without taking into account the others (if there is entanglement)
belltest passes
