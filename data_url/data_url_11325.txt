In the code for jordan_wigner, InteractionOperators are handled with the helper function jordan_wigner_interaction_op, rather than simply mapping to a FermionOperator first and then transforming with the existing code. This is supposedly for the sake of speed. However, I found that doing it this way on a Hubbard Hamiltonian is apparently around 10 times slower. Does anyone have an idea why? Was this actually tested for speed? Should we just ditch the helper function?
Actually, it seems that the currently implementation is faster for random InteractionOperators and those derived from molecular Hamiltonians, probably closer to what it would actually be used for. So probably this isn't a real issue.
