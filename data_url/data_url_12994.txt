The BQSKit IR has always supported qudit gates, but the library of gates included lacks some important ones. We should add these missing qudit gates to our library:
We do include some qudit gates like the CSUM and CPI, which you can look to for an example.
Hello @edyounis! I am new to BQSKit and would like to work on this feature. Could you please give some resoureces where I can find relevant description for required qudit gates?
hi @edyounis! I submitted PR #154 that adds more robust qudit gates as requested.
NEW GATES
All of these gates work for qudit systems with an arbitrary number of levels. I additionally added a QuditGate base class (following the examples of QubitGate and QutritGate), which all of these gates take as a parent class.
Note that  {CSUMDGate, HDGate, PDGate}  form a universal qudit gate set (proved in this paper).
FIXES:
hi @edyounis! just wanted to gently check in and see if anyone had a chance to review my PR :)
Hi,
I did not want to open a new issue, but I added support for qutrit gates by  reproducing most of the existing qubit gates, both constant and parameterized, for qutrits. In addition, I added support for the Gellman generators of SU(3) and other logical gates unique to SU(3). Also I added the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix as a gate.
Please see pull request #157 for a complete list of the gates.
By the way, I used jax as a backend for AD.
