In the file svd.cpp there are several floating point comparisons using == and !=.
Replace them by Linalg::almost_equal.
This issue was raised by Chris in reviewing PR #344.
This usage is more correct and will eliminate several warning from compilation.
Flagging this issue as bug too, because although things are working fine at the moment, that could not be the case with some future change. Floating-point comparison using the canonical  operators it's dangerous (and erroneous depending on the needed precision).
