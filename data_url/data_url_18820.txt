Imagine I want to be able to calibrate two definitions of CX (fast or slow). Currently, it is not clear how this should be done as cx in the defcal needs to match cx in gate.
defcal cx %q0 %q1 { ... }
We need to make this clearer that a user should do the following: define two calibrations but update the library of gates with the second defined in terms of the first it is here that they provide some extra information for the compiler to know when and how to use the second.
gate cx_2 qargs { cx qargs }
defcal cx %q0 %q1 { ... } defcal cx_2 %q0 %q1 { ... }
This needs some changes to get that a user can build gates up from the matrix definitions and also associate them with the same matrix but provide a different definition for the gate.
