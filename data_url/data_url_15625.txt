Gibbs state preparation will be used by Quantum Boltzmann Machines for example. It should include a variational variant using the variational quantum time evolution but also non-variational approaches.
This feature is currently out of scope, and considering the incoming move of qiskit.algorithms (Qiskit/RFCs#44), I think all issues related to this epic can be closed.
