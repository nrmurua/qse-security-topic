Mapper issue reported by @maikatakita
Yields:
Is this an issue you still get? I can't seem to recreate it locally.
@ajavadia can you confirm?
I was able to reproduce (or maybe a similar error) on the same circuit on master / 5f4102a , len(qr)==len(cr)==4,  python3.5 .
Error is MapperError: 'swap_mapper failed: layer 3, sublayer 0' from https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/5f4102a8065ebf1772cde0acf69f2010b970d569/qiskit/mapper/mapping.py#L374 .
