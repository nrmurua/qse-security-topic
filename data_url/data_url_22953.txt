We can discuss here how to solve the problem of providing unit test results for all commits that are creazed.
Current problems are mostly related to
The best solution would be to run the unit tests on a europe-based machine with direct access to a Redpitaya.
Another option would be to locally run the tests before committing code changes and prove that they were successful, e.g. with a hash of the commit or sth alike. This would require a proper way to locally create an environment similar to the one of travis.
Another good option would be to find a europe-based ci Service Provider, or use our own AWS server.
Ano
But Leo, at the moment is there a redpitaya physically accessible for Travis? Some time ago it was at my place, but since I moved, I didn't reinstall the necessary hardware... Moreover, this was rather cumbersome since my internet provider doesn't provide a fixed IP address.
Yes there is one online in my place (whenever I can bear the LEDs to illuminate my hallway). But I have a crappy ISP, so the connection breaks all the time..
I am now thinking about implementing Jenkins on a Raspberry Pi, which will switch on the Redpitaya when needed to do the tests. The workload should be limited, and would enable 100x faster unit tests.
