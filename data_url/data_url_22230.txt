I've added debug prints.
Hangs indefinitely. No timeout.
No. I bet it hangs in busywait_us.
Are you providing a 2 GHz clock with the right power to J1?
Yes.
Have you compiled and flashed the startup kernel?
I built the .elf and loaded onto flash.
Is the startup kernel being executed?
After resetting the board I can do $artiq_run artiq_run startup_kernel.py without error. If I then do $ $artiq_run repository/dac_setup.py it hangs and subsequent attempts to do $artiq_run artiq_run startup_kernel.py fail.
Did you modify the device_db.pyon?
Yes. Modified IP address of core device.
Did you set startup_clock as per the instructions?
Yes. It is set as i.
Do the boot messages show that the startup kernel is executed without error? I.e. paste the boot log.
See snipped I pasted below which shows --verbose output from running startup kernel manually. I've inspected the boot log and don't see errors. I'm not in front of KC705 at the moment so can't paste the log.
Measure the frequency of sysref on JP26/JP27.
I will do this.
Below?
And I need what I asked for. The boot log, not you manually running something.
If you want to confirm my suspicion without being in front of the board, you can try to count pulses on the sysref ttl channel for a Âµs. That should also block.
The manual run is in the snippet which opened the Issue.
$ artiq_run startup_kernel.py --verbose --verbose

Acknowledged. Todo...
And just to verify, in device_db.pyon, core.arguments.external_clock == True as shipped?
Can ping KC705.
verify, in device_db.pyon, core.arguments.external_clock == True
yes
Measure the frequency of sysref on JP26/JP27.
No signal discernable on 1 GS/s scope.
Please just do what I asked and what's suggested in the readme. Use flterm to observe the entire boot sequence and paste the result here. Otherwise this will take a very long time.
Also, you must have changed something that you did not disclose. Before, your $ artiq_run startup_kernel.py --verbose --verbose was succeeding. Now it is failing.
FInally, did you set the jumpers oon XP1 and JP3 as described?
