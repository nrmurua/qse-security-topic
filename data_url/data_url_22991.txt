... or by a 4% error in amplitude.
this only happens at very small amplitude and gradually disappears when amplitude is increased -> should nevertheless try to correct for this by properly modeling ampltidue
did properly model amplitude, but mismatch is still there for small amplitudes -> another roundoff thing because we only implement approximations to rounding in fpga
-> leaving this open as a reminder to implement correct rounding in all fpga computations in the next release...
