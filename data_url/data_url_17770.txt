@jaygambetta Now we have support for dropping an arbitrary unitary into the circuit. What you are proposing for the quantum-information module should ideally use this, but obviously add methods for doing interesting things with the unitary.
@ewinston how is this going. Can you sketch some of these things we discuss here?
I think this is closed via #1961. Can @ewinston @ajavadia confirm?
