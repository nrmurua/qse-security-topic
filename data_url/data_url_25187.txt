I would like to improve the code in the file covalent/doc/generate_docs.py by adding additional logging and adding a logging error if cmd.returncode != 0.
Seems like a simple fix. I would like to work on this issue for hacktoberfest 23.
Looking forward to get assigned on this issue.
Thanks

Hey @THEGAMECHANGER416 , thanks for the issue, however we are not planning to add this into our set of Hacktoberfest issues. So, if you'd like to submit a PR for this, we are grateful but keep in mind that it won't be considered as part of the Hacktoberfest contribution. Also, I'd recommend going through their guidelines as well: https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/.
@kessler-frost Yes sure, don't add hacktoberfest label, Just glad to make a contribution.
Thanks
