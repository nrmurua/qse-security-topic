Hi,
Under the section for TLS end-to-end testing, the instructions only start a server and then measure the number of connections per time unit.
I am wondering if it is possible to start a client and server (both with their own certificate chain) together and then measure the connection time taken? Tried doing it but with no avail.
Thanks in advance !
Hi - can you share what you tried and in which way things failed?
Hi i have solved this issue thanks !
