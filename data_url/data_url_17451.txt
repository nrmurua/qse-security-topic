The initial_layout option of compile give me this error if I use it on more than one qubit.
If I use only one qubit layout it works.
I expect the code to compile without issues and let me use the qubit 1 and 10 of the real melbourne machine
I don't know.
I've tried also lay=Layout( { (qr,0): 1, (qr,1):10 } ) but nothing changes.
I've seen that the problem is the same of issue #1637, but to me it still don't works.
The problem seems to be fixed in master branch and will be release in the coming version. Do you mind checking again with the code from the master branch?
Using the master branch it works! Thanks!
