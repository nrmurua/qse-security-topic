Okay, I can add a controlled-Hadamard gate to PyZX. Are there any other gates from the standard QASM library that are missing?
Controlled Hadamard is the only one I tried. I am new to both ZX and QASM. PyZX does not read qelib1.inc to get the definitions?
Hi @jvdwetering ,  it looks like the crz gates are also missing:
It would be very helpful to our project.
So, for the CRZ gate there is a bit of a difficulty in which phase convention to adopt. The qiskit library (https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CRZGate.html) apparently sees an RZ(alpha) gate as diag(e^{-i alpha/2},e^{i alpha/2}). This leads to a different controlled phase gate than I would expect (namely, a matrix with 2 diagonal elements not equal to 1, instead of just 1 element not equal to 1). For instance, a CRZ(pi) gate does not match the CZ gate.
This does seem to be the way it is defined in the QASM spec however (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03429.pdf, p.12), so I guess I'll just follow that.
In case anyone comes across this issue later, support for all the gates mentioned above have all been added as of PR #156.
