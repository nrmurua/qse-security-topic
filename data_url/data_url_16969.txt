As pointed out by @maddy-tod in #3288 :
... it might be good to have this as a function on the gate for example Gate.is_parameterized() just for clarity. This could potentially introduce confusion for gates that are not able to be parameterized though.
There are a few places in the code which handle parameterized gates differently from fully bound gates, e.g. Optimize1qGates, CommutationAnalysis, Collect2qBlocks, and the unroller . Rather than having each any(isinstance(param, ParameterExpression) for param in op.params), it might be helpful to have a .is_parameterized method on the base Instruction class.
Questions:
The only use in Terra of the phrase noted in the Expected Enhancement seems to be as a boolean.
Here's a question: Does this issue solely address adding an instance method (and test case) to qiskit.circuit.Instruction or also applying the Enhancement appropriately throughout Terra?
