Information
While running gui = MetalGUI(design) syntax to open the GUI, I am getting the following errors:
_**05:10PM 17s CRITICAL [_qt_message_handler]: line: 0, func: None(), file: None  WARNING: QObject::moveToThread: Current thread (0x241ec5ea9b0) is not the object's thread (0x241dfce4430).
Cannot move to target thread (0x241ec5ea9b0)
05:10PM 17s CRITICAL [_qt_message_handler]: line: 0, func: None(), file: None  INFO: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "windows" in "" even though it was found.
Restarting kernel...**_
Please suggest some solutions.
Using PyQt version 5.12.3
Please provide us with a little more detail.  What python code was executed prior to the gui = MetalGUI(design) call?
I started with the initial python code for Qiskit metal:
from qiskit_metal import designs, draw, MetalGUI, Dict, open_docs
design = designs.DesignPlanar()
design.overwrite_enabled = True
design.chips.main
design.chips.main.size.size_x = '11mm'
design.chips.main.size.size_y = '9mm'
gui = MetalGUI(design)
The error comes just when I call the MetalGUI
@ani-tifr, There is a slack channel where you can ask for help.  It is in workspace  qiskit.slack.com in channel #metal.  It is an active support community for Qiskit Metal.
Did you set up a conda environment?  The link below may be helpful to set up Metal.  It also has links to FAQ.
https://qiskit.org/documentation/metal/installation.html
I believe this is documented in the FAQ: https://qiskit.org/documentation/metal/faq.html
Search for "Could not load the Qt platform" (it is Q/A 6).
Closing this case, please @ani-tifr re-open it if none of the suggestions work.
