I want to use parallel.parfor to speed up the calculation, but the parfor function seems not working on windows. I have installed the qutip and other packages. And I have tested my code on linux based python, it works well. So I wonder if anyone can tell me why and how to fix this problem? Thanks.
The following is my test code.
It is an issue with how Windows works.  The solution, as you have found, is to use Linux.
@nonhermitian, Thanks!
Hi @nonhermitian, is qutip's parfor still not supported on Windows? I think I may be running into a similar problem. Thanks!
As it stands now I do not think so. However much has happened since this issue was raised. I think with some mods it will work. I can make a PR
