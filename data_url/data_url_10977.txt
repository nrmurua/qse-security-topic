As described in https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ann-plans-for-removing-packages-that-do-not-yet-support-1-0-from-the-general-registry/ we are planning on removing packages that do not support 1.0 from the General registry. This package has been detected to not support 1.0 and is thus slated to be removed. The removal of packages from the registry will happen approximately a month after this issue is open.
To transition to the new Pkg system using Project.toml, see https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl#transitioning-from-require-to-projecttoml.
To then tag a new version of the package, see https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl#via-the-github-app.
If you believe this package has erroneously been detected as not supporting 1.0 or have any other questions, don't hesitate to discuss it here or in the thread linked at the top of this post.
