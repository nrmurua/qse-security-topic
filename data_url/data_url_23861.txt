On my system the tests (python setup.py nosetests) fail:
I think the code is intended to check whether a file handle is a sequence. On my system the first element of os.listdir('.') is a directory and this generates an error. I suggest removing the file handle altogether.
A second error occurs in the multi processing tests:
Apparently on my system not only the daemons are started, but also a side process which gets counted accidentally. I think we should either replace the check self.assertEqual(len(reprs), 2, reprs) with something more sophisticated (e.g. check names or id's) or do not do this kind of tests as they are very system dependent.
@eendebakpt thanks - what platform are you on, Linux I guess? Turns out on Windows, which should really be my primary testing platform, there are even more errors... I'm spending some time beefing up tests today and will try to address all of these - I'll ping you when I have a PR, perhaps you can tell me if I've succeeded?
@eendebakpt I don't have linux available to test on, but I think this is closed by #47 - can you see if you're happy with the new test runner python qcodes/test.py (and it works correctly) and close this if so?
It works now, I am closing the issue.
