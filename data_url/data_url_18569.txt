If I run echo 'RX(-pi/2) 0; RX(pi/2) 0' | ./quilc in a terminal, I get what I expect, i.e. the two RXs compile to just the identity
However, if I run the same code inside a python session, the two instructions don't collapse into the identity.
Why is this so?
Good spot. Looks like there is some info missing from the ISA. It works as expected if you use Aspen-type ISAs:
The quilc entrypoint is here: https://github.com/rigetti/quilc/blob/master/app/src/rpc-server.lisp#L50
I wonder what it's sending as a chip specification, and if we are h√¶rkening back to the old issue of pattern matching.
EDIT: em gee es kay beat me to it
