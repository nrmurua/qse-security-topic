The transpile function is still not available using from qiskit import *.  The previous issue #2178 was closed assuming that this was fixed, but it is not.
@jaygambetta and I decided to make better use of namespaces and not dump everything in the top level. So the compiler related functions are under qiskit.compiler
I could argue that having perhaps the most or second most important function easy to use is a good thing to do (like we do with execute), but I wont.
@ajavadia What is the reasoning behind not exposing things at the top level?
