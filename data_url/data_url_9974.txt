Affected OS: Windows
Affected Pythons: 64-bit 3.6+
Affected functionality: dimod.roof_duality.fix_variables
Affected CI: CircleCI, not AppVeyor
Proof: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dwave-adtt/dwave-hybrid/builds/30045253
Reason: new C++ exception handling (called FH4), introduced in ~2019-03 (Visual Studio 2019 Preview 2 release notes), but enabled by default during compile/link only ~2019-07.
Manifestation: binary module/DLL dimod.roof_duality._fix_variables.cp3x-win_amd64.pyd imports __CxxFrameHandler4 from vcruntime140_1.dll, but that DLL is distributed in vc_redist.x64 v14.23+.
