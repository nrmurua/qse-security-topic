Variable icon is still active however we have switched to Qcomponents.
The program got crashed when I was dragging the button where it says 'Qcomponent' and opening it in the new window
Disable one icon when the other is enabled
The button should be in off state
Change the state of the buttons depending on the option selected down with the name.

@grace-harper-ibm , have an idea how to handle this one?
