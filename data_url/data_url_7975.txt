I'm wondering if it's possible to use mesolve to find the evolution of an arbitrary operator in the Heisenberg picture, where the operators carry all of the time dependence, and thus evolve according to the adjoint Lindblad equation. For some operator $O$, the coherent part is $+i [H,O]$ and the dissipator for a collapse operator $L$ is $L^\dagger O L - \frac{1}{2} L^\dagger L O - \frac{1}{2} O L^\dagger L $.
In particular, I was wondering if there is a way to "hack" mesolve to do this without any modification, such as using $-O$ instead of $O$ so that it matches the coherent Schrodinger picture evolution $-i [H,O]$ that mesolve does, but I'm not sure about the dissipator.  Using $L^\dagger$ instead of $L$ would also change the anticommutator term, which actually shouldn't change between the two pictures.  Is there a sneaky way of making this work without too much modification?  Otherwise, perhaps this would be a good feature to add?
Instructions on how to use mesolve to solve for the time evolution of an operator in the Heisenberg (not Schrodinger) picture, or an extension of mesolve to allow for this, possibly through an option in the function call like picture=True which defaults to Schrodinger but if False uses the Heisenberg picture.

I realized that this can be done by vectorizing the Heisenberg superoperator contributions and adding them directly to the full Liouvillian as explained in the mesolve docstring for c_ops usage, so I'll close this for now.
