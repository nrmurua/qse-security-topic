Ok, I ran into this issue in two separate times. Once when I was trying to run the new QRL testnet from source, and the other was after I tried a work-around in the clone.
I was told the team already new about the first issue and was working on a solution, so I'll just report the second one.
After attempting to clone the first time which didn't work (I'll report that issue separately), I tried a work-around suggested by a community member which was:
"From the bash prompt cd into your cloned QRL folder and issue the following commands:
sudo -H pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv penv
source penv/bin/activate # this should add (penv) to your prompt
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
start_qrl --miningCreditWallet "
All the commands worked fine until I put in the last one. This is what I put in, and what the terminal returned:
"(penv) Ompanime@DESKTOP-4H33NIU:~/qrl$ start_qrl --miningCreditWallet=Q0106001a5feb3ca2aa716eaa4667e8e5c1d6b34fe5917bbdd2843cff1c601f1fb06d903611dee8
start_qrl: command not found"
Please note that I am running a fresh installation of Ubuntu on Windows 10 Home ED through the WSL.
Sorry, for the trouble. Our pip installer was broken, because of update in setup-tools not supporting older version of pyscaffold. We have updated our codebase and released the latest version. Please try installing latest version of qrl. It should work fine now.
It's working thanks!
