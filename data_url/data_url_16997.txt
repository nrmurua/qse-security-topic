From https://travis-ci.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/jobs/242965523#L6482 :
Attaching a callback to print the pass name and output dag, it looks like the conditional is lost in ConsolidateBlocks.
Collect2qBlocks includes multiple gates with conditionals into the same block. For example, the circuit
is collected into the blocks[['u2', 'u1', 'cx', 'u1', 'cx', 'u2'], ['measure']] which ConsolidateBlocks then joins together.
I don't think that this  grouping is correct as I cannot see a logical value that the condition on the unitary could hold in this instance. Therefore, I think that the update that is needed is to refine how Collect2QBlocks deals with gates which contain conditions.
