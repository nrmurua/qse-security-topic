To get the value of exp_val we need to do exp_val.expectation_z() which makes it sound like we are extracting the z expectation value when infact we are extracting <psi|H|psi> and not <psi|Z|psi>
To summarize our conclusions on this after the weekly meeting:
Outstanding questions:
I vote that we change the C++ to .expectation(). This will be great in that the C++ and Python will mirror each other now.
