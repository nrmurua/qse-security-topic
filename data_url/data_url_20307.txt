OpenSSH regression tests currently fail, cf. issue open-quantum-safe/openssh#13. I have tracked the reason down to  the function OQS_KEM_new returning a struct with "misaligned" members (in lack of a better way to describe it).
This occurs independently of OpenSSH, as shown below. This could instead be a platform/compiler specific issue.
Running the small program below on my Ubuntu machine outputs the following:
Obviously, wrong.
Compile and run like this:
Any clues?
I'm not able to reproduce on my Mac or Ubuntu 18.04 or 14.04 VMs.  What configuration are you using?
Sorry. I just found the cause of this. It was due to a contaminated repository. I pulled the new repository version of master-branch yesterday, ran make clean and re-build. Apparently, this did not remove the old library which I was still linking against when building the small program above and OpenSSH. Wicked...
You can close :).
We recently added a new field in the OQS_KEM (OQS_KEM->alg_version) which would might be why you were seeing misalignment between versions.
