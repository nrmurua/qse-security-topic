The .size attribute of a DataArray is now equal to the .shape, e.g. data.size = data.shape = (10, 20). If would be more natural to set data.size = 200 and data.shape = (10, 20) as is done for numpy arrays.
Should we change this behaviour?
👍 Pandas follows that too
Yes, that will be more standard. 🌟
