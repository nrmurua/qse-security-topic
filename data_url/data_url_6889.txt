Hi @Strilanc
Maybe I don't understand something (or can possibly be a bug) :
Is it normal behavior that controlling qubit changes depending on value of controlled one?
Example:
When Z^½ gate on qubit 1 is controlled by qubit 0, ϕ of qubit 0 is -45° :
http://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={"cols":[["X^½","X^½"],["•","Z^½"]]}

Now if I remove control (and leave Z^½ on qubit 1 uncontrolled),  ϕ of qubit 0 is -90° :
http://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={"cols":[["X^½","X^½"],[1,"Z^½"]]}

I just want to know is it normal behavior or is a bug?
Thanks! :)
Thanks for the report.
Yes, that's normal behavior. In fact it's useful! It's an example of what people call "phase kickback".
A practical example of phase kickback being useful is in the surface code's Z^(1/2) gate contruction. The surface code can't do Z^(1/2) gates natively. But it can apply CNOTs and Hadamards involving an ancilla, in a way that causes a phase kickback equivalent to a Z^(1/2) gate.
A more dramatic example is what happens if you surround a CNOT with Hadamards: you end up flipping the control if the target is on. You might find Thinking of Operations as Controls useful to read.
Hi @Strilanc thank you very much for detailed explanation! 👍
