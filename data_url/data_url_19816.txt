Should the MeasurementFilter be passed the qiskit terra result object and it return a qiskit results object.
I thought the idea was the result object was supposed to be unchanged, (also @ajavadia )
i would make a new results object with the data changed. But i suppose it is weird that the counts will not be integers.
Yes it's cleaner to post-process a qiskit.Result object.
But as you say the counts won't be integers and, if using the 'pseudo_inverse' method, they may even be negative. So this Result object won't pass validation I think. Not sure if that's a problem.
