In the example the random seed for the ket is fixed so in principle the ket's created are not really random. This must be fixed.
I think that the idea for the seed is to show a "pretty good" loss trajectory on a specific set of states. One may remove the seed. The results, however, will not be the same -- loss might be a bit higher.
