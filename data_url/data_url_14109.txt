In Qiskit 1.0 we'll stop using CXCancellation as part of the preset pass managers as it's been superseded by InverseCancellation (see #11210 ). At that point we can deprecate and remove the CXCancellation pass because it's not providing any real value over InverseCancellation. But because the 0.45.x and by extension 0.46.x release series are using CXCancellation in the preset pass manager for optimization level 1 the normal pattern of deprecate for 0.46 and remove in 1.0 won't work here as that would result in calling a deprecated pass every time transpile() is called. This issue is to track the deprecation of CXCancellation pass for >=1.1.0 for eventual removal in a future 2.0 release.
