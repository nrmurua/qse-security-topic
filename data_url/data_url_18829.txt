In qasm3Parser.g4#L66
the grammar state that the iterable (i.e., the thing that will be iterated during the for-loop) is either:
whereas the official documentation on for-loop explicitly states that using indexedIdentifiers should be allowed:
It is valid to use an indexing expression (e.g. my_array[1:3]) to arrive at one of the types given above.
Replace Identifier by indexedIdentifier in the forStatement rule.
indexedIdentifier in the ANTLR grammar is a shorthand in the grammar for making certain l-value expressions clearer, whereas this is an r-value expression.  I'm fine to change the grammar (and the corresponding parser), but the targets should probably change to setExpression | LBRACKET rangeExpression RBRACKET | expression instead and the parser should sort out the type safety (the current reference parser only produces an untyped AST at the moment, so it doesn't actually do any type checking).
I will make a PR for this in the near future then. I agree with the l-value/r-value argument here.
