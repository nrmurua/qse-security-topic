Hi @jcmgray,
While adding gates to large MPSs with the gate_with_auto_swap function, I sometimes get a convergence failure error during the SVD computation of the swapping process. The problem lies in the numba-accelerated part of the svd_truncated function in the decomp module. This error is due to the LAPACK driver used for the SVD function in numba. The gesdd LAPACK routine does not guarantee convergence of the computation. This is problematic because, even if this issue does not happen a lot, it can still raise an error.
I was able to circumvent this issue by using the gesvd LAPACK routine provided by SciPy. A quick fix to guarantee the convergence would be to use the SciPy function when the numba function fails to converge. For example, changing the original function:
by the following functions seems to fix the problem:
Is there a better way to deal with this issue?
Thank you for your help.
Hi @juliendrapeau, yes something along those lines seems reasonable, maybe with a warning raised as well? A fallback like this happens in the core part of quimb for some functions too.
Generally I have found that if one is having problems with linear algebra routine convergence then there is usually some instability in the higher tensor network algorithm that should be addressed, e.g. large differences in norms of tensors appearing.
However, with #192 as well, I wonder if something has changed about the numba svd implementation that has begun to cause this issue. If you have time it would be helpful to see if:
No worries if not, its just a little hard to reproduce these things otherwise.
