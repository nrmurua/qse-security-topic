pytest leaves behind a LOT of temporary files
After executing all cirq unit tests with pytest the root temporary directory contains 31 leftover files  and 38 leftover directories taking about 30G of disk space in total.  The majority of that is taken by /tmp/cirq-pytest which has 59 virtual environments - 3 base environments and 56 per each isolated notebook test.
Some ideas how to reduce disk usage in isolated_notebook_test
Here is how I checked for the leftover files (docker tests are not set up on my workstation).
Note: my work tree had a change in the isolated_notebook_test.py which makes it execute all isolated notebook tests.
Cirq version
1.2.0.dev at 8b97aa5
I would like to work on this

This PR simply removes the temporary directories. Here are the options we have,
Here is some reasoning for the options we have for the isolated test cases.
First, if I understand correctly, these isolated test cases are testing these notebooks or other test cases to be able to run from a base environment by automatically installing packages by themselves. So, the environment shouldn't have all packages set up.
The second method takes about 10s to restore each environment. It's slower than just removing and copying a new one (about 5s). The pip-sync also takes about 8s still worse than simply copying a new one.
@pavoljuhas to review the PR and @shawn-peng to verify that all files are cleaned up as per the last command in the original issue.
Thanks @tanujkhattar,
@pavoljuhas Here is what's left,
cirq-pytest takes most of the usage, here are what's left,
These will be reused later, so I think it would be better to keep them.

4 tmp* dir is empty, 4 browser temp dirs take little space
The top usage with 4 threads/workers is less than 5GB. Each isolated env is deleted immediately after the test is done.
