Consider building/shipping musllinux wheels. Alpine linux uses musl libc instead of glibc, so Ocean install requires building all binary packages (todo: check if they even build on alpine).
Trivial to do with cibuildwheel.
Not at all a blocker, but worth mentioning that I don't believe any of our dependencies have musllinux wheels (e.g. numpy). I imagine they build from source though.
Edit: relevant issues: numpy/numpy#20089, scipy/scipy#15628. https://pythonspeed.com/articles/alpine-docker-python/, linked in the latter, is also interesting.
