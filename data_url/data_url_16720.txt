The pulse.instructions is current a package, with a module for every instruction. It would make the codebase simpler if there was a single module pulse/instructions.py for all instructions.
@taalexander :pl assign it to me.
I understand from your comments, all those instructions should be inside one file and that is pulse/isntructions.py.
correct?
Yes, sounds good. Thank you @hykavitha
Is this issue closed or anyone working on it? Can I work on this?

yes, me.
Closing as it seems no progress has been made on the implementation and this may be unnecessary. Feel free to reopen if you disagree.
