Summarize the task
Enable use of ancillas to shorten the shortest path along qubits that need to be adjacent during routing.
Acceptance criteria - when is the task considered done?
Once an ancilla allocation strategy is implemented (based on some user-specificed inputs like for e.g. max_number_of_anicllas) and MappingManager is extended by a subclass MappingManagerWithAncillas that enables the adding and removing of ancillary physical qubits to the logical->physical mapping and therefore to the routed circuit.
