In the lines of #3739 add a command for open CX and CCX gates. This could be called ocx for open CX or ncx for negated CX.
You can currently do this with XGate().control(1, ctrl_state=0 and XGate().control(2, ctrl_state=0) using the general interface. The biggest difference I see is perhaps not having to append the created gate. Are there other reasons you have in mind?
That is it essentially.
It is purely an enhancement for convenience. They seem to be well used gates to have their own simple commands â€”even if redundant with more general methods.
We are trying to move away from monkey patching (see #4035)...
I'm tagging this as wontfix.
