The QOAO callback attribute docstring says this
Whereas the callback parameter in the constructor does not have and the best measurement nor does the SamplingVQE callback, in either situation, that this class extends where the callback is done by the parent. I believe and the best measurement should just be simply removed unless there was somehow an intent to have had this - but the callback signature does not accommodate such presently.
