Summary: If you initialize the quantum computer object with a density (e.g. qc.qam.wf_simulator.density = rho0 for some valid state rho0) the state is cleared after one call of qc.run.
For example suppose the program is
Next load the pure state rho0= diag[0.0, 1.0] into the simulator and call run many times. You should get statistics like Pr(0) ~ 0.0 and  Pr(1)~ 1.0. Instead you will get statistics like Pr(0) ~ 0.999 and  Pr(1)~ 0.001 if you ran a thousand times. This happens because after the first run the reset method sets the state back to |0> rather than rho0.
I am arguing that this is incorrect behavior as the user has set the initial state it should reset to the state specified by the user until the user decides to change the initial state.
Details: There are some subtitles concerning if the actual behavior is reasonable / expected or not. So lets do a shallow belly flop (cf. deep dive) into this issue. The points made here are illustrated with working code below.
Let me state again that the desired statistics are approximately Pr(0) = 0.0 and  Pr(1) = 1.0.
Moreover, this behavior is, from a naive users perspective, inconsistent.

@kilimanjaro @kylegulshen, and @msohaibalam  do you have thoughts?
