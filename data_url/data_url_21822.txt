On windows 64 bit, after creating a conda environment using the artiq-kc705-nist_qc2 package via  conda create -n artiq-main artiq-kc705-nist_qc2 no binaries directory is created which causes  artiq_flash commands to fail:
Where is it created instead?
It looks like it just wasn't created at all.  I only have a single directory containing the kc705 gateware at artiq-main/lib/python3.5/site-packages/artiq/binaries/kc705-nist_qc2/.  Seems like the artiq package and it's dependencies weren't installed.
Ok. Is there a problem other than the artiq package not getting installed? Are things working correctly after installing the artiq package manually?
Yes, everything works correctly after installing the artiq package manually.
So, it's #984.
