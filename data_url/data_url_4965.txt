Hello,
are there technical reasons which make it impossible to run QuEST distributed AND on GPUs?
Hi Al,
While not impossible, it hasn't proved worthwhile (here are some previous comments on this)
Thanks @TysonRayJones and sorry for not seeing the other issue! I’m offline these days, but I’ll add some comments soon!
No problem, it's hard to notice things in closed issues. I'll keep this issue open in case you want to pen further thoughts
