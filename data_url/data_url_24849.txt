This issue is meant as a unitaryHACK bounty issue.
Bounty: $75
We would like to make scqubits easier to use by providing more involved tutorials that describe its various features. Some of these are already present in this repository and can be explored interactively here.
The new jupyter notebook tutorial should present examples of interfacing scqubits with qutip.
This could include:
A more involved example could include doing some evolution as part of a custom ParameterSweep (see "Custom Sweeps" section of this notebook for ideas).
The final jupyter notebook tutorial should be added to this examples/tutorials repository.
Hi @petergthatsme,
I would like to work on this issue. Can you provide me some insights on where to start?
Hi @RamAIbot
I would guess a good starting point would be the tutorials we already have (see top post for links). That could give you a sense what's this one might look like.
There is a bit of freedom with what you choose to do, but the list of items I outlined might represent an easy way to get things going (i.e. see point form items in my top post).
Let me know if there is something specific that's not clear and we can go from there.
