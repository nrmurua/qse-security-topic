conda build ... --output regularly takes 5 and sometimes more than 20 minutes.

I've disabled the overclocking in the BIOS on build.lab.m-labs.hk so it should be stable now. We should move the builds to that faster machine.
I suspect this particular issue is from a large number of packages (in our conda channels, previous builds on disk, or in conda-forge). Might not even be CPU bound.
Yes, we should look at that too. But the new machine also has SSD.
That was due to the 26GB of trash in /var/lib/buildbot/slaves/debian-stretch-amd64-2/miniconda/conda-bld. I deleted it and it now "conda build output" takes a more reasonable time. We should clean up that folder regularly.
