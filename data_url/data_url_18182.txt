In #297, coverage testing was introduced. In the cmake it uses "coverage3",

but this is not part of the requirements:

Consequently, my build from source breaks.
@ajavadia , can you elaborate a bit? Do you mean that coverage3 (the binary) is not provided when you pip install coverage (the package)? If so, can you provide more info about your installation - the wheels for Python 3 seem to have an alias for coverage3 in most cases:
And the docs seem to point in that direction as well:
When you install coverage.py, a command-line script simply called coverage is placed in your Python scripts directory. To help with multi-version installs, it will also create either a coverage2 or coverage3 alias, and a coverage-X.Y alias, depending on the version of Python youâ€™re using. For example, when installing on Python 2.7, you will be able to use coverage, coverage2, or coverage-2.7 on the command line.
Hi @diego-plan9, thanks. I think the problem was with the pip version I was using on the new linux environment I was testing on. It is fixed now.
