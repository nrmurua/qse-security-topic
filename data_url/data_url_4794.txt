Stealing the idea from PennyLaneAI/pennylane#181 and @quantshah,
SF could use two new top-level functions sf.about() and sf.cite().
sf.about() would allow us to replace all the stuff below â†“
Strawberry Fields version:
This can be found by running
python -c "import strawberryfields as sf; print(sf.version())"
Python version:
This can be found by running: python --version
NumPy, SciPy, and Tensorflow versions:
These can be found by running
python -c "import numpy as np; import scipy as sp; import tensorflow as tf; print(np.version,sp.version,tf.version)"
