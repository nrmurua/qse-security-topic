Sometimes happens, sometimes it doesn't. It seemingly started today-ish.

So far, every time I've observed this, there has been an un-closed multiprocessing.Pool in another test. Which could be relevant or a red herring

As it turns out open multiprocessing.Pool instances are the culprit on python 3.7! It is easy to repro the situation by adding pool = multiprocessing.Pool() into test_api_retry_times. Closing, as this is not going to be an issue anymore.
