The original noise tutorial was written prior to the introduction of noisy ops into TFQ.  Now that we have these, a new tutorial is appropriate.  One idea is to base it on a well understood paper.  In the comments below, feel free to propose papers or other ideas on what this tutorial should look like.
I'm not sure if any of these are really "seminal" or well established enough, but maybe they can help generate some ideas:
Also, since every hardware experiment is noisy, maybe recreating experimental papers (w/ noise) is an idea:
Put a candidate tutorial up that makes use of our tfq.datasets module. I read through the list of papers here and a lot of them seemed pretty tricky to implement alongside an introduction to noise basics in TFQ so I opted to shorten up the recreating a paper from the wild part so that there was more room for this noise introduction. What do people think of #582 ?
