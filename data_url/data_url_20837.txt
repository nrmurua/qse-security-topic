In #156, it annoyed me a bit that I had to edit the compiler flags in every Makefile. This also makes it quite likely for these compiler flags to get out of sync when we have more than a handful of schemes.
Can we unify these somehow while still maintaining the 'you can build it as a standalone directory' idea?
I realize we've been over this a few times, and don't intend to re-hash the discussion of whether we need a Makefile, but I feel like the current situation is not optimal.
Can we unify these somehow while still maintaining the 'you can build it as a standalone directory' idea?
I don't think we can really do both, while also just using Makefiles â€“ we would really need something like CMakeLists.txt that supports a more recursive structure (in my understanding) with passing parameters somehow if we want to support both local customisation (needed for AVX2, etc), and stuff from elsewhere.
