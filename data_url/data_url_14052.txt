I pushed a branch at feature/init-varargs that simply tries to see if this works (it doesn't). My main use case here is to allow init to be called on multiple QRegisters without encapsulating them in an iterable first.
Starting a new branch a f.9.init-starargs.  Ideally this will allow general "varargs" functionality, but at the least it will be something that works for init()
@dellard is f.9.init-starargs in a working state? Should it be merged?
It got put on the back burner for various reasons.  I think it was in a good enough state to be useful, but not to solve the problem completely.  I'll take a look at it today and see whether merging it back would do more harm than good.
