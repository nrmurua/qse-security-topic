In this program error coming for minimize entropy
"TypeError: can't convert complex to float"
can you help me?
HI @Hosseinyeganeh ,
One possible issue I see is that taking the sine of a complex number does not work if you import it from math.
Would you try importing the sin and cos functions from cmath instead?
Something like from cmath import sin.
Note that the pow function in math doesn't work either, and you'll need to use ** instead (which you are, but I felt I should clarify).
Closing now due to lack of activity.  The problem is likely caused by from math import * shadowing many functions that should be called from numpy, as noted above.  (I take this opportunity to evangelise the belief that star-imports are evil and should be avoided in almost all situations.)
