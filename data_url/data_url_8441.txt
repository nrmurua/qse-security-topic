When I run ffmpeg -r 20 -b 1800 -i bloch_%01d.png bloch.mp4
from the User Guide's Generating Images for Animation
 section I get the following error:
What works for me instead is this:
ffmpeg -r 20 -i bloch_%01d.png -pix_fmt yuv420p bloch.mp4
Note: personally I print files as zeropadded 4-digit number, so I have %04d.png instead of bloch_%01d.png.
Thank you. Will look into this. I did run into some issues when making a movie of the density matrix evolution in the qutip.piqs overview notebook.
A minor documentation issue: the link to the Bloch sphere video, at the end of the page (with latest =4.2) is broken, as googlecode changed domain (now https://code.google.com/).
This issue seems related to #836.
This issue has been answered online on StackOverflow, exactly relative to the QuTiP question (!).  If I implement the fix though, the saved mp4 file is empty and another error is given,
which might be reported here too
matplotlib/matplotlib#12357
@nathanshammah I would like to take a stab at resolving this issue. Btw, I don't see any unitaryhack tag to this issue even though it is referenced over here https://unitaryfund.github.io/unitaryhack/participating-projects.html#qutip
@WingCode Apologies for the lack of label. UnitaryHack label added.
@WingCode please go on!
