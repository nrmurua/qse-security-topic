I'm using the novatech controller in an experiment.  If I try to call the novatech methods from the core device as below, I get an AssertionError.
If I wrap the novatech methods such that they are RPCs as below, I don't get an error.
I think it would be more convenient if all controller methods were RPCs by default.
You shouldn't be ever getting an assertion failure, that means a bug regardless of anything else (like whether the behavior is permitted). What is the backtrace? (Alternatively, what's your device_db?)
Backtrace:
device_db:
@whitequark I suppose your compiler doesn't like the custom __getattr__ of RPC clients.
