Parsing a qasm string including a custom gate definiton - as given by Gate.qasm() -  using QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str() returns QasmError: "Cannot find gate definition for 'test', line 6 file ".
This issue was reported in #3066, which was closed, but the issue persists.
from qiskit.circuit import Gate
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
test_gate = Gate('test',num_qubits=1,params=[])
test_qasm = 'OPENQASM 2.0;\ninclude "qelib1.inc";\n\nqreg q[2];\ncreg cr[2];\ntest q[0];\n'
test_circ = QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str(test_qasm)
Generate quantum circuit with custom gate without throwing error.
Custom gates should be opaque.
So does the functionality to create a circuit with custom gates from a qasm string exist?
In QASM, you can declare a custom opaque gate using the opaque statement, like
or a non-opaque gate using the gate statement like
In your example, you are defining a python Gate object in qiskit,  but the definition for that gate is not included the qasm string passed to QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str, leading to the error.
I did find a related bug in that user-defined Gate objects are not properly being exported to qasm as opaque gates. Is this the issue you're seeing?
Yes that's the issue I'm having Kevin - thanks.
@kdk 's example:
does not work because QuantumCircuit._add_sub_instruction_to_existing_composite_circuits() raises on the empty instruction list.
Indeed. Renaming the issue.
@kdk says:
the bug is that the qasm that’s generated is invalid (and thus fails during parsing). It’s a QASM2 exporter bug, not a from_qasm_str bug.
