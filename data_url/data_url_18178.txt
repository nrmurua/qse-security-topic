Defining a general opaque gate raises an error when unrolling into a circuit.
Either an opaque gate should be taken as-is and be left alone, or when it is defined in the basis it should be left alone when reading in OpenQASM.
My OpenQASM code
and parsing code
When reading in OpenQASM with an opaque gate definition I get the error
So I did the obvious, and added mygate to the basis of the CircuitBackend constructor. But this still gives an error:
It seems that QISKit is insisting on unrolling opaque gates into an explicit circuit description, even though they are defined as opaque. (Even I don't know what mygate is.)
It seems that there is some code for detecting opaque gates in the CircuitBackend, but it still only expects gates from the standard library. Instead there should be support of opaque gates in a QuantumCircuit object.
Another design decision is whether to allow opaque gates to exist outside of the defined basis.
I'm trying to generate images of quantum circuits using OpenQASM. The circuit is supposed to represent some general quantum circuit for some arbitrary unitary U followed by some measurements.
Yes we need to add opaque to qiskit.  @ewinston can you think about this the user will need to provide a definition of what it is as well.
Labelling this as a bug since we should explicitly say we are not currently supporting opaque gates instead of failing with non-clear error messages.
CircuitBackend is not a thing anymore. Therefore, I'm closing this. If this issue still exists in terms of the current code, please reopen and rename (and give a new way to reproduce it). Thanks!
