Typical use case:
The user wants to sweep two parameters of a pulse which has a measurement defined resulting in a NxM grid. The sweeping is repeated K times to reduce noise.
The averaging over each measurement window results in N * M * K data points which need to be converted into a N x M matrix by averaging over the K repetitions.
qctoolkit should provide means to make this easy for manual use and for integration in a an acquisition software like QCoDeS or special-measure. This means
This partly tackles #9
Or one could just provide some template pulses? This is essentially our charge scan...
I don't understand your question.
