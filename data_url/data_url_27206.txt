Hi, I tried running the hamiltonian-simulation code in the pycharm. I am getting the below error:

The directory structure of my program looks as below:

Please give suggestion on how to resolve this error?
Several of the benchmarks (hamiltonian, monte-carlo, vqe, and others) have their own _common directories at the benchmark directory level (i.e. parallel to qiskit, cirq, etc).  This is due to the fact that There is a version of the benchmark that executes in Qiskit, Cirq, and/or Braket.  They can sometime share common code or data files, even tho the main part of the benchmark is written differently.
In some of the more advanced benchmarks like the vqe, there are a whole lot of data files containing problem descriptions.
Basically, this is an issue for executing the benchmarks from IDE tools ... you need to essentially have the entire directory structure available for execution.
A python package could mitigate some of this, but then the package would have to be reconstructed after every check-in to run.  In its current, rapidly developing form, the team has held off on that.  But it is an option being considered.
For now, to execute in an IDE you need the whole structure for the more advanced benchmarks.
Thank you
