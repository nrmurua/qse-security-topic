Generate some simple circuits in qiskit, put these circuits into a list and then in a for loop, try to draw each circuit. Snippet below:
    circ_inputs = [qc1, qc2, qc3, qc4]
    for i, circuit in enumerate(circ_inputs):
        circuit.draw(output='mpl')
Using the show() method in the loop:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.show()
Does not resolve the issue as suggested in some qiskit issue posts.
In the above example, 4 plots should be shown, preferably one on top of the other.
May need a new implementation but returning the axes objects in some way from the 'QuantumCircuit' object method so that they can each be drawn in a loop.

At least on the jupyter backend I use, you can wrap the draw command with the jupyter display command to see all 4 outputs. This works whether using 'mpl', 'text', or 'latex'.
Yep, that seems to solve the issue. Thanks, @enavarro51!
