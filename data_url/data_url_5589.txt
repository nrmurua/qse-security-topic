The documentation of qiskit-aer seems to be unreachable. Also I get the following error for intersphinx
Can you point me to the new url (especially for the objects.inv)
Qiskit/ecosystem#611
Thank you for the report @MoritzWillmann and pardon the issue! This was a temporary problem from rolling out the redirects for qiskit.org to https://docs.quantum.ibm.com.
