Having a QuantumCircuit containing nested gates, such as PauliEvolutionGate, with different parameters leads to issues when translating these circuits to qasm strings. Qasm defines a new gate for these nested gates with parameters but discards gates that contain the same nested gates with different parameters.
The resulting qasm string looks like this, containing a duplicate definition of the gates exp_it_ZZ_ and exp_it_XI_:
The result is that only one definition of these gates is used, ignoring the fact that they are used multiple times with different parameterizations.
This is a problem when sending such circuits to the cloud and results in the wrong circuits bein evaluated.
Output:
qiskit.qasm.exceptions.QasmError: "Duplicate declaration for gate 'exp_it_Z_' at line 5, file .\nPrevious occurrence at line 3, file "
Qasm should define distinct gates for each nested gate with a distinct parameterization.
No response
The code below shows that this issue is more deeply rooted and does not only apply to the PauliEvolutionGate, but to nested gates generally.
Output Qasm string from print statement:
Error raised in the last line of code (same as above):
 qiskit.qasm.exceptions.QasmError: "Duplicate declaration for gate 'internal' at line 4, file .\nPrevious occurrence at line 3, file "
It seems like the exporter does not check the namespace of declared gates.
