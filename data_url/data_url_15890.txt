In making #6611 I noticed that the way we were applying pylint to the examples directory, as
only covers the top-level python directory but not the ibmq subdirectory. In #6597 I made the git path :(glob,top)examples/python/*.py rather than the more complete :/examples/*.py to avoid raising new pylint errors, but we should fixup the ibmq examples and cover them by the default lint rule.
Hi! May I work on this?
Sure, have at it
I believe this can be closed, as examples/python/ibmq no longer exists. see also #6649 (comment).
