Could you print what python's sys.getdefaultencoding() says your system's default encoding is? It looks like it's expecting some chinese-specific character encoding called GBK instead of UTF8?
I suspect I can fix this by replacing with open('README.md') as f: with with open('README.md', encoding="utf-8") as f: in setup.py, but in the meantime you should be able to work around the issue by changing your python' default encoding to UTF-8 (which has become so ubiquitous that it's kind of expected; I wouldn't be surprised if you run into similar issues a lot).

It's actually UTF8 by default...
Hm. I still think it's somehow a default encoding thing, given the error. Maybe pip has a different default or something. I'm going to make the change I mentioned, and then I'll ask you to try to pip install the dev version to see if it's actually fixed.
@inmzhang123 please verify that pip install stim==1.9.dev1648583208 works. If not, the error isn't fixed.

Great, it works!
