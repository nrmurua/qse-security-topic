Trying to run the Qutip propagator for a Hamiltonian that is a QobjEvo object does not work and will result in Invalid time-dependent format error.
Example of a piece of code.
propagator does not support QobjEvo yet.
If you are looking for solution for the problem prop = propagator([H,[H1,np.cos(tlist)]], tlist, []) will work. You can get [H,[H1,np.cos(tlist)]] using H_tot.to_list() if you already have a QobjEvo from somewhere else.
