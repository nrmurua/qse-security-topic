The following snippet fairly reliably triggers an assertion for me:
During compression, a 2Q compiler tries to calculate a kernel and gets frustrated that it's just above the numerical threshold to be considered nonempty.
This is probably pretty far from a MWE, but I'd like to make sure that a solution to a MWE solves this problem. Doesn't seem to happen for j ≤ 5.
Nice find.
