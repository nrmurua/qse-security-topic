I tried to install cp2k to our workstation.
The problem happend when I install elpa and other libraries by toolchain with following command:
./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh --math-mode=mkl --mpi-mode=intelmpi --with-cmake=install --with-libxsmm=install --with-mkl=system --with-fftw=install --with-reflapack=no --with-scalapack=no --with-sirius=no --with-cosma=no --with-plumed --with-gsl=install --with-hdf5=install --with-superlu=install --with-libvori=no -j 4
'male.log' of elpa said /usr/bin/env: ‘python’: Permission denied because my workstation has python at /usr/bin/python3, and  it works only withpython3 command, not python command.
It seems that it comes from './build/elpa-2020.05.001/remove_xcompiler'.
To recognize the python path, I tried:
Dose anybody know how to set python path when installing elpa by toolchain?
Verified, the remove_xcompiler in ELPA still refers to python.
@akkadaska the easiest workaround for now would be to provide a python binary somewhere, which can be a symlink to /usr/bin/python3. Without rebuilding everything and since I don't know which paths you have in your $PATH environment variable, I believe creating a symlink in the cmake bin folder might be the easiest:
and then run your install_cp2k_toolchain.sh command again to continue.
Looks good to me. By creating symlink in cmake bin folder, it recognize the python symlink and remove_xcompiler runs.
Since it still fails to build without binary, I don't close this issue. If it should be closed, please do so.
Thank you very much @dev-zero .

We still need to fix it properly, you are right to leave it open.

お力になれて幸いです
We should just upgrade to ELPA 2020.11 where they officially switched to Python 3.
@oschuett sure, please go ahead, might also need a patch/minor release for v8.1
