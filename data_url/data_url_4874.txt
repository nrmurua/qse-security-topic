Add a general driver...
Based on examples quil_simple_circuit_read.c and projectq_vqe_1good.c. Add JSON files (one for run parameters (dt, etc.), one for device parameters (T1, T2, etc.) and one for the circuit definition. Might also use Python embedded to make the config files instead (or just expose as a Python library - maybe make a Qiskit backend - https://medium.com/qiskit/qiskit-backends-what-they-are-and-how-to-work-with-them-fb66b3bd0463)
Modify circuit builder to make multiple gates run at the same time.
Per qubit T1,T2 times plus coupling parameters. Also, may have different values "during gates" than otherwise.
Measurements: Need to add a measurement operator to QuaC.
Gate errors: We need to figure out the modeling approach (but see note about changing T1/T2/etc. during gates). Add errors on angles for rotations.
May also add random rotations to other gates, maybe random Clifford gates, etc.
For initial parameters database, see https://www.rigetti.com/qpu ; https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/editor ;
For leakage: subtract amplitudes and renormalize. Remember the overall factor.
Add time-dependent gate operators.
