On Windows 7 64-bit, using ARTIQ version 2.3 from the m-labs conda repository, trying to run any of the artiq commands from a command prompt fails with "failed to create process" error:
That's a conda bug, iirc worked around in artiq 2.4.
@philipkent Assuming 2.4 had already fixed this, I'll close it.
