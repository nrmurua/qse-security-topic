Encountered this issue when using Jupyter lab to view a .json file. Apparently Jupyter now checkpoints json files, which causes an issue with config.load(). Briefly looked into it, couldn't see any glaring causes so I'm just working around it for now.
This is similar to #63, they can probably be tackled simultaneously.
