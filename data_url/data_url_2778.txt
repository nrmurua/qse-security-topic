By far the most annoying part of getting a developer environment is acquiring a version of the protobuf compiler that can build proto v3. If we just included protos generated for 2.7, we could make this step unnecessary (unless you wanted to change the protos, which is very rare and mostly driven internally).
Another alternative is that we get rid of the precompiled code all together.  The proto file is mostly used for typing info, but I think in the engine code could just use dictionaries.  And our to_proto could just product dictionaries, I think.  @lindmarkm is this true?
Yes. The api client code actually uses dictionaries. The protos are nice for conveying the spec of the program and results but proto in general seems to be a pain to deal with in python and if the compiler is also a problem we should probably just avoid them.
