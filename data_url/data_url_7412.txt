requirements
Hello! I started working on an example and I wanted to ask what is the easiest way to view deployed page? Can I get workflows approved or do I have to build it myself? I made a PR #398
Hi @radras thanks for joining the unitary hack! The easiest way to view deploy page is to generate the notebook via Literate, which can generate either a notebook or markdown file (it's not exactly the webpage we build, but close enough)
Hi @Roger-luo can I get assigned to this issue Thank you
