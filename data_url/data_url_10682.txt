This code does not run successfully. Here is the error message:
I think the cause of this error is treatment of qubit variable label.
For example in this case :
In BinaryQuadraticModel, the qubit variable label is [624, 625, 627, 628, 629, 630].
but, In unembed_sampleset, the qubit variable label is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6].
Environment:
I would like to apologize for my poor English.

Thanks for the bug report! I took a look and this has actually uncovered some problems with the way that the chain_breaks are implemented.
You are correct that the problem is the qubit/variable labels. Specifically, the chain break resolution methods have the following api: cbf(samples, chains) where samples is an array-like of the sample values and chains is an iterable of chains where the chains are defined in terms of the columns of the samples.
MinimizeEnergy meanwhile accepts a bqm and an embedding on construction, which means we have a mapping from the binary quadratic model to the target graph labels (in this case the qubit labels). What is missing is map from the target graph labels to the columns of samples.
Here is a deterministic version of the failing example from above:
This cannot be fixed under the current API. One solution would be to pass sample set and embedding into the chain break resolution methods, rather than just the samples and chains. We could also accept samples and chains for backwards compatibility reasons.
