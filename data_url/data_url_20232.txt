Hello, I tried to compile it on Ubuntu 18.04.04, and I get the following errors:

I tried to compile it a few moments ago.

@Septien, could you try re-compiling with liboqs at this commit?
If that doesn't work, could you walk me through your build process in more detail? Are you building liboqs using our fork of OpenSSL or using the OpenSSL distributed by Ubuntu 18.04? Have you tried the instructions here?
Closing issue.  If you're still encountering the problem, please re-open the issue or start a new issue.
