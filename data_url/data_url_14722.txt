While other tutorials in Qiskit tend to lead the user through some story, explaining concepts and showing them in practice, Advanced Circuits starts with Opaque Gates without introducing any text about why they could be useful and in what context.
I tried to have a go at it myself, but the Gate documentation on its own does not help very much.
Similarly, "Composite Gates", while a bit more self-explanatory, lack some text that would make reading the tutorial more natural. I am afraid that in the current shape the tutorial looks unfinished and somehow not ready for release.
Ideal improvement would be to add some text surrounding the code, explaining why and when it could be useful.
Suggested by AG on Slack, Gate appears to be a parent class for UnitaryGate, which looks very similar, but provides a constructor to create the gate from data.
I suppose my question is: what is the actual intended use of the black-box gate and how could the tutorial be updated to reflect that?
