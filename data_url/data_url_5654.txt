Aer Estimator crashes while running simulation.
Script below
I create a parameter placeholder at the beginning.
After prepending the circuit with ZFeatureMap and several compositions
the final circuit obtains a non-zero global phase represeneted as a linear
combination of placeholder's entries. I do NOT change the global phase
myself, rather this is the outcome of aforementioned operations.
At the time of evaluation, the linear combination of placeholder's entries
cannot not be cast to a float value causing an exception.
In the simple example below, I reproduced the behaviour by explicitely
expressing the global phase as a sum of two placeholder entries.
Note, the default estimator works without a problem.
Checking of global phase before evaluation is needed.
Thank you for your report. This is a bug. Latest Aer cannot handle parameters in the global phase.
