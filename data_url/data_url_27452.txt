There have been instances in the past where a process performing a measurement will be writing to an hdf5 file, while a user attempts to load the file from another process to perform analysis. In this case, there is a possibility that the reader will somehow cause the data to become corrupted.
A potential solution to this is to move all hdf5 file use towards the single-writer multiple-reader framework, which addresses this issue directly. The main drawback of this is that older version of hdf5 (h5py) will be unable to load these new files, but that shouldn't be a problem as the current required version of h5py is >= 2.6 (which includes SWMR).
This was originally flagged in #217.
