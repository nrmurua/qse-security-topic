SciPost took it upon themselves to reformat the output listing of the example: to make it fit into the relatively narrow text column, they left-adjusted the first iter. column (which I didn't notice until the very last proof). This means that the paper is technically lying w.r.t. krotov version 0.5, but we can modify print_table to match the output shown in the paper to fix it in release 1.0. It does make for a more compact table, so it's not a terrible idea anyway.
