Patrick, Simon and I decided to move the generation of voltage values per sample via interpolation from TablePulseTemplates into a get_interpolated_voltage_values method of TablePulseTemplate. Sequencer (and corresponding classes) should make use of this method and hence some interfaces need to be adapted.
