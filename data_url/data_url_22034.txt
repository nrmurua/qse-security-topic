Using the 3.0 release on a KC705, connected to a 100M switch, I get a 'malformed packet' error from the core device on average every 20s.
This may be related to #837
I could log malformed packets so that it's easy to tell if they are benign or not. Your case is likely to be benign though, just some network background radiation.
Core device now logs the complete packet under DEBUG log level, please open an issue per type of malformed packet you see (unless it is something benign).
Maybe we should lower the log level for the malformed ingress packet to DEBUG.
