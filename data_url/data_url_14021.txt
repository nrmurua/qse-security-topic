If a qgl2decl function calls a helper that in turn calls the first function, the inliner gets stuck in an endless loop.
See for example cliffords_seq which calls entangling_seq which in turn calls cliffords_seq.
If possible, break up that loop, and then things work better I think. But I'd like the inliner to warn if you hit this situation.
