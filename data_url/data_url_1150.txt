#1825 added --actually-quiet parameter to check/pytest to suppress progress output from pytest in travis logs.
This is done by piping through grep -Pv '^(.\[0m)?[\.FEsx]+(.\[36m)?\s+\[\s*\d+%\](.\[0m)?$' which detects lines like
accounting for the possibility of color codes being present.
However, this does not work in the windows tests build. E.g. https://travis-ci.com/quantumlib/Cirq/jobs/216688375
The grep filter needs to be modified somehow, but I'm not sure how. I think pytest uses colorama https://github.com/tartley/colorama/ for cross-platform coloring, but it's not clear to me why this would cause the filter to fail.
I worry a bit about --actually-quiet parameter because if you don't know about it, travis logs can be less useful (why doesn't it show the tests running like when I use check locally).
A data point: I thought everything was broken during #1992 because there was no terminal output (in addition to the wonky matplotlib behavior)
@mpharrigan @dabacon You don't find that the amount of dot output was becoming problematically large? When a test fails, the output is hidden way down instead of being right in view.
If there was some way for us to trigger Travis' log folding behavior on the progress, that would solve both issues.
Still a problem after move to Github Actions.
