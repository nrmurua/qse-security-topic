The purpose of the Pulse class is currently unclear and needs to be refined.
In the current design, it adds no real value but I feel like some representation of pulses as instantiated pulse templates is required.
@j340m3 and I decided that currently no pulse class is needed and we will thus not spend time and effort in its creation until the need for one arises.
