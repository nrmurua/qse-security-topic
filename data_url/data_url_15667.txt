The adjoint operator corresponds to taking the transpose of the complex conjugate of an operator. However CircuitOp(PauliGateEvolution(...)).adjoint() only applies the complex conjugate.
Printing the matrix corresponding to evolution_gate and its adjoint gives:
The expected answer should be
Since this is a Lie Trotter decomposition the matrix corresponding to evolution_gate is not necessarily Hermitian, however looking at the printed circuits:
it seems that qiskit is taking the adjoint by multiplying by -1 the time, which is true for Hermitian matrices but not for a Lie Trotter decomposition. To correctly apply the adjoint it would have to also reverse the order of the operators, i.e.
Also, totally minor, but the label in the drawer needs some more brackets!
This has been addressed with #7524.
