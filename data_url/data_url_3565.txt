It would be nice to have another example of the kraus operators for the naive depolarizing noise model.
In particular, I've  found it useful to add in NQ depolarizing channels to assess whether circuits are performing as expected under noise, and NQ depolarizing channels factor out easily to the end of a circuit. (But I've only been doing N <= 2)
Unfortunately, I don't think this scales very well. @ntezak I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.
I drafted up something like what I want in the above PR. (#494)
