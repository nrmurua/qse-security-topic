it seems very hard to compile quip with intel fortran.
the third error is that the download link of sirius 7.0.0 reads a 404 error.
https://github.com/electronic-structure/SIRIUS/archive/v${sirius_ver}.tar.gz
the right location on github is https://github.com/electronic-structure/SIRIUS/tree/v7.0.0

@alas-go I can't reproduce this:
Can you please try the command above on your machine and report the error? My guess is that your wget has location-follow on 302 disabled or that some variable substitution fails for some reason.
it is ok to download sirius-7  at  very low connetting speed after typing in this commond in a terminal.

Well, no idea about the low speed, but since we're using wget I don't see what else could go wrong in the toolchain. Also, I can not reproduce from multiple sites. I would attribute this to a spurious error on GH side. Please reopen if you can reproduce this with the toolchain script and can provide more info.
The download process of latest SIRUS 7.0.2 can not been finished. several hours passed, it only downloaded 15.5 MB，and the terminal stuncked but the size of early editon 7.0.0 is 55 MB. I also download it from github, it is sure that the package is only 15 MB and it report an unexpected ending when tar -xvf to uncompress. I don't think the main problem is the slow connection speed of the internet. kindly, please upload the file fullpack SIRUS 7.0.2 to www.cp2k.org/static/downloads as soon as possible.
thks.
