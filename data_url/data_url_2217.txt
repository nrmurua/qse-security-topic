You beat me to this! An example of how we want this to behave:
The multiplication symbol represents the tensor product here
In your example, * should denote plain (matrix) multiplication, not the tensor product. The tensor product is implicit in the fact that cirq.X(bit_0) represents X ⊗ I, cirq.X(bit_1) represents I ⊗ X, etc.
