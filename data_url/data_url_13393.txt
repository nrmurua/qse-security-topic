A point of feedback we have gotten is that it is hard to know how to get started with Mitiq. Some is because we don't have an example of the technique they are interested in, or for the backend they are using. This roadmap task covers adding a "quick start" section to the docs and adding short samples (if possible in Jupyter notebooks) that can show how to get started with Mitiq in a variety of settings and mitigation methods.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
