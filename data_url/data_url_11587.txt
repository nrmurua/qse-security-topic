When repackaging qiskit-aqua for NixOS, the following error test fails.
Ref: NixOS/nixpkgs#95713 (review)
(Optional, exact reproduction of build):
Test https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/32595efa34f54f55555ede886e38db9ee87c4344/test/aqua/test_optimizers.py#L65-L69 should pass.
It looks like this is failing because the P_BFGS algorithm distributes the optimization task to more cores than the test expected, and then the number of evaluations is too high even if it finds a solution quickly. Maybe you could either raise the number of evaluations or have the evaluations depend on the number of CPU cores somehow?
We can limit the number of processes it would use for the test, since it has that as a constructor parameter - that maybe the simplest solution here.
Great, thank you!
