When I try and use the timing_constraints kwarg (incorrectly) I get an error when it is attempting to print the actually error message.
What I was trying to do is see if this arg can be used to set a minimum duration for inserted delays, but I think this arg is actually supposed to be making delays multiples of this value?
running the example code with this extra kwarg:
raises
It should have printed the actual error message for me using the kwarg incorrectly (if thats what I was doing wrong).
Fix the error message.
Separately is there a way to set a minimum delay duration using this pass without truncating everything to multiples of this value? (@nkanazawa1989)
About the error message, the problem here is that the prev_node is being passed as a DAGInNode, which doesn't has the name and qargs attributes.
In my tests I've changed the dynamic_decoupling.py file to this:
Once the DAGOpNode class has these attributes, we can check if the node is an instance of it and whether not , just left empty or with other value.
This is just a preliminary test, There might be another way to fix it, but if the prev_node.name and prev_node.qargs aren't used in other functions/contexts, maybe just changing the error message could be a good solution.

Can you give me more context? You just reschedule your instruction with some minimum interval?
