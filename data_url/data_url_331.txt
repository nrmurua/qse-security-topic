The nvq++ driver wrongly reports arguments as ignored. The problem is that this argument is not handle by the driver script, nvq++, but by the scripts which configure the target, <install_dir>/targets/quantinuum.config.
Do not report the argument as being ignored.
Not a regression
No response
The mechanism for handling target command line options is very odd, IMHO. Why are all the options forwarded? Why does the secondary script need them? Why should it sift through all the chaff?
We just need to be able to have target backends expose extra command line options. If there's a better way to do, let us know and we'll implement it that way.
Assigning to @boschmitt for a temporary fix for the next release. After that, we should consider how to proceed with the drive holistically, and possibly make the config files actual configs (e.g. yml) following a specified format.
Let's put this on the discussion docket...
Fixed. Unrecognized options are handed off to clang++ now.
