import qiskit, or from qiskit import *, etc.
Qiskit should get imported.
Just as was said in slack this is showing you that it can not find the compiled c extension modules for stochastic swap and this is not enough information to debug a local packaging issue on your system. We build and publish precompiled binaries on windows for both 32bit and 64bit on all supported python versions (you can see them hosted on pypi here: https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-terra/#files ). In addition an sdist is uploaded which pip will fallback to if it can't find a binary wheel to install for your system which will trigger a compilation of the c extensions. If any of these fail pip will error with what went wrong.
To start actually being able to assist you with this issue you need to specify how you installed terra, any output from those install commands, and if the state of your anaconda virtualenv prior to installing. It might be worth starting from scratch and creating a new venv and running whatever your install command was again that fresh env to ensure that a previously bad state isn't interferring with something. Python packaging can be weirdly sticky and mess itself up by not properly cleaning things. This is why current advice is to always install in a venv to make it easy to rebuild and not interfere with other python packages.
Thank you. Yep, I tried to install it in a venv but didn't work too. I am trying now to uninstall everything and re-install again
any news @rodriguerizk ?
If I understand this correctly, this is not an issue. Feel free to reopen otherwise!
I am facing a similar issue now.
So I followed the exact same steps to start contributing to my first issue as mentioned here: https://youtu.be/QjZdvNgYl3s?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY
When I ran pip install -e .
I get the following error:
But I still proceed to run python and import qiskit, which produces the same error:
As it says in this line
you seem to be missing a/the correct C++ compiler.
Thanks, I downloaded the wrong version of Visual studio which caused the problem
I am facing a similar problem. I tried to "import qiskit" in jupyter notebook. I am new at coding so don't judge me???
