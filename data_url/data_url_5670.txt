i have installed cuquantum and update path but still when i use custatevec="on" this gives error
from qiskit import *
from qiskit.circuit.library import *
from qiskit.providers.aer import *
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sim = AerSimulator(method='statevector', device='GPU')
shots = 100
depth=10
time_thrust= []
time_cuStateVec= []
qubits_list = []
for qubits in range (15, 26):
qubits_list.append(qubits)
circuit = QuantumVolume(qubits, depth, seed=0)
circuit.measure_all()
plt.yscale("log")
plt.plot(qubits_list, time_thrust, marker="o", label='ThrustGPU')
plt.plot(qubits_list, time_cuStateVec, 'g', marker="x", label='cuStateVec')
plt.legend()
###output
Simulation failed and returned the following error message:
ERROR: Failed to load qobj: Simulation device "GPU" does not support cuStateVec on this system
sucessfull simultation
The error ERROR: Failed to load qobj: Simulation device "GPU" does not support cuStateVec on this system only occurs when Qiskit Aer is not built correctly with cuStateVec support.
Please check if AER_ENABLE_CUQUANTUM=True and CUQUANTUM_ROOT=path_to_cuQuantum is set correctly.
Let me close this issue because no response in three weeks. Feel free to reopen this or open new issue if a problem remains.
