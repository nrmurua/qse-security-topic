... so that versioneer does not get confused by project tags (for phaser, smoltcp etc).
Needs duplication of the last tags in release-2 and master, needs changes in versioneer config.
OK but then we should rename release-2 to at least release-2.x so that people don't get confused. Because if I can check out release-2 and release-2.0 that is confusing.
That said, will versioneer even not get confused by the branch with the same prefix by itself?
Ack. I don't think it gets confused by that branch vs tag. But will check.
just use version-x.y tags.
vX.Y.Z seems to be most common format here on GitHub.
I would also voted for vX.Y but that seems to pollute the namespace a bit too much.
vX.Y is great but I believe that this issue exists precisely because versioneer cannot cope with the v prefix. I.e. it treats anything starting with v (say, a branch called "virtual") as a release, and then breaks in an obscure way.
Arguably versioneer should be fixed.
If we're going to mess with versioneer, we can also keep the current tags and make it recognize only those that consist in a version number.
@jordens Also, a pragmatic solution is to use tags for versions only, and put other commit IDs elsewhere, e.g. in the wiki.
Versioneer seems a bit tedious to fix anyway, they've had a corresponding issue open for more than a year. python-versioneer/python-versioneer#110
Can we go with using tags only for versions? This is the only thing versioneer actually supports.
Ok. Let's use well-organized branches to store/tag things then, i.e. old/phaser.
OK.
