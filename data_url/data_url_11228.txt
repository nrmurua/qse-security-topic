when importing openfermioncirq in colab,
from scipy.misc import comb, factorial causes problem "cannot import name comb"
You are using older version of OpenFermion (0.9.0). Please reinstall OpenFermion on Colab and see that it's version is 0.10.0 and try the import again.
Seems that some people are having issues with this when using pip to install openfermion; does this need to be updated to 0.10.0?
Yes, we need to cut a new release of OpenFermion.
I still have this issue with openfermion==0.11.0.
@mstechly What command is giving you an issue? How can we reproduce it?
I was getting the same issue with pip install. pip list showed OpenFermion at 0.9.0. Using developer install was the only way I could get it to update, which fixed the issue.
Is the pip version not updated? Perhaps it would be better to clarify on the readme if this is the case.
@warrenalphonso pip install openfermion installs 0.11.0, which is the latest version, for me. Can you try doing that in a fresh virtual environment?
Oops you're right, my mistake.
@kevinsung couldn't reproduce it, sorry...
It pops in my code from time to time, I'll keep my eye on it and will let you know when it appears again – this time with reproducible example.
@kevinsung FYI: it seemed actually the version of the library was overwritten somewhere in my project to be 0.10.0 instead of 0.11.0.
I think this issue can be closed.
This issue is fixed in the latest pip version of OpenFermion and OpenFermion-Cirq.
