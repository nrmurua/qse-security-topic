The iterative phase estimation class is not generating the correct circuit, causing the algorithm to behave incorrectly. The fix is very simple too, the controlled unitary is just using the incorrect qubit as the control.
Consider the unitary $T \otimes T$. This has the following (eigenvector, eigenvalue) pairs
The following code runs QPE and IQPE using the fourth eigenvector, eigenvalue pair.
The above should generate the output
Both algorithms should predict the same phase of 0.25, since $e^{2 \pi  i * 0.25} = i$. However, as the output above will show, IQPE outputs 0.125. A similar mistake can be observed for the second case.
I was able to fix this very easily by changing line 122 of the file https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/algorithms/phase_estimators/ipe.py:
Before:
After:
Reason for change:
The control qubit should be the phase_register which is the final qubit, not the first qubit.
Personal note:
If possible I'd like to make the PR for this change, as it'll be my first code contribution to Qiskit.
@shifubear thanks for reporting this! It would be great if you want to fix this as a first contribution, see e.g. here for some guidance if you want: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md. Updating this would also require adding a test to ensure that the behavior is now fixed, ideally in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/test/python/algorithms/test_phase_estimator.py.
This was fixed by #9887 but was not closed at the time. So closing it now.
