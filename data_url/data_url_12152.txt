As the picture shows,when i execute the circuit on qasm_simulator or ibmq_qasm_simulator ,it works well.But if i excute circuit on ibmqx2 ,ibmq_16_melbourne or ibmqx4,it will report an error.
I want to know whether the reset operation works but currently only in simulation.Can the reset operation work on ibmq_poughkeepsie or ibmq_20_tokyo?
Reset operations are not currently supported on the devices. Only simulators at present.
@nonhermitian Thanks for your reply.Is it possible to achieve on devices in the future?I would appreciate it very much if you can share me some paper about the achievement of reset operation just by link.
I can not speak to future work.  However, the devices are constantly improving.
