hi,
I tested cp2k 7.1 with libint 2.6.0(--enable-eri3=1 --with-eri3-max-am=7,6) on aarch64 linux, but cp2k.popt failed.
"CALL pbuild(lib%prv)" in cp_libint_get_3eris function faild. It seems that libint2_build_3eri has not been set and all are zero, so  "CALL pbuild(lib%prv)" will call a NULL function pointer. Where libint2_build_3eri is initialized or set?
thank you!
Can you post the complete configure invocation for libint. Please note that the configure options you posted are not enough. We are using the following to generate a CP2K-"compatible" libint:
with LMAX=4,5,6,7. You can find the different generated libint versions here: https://github.com/cp2k/libint-cp2k/releases/tag/v2.6.0 (they are not compiled, only code-generated, hence these tarballs should work on aarch64 as well).
It's been 28 days without reply. @arm7star, feel free to reopen when you have more details to share.
