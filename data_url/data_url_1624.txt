Description of the issue
Sometimes you optimize a circuit containing an X, Y, or PhasedX rotation gate with zero angle.  Rotations with zero angle are equivalent to identity but come up in generated circuits.  cirq.EjectPhasedPoaulis().optimize_circuit(circuit) incorrectly resets the angle to Ï€ (or 1 half-turn) resulting in an circuit not equivalent to the input.
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
0.12.0.dev
