Why is my CNOT Gate not displayed in the drag and drop menu?
Everything else seems to be fine.
Thanks
Put “X” gate to one wire and then put “dot” to another wire (below or above “X” gate) and you’ll get CNOT gate. See video in docs section (it is under construction, but there is video)

Thanks Perak,
I was following the video and as you can see from my picture, I have no X gate (NOT) to drag.
Best, Michael
“X” gate is next to “ID” gate.
Between ID and Y gates
Oh Sorry Perak !
I was looking for the old circular symbol in the drag and drop menu.
Thank You.
No problem! :) BTW, I changed it to “X” because users complained that they cannot find NOT gate, now I have opposite - users cannot find CNOT gate. Do you have idea how to make it obvius for both? (Maybe to add both X and circled X (bulb) symbols?
