Description of the issue
How to reproduce the issue
Run pytest in cirq-core/, using Python 3.11.2.
Cirq version
1.1.0
I think this is important to fix soon, should be relatively straightforward and would unblock support for Python 3.11
cc @navaro1 - In case you are looking for important things to work upon. I'll get back to your serialization PR soon; that one was more ambiguous in terms of requirements so it's taking longer than usual.
@tanujkhattar, feel free to assign to me.
@tanujkhattar, FYI: #6181
This is now fixed and Python 3.11 tests are added to CI after #6191
