This is a first step in exposing more config params (#357).
Polling is controlled by Client._POLL_BACKOFF_MIN and Client._POLL_BACKOFF_MAX class attributes. We shall turn them in a default value placeholders, and allow override on Client construction.
At the same time, we'll decrease the _POLL_BACKOFF_MIN from 1s to 50ms to increase responsiveness in cases the answer is available sooner.
