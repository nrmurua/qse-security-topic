The current circuit representation is flat.  Meaning that a circuit is simply a list of primitive gates.
It is necessary to implement higher level structures to handle gates (or sub-circuits) that might be defined by a user.  Then I circuit could be a mixed list of primitive and user defined gates.
This is not relevant anymore.
