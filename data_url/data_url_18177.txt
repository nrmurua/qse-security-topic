When running make I get an error for not having conda installed.
Either require Anaconda explicitly for building (I would not prefer this) or support a normal python installation.
I use pipenv for managing my virtual environments and installed & sourced the dependencies. Then I run make and get this message:
In effect, this probably does not matter since I have already installed the dependencies in an other way.
Check with pip if the requirements are already included in the environment, and install them only if they are missing.
Add a fallback for normal python.
I am trying to make qiskit so I can contribute changes.
Thanks, @eddieschoute ! As hinted in slack a few days ago, I believe the issue can be attributed to a combination of three separate ones:
We'll give it a look at the full situation after the upcoming release, and see if we can ensure that these points are reflected and avoid confusion - thanks for raising awareness and for the rationale!
I agree that documentation for users and contributors have different goals. Mainly I feel like there are no clear build instructions for qiskit. Even a quick code snippet with a sequence of commands could help. For me on Mac it is (thanks @atilag ):
then a user may import the built package from dist by untarring it and running pip -e ..
It is definitely harder to engineer for allowing a larger set of development tools, but at the least common denominator still includes the basic build process and dependency management. From there people can use their own tools (such as pipenv or conda).
After the latest round of changes, hopefully things improved on the documentation side:
This seems to have been addressed. @eddieschoute, re-open if you feel something is missing yet.
