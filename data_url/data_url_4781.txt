We should deprecate Measure. It doesn't really serve the same purpose as MeasureX and MeasureP (which are shortcuts to MeasureHomodyne with specific values of phi), except for typing 4 less characters.
At the same time, it makes the documentation confusing, and goes against the zen of Python:
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

What's the deprecation policy in Strawberry Fields? Do we use DeprecationWarning?
We haven't officially deprecated anything in SF yet, but when we deprecated qml.expval.Observable in PennyLane, we used DeprecationWarning. So let's use it here as well.
