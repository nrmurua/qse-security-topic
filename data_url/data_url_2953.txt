We use abstract classes a lot for things like gate features and the extension mechanism. mypy barfs on this, for example:
One way to fix this would be to make these concrete classes, and explicitly raise NotImplemented errors instead of relying on the abstract base class machinery to do this. It might also be possible to use mypy protocols instead of mixins.
