Hi!
I'm investigating the possibility of replacing some of our PDH laser locking electronics with a Redpitaya. I'm new to the RP, so before settling on getting one I want to investigate the feasibility.
Essentially, I'd like to make two modifications to the pyrpl setup:
On a scale from "there's a boolean flag in the API for that" to "start shopping for VCOs", how doable is this?
