I am trying to solve the Measurement Task 1.8 AllZerosOrWState. As far as I can tell, I solved correctly, but the test fails. (Actually pasting the solution from referenceImplementation.qs still results in a failing test)
Debugging the test, I noticed a ArgumentOutOfRange exception for the angle returned by ArcSin(). It returns NaN. I tried some more ratios and this is the result:

I expected a double in all cases.
I can not reproduce this, so I'm not sure what's going on here...
For N = 2 the value of inverse you got is 10.0/sqrt, not 1.0/sqrt as the code says, in which case theta would indeed be undefined, since the value of sin can not be 7. But values of alpha, beta and gamma are completely independent from theta being NaN, and don't reset to NaN even if the rotation gate throws an exception. Are you quite sure that all the code and the debug values from the screenshots are from the same build and test run?
Somehow, the decimal separator is ignored. I get the expected values when I do:


Any idea why this might be happening?
Could you provide more details on what language and region settings you have, and what OS?
My language setting is Dutch. The dutch language setting by default uses a , as a decimal separator and a . as a thousands separator. I swapped those around and now it works like it should. I did not expect this Windows setting to affect the passing and failing of tests, but it works.
Thanks for the help.
We're looking at it with the compiler team to figure out the best way to fix it. I'm not sure yet whether the fix will be on the compiler side, in the katas or both, but a fix there will be :-)
An update: this issue should be fixed in 0.5 release (coming up in the end of February). The compiler will always treat . as a decimal separator regardless of language settings.
