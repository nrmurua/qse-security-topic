See the log.
Version: 1.6.0

Thanks for raising this. The tests that are failing are due to a bug in scipy #815. What version of scipy are you using? Was openfermion installed via pip?
From here it looks like the additional upper limit on scipy isn't being pulled in from https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion/blob/master/dev_tools/requirements/deps/runtime.txt.
We have scipy-1.11.1
OpenFermion was installed using the FreeBSD port, not pip.
How are your build dependencies pulled in? Do you manually edit the Makefile?
Or should these changes be pulled automatically from the openfermion requirements?

Unfortunately, in the context of the ports framework we can't pull arbitrary versions of dependencies, because the dependency packages have fixed versions.
This explains the problem, thank you.
We will wait for the fix in scipy then.
Ok, thanks for your understanding! I'll keep this open for the moment so we can track it.
@yurivict this scipy issue is now resolved so I will close this. I will cut a new patch release shortly and (hopefully) these test failures will disappear.
