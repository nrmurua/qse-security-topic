python version 3.10.11
I'm trying to give RXXGate a parameter phi when I encounter this error:
ParameterExpression with unbound parameters ({Parameter(a)}) cannot be cast to a float.
Here is my codes:
However, it's interesting that everything works fine if the control method isn't used:
which can give the result:
I'm wondering what I've done wrong and how to fix it?
Besides, is it possible for me to make this parameter trainable for optimization tasks like using gradient descend?
Perhaps making the Parameter class more flexible can help.
I suppose the gate should take this parameter and give it a random(or zero) initialization.
No response
You can stop the error even without assigning any value in control()

This error is raised from the following method.

Check PR #10244 .
I strongly suspect that this is the same root as #7326, because the internal definition of the multi-controlled $R_{xx}$ gate will use CU, which has issues in Qiskit at the moment.  There's a potential fix in #9118 that I've just bumped up the priority list, because it keeps getting forgotten (by me - sorry!).
Thanks for pointing out, hope to see the update soon!
Sorry to come back to this after a long time with somewhat bad news: this isn't related to #9118, and the problem is that some of our controlled-gate synthesis code can't cope with parametrised gates in certain circumstances.  In particular, we fail if asked to control a parametric RZGate with more than a single control state:
That example is the root cause of your bug.
@ewinston, @alexanderivrii: do you two have any ideas of how we might go about modifying the synthesis to allow this?
This is related to issue #10311.
