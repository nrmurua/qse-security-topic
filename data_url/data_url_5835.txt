The output of the Qiskit transpiler when a circuit is scheduled is a circuit with a bunch of delay instructions. So when compiling to a large device the circuit will contain delays on idle qubits.
Ideal aer simulator should treat those delays as no-op, and simulate a much smaller circuit.
e.g. qubits 0, 5, 6 should not be simulated in the circuit below.

Fixed in 0.9.0
