The old SDRAM code supported Spartan 6 and Artiz 7 memory PHYs that have hardcoded write/read leveling through the DQS clocks. The new rust sdram init code breaks this (and therefore Kasli).

New init code also broken when handling the Kasli Ethernet PHY.

For the record, when I have ported the SDRAM init code, I have taken great care to port every code path. The code you're referring to postdates the Rust port (as discussed).
Sure. Until the new code (in ARTIQ) replaces the old one (still current in MiSoC), forking means twice the work.
