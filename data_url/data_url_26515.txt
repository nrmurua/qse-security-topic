The test SIRIUS/regtest-1/He-full-potential.inp gives with GCC 12.1 and OpenBLAS 0.3.20 the following SIGSEGV error in the routine zgemv_n_4.c:499
This is possibly an issue of GCC 12.1.0 (compiler bug?), because that error does not appear with GCC 11.2.0.
A similar error still occurs with OpenBLAS 0.3.21 and GCC 12.2.0 (and MPICH 3.4.3) using OpenMP (2 MPI ranks and 2 threads per rank). It might be related to this OpenBLAS issue.
This was presumably fixed by the upgrade to OpenBLAS 0.3.21 via #2236.
