It would be a nice addition to add a migration guide for users with local repos to change from master to main as the default branch. Of course, one could always fork and clone the repo once again and this is just me being pedantic but it would be a nice addition nonetheless.
If one agrees, I'll be more than happy to open a PR. ðŸ˜ƒ
