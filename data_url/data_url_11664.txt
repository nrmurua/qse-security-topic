I am trying to run a QAOA algorithm and I run into a dimensionality issue when I try to append an initial circuit. If I remove this circuit, everything works perfectly fine. I did check that my initial circuit has 4 qubits and the same holds for the operator Hc.
This seems to be a bug caused by naming explicitly creating the qubit register of the initial state, since the composing circuits with differently named registers can stack them on top of each other instead of appending them. Try running this slightly modified version where the qubit register is not explicitly defined
Until we figure out where this composition error comes from.
Thanks a lot. This works. I did try that on an older version of qiskit and that did not solve the issue but this works perfectly here.
