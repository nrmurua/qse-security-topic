The requirement enum34 is actually unnecessary and its use is discouraged: it breaks random things. For instance, on Anaconda, it breaks spelling completion in Spyder.
Hi peterwittek,
We use enum as a backport for python before 3.3. We can add filter so that it is only installed for legacy versions.
Thank you.
