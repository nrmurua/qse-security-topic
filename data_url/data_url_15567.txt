Since last release of Qiskit, I am unable to run Qiskit runtime program. Apparently there is a problem with the qpy_serialization function, which creates invalid OPENQASM register name such as \x01.
Here you can find a part of the error message.
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/qiskit/circuit/qpy_serialization.py:1563: UserWarning: The qiskit version used to generate the provided QPY file, 0.19.2, is newer than the current qiskit version 0.19.1. This may result in an error if the QPY file uses instructions not present in this current qiskit version\n

It should run the circuit runner program without problem.

@jyu00 will know more about this, but as far as I know the fix for this in underway üôÇ
Hi @Cryoris @jyu00! Are the runtime programs down? Now it does not return any error but the result job.result() is empty for any of my programs.
@rmoyard Yeah runtime is having an issue right now that's preventing results from being returned. We've identified the cause and are working on a fix, which should be available later today.
@jyu00 Thank you for the update! Is there a place where I can find the status of runtime programs?
The runtime should work now again, at least for me the results are returned fine üëçüèª
Runtime was also upgraded to 0.34.2. Closing this issue.
