Presently, calcProbOfOutcome assume normalisation of the input state, and returns the probability of outcome=1 as 1 - prob(outcome=0).
Hence for unnormalised states, prob(outcome=1) will differ from the absolute-value-squared of every amplitude where outcome=1. This is documented, and tested for.
In some settings, the absolute-value-squared of every amplitude where outcome=1 is still useful, though this information is currently inaccessible.
So,
Workaround in new calcProbOfAllOutcomes which will calculate the 0 and 1 probabilities independently
