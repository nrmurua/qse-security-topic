It would be useful if the stim python API exposed a stim.FrameSimulator class that provided access to the underlying C++ stim::FrameSimulator, in the same way that stim.TableauSimulator exposes stim::TableauSimulator. Basically, copy-paste src/stim/simulators/tableau_simulator.pybind.cc to src/stim/simulators/frame_simulator.pybind.cc and then edit the details so apply to the frame simulator instead of the tableau simulator.
The main distinctions between the frame simulator, and the tableau simulator, are:
From the perspective of the user, the frame simulator should have the following state:
Here is an attempt at writing down what the API should be:
Now I understand why pauli noise can be run independently from a tableau simulation, gonna implement this
Is there anything blocking this? If not I can have a go. Seems like a useful issue to understand the code.
There shouldn't be anything blocking it. You will likely run into things that need to be tweaked, like the ownership semantics of the PRNG.
Note the recent edit was triggered by https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/32350/stim-peek-or-extract-circuit-pauli-frame where a commenter said they were interested. I'll assign you to it to avoid confusion, if you want it.
Ok cool, this sounds sort of therapeutic so I'd be happy to be assigned.
@fdmalone, are you working on this right now? I am working on something where'd I like this feature so I offered to pick this up (https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/32350/stim-peek-or-extract-circuit-pauli-frame) but happy to let you take charge if you've already started on this (but would appreciate being kept in the loop in that case though, thank you)
I probably won't get to it for a week or so, so if you want to take over then go for it!
@ababar-usc after a long hiatus I'm ready to start working on this again unless you've gotten it done in the mean time?
@fdmalone, I did, but I got sidetracked to finish up another project:/ You can pick it up but happy to help in any way I can.
