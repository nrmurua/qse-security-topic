I'm implementing a custom function that is supposed to use QAOA ansatz, however, when I attempt to calculate the gradients I get an error about the dimension mismatch between the parameters and the gradient. Here is a minimal example that I could come up that reproduces this error.
If I use an ansatz that is built out of basic gates like the one given by variation_circuit, then everything works out, however, when the ansatz contains time_evolve then I get the following error
Thanks for the issue, it is caused by an incorrect AD rule binding to TimeEvolution constructor. It is fixed in PR #350
Thanks, it's working now!
@radras FYI: YaoExtensions will not be maintained actively anymore, most of its useful feature has been transfered in Yao.EasyBuild.
