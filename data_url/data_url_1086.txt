It would be useful to have integration tests against the Engine API to make sure that things work end to end.
Now with the cirq-infra GCP project (#3317) we could have a simple job as part of our CI suite that could use a service account key to connect to the qsim "processor". These will be slow, so we are not aiming for high coverage, just for key scenarios.
Also, if we create a good integration testing environment, we can run the Google notebooks against them as well.
The problem with the qsim "processor" is that for example reservations are not supported for it.
Maybe we could have a fake processor implementation for integration tests? @wcourtney what do you think?

I had the same initial thought when you framed the problem. We could create a test processor that happens to route requests to a qsim backend and is visible only to test infrastructure. A couple of things about reservations:
