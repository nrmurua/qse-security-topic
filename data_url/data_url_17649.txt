The above qasm should give all shots in 100, but they are all in 000. Only happens in BasicAer, not in Aer.
I confirm there is a bug
gives the outcome david is saying.
@chriseclectic can you have a look at this.
The bug is in the BasicAer python simulator. Specifically it is occurring in the _add_sample_measure function, which is responsible for finding a probability distribution from the statevector and sampling from that. This function cannot handle the case where only a subset of the total qubits are measured.
