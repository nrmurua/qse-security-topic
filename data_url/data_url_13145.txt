As a jumping off point to implement Robust Shadow Estimation [RFC], we need a workflow to perform random Pauli measurements on a specified circuit. The suggested workflow is to have two functions (WIP code available at https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq-internal/pull/64). One will generate the necessary Pauli strings, and the other will generate the circuits from the supplied strings. Question for Min: will these be public functions? Do we expect users to use them, or will they be used primarily internally?
Function/variable names should be changed where fit.
To get started, a new directory will need to be added to mitiq/mitiq and should have a directory structure similar to the other modules (zne, pec, etc.). E.g.
cc @Min-Li
This was completed by #1906.
