Since we have to pass an important configuration parameter (runtime path) to the MacOS simulator, I have noticed that we have to explicitly call the controller::set_config( qobj["config"] ) function before calling execute. The thing is that execute already takes the qobj (so the qobj["config"]) as a parameter, so there's no virtual need for calling  controller::set_config() explicitly.
We need to redesign how configuration is loaded in the simulators, having simplicity for the user in mind (he should not call any function if it's not strictly necessary).
Closing since I think this was fixed in #287
