Is there a way to convert a waveform into a vector, with certain clock resolution?
there is https://github.com/QuEraComputing/Bloqade.jl/blob/master/lib/BloqadeWaveforms/src/waveform.jl#L78 but it's not exported, we can consider doc and export it
Is this intuitive enough? Or do we need to explain it somewhere?
feel free to close this issue @Wang-Shengtao or we can also export sample_values
