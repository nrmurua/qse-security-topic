Thanks for the report.  For the future, it's helpful if you can include some of the error message (or the full traceback) in the top comment as well, but no worries - here it is:
Just flicking through the various properties of how the Rust-based CircuitData is deep-copied, I suspect somewhere the internal Rust-side components are getting out of sync when new registers are added to a circuit after the copy.
