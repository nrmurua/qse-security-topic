The information on installation via the Anaconda cloud needs to be updated, now that #38 has been closed. I will add information on that installation procedure in the documentation in a related PR. This issue can be used for general discussion on it.
Awesome, thank you, Nathan. We are currently using the develop branch for new updates. So I guess once we merge that into the master branch, we can follow this procedure on how to update the anaconda and the pip
