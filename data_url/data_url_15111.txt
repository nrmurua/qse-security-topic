The reference primitives in Terra are a lot slower if they are given a wrapped circuit versus a decomposed circuit. This seems to happen because parameter binding takes much longer on the wrapped circuit due to the call to _rebind_definition. Here's a small example using the EfficientSU2 circuit and it's decomposed version, where the latter is ~3 times faster.
Here's a profiling for the boxed version:

and the decomposed version:

The reference primitives should unroll the circuits to gates that own the parameters, i.e. a basis of all the standard gates. Since caching is already implemented we could just store this unrolled version.
#10284 is an alternative solution to this, simply fixing the parameter-binding slowdown.  I think we can treat that PR as closing this?
Yeah agreed 👍🏻
