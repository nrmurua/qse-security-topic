When I tried the example: https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/api_docs/python/tfq/layers/Sample
sample_layer = tfq.layers.Sample()
output = sample_layer(get_circuit(), repetitions=4)
output
I got:
<tf.RaggedTensor [[[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]]>
Instead of [1,1] as shown in the example.
Here is the full message:
tensorflow_core\python\util\deprecation.py:507: calling count_nonzero (from tensorflow.python.ops.math_ops) with axis is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
reduction_indices is deprecated, use axis instead
<tf.RaggedTensor [[[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]]>
Could you please share the exact code you used to generate this output ?
Hi @MichaelBroughton : Here it is:
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_quantum as tfq
import cirq
def get_circuit():
q0 = cirq.GridQubit(0, 0)
q1 = cirq.GridQubit(1, 0)
circuit = cirq.Circuit(
cirq.X(q0),
cirq.CNOT(q0,q1)
)
sample_layer = tfq.layers.Sample()
output = sample_layer(get_circuit(), repetitions=4)
print(output)
I was not able to reproduce your all zero output. What version of TFQ are you using ?
I use: TFQ 0.3.0 and Windows 10
Seeing that your error message is coming from tensorflow_core, I wonder what version of TF do you have installed?  TFQ currently requires tensorflow==2.1.0.
Going to close since this has gone stale.
