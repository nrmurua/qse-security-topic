If execute is called with memory=True and a backend like ibmq_16_melbourne (with backend.configuration().memory = False) the job is sent and returns with an error that is very hard to debug (not much data, just ERROR_VALIDATING_JOB).
I think, this should be validated before queueing it in the backend. Similarly to #3250
Fixed via #3528
