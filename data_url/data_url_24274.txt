TODO: Determine better path
@zlatko-minev 's comment:
The path is ideally associated with the design and the component/sim name. Doesn't have to be done by march.
This TODO will be removed from issue #215 and made into this issue.
The renderers will be eventually replaced with pyaedt.  We can depreciate this request.
