The code above dumps the state but the output can't be manipulated as it does not have a type. I suggest it be dictionary where the keys are the basis states and the values are the complex amplitudes.
Moreover, it is not clear that the basis state ordering starts from the 11 state. A dictonary key value mapping would solve that too.

The issue of manipulating the coefficients can be solved by this:
however the labelling of the basis states still remains and I suggest a dictionary style structure to represent this information.
