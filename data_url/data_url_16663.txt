some more python modules to be added to requirements.txt
After we fork, git clone, create conda environment in our local & install pip install -r requirements.txt. I would imagine I should not be installing any more packages or not expecting any import errors. And without any code change, if I run make style / make test, its causing missing modules.
I have been installing separately these packages. With this also, there are some tests which are failing with ddt module not found, etc.. needs to be fixed.
I would look at adding these into requiremnts.txt
pip install pycodestyle
pip install pylint
Â  pip install pylintfileheader
pip install pylatexenc
pip install matplotlib
pip install nbformat
pip install z3-solver
pip install pydot
pip install nbconvert
pip install pycodestyl
pip install pylint pylintfileheader
pip install pydot
@lcapelluto : if you can assign it to me, I can take care of this issue.
This isn't actually a bug, those dependencies are not for qiskitt-terra (which is what lives in the requirements.txt file) those are development only dependencies which are listed in requirements-dev.txt file. Those packages are only needed for running tests or linting checks, we don't want users to have to install them when they install terra (which is the pupose of the requirements.txt list). If you read the contributing guide: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#test it recommends the use of tox because it will handle the dependencies for you (and also build an isolated venv for testing).
I'm going to close this issue, feel free to reopen it I'm missing something.
