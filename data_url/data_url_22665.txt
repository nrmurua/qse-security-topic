linux-32/artiq-0.0-np_1536.tar.bz2 is 1 month 2 days old
There is now a build 1579 that should work.
Confirmed build now works. I can install 1589 from conda.
Is there a way of seeing the relationship between commit ID and build number?

Not really, since while build number is derived from the output of git describe, it is ambiguous. We'd need to include the hash into the build number, conda allows to do that.
@whitequark Can you make the platform-independent packages noarch in conda-recipes (most of them AFAICT), and upload linux32 and win32 versions for the other ones in addition to linux64?
Will do.
Well, every package that builds for linux32 and win32 is already uploaded, so that does not have to be done.
@whitequark Nevertheless ARTIQ still cannot be installed on linux32 and win32. I tried to make it noarch, which would be the proper way of fixing this, but this tickles yet another conda bug. Can you have a look at it?
conda/conda-build#542
I don't really see a point in bothering with noarch then, just build it thrice.
The bitstream being included in the same package makes this approach somewhat slow and annoying (especially with the non-determinism of bitstream compilation by ISE and Vivado). How is #146 progressing?
Everything in still issue should be done, #146 is in progress.
