writing cirq.H(ancilla_qubit) ** 0.5 gives the error:
"Expected a <class 'cirq.ops.gate_features.ExtrapolatableEffect'> but got cirq.H"
This is probably expected behavior but I don't understand it. Why isn't Hadamard extrapolatable?
It's just not implemented. I agree that it should be.
I'm labelling this "good first issue" because all that really needs to be done is to mimic RotXGate but with the Hadamard gate's eigendecomposition.
How do you calculate _eigen_components? The docs give an example with Pauli-X, but i'm having a problem deriving them. From the docs: The first component of a tuple is how much that eigenspace should be phased by applying the gate How is that phase factor calculated?
The eigenvalues of a unitary are of the form λ=eiθ; the phase factor is θ/π.
The second component is the projector onto the subspace with eigenvalue λ.
Alright. I still don't know where [[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5]] comes from. The eigenvalues of Pauli-X are λ_1 = -1 and λ_2 = 1 so for -1 = e^iθ , θ = π, so the phase factor would be 1, for 1 = e^iθ, θ = 0. Phase factor is 0. Where does [[0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5]] fit in with this?
The ±1 eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector |±⟩ = [[1 / sqrt(2)], [±1 / sqrt(2)]]. The projector is then
|±⟩⟨±| = [[1/2, ±1/2], [±1/2, 1/2]].
@Strilanc I'm sorry. I don't understand. The H matrix has the same eigenvalues as the X matrix. I think i'm having problems understanding what an eigenspace is. X and H have different eigenspaces. What are they?
The eigenvectors of the Pauli X gate are |+⟩ = √½(|0⟩ + |1⟩) and |-⟩ = √½(|0⟩ - |1⟩). The eigenvalues of those vectors are -1 and +1 respectively. This means that X = |+⟩⟨+| + (-1)*|-⟩⟨-|. In prose, that equation basically reads "X takes |+⟩ to |+⟩ and |-⟩ to -|-⟩".
|+⟩⟨+| is [[1/2, 1/2], [1/2, 1/2]]. It is a matrix that sends |+⟩ to |+⟩ and everything else to 0. It is a projection matrix onto the +1 eigenspace of the X operation. |-⟩⟨-| is a projection matrix onto the -1 eigenspace of the X operation.
When you compute the square root of a matrix, what you are actually doing is square-rooting its eigenvalues. So, if M = x |a⟩⟨a| + y |b⟩⟨b| then √M = √x |a⟩⟨a| + √y |b⟩⟨b|. This applies to basically every other function you would care about. So, if I give you x, y, |a⟩⟨a|, and |b⟩⟨b|, it's very easy for you to compute functions of the matrix. And EigenGate asks for those values, almost.
Instead of asking for x directly, EigenGate asks for the theta in x = exp(i pi theta). This disambiguates stuff like whether or not to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise through the complex plane in order to reach -1.
According to wolfram alpha, these are the eigenvectors of the Hadamard matrix:
