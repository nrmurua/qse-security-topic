Application
In some applications the energy value of a sample has an important meaning to it. For instance I am working on a graph partitioning problem, and due to the structure of the cost function for this problem, the energy value of a sample (offsets included) is exactly the number of cut edges between the partitions. You get the energy of a sample and you know the number of cut edges right away and you don't need to traverse the graph one more time to count the cut edges. When formulating a problem in terms of a DQM, one usually throws away any constant offset which appear on the way, but in problems like this it is sometimes convenient to keep the constants. BQM has a function called add_offset which allows to do this.
Proposed Solution
Implement add_offset function for DQM as well.
Alternatives Considered
I am currently calculating the offset in a separate variable, so that I can add it to the energy of the result after sampling.
I agree with adding an offset to DQM. However, I would just add a property so the syntax would be dqm.offset += 1rather than dqm.add_offset(1)
