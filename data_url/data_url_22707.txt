On the mailing list it was suggested that we adopt a Trunk Based Development model.

I think this is a bit more complexity than is needed at present since SB does nearly 100% of the commits. However, we could benefit from a slightly more structured development vs release structure. The motivation for this is that some "people of influence" in the AMO community may unreasonably judge ARTIQ based on their experience during the first two hours of use which is largely dominated by the installation experience.
New dependencies naturally emerge that can be overlooked on development machines.To address niggling issues that keep recurring like #88 (which took me 10 minutes to resolve) I propose the following.
For install-validation the following comes to mind as a simple 30-minute test that would greatly ease the new-user install experience. Getting these simple steps as part of a regular release schedule may improve the community's uptake of ARTIQ.
This could also permit a periodic validation of the install-from-source instructions.
