The Wiki needs to be updated to reflect the latest in liboqs, such as the CMake build system.  We should also expand on the build options (such as disabling select algorithms) there.
This includes the instructions for building the example KEM and example signature programs.
@xvzcf Could you please add MinGW build instructions to the wiki?  https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/m9Nc5TMJgk/
Done here. Could you give it a once-over?
