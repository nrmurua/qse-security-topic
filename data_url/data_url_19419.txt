Describe the bug
Hamiltonian expectation value calculation is wrong for density matrices, as they are treated as state vectors.
To Reproduce
Expected behavior
The calculated expectation value (first printed number) should agree with the np.trace calculation (second printed number) but instead it agrees with the third printed value, which is the formula for state vectors.
