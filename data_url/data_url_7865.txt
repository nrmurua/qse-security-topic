QuTip has several modules that implements transformations between superoperator representations, including supermatrix, Kraus, Choi and Chi (process) matrix formalisms. However an important superoperator that QuTip is currently missing is the Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM) [1].

Implement a function to_ptm that can transform a quantum object to a PTM superoperator. Also implement a transformation ptm_to_chi.

Hi @Wikstahl, I am Rishabh, an undergraduate computer engineering student and I have been working in quantum computing development stuff for the last 2 years and research stuff in the last 1 year. I would like to know about, is this issue still open? If, yes so can you please elaborate a little bit more?
Hi @anonymousr007, This issue is still open and as far as I know, no one is working on it.
If you want to have a go at it, please use the dev.major branch. You can use other super operator transformation functions in qutip/core/superop_reps.py as inspiration.
I don't think any of the qutip developers have any experience with Pauli Transfer Matrix representation. So we can't help you much with the equations, but the paper Wikstahl mentioned has a good description of it.
Okay, Please assign me this issue. I want to work in it and fix it asap. Thanks for information
