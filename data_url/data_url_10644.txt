The following files were copied (with history) from dwave-system to minorminer.  They should be deleted or replaced with deprecated stubs redirecting the user to replace minorminer.utils with dwave.embedding for the exceptions, diagnostic, chimera, and pegasus submodules.
We should likely leave the tests in-place for now.
Also I don't know if we should raise a deprecation. It's not obvious to me if minorminer.utils is a more or less intuitive namespace than dwave.embedding.
Agreed on the deprecation.  But I have some concern that duplicating the tests will be a drag on maintenance, since they don't depend on dwave.embedding at all (except I duplicated the source_to_target function in test_chimera)
@arcondello, I agree. dwave.embedding is much better for now, and tests should verify everything still works from dwave-system perspective as it used to work.
