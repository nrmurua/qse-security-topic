When quitting artiq_ctlmgr with ctrl-c, there is some race condition in the logging protocol. It might be because the writer doesn't exist yet as it was unable to connect.
Fixed this while investigating http://buildbot.m-labs.hk/builders/artiq/builds/2381/steps/python_unittest_1/logs/stdio. I think I got all of them.
Thanks!
