I tried to regenerate the dispersion plot given in the documentation at https://scqubits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/ipynb/basics.html for Transmon. But, the resultant plot is not what is what is expected. It does not even generate three plots for the levels given as parameters. The axis labels are also not visible, I also checked the same behavior when I called the subroutine through a different code, which I am sure was working fine a few days ago.

Any additional information you would like to provide to aid us.
Looking into this. (Probably unrelated, but I should point out that Python 3.9 is not yet officially supported.)
Output on my end differs from the above (generated with v2.2.1):

Still not what we should expect.
