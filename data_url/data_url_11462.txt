We expect the users of qgrad to be likely optimizing some sort of cost function. Until now, we have been using fidelity. SWAP Test is another way to measure overlap, which can be a valid cost function as well. It would be nice if we can also provide a swap_test(ket1, ket2) as part of the cost function module, let's say.
