I cannot find the control qubits inside the cmd object here is a minimal code to reproduce the issue:
The output is :
Aren't the control qubits supposed to be in the _control_qubits list? The only qubits I can find are the target qubits inside the _qubits list
The control qubits are only added to the command after it is received by the ControlEngine further down the chain after the MainEngine. For implementation details see “3.2.1 Implementation of meta instructions” in https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000322770.
To implement a testing engine such as yours, that can be used to check that indeed control qubits are added right after the MainEngine, you could do the following:
Thank you, that is important information, but I cannot use MainEngine since I want to create a class that inherits from it and adds a few functions, using your method prevents me from getting these functions.
Edit: it actually works even with another class but I would get this output whenever I try to
add some more functions, the funny thing is, when I add a change that causes this, even after that change is removed I still get the same output, if I copy that same code (with the removed problematic change) that worked earlier but doesn't work now into another file, the problem would cease to occur :
Edit2: Also how normal is this?
The problem only occurs with SqrtSwap  and SqrtX the rest of the gates work normally. I'm using
Python 3.4.5 and projectq version 0.3.5
That's perfectly normal, your version of ProjectQ does not have these gates yet.
For the other things, I would suggest opening a new issue and describe in more details what you are trying to achieve. Otherwise it is hard to help.
