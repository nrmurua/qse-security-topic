I found that conditional_gate now is designed to work in a probabilistic way. I think a batched evaluation can work. But I want to know if there is a way to get the accurate expectation value, which is averaged over conditional measurement outcomes.
An example:
Now it gives -1 and +1 each with a 0.5 possibilities. But I want to get 0 as an expectation instead. And I suppose in principle this is implementable in the tensor contraction manner.
And this is also related to #46 , where the expectation value of circuits with conditional gates is needed.
I wonder whether the thing you really want is like a multi control gate:
Or somehow, multicontrol and cond_measure are the same thing based on the philosophy of deferred measurement
Thanks for your reply! I think you are right that multicontrol is the correct choice for my example codes. And I realize that this works for QCNN as well.

That makes sense in the cases above and in most cases I can think about.
