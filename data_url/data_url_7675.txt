In quimb.tensor.drawing.visualize_tensor() line 882 needs to be changed to xyzpy.plot.plotter_matplotlib.visualize_tensor because it has been changed in xyzpy library. Double check, please.

Hi @emapuljak, thanks for the issue. I think the problem is that xyzpy.visualize_tensor is not in a released version of xyzpy, I'll try and release a new version soon. You could try installing it from github/source to get it working at the moment.
