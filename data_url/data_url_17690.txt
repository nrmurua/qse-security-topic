After #1210 every gate has associated with it a gate._decompositions. The quick and dirty way was to call a self._define_decompositions() at init time, but that gets called with every Gate and becomes slow for large circuits. We should factor out that logic so it is a class property and only computed once per class, not for each instance separately.
So I'm looking at how to solve this and the only way I can come up with only running _define_decompositions() once for the entire run of the program is something like:
for every gate. Does this work for you?
Yes, this works. Thanks.
Please preserve the docstring of _define_decompositions as it highlights the decomposition rules in a concise way.
The main bottleneck here is gone with #1455.
I'll close this issue. PR #1445 adds some more speedup, but it's not critical for 0.7.
