I have added keyword FREQ in my calculation. The code stops at the line
I request you to resolve the issue.
@ Begin Hessian calculation
Hi, thanks for reaching out. This is currently WIP. We plan to enable frequency calculations in near future.
Thank you for replay. I kindly request you, if you could add saddle/TS finding algorithms along with optimization, then quick will be the ultimate software for potential energy profile calculations.
Hi, This is something I am currently working on. Once we have full Hessian working, we can calculate frequencies and use it for TS/saddle points.
Thats Great... I am currently running QUICK on NVIDIA DGX- A100 8 cards machine. performance is really fantastic... excited for next releases of QUICK with new updates. Thank you.
Awesome. Happy to hear that you are making use of the code.
Hello, I have developed a toy script that enables Gaussian to invoke QUICK to do energy and gradient calculation, and the frequencies can be obtained from half-numeric method. Also, transition state optimization and IRC task are supported. Here is my repo, and I hope this repo may help you (but may be not so efficeint). https://github.com/mizu-bai/Gauick
