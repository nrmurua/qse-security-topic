Dear Quip-developers and users,
Sorry for the label "BUG" - I thought it was before I could understand it!
I was trying to go through the smesolver in Qutip, and find it difficult to understand what value to be chosen for dW_factors in smesolver, which is [1.0] by default. The workflow of smesolver is as follows:
In stochastic.py, the solver options are decided based on user's input and sets the solver to smesolve
It calls the  _sesolve_generic function in  stochastic.py
_sesolve_generic calls the _single_trajectory function in stochastic.py
_single_trajectory calls the cy_sesolve_single_trajectory function in ssolver class of cy/stochastic.pyx
The noise is to be multiplied by the variance of the Wiener noise, which is done in line 482-483 anyway, as given below:
What should be the exact [dW_factors] one should choose when m_ops is explicitly given (for example m_ops=[x])? Should it be sqrt(Gamma), where Gamma is the damping factor? I have tested that dW_factors=[1] generates very strong noise.
Thanks in advance
