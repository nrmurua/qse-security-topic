None of the algorithms appear to actually use this and it made it slightly irritating to wrap in C++.
My suggestion would be simply to drop this parameter, which would make the API marginally simpler to understand
Good suggestion. I want to simplify the KEX API even more and will include this in the plans.
Will be done as part of #91.
