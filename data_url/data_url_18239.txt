Float is a source of imprecision, as #111 shows. I'm working on a pull request to get rid of float (and math) in favor of sympy, as suggested to @awcross1.
Please, comment on this issue if you have any thought.
Why not just check if the value is one to floating point precision, and then just set to one if so?  Adding an entire dependency for a single corner-case is probably not the way to go.
Hi @nonhermitian ,
There are several situations where dealing with floats is hard. There are several zero checks and simplifications that we can delegate to this library.
@lbello what's the status of this issue? I know there have been several commits regarding float to sympy migration.
For sure, the tools are still using floats. I will take a look to the rest. If it's just the tools, I would probably consider this done for now.
The coming approach is to handle sympy and numpy options. Give option to the user to have a symbolic representation or an efficient numpy as numbers. Soon, a PR about this.
