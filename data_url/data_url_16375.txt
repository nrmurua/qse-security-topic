Even though issue has been resolved as on #4948 at #4948, I am getting the same error. Error is reproduced below --

Error Output
The fix for this has been merged into the development branch and been backported to the stable branch for a future bug fix release. But it has not been released yet, the fix only merged two days ago. You will either have to wait for it to be released or install terra from source to get the fix. I'm going to close this as there is nothing to do here since this is a duplicate and the bug has already been fixed and just hasn't been released.
