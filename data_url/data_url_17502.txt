The base output command for pulse is the SamplePulse and all other terra output pulses are eventually compiled to the SamplePulse. Internally the SamplePulse is a complex numpy array of samples. The SamplePulse should support being treated as a numpy array by implementing the proper numpy interface. See NEP 22 â€” Duck typing for NumPy arrays for more information on what must be implemented. This should also extend to DiscreteFunctionalPulses and AnalyticFunctionalPulses with delayed evaluation.
As a consequence pulse composition should be supported AnalyticFunctionPulses and DiscreteFunctionPulses.
Closing as the need for this is no longer clear.
