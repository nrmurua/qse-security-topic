Given a map (quantum channel) compute the dual of the map.
As an example, this functionality is present in the QETLAB package. While the implementation there is in MATLAB, the spirit of the implementation should be quite similar to the implementation for toqito:
http://www.qetlab.com/DualMap
Write the functionality for this task in toqito/channel_ops/dual_channel.py and ensure proper unit tests for this feature are written in tests/test_channel_ops/test_dual_channel.py. Also ensure that the automated docs are updated by placing the line toqito.channel_ops.dual_channel in docs/channels.rst under Operations on Quantum Channels.
Hi @vprusso, I would like to implement this.
To be clear, "dual" here means the adjoint of the superator, which amounts to
Is this correct?
Hi @dfacoet.
That's great to hear, excited to see what you come up with on this feature.
And yes, I believe your interpretation of what "dual" means in this context is spot on. Please don't hesitate to ping me if you have further questions, and thanks again as always for your eagle eye catches and contributions!
I should take into account the discussion in #74 regarding the possible Kraus representations. I think the best thing to do is to accept both "one-list" and "two-lists" representation, and the output should have the same forward.
This is pretty straightforward since in any case it amounts to taking the Hermitian conjugates of all matrices.
Closing. Thanks again to @dfacoet for the wonderful PR!
