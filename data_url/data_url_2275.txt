This has come up repeatedly for me but one example would be at commit 94f4a4e of #2096 . If, at that commit, I run the script check/format-incremental, it tells me No formatting needed on changed lines. Nevertheless, Travis tells me I do need formatting. Could this be my yapf version? I have yapf 0.16.2.
I should have thought to actually try updating my yapf. Now that I did, it seems to work.
