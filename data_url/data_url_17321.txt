Qiskit-terra should contain a result generating mock pulse backend for testing purposes. This would allow end-to-end tests of the pulse API within terra to be written. While there will be a pulse simulator in Aer,  Aer is currently not a dependency of Terra so will not be available for testing.
This is a non-trivial amount of work and I'm not sure it is worth the effort. While Aer is not a dependency, for testing purposes you can just assume it is installed (or just add it to requirements-dev.txt). The randomized tests, for example, currently rely on Aer. In general, a simulator is indispensable for testing, so I don't think we should go to great lengths to circumvent it.
Agreed.
