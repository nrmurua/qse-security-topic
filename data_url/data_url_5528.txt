I want to use qiskit_aer's Estimator as substitution for a current script that uses qiskit_ibm_runtime's Estimator. Both will use QuasmSimulator Class.
These two Estimators seem to be quite different in initialization and features.
I want to specificy: number of shots, optimization level, and resilience level.
In the documentation of qiskit_aer's Estimator I cannot find a lot of information on the options that I can parse to the Estimator.
Moreover, it seems that the run_options of Estimator takes whatever dictionary you give it without error/warnings or any reaction to it.
In qiskit_ibm_runtime's Estimator number of shots, optimization level, and resilience level are defined like this:
For qiskit_aer's Estimator I figured out with some try and error that this gives me the number of shots and optimization level. But I have not yet found resilience level
Moreover, as mentioned above, there seems to be no check or feedback on what you give the run_options as dictionary. To put it to extreme, you could, for example, run this with no problem:
I would expect for qiskit_aer to have the same options available as qiskit_ibm_runtime, but I cannot find anything in the documentation.
Being able to give run_options any arbitrary dictionary is also rather unexpected.
More info on options in documentation.
Check of dictionary passed to run_options.
