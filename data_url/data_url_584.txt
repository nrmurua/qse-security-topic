I think it would an interesting and useful feature to allow previously completed jobs from various backends for use in xacc post-processing capabilities. However, much (all?) of the post-processing capabilities are built within the framework of an AcceleratorDecorator, thus this may require some adjustments to the way these decorators are defined.  I'm thinking it could be implemented as third execute function that takes a job-id instead of an compositeInstruction. Then, when it comes time to "execute" you would just substitute the result from the job for the post-processing part of the script. But I am open to other (more clever) solutions.
