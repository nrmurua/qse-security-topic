Hi @BastianZim thanks for reporting this.
I suspect this is either a C++17 flag issue for the compiler, or the platform doesn't pull in the header provided for the std method. I'll have somebody look at this.
Thanks @mlxd Let me know if you need more info here from me.
Thanks @BastianZim . We did notice this may be for a Py3.10 build. Due to restrictions in Pennylane's other dependencies we do not currently support Python 3.10.
As for the observed error, we will issue a bugfix release shortly.
Thanks @mlxd! Pyhton3.10 is not a huge concern, it's just currently passing on the other platforms which is why I had included it. I'll remove Windows for this build and merge it then.
Hi @BastianZim thanks again for reporting this. The problem you found will be fixed in the minor release v0.20.1
Hi @mlxd can confirm that it is working. Thanks again for the quick fix!
