Currently, if a non-null value for initial_states is given (to .sample()), the number of states provided has to match the number of reads requested.
To simplify a few common use cases, we can extrapolate (or cut) the list of provided initial states to match num_reads.
There are a few ways to do that, so it seems reasonable to provide an additional parameter, e.g.  initial_states_mapper so users can control it:
I think these options are great and they cover a wide range of use cases. I think the default should be exact, so if both initial_states and num_reads are provided (and the additional parameter is not) then an error should be raised if len(initial_states) != num_reads.
I think it makes more sense to require num_reads, but have initial_states_generator defaulting to random -- so that the most common use case is as short and natural as possible:
Alternatively, we could go with num_reads=1 by default, because this also looks reasonable:
