The current factory lock is for locking qubits in the simulator backend. We want another lock in the cqc backend as well to lock factories and sequences
This lock is now in place, but has not been properly tested yet. (How to test?)
@LeonWubben What's the status of this?
@AckslD
Locks.. fun.
It's probably not implemented correctly either, as I didn't understand how locks work.
I'll close it for now, it should be looked at later when someone (maybe me) dives back into twisted
