The changes in #142 made the restriction of waveform and pulse duration less restrictive, but it also made the warnings more informative.
This means that, in cases where the rounding to the allowed precision is not respected, it will do so automatically as before, but it will raise a warning stating which number was rounded to which. As a consequence, tutorials with loops where this happens repeatedly will raise a lot of warnings, which is not ideal.
Therefore, it is important to go over such tutorials again and adapt them accordingly.
