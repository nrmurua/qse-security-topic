While simplifying code trying to understand a different issue, I tried to run the trivial example here:
https://github.com/dwavesystems/qbsolv/blob/0.2.9/python/dwave_qbsolv/dimod_wrapper.py#L75-L81
However, the response has no energies attribute.
I don't actually use this code in my project, but I would like to understand what I've done wrong; or, perhaps the example is incorrect.
(If it helps, looking at the history, the example went in at 11745cd back when the response was a dimod BinaryResponse.  It is now a Response.  I'm using qbsolv 0.2.9, but I don't see any thing since then on master which might be related.)
Including the qbsolv import, my entire code is:
Apologies for by-passing your issues template. :)  If I should ask about this elsewhere, please let me know.
Hi, thanks for the bug report! We'll update the example. For now, the instead of e = list(r.energies()) try e = list(r.record.energy)
