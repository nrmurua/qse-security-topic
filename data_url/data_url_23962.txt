When running the code below, we get a com error ending w/ a failed creation of a junction from the qgeometry table. This is weird as there are no junctions in our design.
I noticed that I was using MultiPlanar designs, and when I switched it to Planar, everything ran smoothly.
Should just render design to ANSYS.
Apon initializing the old ansys renderer, perform a check which flags a user if they're using a MultiPlanar design instead of a Planar Design. However I'm unsure if this will scale properly, will need to add checks for when people add new design types. Also unsure how FlipChip works, if that needs to be support.
Would appreciate feedback before attempting solution.
