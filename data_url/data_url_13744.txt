This import is there to check the type of a quantum program and branch to a different default behavior if the program is a qiskit one. This was reported by @yhindy
Once #93 is merged we will be able to translate smoothly between circuits and so this branch (and the import) will no longer be necessary.
Once #93 is merged I'm happy to take this one.
