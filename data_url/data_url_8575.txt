The docs for the sesolve function are ambiguous about the form of the input state. In several places, it mentions that density matrixes are an option (even using the name 'rho0' as an argument). However, when trying to solve using a density matrix, I get the TypeError "psi0 must be a ket"
Sample code:
Documentation needs fixing. Change rho0 to psi0 only. Add explanation of dUdt=-iHU in documentation.
Now fixed in the docstrings of sesolve.py.
