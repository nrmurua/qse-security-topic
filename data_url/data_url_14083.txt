The exporting and importing of Qasm3 uses different Qasm3 version/convention:
This is the Qasm3 circuit I want to parse  with qiskit.qasm3.loads(.)
The error is:
Attached code demonstrates I can save a transpiled circuit with feed-forward operations as Qasm3, but I can't read it back.

I should get back the original circuit
The extended binary-operation conditions aren't currently supported in the OpenQASM 3 import; we just haven't added that capability to the converter yet, because we're in the process of completely rewriting it to switch to a more performant and easier to extend parser.  This feature is very much on our roadmap, it's just likely a few months away, since it's taking a backseat right now in favour of changing the foundations of OQ3 import.
For the second issue: it's hard to know exactly what you mean without a reproducible example.  If you would like to open a second issue about that, please do.
thanks for the explanation. How should I export a feed-forward circuit constructed in Qiskit to other frameworks, like TKet or cuQuantum?
Until this issue using QASM  allowed the convenient  conversion of circuit.
I have filed  new ticket #11480 with regard of lost qubit IDs
Well, the export still works, it's just our import that doesn't at the moment.  I wasn't aware that tket had any support for the dynamic-circuits features of OpenQASM 3 yet (the circuit-runtime operations on classical data in your condition), so I'm not sure if they'd be able to import OpenQASM 3 themselves, but if they've added it recently, then the import should work.  I'm not very familiar with cuQuantum's offerings, but I believe they have a functional OpenQASM 3 converter to other formats, which I assume contains themselves.
