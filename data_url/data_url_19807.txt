Here is the documentation of t1_circuits:
While gate_time is in micro-seconds, the unit of delay time is xdata are said to be seconds. I assume that this is incorrect, for xdata? The implementation itself does not convert between units.
Yes, the gate_time should just say "time for running a single gate" and xdata should be "a list of delay times in the same units as gate_time"
