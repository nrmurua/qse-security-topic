Artiq 6 will throw a compilation error when indexing the numpy array in the following way.
But artiq 5 works well with the same code.
Run the following code on artiq 6.7526 and 5.7114.
It works well on artiq 5 but not on 6.
Artiq 6 should have the same behavior as artiq 5 for this code.
I get an error:
Thanks for the great bug report, will have a look later this week.
I've created #1632 for the sub-issue (unrelated to NumPy arrays) regarding having to use length = self.n instead of self.n directly.
The issue as filed should be taken care of, but please don't hesitate to create new bug reports for any other problems you might encounter â€“ the NumPy array implementation was completely rewritten for ARTIQ 6 (arrays had previously been treated just the same as lists), so some issues are bound to have slipped through due to imperfect test coverage.
