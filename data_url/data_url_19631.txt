Applying CTMP mitigator on circuits with odd number of qubits makes expectation value worse rather than making it closer to the ideal value. works opposite to error mitigation. It behaves right for the circuits with even number of qubits, though. You can check with the code below by changing the variable n_q for the number of qubits.
@georgesbarron Do you have any ideas for this?
