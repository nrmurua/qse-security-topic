Write the following characterization experiments, based on the new experiment class:
Inversion recovery (T1), Ramsey (T2*), Hanh echo (T2), Resonator kappa, Resonator chi, ZZ discovery sequences
Some of them already exist in Ignis, but need to be adjusted to the new design.
We should start with T1, since it is the simplest.
