The classical loop in optimization process for QAOA takes a long time. Possibly because the whole sequence has to be re-created for each new value of variational parameters.
How big is the sequence? Can you time how long it takes to create it once and multiply that by how many times you create it, please?
My guess would be that the bottleneck is not the sequence creation itself, but rather its processing inside Simulation.
According to @sebgrijalva and @cdalyac benchmarks, it indeed comes from the simulation part. One fix seems to be able to resize the t_list in sesolve depending on the cases.
This was addressd in #64.
