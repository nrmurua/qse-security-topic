The monkey patch from #506 (1c32d4f) breaks UDP.
This in turn breaks pc_rpc device controllers that use UDP.
At some point the asyncio is calling:
loop.getaddrinfo("127.0.0.1", 4000, family=socket.AF_INET, type=socket.SOCK_STREAM, proto=17, flags=0)
which raises the exception and which I suspect is another Python bug that is exposed by the patch.
i.e. asyncio is asking for a stream UDP (proto=17) address, which is obviously not possible. Without the patch, the error is masked, as _ipaddr_info disregards the type/proto combination.
thanks!
