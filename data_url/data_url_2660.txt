For specifying initial states it is useful to have a computational basis state, or the full wave function, or a sparse representation.  We currently support first two, but not the last.  We should crate a new type that encapsulates that an use in our simulators.
One problem with new types is that they are less self documenting
This is done and is called STATE_VECTOR_LIKE.
