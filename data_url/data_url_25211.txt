EDIT: Never mind! I forgot I should be modifying add.electron_object and not add itself.
When assigning the executor of an electron on-the-fly as introduced in #1674 (@kessler-frost), the metadata of the electron is updated, but the job still runs with the default Dask executor.
The electron should run on the specified executor. The GUI shows a successful job that ran on the Dask executor.
