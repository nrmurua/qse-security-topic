The current implementation of the global pulse/serializable registration is flawed. The second if statement in the relevant excerpt from Serializable.__init__() below does not evaluate to True if the standard default_pulse_registration - a WeakValueDictionary() - is employed (see at the end), hence pulses are never registered.
Changing that line into if identifier and registration is not None: will result in registered pulses... and a majority of tests failing, since pulse identifier are assigned multiple times.
We would need to fix all tests or find a better solution to avoiding duplicate identifiers than a global registry.
apparently instances of WeakValueDictionary cannot be checked for presence using if <instance>: (as seen in tests)
I will fix this by using explicit registrations in the tests. The init methods of nearly al PTs miss the registration keyword argument. I will fix this, too.
Rename registration to the correct registry
