I want to generate a dataset of scheduled Quantum Circuits to run analysis on. I want to save these circuits to a file, so I found the qpy functionality qiskit provides to write circuits to bytes. However, I am seeing that when I load the circuit from the bytes, I am losing scheduling information. Specifically, I can use timeline_drawer before I write to bytes, but when I load the circuit back, I get VisualizationError: 'Input circuit bv is not scheduled and it contains operations with unknown delays. This cannot be visualized.' The circuitop_start_times, qubit start/end times, and duration are also undefined.
QPY serialization should not lose any information in the QuantumCircuit, including any scheduling details.

I would like to have a look at this bug. Can you please assign me?
Thank you
And, a simpler and error-free way of reproducing this issue would be as follows:
@Abhiraj-Shrotriya, you're welcome to have a look, but just be warned that it's quite possible that this issue will not be simple, if there's significant changes to QPY serialisation required.  I think / hope that that's not the case, but it could be quite a significant chunk of work.
@jakelishman,
Hi, I took a look at it. Yes, this fix will take some time. I will try my best to solve this as soon as possible.
If required, of course I will take your reviews.
Thank you
