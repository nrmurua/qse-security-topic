Acceptance criteria
note https://agnostiqworkspace.slack.com/archives/C03KZRV93J5/p1661880147076689
The version action is failing for external PRs, like this one https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/actions/runs/3144819962/jobs/5111659925
This appears to be because the action can't find the fork branch
This is probably because the action is checking out the base repo rather than the fork repo.
Check the docs to make sure the ref is being set properly based on the trigger. https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-events-for-forked-repositories
It's possible the that checkout has to be done in the workflow, and only business logic should live in the action.
