The toolbar button for the Library that @grace-harper-ibm  added is missing. If you close the library there is no way to have it show up again.
Solution: Add a toolbar button like the rest of them to show/hide the library window.
@JeremyDrysdale-ibm , perhaps it makes sense to ask @grace-harper-ibm to tackle this, since @grace-harper-ibm  added the nice library.
