Best demonstrated using an example. Define an "echo sequence" using
Compiling using the CCL example configuration from the develop branch.
For small values of wait_nanoseconds, everything is fine, e.g.:
Unwanted behaviour occurs as soon as wait_nanoseconds reaches the readout duration, here set to 15 cycles (300ns).
Case 1, equality:
Case 2, larger waiting times. It seems that the wait is collated with the readout duration.
Expected behavior is that the behavior for small values holds for all values.
@imranashraf , it appears that there is a bug in the fix to the waiting time.
This is currently preventing us from measuring an echo (or relying on the timing instruction).
It would be great if you could take a look at this.
sure @AdriaanRol. I am having a look at it
Indeed it was a bug which has been fixed now. So for hardware_config_cc_light.json and the following test:
waits are inserted correctly independent of the wait duration, as can be seen by the generated QISA shown below:
Note: durations < 8 can be represented with 3-bit pre-interval value, hence no explicit qwaits there.
@imranashraf thanks for the quick response, we will test this  (probably today) . I'll close the issue if this resolves the problem.
@AdriaanRol most welcome.
a test has been added, so this can be closed now.
