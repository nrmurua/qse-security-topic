I am wondering whether there is a quick way to sample the readout. I have been using
This apparently no longer works since simulator.run does not support inital_state anymore. I am wondering whether there is an alternative or not.
The feature you want has been moved to simulator.simulate.
The idea is that we want "run" to be a word that refers to actually running on hardware, and so "run" implies sampling. And since the hardware doesn't give a wavefunction, or allow you to specify a starting wavefunction, we removed those features from run and added the simulate method to make up for it.
Sorry for any confusion.
I'm going to close this because I think I answered the issue. Please re-open if you have additional questions.
