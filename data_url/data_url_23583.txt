When running Qcodes with python >=3.7.0 warnings about deprecation will pop up related to the collections abstract base classes that were moved to collections.abc since Python 3.3
Note: Some are related to external libs (h5py, pyqt) and need to be fixed upstream in the respective projects. But I can make a pull request that fixes the Qcodes part.
