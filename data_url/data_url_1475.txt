Description of the issue
cirq-google/cirq_google/engine/engine_validator_test.py::test_create_gate_set_validator experiences a flake in ~0.4% of tests where the generated circuit is too long. Example failure
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
0.14.0.dev
From cirq sync:
This is testing that really large circuits are invalidated. We should make the test deterministic to fix this. The test needs to be there.
This was fixed in #4908.
