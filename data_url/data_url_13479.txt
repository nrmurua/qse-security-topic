I did the last bit of the release (local dist build and PyPI upload) manually. I think it is still useful to keep some information about this in the docs, for the manual part, in case the action fails, so I propose to
I will open separate issues regarding investigating why the action did not trigger and implement a modification in the actions, so that the package is first pushed to test pypi and then to pypi. Possibly it's first pushed to testpypi, downloaded and installed from it, and then pushed to pypi.
