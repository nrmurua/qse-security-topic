The wallet file generated by python client is not encrypted.
It would be better to allow users to set a password for accessing this wallet file.
Support for encryption is there. CLI needs to be updated.
@cyyber CLI support is complete?
@randomshinichi remember to close this issue once the unit tests for this feature are ready.
Sorry, CLI adjustments are tracked by issue #1120
It is possible to close this issue
