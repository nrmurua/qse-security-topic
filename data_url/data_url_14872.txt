Describe the bug
I get the error: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'clbits and it seems that the Qpy to QASM conversion failed: unable to parse quantum circuit for a circuit containing a controlled unitary gate.
Steps to reproduce
Expected behavior
It should work
Suggested solutions
Additional Information
Transpiling before works
transpile(qc, basis_gates = backend.configuration().basis_gates)
@jakelishman is this a bug with qpy? If so, can it be transferred to qiskit (terra)
Yep, looks like it to me. I've no write access on this to transfer, but @mtreinish could.
@AzizNgoueya As a quick patch until the bug is found/fixed, you can try transpiling the circuit locally before sending it to the estimator:
I can take a look at this bug :)
