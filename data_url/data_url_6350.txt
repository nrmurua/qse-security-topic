I've read the commentary around "master" branch vs. "main," and I'm perfectly happy to respect a new, better convention, so long as we don't tank anyone's forks downstream without consideration and support. I've changed the default branch, but master is still there, for now. Assume that we want to delete "master" ASAP; please reach out on this issue, if you need time or help to transition. I'll try to wait for a reasonable period.
This is a trial run, for name conversion. GitHub has said that automatic porting tools should be available by around the turn of the calendar year. I realize, after I do this here, that ultimately every one of my repos needs to be supported through this process, and it might simply actually be expedient to wait for the planned conversion solution. However, in 10 minutes of down time, when no PRs are open, we can give this a trial run on the core vm6502q/qrack repository.
master has been decommissioned. Please reopen the issue if you still need help updating.
