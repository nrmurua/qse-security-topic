Description of the issue
cirq.two_qubit_matrix_to_operations decomposes a 2q unitary matrix into CZs + single qubit rotations. The method was originally written when we had only decomposition into CZs. But now, we have other analytical decompositions like cirq.two_qubit_matrix_to_sqrt_iswap_operations, cirq.two_qubit_matrix_to_ion_operations etc.
We should do the following renames (with a deprecation cycle):
Cirq version
0.14dev
I'll make this as closed because the renaming and deprecation was done as part of #5070 and the next release will remove deprecated methods.
