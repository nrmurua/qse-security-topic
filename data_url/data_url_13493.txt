Couple of code cells in documentation appear at the end instead of at the beginning. For the variational circuit example,  a code cell for import mitiq appears after acknowledgements. Another misplaced code cell is in the maxcut example, where mitiq.about() appears after references.
If these are intentional then feel free to close the issue. If not, I can work on it.
It was intentional to show the version information of Mitiq, with the unstated convention that it appears at the end of tutorials. I think it looks weird as well, though, and it seems redundant since RTD tells you latest or stable. If @nathanshammah or @crazy4pi314 don't disagree I would say feel free to remove it @purva-thakre.
Closing this because version information code cells only look out of place when their output is not shown. See comment in above PR.
