How do I load ARTIQ Python programs? Ethernet or PPP?

I didn't appreciate that this is an implication of the RGMII problem you mentioned. The RGMII discussion should be an Issue so everyone involved can contribute to the discussion. Shall I create a new Issue by cutting and pasting from your email to me? Or would you like to create the Issue?

Unless someone wants to fix the bugs or provide funding, there is nothing to discuss.
