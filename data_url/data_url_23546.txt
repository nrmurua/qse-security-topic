The error message raised when pickling an instrument references the old Loops which is confusing to modern users.
https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/66222eb8cc4ab1ab2cdadb94da827f94436b4af7/qcodes/instrument/base.py#L368-L375
I propose that we shorten the error message down to "QCoDeS instruments can not be pickled".
Maybe this is something for @Akshita07 to look into?
