Step to reproduce:
Then try to save agin:
The file won't re appear on disk.
@alexcjohnson  is there a design idea behind this behaviour that I can't see ?
@everynodyelse Is this the wanted behaviour ?
Do we want a way  to force save anyway ?
This has now happened several times for us when using a combining parameter, to set the same value on two gates, and sweeping that one.
@MerlinSmiles this is reproducible also by manually messing with  last_saved_index or  save_range
@giulioungaretti no, not intentional. I didn't want to do a full check of the file to see if all the data is in it on every write, that would take forever. But checking whether the file exists period seems like a smart thing to do!
