Dear Sir/Madam.
The input could be run with popt/psmp which did not inclued  the sirus package, Since sirus was included when compiling. the
input code run with the err printed. It could be reproduced both on the cp2k 7.1 and cp2k 8.2.
How to correct it? Could you help me?
cp2k 8.2 would be easily installed by anacond3 but the sirus package is included.
mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:
Process name: [[8274,1],0]
Exit code:    127
We changed sirius api which makes the latest SIRIUS version incompatible with cp2k 7.1 and 8.2. My suggestion would be to use the latest official version as it provides an updated version of SIRIUS.
