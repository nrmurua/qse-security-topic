Within the circuit timing section https://qiskit.github.io/openqasm/language/delays.html#delays-and-other-lengthened-instructions, there are instructions such as
Within lengthof, it appears {x %0} is meant to be a box. Should it include the type boxas or should it be assumed that if {} are found as an argument for lengthof it is a box type.
Closing and will open more general issue for timing questions
