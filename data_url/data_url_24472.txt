After the fix applied in pull request "OP-61 Improve qtt installation." installation of pyqtgraph still fails, but for a different reason.
pip install -e .  fails because pyqtgraph needs PyQt5, which is not in the requirements list. This can be solved by adding pyqt5 to the install_requires list in setup.py.
Duplicated by  #611, which is indeed not resolved.
