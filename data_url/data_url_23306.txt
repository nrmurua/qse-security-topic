Hello,
I am trying to write the following function in a more dynamic way:
Here, instead of writing many sweep and many for loop, I am giving the sweep elements into an array like that:
sweep_elements = [[time,'time','s'],[range(5),'repititons']]
And I am writing the following code
However it is not working and I am getting this error :
measurement.py in _add_measurement_result(self, action_indices, result, parameter, store, name, label, unit)
557             ndim = len(self.loop_indices)
558             if len(data_array.set_arrays) != ndim + result.ndim:
--> 559                 raise RuntimeError(
560                     f"Wrong number of set arrays for {data_array.name}. "
561                     f"Expected {ndim + result.ndim} instead of "
RuntimeError: Wrong number of set arrays for result. Expected 2 instead of 3.
I have no idea what I did wrong. It seems to me all correct
Could you please help me and tell me what is going on here
Thanks,
Best
@apassenger Thanks for your question.
The error says that it expects your data to be 2 dimensional but it is actually 3 dimensional. Without being able to see what sweep_elements is it is a bit hard to figure out what exactly is going on.
Could I ask you to write your examples in such a way that I can execute them directly if possible?
Hello, thanks for the answer
My sweep_elements are here:
In the first code, the sweep_elements corresponds this code lines:
In the second code, the elements are in the list:
sweep_elements = [[time,'time','s'],[range(5),'repititons']]
And time is defined: time=np.arange(.1,1,step=.1)
n_points is an integer value
the prog is written in qua language. if you want I can put this code too
Hello
Do you have any update?
Hi again. Please provide a Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example http://www.sscce.org/ such that I can copy paste the code from your example to a python prompt and then execute it to see the issue. Otherwise I will have to manually piece together the pieces that you have provided and I unfortunately do not have. Also if possible please write the example such that it does not depend on qua
