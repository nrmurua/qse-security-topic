Noticed 1 test consistently failing in #1936
https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/actions/runs/7254911112/job/19764545557#step:7:40

Re-running the failed test does work but this has to be done for each commit triggering the CI workflow.
It appears the test failure can be fixed by generating a new secret token.

Thanks for raising this! We should take a renewed look at it. I'm going to close this since we have a ticket open for it already here: #1584
BTW did you mean to link to #1936?

Ah no. I meant to link to failing tests in #2034
