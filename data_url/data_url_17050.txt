Simple sequence of single qubit operators XZH results in incorrect overall unitary(example attached):
[[ 0.707+0.j -0.707+0.j]
[-0.707+0.j -0.707+0.j]]
ZH is correctly represented as:
[[ 0.707+0.j  0.707+0.j]
[-0.707+0.j  0.707+0.j]]
and X correctly as:
[[ 0+0.j   1+0.j]
[1+0.j   -0+0.j]]
Calculation by hand shows X.ZH to be incorrect, and also inconsistent with qiskit 0.8.2
This is best illustrated by running the following:
print(qiskit.version)
q = QuantumRegister(1)
c = ClassicalRegister(1)
circuit = QuantumCircuit(q, c)
circuit.h(q[0])
circuit.z(q[0])
circuit.x(q[0])
job = execute(circuit, backend)
result = job.result()
print(np.around(result.get_unitary(circuit), 3))
Output:
0.9.0
[[ 0.707+0.j -0.707+0.j]
[-0.707+0.j -0.707+0.j]]
The correct result should be (compare 0.8.2 output below):
0.8.2
[[-0.707+0.j  0.707+0.j]
[ 0.707+0.j  0.707+0.j]]
Revert to 0.8.2 for relevant code, or compare for the introduction of above behaviour


Are you trying with the latest Qiskit release installed via pip? (0.9) Just to make sure everything is fixed now.
Ok, seems like you are using the latest version so I guess that this might be fixed from 0.8.2. I'm closing this. Thanks for reporting!
No, this was referring to 0.9.0. This is an open issue
I can't reproduce this. On latest stable I get the correct output with your example:
Returns True for me on Terra 0.9.0, Aer 0.3.0
The problem is reproducible with BasicAer - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BVSV_KnVppRk5N-oXWov5R1tWl9DMB-R
For qiskit version = 0.8.2 , BasicAer result equals Aer result
It looks like there is a phase issue in the Terra transpiler pass that combines single-qubit gates. You can see this running on Aer or BasicAer if you manually specify the unroll gates and optimization level.
Using the previous example the following returns the correct result with either Aer or BasicAer
The following returns an result with -1 global phase
The problem is reproducible with BasicAer - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BVSV_KnVppRk5N-oXWov5R1tWl9DMB-R
For qiskit version = 0.8.2 , BasicAer result equals Aer result
Moving the example here, just in case:
PR #4036 fix this issue. @ajavadia, I just saw PR #3658 after finishing the fix.
@1ucian0   Has this been resolved? Your example seems to produce the correct response as of 0.18.0.dev0+31a24c1
Indeed, it seems fixed. Adding the test from #4036 in #6295 for closing the loop.
