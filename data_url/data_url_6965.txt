The information overload on landing in Quirk is a bit extreme. Adding some structure, like a landing menu, would help.
The menu should be easy to dismiss and get started, and shouldn't show up when linked to non-empty circuits. It should have basic info "this is a quantum circuit simulator", and probably only two options: start, tutorial.
