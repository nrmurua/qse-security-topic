just run thew qiskit-aer-gpu install command
it should install
I am facing the same error, unable to find any fix. Please direct me to one if possible.
There is no qiskit-aer-gpu package on Windows. We're only able to build and publish it on Linux which you can see with the list of available binary wheels on: https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-aer-gpu/#files If you'd like to run the GPU simulator on windows you'll have to build it from source following the instructions in the contributing guide: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-with-gpu-support however note the GPU simulator is not tested or supported on windows so there are likely issues there. I'm closing this since there is not anything to fix here, please feel free to reopen this if I'm missing something.
