The qiskit.result.Result.get_statevector documentation says that it returns list[complex]. However, it many time returns Statevector. This was introduced in #7277 . I'm not sure if now it should always return Statevectors or if now the return type is a Union.
Re: https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/q/33294/1859
The method used to obtain the statevector has two possible cases: a list of complexes or an instance of the StateVector class. The result is obtained based on the input provided.
