Dear Pulser devs,
at Forschungszentrum Juelich we are currently trying to install the current pulser==0.16.0 version so that we can include it in our 2024 HPC SW stage.
It seems that all your pulser > 0.14.1 pin their jsonschema > 4.18, but unfortunately our SW stage provides jsonschema==4.17.3. I've noticed that jsonschema isn't used too widely by Pulser, so is there any chance you could consider supporting our 4.17.3 version?
Many thanks in advance and sorry for the inconvenience!

Hello Carlos,
Thanks for your interest in Pulser ! It seems feasible, I have just opened a PR to support v4.17.3 of jsonschema.
Best regards,
Antoine
Hey @ccalaza , pulser == 0.16.1 has been released with support for jsonschema == 4.17.3. Feel free to let us know if any issues persist.
Many thanks for the quick reaction, Henrique and Antoine!
This was the only incompatibility we spotted so I think we are good :)
