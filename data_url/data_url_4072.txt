This problem is discussed at this issue.
The change should happen in OpenQL after it is done in the assembler. Once it is done in the assembler, I will notify this repo.
@gtaifu Did the change happen in the Assembler ? Should I update it in OpenQL ?
@Nader-Khammassi , @AdriaanRol , @imranashraf , it is done in the new CC-Light assembler. You can get the new version assembler from the development branch of CC-Light.
@AdriaanRol If you can confirm you are using the updated version of the assembler, I will change the output file name.
This will also require to update the qisa-as inside tests/qisa-as to work properly.
Done. All tests are passing on linux as well as windows.
