I was trying some simple rabi oscillation with sum basis and found different behavior for schroedinger() and master().
If I understand what I am doing, the following script shows two identical plots (as printed value is true), but it does not.
When you supply a density matrix to schroedinger you are computing the action of the propagator exp(-itH) * rho, whereas master performs exp(-itH) * rho * exp(itH).
You should see the same results if you apply schroedinger to psi0 to get pure state outputs.

Thank you. I guess it is not a sum basis thing then.
If I am interested in a coherent evolution of a mixed state , I should use master without the jump operators.
Yes, that's right.
