I have an issue with a hanging PR. It seems that the PR creation was interrupted during processing and it does not show up in the PR list (should be #55) as an issue. When I try now to create the PR again a validation error is shown claiming that the PR already exists. Does anybody know how to resolve this?
The reason for this was an incident at GitHub, which seems to be solved now.
