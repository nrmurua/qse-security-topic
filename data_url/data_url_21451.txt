I cannot find the dataset tab on the dashboard. Restarted artiq multiple times, but dataset tab not appearing.
Dataset should be next to the shotcuts/applets/Explorer tabs?
Operating System:
ARTIQ version: ARTIQ v5.0+202.g4ebd956e.dirty
Version of the gateware and runtime loaded in the core device:
PS C:\Users\LABadmin\Documents\artiq-master> artiq_coremgmt -D ... log
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\envs\artiq\lib\encodings\idna.py", line 165, in encode
raise UnicodeError("label empty or too long")
UnicodeError: label empty or too long
If using Conda, output of conda list (please submit as a file attachment, as this tends to be long)
conda list output.txt
Hardware involved: software issue
Most likely Qt and/or Windows bug, try deleting the GUI state file. https://forum.m-labs.hk/d/90-open-artiq/9
Did this resolve the problem?
