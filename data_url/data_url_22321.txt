Using 1.1 on Windows, we have the following SPI device.
Trying to test this experiment, I have the following build,
When I scan the repository head, I get the error,
However, if I comment out the the last line self.dds0.channel = self.channel, scan the repository head, uncomment the line and then run the experiment, it runs as it should. How should I avoid the initial attribute error?
During repository scan, devices are not available and all get_device calls return None. If you really must have devices configured by arguments instead of the device database, simply skip the device interaction in build if the device is None.
Note that rewriting attributes after the device is created may not work correctly with all drivers; if you really cannot use what the device database system provides you, consider creating the device driver yourself (from artiq.coredevice.ad9914_spi import AD9914_SPI, self.device = AD9914_SPI(...)).
