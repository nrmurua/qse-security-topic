I found a doc bug to be fixed.
What is the file name(s) where you found the bug?
Documentation URL: https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/fundamentals/1_getting_started_with_qiskit.html#OpenQASM-backend
What is the current text that needs to be fixed or removed? (You can copy and paste)
$$|\psi\rangle = |000\rangle +|111\rangle)/\sqrt{2},$$ and let $xyz$ denote the bitstring that results. Recall that, under the qubit labeling used by Qiskit, $x$ would correspond to the outcome on qubit 2, $y$ to the outcome on qubit 1, and $z$ to the outcome on qubit 0.
What should the documentation say instead?

The URL doesn't work unfortunately.
Hi,
Let me update the link to the error:
