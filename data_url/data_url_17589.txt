Is it possible to filter jobs on a backend by the qasm.header.description string?  For example:
[job for job in backend.jobs if 'experiment_123' in qasms.header.description]
If not, can this be added?  It is a requested feature.
This should be possible with the db_filter argument of backend.jobs() but it may require some knowledge of the data format coming back from the api.
Yeah, I know about db_filter, but I have no idea how to get it to do what I want.  In addition, some things are CamelCased from the API, but they are snake_cased in terra, so searching is less than straightforward unless you are directly copying an example from the docstrings
All should not be CamelCased.
If this issue is still relevant, the filter that worked for me that returns jobs based on their qobj.header.description was db_filter = {'qObject.header.description': <target_qobj_description>} where target_qobj_description is the qobj.header.description you are filtering for.
If it is still a feature a lot of people ask about, I could make a Jupyter notebook tutorial explaining how to filter backend.jobs briefly and giving examples to some filters, such as this one.
I think this resolves itself once the jobs themselves have a name: Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider#118.
The question was asked in lieu of not having this functionality.
Since Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider#118 is closed, I'm closing this issue. Feel free to open back.
