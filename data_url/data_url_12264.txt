What is the easiest way to generate Equilibrium.txt files?
What do you mean by equilibrium.txt files?
ansatz. In the following folder, LiHEquilibrium.txt is stored.
qiskit-tutorial/reference/approximate/LIH/
Likewise, I want to calculate Li2, so I need the equilibrium (It is named here like that) file for Li2.
If I am mistaken please let me know.
Hi,
generating qubit Hamiltonians from general molecular configurations is currently not an available feature.
Will it be added soon?
Also, it doesn't have to be a built in function. Can you suggest any software or script for that purpose?
Yes, we are considering adding it so stay tuned for next releases. Thanks
