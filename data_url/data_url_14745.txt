The notation q for referring to physical flat register might be confusing to user with access to a layout. For example: #3851 (comment)
Would it be easier to add a physical register as an array of numbers for embed/physical circuits? Do we need an embed/physical circuit type?
Having an embed/physical circuit type might help the transpiler to skip the layout selection part and to some passes which only work on that type of circuit.
I found myself trying to decode what this code really means (StochasticSwap::run()):
.... and I got very confused until Luciano drove me to the real meaning.
I do agree with Luciano, differentiating the physical qubits that we map after applying the layout using a type instead of differentiating via naming, would make things easier to understand.
Code like that could be refactored to:
