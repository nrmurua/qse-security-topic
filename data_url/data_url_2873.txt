Currently, the way we implement gates that have a matrix but should also support Symbols is to do
But when we run a circuit with a ParamResolver, the gates do have a known matrix, but this doesn't let us use it. If we run such a circuit on the simulator, we'll get something like
which means we can't use the automatic decomposition feature. It would be really nice if this were not the case. This issue also holds for CompositeGates that perform arithmetic in the decompositions, since arithmetic can't be performed with Symbols.
As it stands, the simulator converts to an xmon circuit before resolving parameters. Can we do it the other way around?
If you try to let the gate be run by providing a decomposition instead, and the decomposition uses arithmetic, you'll get something like
So the larger issue is, how do you allow custom gates parameterized by Symbols to be run on the simulator?
This seems like a reasonable thing to do.
