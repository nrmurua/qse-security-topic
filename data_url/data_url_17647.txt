A lot of warnings are reported when make lint is run.
Run make lint.
No warnings.

Thanks for reporting and the PR, @iblancasa - however, please note that we are using a specific version of pylint and it seems that the warnings are due to using a different version than the one specified.
It's good timing, though - it was discussed informally last week to revise the pylint version and bring it into a more recent one, and work is underway! I'm closing this issue and opening a new one for making the transition official, as it involves some extra revising and tuning (for example, the no-else-return might be disabled overall).
