Getting a warning Could not find a suitable cuQuantum Python package. with the latest image (following directions from https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/install.html#docker-image), but the provided python examples seem to run okay otherwise.
This warning is from the code checking for the cuquantum-cu11 Python package. This package is a dependency of our cuda-quantum Python package and hence will be installed if not present when installing cuda-quantum via pip.
The docker image has a natively built cuda-quantum Python package (opt/nvidia/cudaq) and a system-level cuquantum installation (/opt/nvidia/cuquantum), this warning can be safely ignored. A workaround is to install the cuquantum-cu11 Python package in the docker image since we didn't do a pip install of cuda-quantum as a package when building the image.
