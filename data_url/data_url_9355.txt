In creating the SchrodingerProblem, if the total_time is longer than the time in the Hamiltonian h, an error should be produced. If the wavefunction Ω and Δ have different total time, then total_time should be smaller or equal to the smaller of either one, otherwise, an error should appear.
prob = SchrodingerProblem(reg, total_time, h);
I think this should be resolved in upcoming BloqadePulse.
