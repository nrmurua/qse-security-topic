when i used toolchain to install cp2k 7.1 or 9.1 version, i used this command
But i met this issue
Thanks for your time and help
Best
I suggest to try the latest CP2K release 2023.1, because several issues related to the toolchain build have been fixed in the meantime. Moreover, I do not recommend to combine OpenMPI and MKL. Either use OpenMPI with OpenBLAS or Intel/MKL, i.e. a setup purely based on Intel.
