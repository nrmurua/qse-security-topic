To transfer binary data via SPI, it would be useful to be able to iterate over a bytes() object in ARTIQ-Python, instead of having to pass 32 bit integer arrays around.
maybe bytearray() would be better here since it is mutable (reading SPI data).
Why not both.
ack. "better" just when prioritizing. the .extend() ability of bytearray() might make it more problematic again. what i'd like is a fixed size bytes/bytearray where i can set elements.

We just skip all such methods already. E.g. size-altering mutators of list.
