The equation given for the DQM under docs/concepts/dqm.rst does not appear to be correct.  I believe that the linear and quadratic terms are associated with indicators on the cases of each discrete variable, not the discrete variables themselves.  As written, the equation appears to suggest we could do something like red * green.
Correcting this may complicate the notation quite a bit.  I suspect that four indices are needed to express the quadratic terms (two for the discrete variables, two for the cases, just like in DiscreteQuadraticModel.set_quadratic_case).  And if v_i denotes a discrete variable, it may be necessary to use a different notation in the equation, such as x_i_j, which would be a binary indicator for whether discrete variable i is set to case j.
