Hi,
I'm new to the project as a user. I am trying to solve some problems involving multiple baths with Floquet formalism. Just wondering if you already implemented it in your current version?
Notice this just now in the documentation: http://qutip.org/docs/3.1.0/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html where 'Currently the qutip.floquet.fmmesolve can only accept a single environment coupling operator and spectral-density function.' But I think it's good and not so difficult to come up with a general solvers where multiple baths are supported by myself. Is it okay if I contribute to this as well?
Cheers,
Tianqi
Any help on the Floquet module would be great! Let mention that further work on it could also fall under the https://github.com/qutip/qutip/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2021 scope, if applicable.
