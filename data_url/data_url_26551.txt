Thanks god. cp2k-master has been successfully compiled on RockyLinux 8.5 OS with mkl 2020.4 and openmpi 4.1.1 but something about plumed 2.7.3 warning printed on the screen. The compiling method is toolchain with all functional packages without GPU and cuda. All scripts under the path-tool/toolchain/scripts are kept unchanged.
After type make -j 8 ARCH="psmp" test and press the Enter key, it prints something about git and some tests about QS were not carried out.
warnings-about-plumed.txt
QS-test-not-satified.txt
warnings-about-git.txt
All three warnings are benign and nothing to worry about:
QS-test-not-satified.txt
Those three test directories require >2 mpi ranks. So, essentially they are never executed :-(
warnings-about-git.txt
This warning only means that your binary won't know from which git revision it was built.
warnings-about-plumed.txt
This has already been fixed upstream: plumed/plumed2@ee230ef. We just have to wait for their next release.
Thanks.
Upload some errors tested for your references.
it was tested on my laptop with RockyLinux 8.5. Plumed-master on 20220207 was downloaded for compiling.
