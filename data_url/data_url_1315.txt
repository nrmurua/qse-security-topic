Description of the issue
Currently cirq_google.GridDevice requires that for any operation with exactly two qubits, the pair of qubits must be in qubit_pairs. However, not all 2-qubit operations require the qubits to be coupled. In particular, MeasurementGate should be allowed on any set of qubits, including pairs that are not coupled.
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
0.15
Thanks for the catch!
