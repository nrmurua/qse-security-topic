we should support more framework and language, so we can add more simulator for different framework, so we are able to use different tools from different framework.
adding necessary support for community to add other simulator easily as well.
to implement this, we can learn from https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/PennyLane-qsharp, but we also want to look into tools from other language as well such as julia, c++
I think Pennylane and OpenQASM 3.0 should be our next packages that we add. But going forward, I can definitely get behind investigating how we might integrate the Bloqade and qsharp python wrappers, which would give us reach into both Julia and C++, respectively.
As per reddit poll seems like OpenQASM 3.0 won the popular vote:
The only package that has built-in support for converting to OpenQASM 3.0 seems to be Amazon Braket:
cirq and qiskit both still seem to be hardcoding the openqasm 2 header:
There don't seem to be any packages (yet) that support conversions from OpenQASM 3.0. But will continue to look into it.
Worthwhile approach could be adding converters that convert OpenQASM 2.0 to OpenQASM 3.0 and vice versa.
As for pennylane, we supported conversion of the pennylane.tape.QuantumTape program type in the past. This was pretty straight-forward, because pennylane QuantumTapes have built-in support for converting to/from openqasm, e.g.
