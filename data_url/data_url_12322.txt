It was working well since April 2023. But ever since April 2023, I have been getting the below error when trying to install tensorflow-quantum.

TFQ nightly has 2.11 Tf requirement
TFQ Colab errors due to its silent Python version change have been well documented in the issues (look at any recent installation issue, eg Can't install tensorflow quantum == 0.7.2?Â #768 (comment))
