The page "qiskit.providers.aer.noise.phase_damping_error" has description "Return a single-qubit combined phase and amplitude damping quantum error channel." even though it should only create phase damping error.
This was issued in Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#1119 however, it is an error in the documentation generated by this repository files
I am actually working on this
Fixed in #1374
