To solve the Schr√∂dinger Equation in the Simulation.run() method, one calls QuTiP's sesolve() routine. One of the arguments to give is tlist, which corresponds to a list of times for the result's output. This list was set to be equal to that of the Hamiltonian constructed from the pulse sequence (taking into consideration a sampling_rate). It may be useful, in some applications, to only output certain times (e.g. if we only care about the expectation value of an operator at the final time).
To allow custom evaluation times, an additional argument should be given to the Simulation.run() method (called evaluation_times) which contains said custom times. It will then be entered as the value for the tlist argument of sesolve().
