Is there any way to control the amplitude from the AD9914? The manual describes phase and frequency control but not amplitude.
What should the amplitude unit be?
Could we just leave it as a fraction?
You mean a number between 0 (min) and 1 (max)?
Yes. I think that's probably better than any absolute power or voltage value as most of the time the output is amplified anyway.
@sbourdeauducq What do you want me to do?
Needs to be a new method which takes an amplitude between 0 and 1, converts to a 12-bit value, and writes to ASF register.

Actually, better send those patches to the ML or by email to me.
There are still some issues to fix, e.g. this disables reset for the 9858 as well, adds the unneeded reset pulse delays, etc. Please review carefully each line of this patch.
Added asf_to_amplitude function. All the changes should be here.

Almost there, there is still the reset test laying around in this patch, and the ddb should not be modified.
I think I got rid of all the residual reset test stuff.

The "turns on OSK" comment is misplaced. DURATION_DAC_CAL should not be modified.
We're not changing the DAC cal pulse time to match the datasheet? We don't want it at 1 ms?
147000 is the correct value for 1+ms, I already committed the fix. In all cases, this should be in a separate patch, since it has nothing to do with amplitude control.
Okay. Where do you want the turn on OSK comment? That seems to be where we modified it.
The comment and the source code currently sound as if bit 0x2000 were OSK disable.
Is this clearer?

Yes, thanks
