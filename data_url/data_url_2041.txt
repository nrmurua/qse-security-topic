If #2809 turns up nothing, we'll implement some QIS functionality in cirq. I'm filing this issue to request comments on the name of the possible future QIS subpackage in cirq. A few options to get us started:
My preference is 1. It is short and is consistent with some other second-level subpackages in cirq (e.g. ops instead of operations and linalg instead of linear_algebra). Option 2 is consistent with qiskit.quantum_info. Option 3 is the most descriptive.

+1 for choice 1.
Choice 1 sounds good to me. Even if we do decide to partner with another package, we'll need a place for the code being moved in #2808 and maybe a few core qis functions that we want to implement ourselves.
+1 for 1
Qis it is!
