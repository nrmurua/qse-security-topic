Currently, Statevector.draw('latex') ignores the max_size parameter.

We get 12 terms, but I expect to get 3.
The drawer should change its behaviour according to the max_size parameter.
I think adding **args to this line might do it.

Happy to look at this properly, can you assign me please?
Hi this issue has been causing me a real headache recently. Has there been any progress on it?
I think the solution will be very slightly different to what Frank originally suggested, because the options to array_to_latex and _state_to_latex_ket are different, so we'll need to only pass the right options to each of those, but in principle that's the only change needed.
I'll just ping @frankharkins to check if you've got time to work on it?  If not, I'll return it to the pool of good first issues for somebody else to take a look at.
Oh and in case it isn't the same bug in the code, the same issue occurs with .draw(output="latex_source")
Sorry I completely forgot about this, I'll have a look this week
Has there been any luck at all?
Yes, sorry- I've fixed and am just writing a test now.
