I'm not certain but for large SparsePauliOp objects, it seems like the type-checking is a bottleneck for initializing the object (which also happens inside various SPO methods such as compose()):

In the most common case, we can avoid calling isinstance thousands of times by changing the logic to:
Very crude timing test (seconds indicated at lower left); may want to confirm benchmark before committing. I repeated with seed=2 (not shown).

Coincidentally, I'd also spotted this recently and there's fix in #11133.
