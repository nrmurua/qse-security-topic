For the wheel issue/pr just some more information. They're covered by both #168 and #428 in for 0.4. One automates the wheel building (and publishing process) so we don't have to manually build them anymore, the other marks python 3.8 as supported (the first actually starts the processes of building wheels on py38). It would be good to push out a combined release with terra (which already supports 3.8) so that the 2 elements that require compiled code have published wheels on 3.8 so users stop running into issues installing with 3.8. The blocker for both is the windows environment but we can either fix those issues or workaround them somehow we should be good to go.
