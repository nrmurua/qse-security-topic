Current stretch type is defined as follows:
I think this is wrong because no space exists between stretch and N in the spec.
We distinguish different “orders” of stretch via stretchN types, where N is an integer between 0 to 255. stretch0 is an alias for the regular stretch.
The most naive (and not-smart) way to solve this issue is listing all the stretch types.
I'm not sure we can definestretchN with fragment Digit*.
There is no space. To create a space in ANTLR, you would need ' '. So stretchN would work. N is, admittedly, not limited between 0-255 though. An added example to fix this would be beneficial. Feel free to add a PR and tag me
