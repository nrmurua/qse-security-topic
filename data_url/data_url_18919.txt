The specification states that there are no implicit sizes for OpenQASM types: https://qiskit.github.io/openqasm/language/types.html#integers.
However, in some of the examples, an implicit width is assumed:
I think a default width would be nice, but either way the specification and examples should match.
Please remove the implicit types in examples and replace them with a sensible default for now. We will consider a default size at a later time
An alias like isize, usize, asize may be sensible as found in Rust for architecture-specific defaults.
I think we will almost certainly need some sort of default. Some examples have implicit casting. For instance, if you have
In this case, i is implicitly cast to an int type, rather than a float[64] (double floating pt used for const).
See #119.
