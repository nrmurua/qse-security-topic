when import cirq, it pull "google" module not found? can you give me some hints how to deal with this?
How did you install cirq: did you use pip install?  What version of python are you using (run "python --version" to figure this out)?  Could you post the text of the error that you got?
Short answer: run pip install -r requirements.txt
I ran into this message also when I tried to run some of the scripts intended for development, but with only the regular (non-dev) setup instructions completed.
Incidentally, the link to "development environment" on that page is broken, which is issue #850. I missed the dev setup instructions because of this, which is probably also what happened with @ywlds above.
I don't remember what sequence of commands I ran to get the error, but basically I just tried running something, and whatever missing module it complained about, I installed it. Eventually, I got the "module google not found" message and was unable to proceed further. I then realised that there was actually an additional page for dev setup. Running pip install -r requirements.txt fixed the problem.
I should link to the working development setup doc.
This issue can probably be closed, unless those instructions don't fix this problem for you.
Closing as we think this was the problem.  Please reopen if following the development setup doc doesn't work.
