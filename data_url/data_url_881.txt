Hi,
This may be the wrong place for questions/issues like this, and if so I apologise, but I cannot seem to find a way to initialise any arbitrary qubit state on aws braket. I can only start with a |0> state and then convert to a |1> state (or something in between) through gates.
What I desire to do can be done on IBMQ experience with initialize(). Is there something similar on AWS braket? If not would it be possible to create such a function.
Kind regards
Hello,
Thanks for reaching out! We currently don't support an initialize instruction. As you pointed out, the qubits can only evolve through the application of gates. We do however support an arbitrary unitary gate. An example usage can be found here
If this does not help, we would love to hear more about your use case and determine how we can incorporate this in Braket.
Hi,
I have came across the arbitrary unitary gate and was using it for another application so I should be able to use this to initialize any state. My concern is just that in doing this for the real world quantum computers I wish to access will introduce an extra unitary which will result in unnecessary extra noise. I would have thought the real world devices were capable of initialising any arbitrary start state so possibly some function of this form would be useful. If you wish to use the function I will create please let me know.
Many thanks
Glad to hear that the unitary gate unblocks you. I'm not quite sure if the real world devices can be initialized to any arbitrary state in a noise-free manner. I took a brief look at qiskit's initialize method and it seems like they derive the set of gates which lead to the specified input state vector.
