Since cuda-quantum is only available for Linux OS, I tried using it on Google Colab.
For CPU runtime, I ran the code:
It installed perfectly.
Then running the code
Also gave the desired output.
But when I changed the runtime to GPU, and installed the cuda-quantum again. This time running the code
gave me this error:
The full error being
It's evident that it's failing to import pycudaq in the __init__.py file, which is
The error is in line 28
from ._pycudaq import *
and this only arises when you are using an actual GPU runtime,
Make sure this is done in a GPU runtime, or with a machine with GPU.
It should not show any error.
Not a regression
No response
Can you confirm that you have the necessary CUDA runtime libraries installed?
This error matches the note in documentation - https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/simulators.html.
Also refer https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/install.html#dependencies-and-compatibility
Yes, I have installed all the necessary pacakges:

I believe the error is due to the fact that it's still not available for windows OS. Although I am using windows subsytem for Linux, but I think it's not compatible for that either.
