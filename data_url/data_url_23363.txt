Pysweep should become a new part of QCoDeS most likely just called the QCoDeS Sweep (since Loop now has such bad connotations).
It should not be a replacement for the current Loop, but an optional-to-use convenience object to create experimental runs. It should be clear how to achieve what the Sweep achieves in a more verbosely typed way.
I guess a good starting point for the development is integration with the new dataset's context manager.
I think I should be the one who is assigned this task.
I agree with the verbosity issue and the need for more proper documentation.
