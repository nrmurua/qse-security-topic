The utils folder is getting a bit bloated. I suggest that we move all code that is specialized to generating model Hamiltonians (i.e. hubbard, jellium, plane_wave, meanfield and possible molecular_data) to a different folder called "models". This will require changing imports in a lot of the code and also in docs/examples.rst and in the demo ipython notebook.
