I hope you can add a shortcut to delete selected gate or gate combination (column). By selected gates I mean the gates selected when using ctrl key.

I could remove the code that clamps the column into the circuit, and allow it to be dragged away.
Weirdly, it does this sporadically on OSX; this probably has to do with ctl not being remapped to cmd.
Fixed by 6da666c . Will be in next release.
