In order to complete qiskit-terra and qiskit-aer integration we must:
Aside from that, we should try three scenarios:
For the version I assumed the metapackage qiskit and qiskit-terra package would keep in sync and both be at version 0.7.
Should scenario 1 be: "install just the terra element through pip install qiskit-terra" I thought the idea of the metapackage was it would always install terra and aer in one go
All the scenarios tested with the packages in the testing PyPI repository: https://test.pypi.org/
