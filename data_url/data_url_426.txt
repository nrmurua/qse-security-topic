This snippet (Let's call it input.qasm.) reveals a problem.
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[3];
qreg qqq[1];
creg c[3];
measure q -> c;
if(c==1) x qqq;
When I run this:
./staq   -o output.qasm   input.qasm
It will produce this output:
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[3];
qreg qqq[1];
creg c[3];
measure q[0] -> c[0];
measure q[1] -> c[1];
measure q[2] -> c[2];
x qqq[0];
The output is functionally different from the input because the if statement is gone.
If the if statement takes this form
if(c==1) x qqq[0]; 
everything will work as expected.
Thanks for the bug report -- it was caused by an error in some of the visitor logic. It should be fixed now.
