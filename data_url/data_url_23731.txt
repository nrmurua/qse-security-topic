data set looks like:
Should look the same both times and have the setpoints you would expect on the x axis
Looks right when you live plot it (as in step 1) but gives a nonlinear spacing error when you load the data (as in step 2) in and discards the setoints but keeps the label which is now a lie!
from 1

from 2

with this error:
Note: works in matplot in terms of using the setpoint array even when loading data back (but we cant use that because of #380)
Note2: code generating setpoints looks like:
@giulioungaretti @alexcjohnson @WilliamHPNielsen
Note3: also works correctly for plotting in the notebook after taking the data (ie without live update)
Note4: this sometimes works as expected even in QtPlot (depends on the setpoints)  which makes me think its something to do with rounding in the driver producing a nonlinear setpoint array but it still wouldn't really explain (to me at least) why it would always work fine with the Note3 example but not with loaded in data.
I guess you could try to increase the MAXPX value in the qcodes/plots/pyqtgraph.py file to see if it is related to rounding errors?
Not that I understand how that error is actually calculated...
@MerlinSmiles that works, thanks Merlin. Not sure whether to close the issue or leave open to flag up that this is a minor thing that should be looked at/changed in qcodes. @giulioungaretti ?
@nataliejpg dont close it, its still a bug.
@nataliejpg I think this has been fixed some time ago ?
@jenshnielsen agreed
