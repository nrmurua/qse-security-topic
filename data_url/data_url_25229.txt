I'm not sure if you wanted to include the Version Migration Guide in the "User Documentation" side-panel or not, but I don't think it's currently visible.
Currently, the Azure Batch and Google Batch executor instructions aren't listed in the Plugins index, meaning that most users probably don't know about it.
In the Server Deployment section of the docs, the "Cloud Deployment" section only lists AWS. However, the docs folder also has instructions for deployment with Azure, which is otherwise not visible since it's not included in the index.rst. The deploy_with_azure.rst should be added to the index.rst as a card alongside AWS.
Hi @arosen93, great observation! Unfortunately, we're still testing the deployment with Azure at deployment with Azure and it's not available to the public yet. Our team is working hard to make sure everything is running smoothly and up to our standards. Once it's ready, we'll have everything you need at the click of a button, including the documentation, corresponding image, and plugin. If you're an Azure user and want more information, just let us know through Slack in Covalent. We'd be happy to give you access to the alpha version !
Oh, I guess I was a bit early with that one! I've expanded the scope a bit just to clarify a few other things I noticed, but I'll close the issue for now.
Pinging @wjcunningham7 and @venkatBala since they made the version migration guide and Google batch executor instructions, respectively, and I'm not sure if their decision was intentional or not.
