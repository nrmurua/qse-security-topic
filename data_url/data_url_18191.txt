Building an alpine docker image of qiskit-0.4.9 results in a build error.
pip install 'qiskit==0.4.9' should succeed.
The installation fails with a build error. See the attached logfile for the output log.

Building pip install qiskit==0.4.8 does succeed. The docker image is located at https://github.com/eddieschoute/python3-qiskit
Provide build requirements so that I can figure out what dependencies are missing.
Or output missing dependencies that cause the build to fail.
My CI build system relies on the docker image and I recently bumped my version to qiskit-0.4.9. The CI system is now broken.
Building locally on macOS 10.13 did succeed.
Hi @eddieschoute,
Seems like your docker image must be missing some of the components needed to build the C++ Simulator.
Anyway, that shouldn't be a problem at all, you are actually hitting a bug that we have already fixed in the master branch, so it will be fixed for the next  release, that should happen soon.
If you can install using pip in verbose mode: pip install -vvv 'qiskit==0.4.9' and paste the traces here, I could see what's failing on your build and try to sort it out.
Hi @atilag , I have attached the verbose log. I don't see any trace of why the error happens but maybe you have more insight: log-verbose.txt
@eddieschoute I just noticed that Alpine build-base package doesn't include CMake. Since 0.4.9, CMake (>=3.5) is required to build non-python code. Try to install it on your docker image, and send me the verbose log again if it fails.
Adding CMake to the docker packages has resolved the issue.
