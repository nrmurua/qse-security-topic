Latest OQS update breaks the OpenSSL build. "./config" results in the following error:
cd vendor/liboqs && make links
make[1]: Entering directory '/mnt/c/temp/openssl/vendor/liboqs'
make[1]: *** No rule to make target 'links'.  Stop.
make[1]: Leaving directory '/mnt/c/temp/openssl/vendor/liboqs'
Makefile:451: recipe for target 'links' failed
make: *** [links] Error 2
The config script shouldn't be "making" vendor/liboqs. This is currently done in "make".
Fix is available under liboqs_update branch.
make depend ;make test now work fine.
make test is not causing the liboqs to rebuild it's only calling autoreconf -i;./configure;make but actually not building because it figures the build has already happened, if not, then only it actually builds.
Clearing this comment: please disregard. Despite my best efforts I wasn't actually starting from a fresh clone and had some lingering cruft somewhere that was messing things up. Sorry for the confusion.
Hi Kevin, we just tried rebuilding as well and didn't encounter any problems.  I'll close the comment, but please do follow up if you encounter any more trouble.
