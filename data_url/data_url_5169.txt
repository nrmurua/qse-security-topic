wavefunction-qubits returns the number of qubits in a wavefunction.  But, this interface is not use consistently. Is this an oversight, or intentional ?

Just an inconsistency I suspect.
The google lisp guidelines mention fixing small things like this inconsistency while doing other work. If I am working on code that touches this, I'll fix it.
