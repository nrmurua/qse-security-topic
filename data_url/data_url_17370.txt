If I add unitary gates to the circuit, they show up fine in the mpl drawer except for the 1-qubit case. The single-qubit case should also not print the full matrix, and just do a box labeled "unitary".

It looks like the box isn't in the correct place for the 4-qubit case? Potentially a separate issue
It's a bit of an offset, probably due to that 0 label at the top. Not a big deal but yes would be nice to fix that too.

Yeah, they look like 2 separate issues. It looks like the dynamic sizing for the 4 qubit case could be off slightly. (although my eyes may be playing ticks on me as I think I see the spacing between qubit 0 and 1 as slightly larger) The label issue is probably caused by the param fix in #2169 treating the matrix as a string parameter. We'll probably just need to add real type checking there.
