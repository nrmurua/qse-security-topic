I'm using a window PC and trying to install artiq 4.0.dev from the dev channel but seems something goes wrong:

Then I found I only got an artiq\binaries\kc705-nist_clock folder installed in this new environment.
I tried to install other versions and found out that this problem first appeared in artiq 3.5.
I guess there's something wrong about the conda setting?
As a workaround, add artiq=4.0.dev to the conda create command line (or type conda install artiq=4.0.dev in the activated environment)
This should have been fixed in 1ef673c, but conda is selecting the commit just before that for some reason.
@KaifengC Do you still have this problem?
It's still the same. But using conda install artiq=4.0.dev in the activated environment makes it work.
Can you run conda update conda and try again?
I use conda update  conda and update conda to 4.5.4-py36_0. Then I create a new environment, still the same.
This is also affecting 3.6.
Fixed by updating conda-build + d6992f6
