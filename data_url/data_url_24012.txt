Multi-pew Management
Multiple param entry windows can be opened at the same time but the MetalGUI keeps reference  to only the latest pew
This is useful for testing purposes and since the windows are dockified, no usability issues have been noticed yet. However, for future testing, it would be useful to have better management of all the currently available pews.
