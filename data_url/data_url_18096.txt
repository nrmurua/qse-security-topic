The compile method randomly fails to compile and throw a TypeError exception.
Here is the full stack-trace obtained from the QISKit_issue_593.py file:
After some investigations, the "complex" value is close to 4.71 - 2.1e-8. Because the compiler is not deterministic, results are not really reproducible and so you may obtain a different value.
The script may take several minutes to finish: one compilation is approximately 20 seconds on my computer and the exception may occur only after 4 or 5 steps.
With the modification of eps in qiskit.mapper._mapping.yzy_to_zyz, this script should run for ever without being interrupted by an exception thrown by the compiler.
To recall, the "complex" value responsible for the exception is close to 4.71 - 2.1e-8. With such a tiny amplitude, I think the imaginary part can be the result of a mathematical operation with bad rounding. @rraymondhp proposed the computation of eigenvalues on Slack.
EDIT: Updated to link to gists instead of full code in the description.
Possibly the same issue as #239.
This is the same issue as what #607 will fix.
@ajavadia can we check if this can be closed now.
Should be.  Same as #520.  Becuase rotations not valid, so small complex term.
Yes, I just confirmed that this is also fixed by #626.
