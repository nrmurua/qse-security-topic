I am trying to generate a single atom by using the code below,
atom1 = generate_sites(ChainLattice(), 1, 3.0)
It shows errors as shown in the snapshot

The code does generate the atomist successfully, but it could not output a plot for the atom position
.
Thanks for the report, here 3.0 should be a key word argument. The following code works for me.
