We had some issues when loading the backplane with 11 DDS`. They started failing to programme starting from DDS0, which seems to be due to some bus signal integrity issues. This can be fixed by increasing the current drive from 12 to 24 mA. This enables us to handle a fully loaded bus. Could we apply the following patch to gateware/nist_qc2.py? Are there any issues with raising the current?
There are no particular issues. Did you get the backplane to work with 11 DDSes?
Yes, 11 seemed to work fine with flterm. The io_update signal at least looked better on the scope as well.
Note that we only used 11 DDS cards because one of the slots on the backplane wasn't working correctly; we will test with a full load of 12 at a later stage.
Tested with 12 DDS boards with flterm and it seems to work.
