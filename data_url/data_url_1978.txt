Single qubit circuits returned from testing.random_circuit are always empty with the default gate domain. For example:
The reason is that the default gate domain contains two-qubit gates, so max_arity = 2 which prevents any gates from being added to single qubit circuits.
This can be fixed by passing in a gate_domain with only one-qubit gates, but it seems useful to have the default behavior return non-empty circuits.
Proposed change: If the number of qubits is one, only select from single-qubit gates in the provided gate domain.
For example:
Does this sound reasonable? If so I can submit a PR with this change.
This seems reasonable to me. Could you also update the doc string to specify that the default is to use the DEFAULT_GATE_DOMAIN including noting the special case you are adding (The param currently doesn't document this)?  (I'd also maybe use a different word that arity or at least clarify it in the doc string, it's not a term that is universally understood).
