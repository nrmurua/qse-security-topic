Once Expr values are allowable in some attributes in QuantumCircuit operations, we need to ensure that QuantumCircuit methods take them into account.  For the minimal set of expressions described in the initial classical-expression design document, the necessary "register-mapping" logic should be largely the same as already exists, but the mapping will need to rebuild the expression tree fully as well.
Depends on #10223 and #10224.
