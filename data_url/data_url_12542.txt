A simple image based on Tensorflow's would be cool.
For example:
Interesting idea, It doesn't look like other TF addons like probability are using their own docker containers. @MarkDaoust or @yashk2810 what are your thoughts on this ?
Depends on how important it is. Why is a docker container needed though?
Note: Creating docker containers comes with a maintenance cost. So I would recommend going through all the positives and negatives of it and then deciding on what to do ðŸ˜…
Cool, it makes sense to save maintenance cost here. I don't think there is too much extra effort to create Docker file based on TensorFlow's.
