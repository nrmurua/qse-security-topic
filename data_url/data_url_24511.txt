@Nomos11 Optinions on the interface?
Looks like the right way to do it. What I do not fully grasp yet is:
One addition to the to_next_multiple might be an optional minimum_sample_count to not go below (e.g. the 192 samples for the Tabor)
how is the symbolic sample_rate provided?
At instantiation time, i.e. in create_program.
pt_kwargs (what would be their usecase then?)
pt_kwargs is for all optinal arguments that a SequencePT takes, f.i. an identifier or measurement definitions.
does it entail potential disadvantages in program compilation afterwards if it is 'split' into 2 PTs?
This can be automatically detected later or the resulting PT can be passed as a member of to_single_waveform.
Implemented in #802
Was the to_next_multiple convenience function supposed to be added as well, or to be constructed in own code?
It was just an example here but it makes sense to provide it. Could you implement it?
is #805 suitable?
