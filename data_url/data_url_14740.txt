The following 3 circuits are all equivalent:



When starting from the zero state, all three should be equivalent to this:

The HoareOptimizer transpiler pass is able to deduce this for the first circuit, but not for the other two.
Can we improve the pass?
Code for the 3 circuits:
With @javabster, we are going to take this short project as part of the "connectme at ibm" mentorship program.
