There is a TODO in test_visualization_output.py.
I think is time to remove the TODO and start running it. Especially in the context of the new circuit_drawer interface.
I moved the skip to the specific tests in 6618ed7.
@1ucian0 i don't get this. what's the point of skipping these (what does it mean by "useful for refactoring purposes"). There are other tests of latex drawer and mpl drawer that we don't skip. I think we should remove the skip.
This issue is about stop skipping them. When we had that attempt to have a meta test for the visualizers (#1617), we could close it. But we reverted it (#1780). Any way, the idea is to test the visualizers, not just to skip it.
In order to close this issue, we need to move the following tests to binder (see #4544):
@1ucian0 Are these still relevant - test_circuit_visualization_output.py, visualization.py, and test_pulse_visualization_output.py? I believe there are other tests that cover these and the test images are way out of date. Should they be removed along with their .png files?
First off, since most all of these tests are skipped and have been skipped for a couple of years, I'm not sure it's of much value to port any of these. It seems more reasonable to delete all this and open issues for places where testing is inadequate, like #2307.
Removing the skipped tests and create issue for non covered code would be a way to close this issue indeed.
Ok, great. I can clean this up.
Is there a plan in place to move pulse testing to the #4544 model? If so, I'll open a new issue for that.

Not that I'm aware of. @TharrmashasthaPV working on #6450, the fist extension to #4544, so probably should look similar to it.
