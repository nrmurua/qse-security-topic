The QRL installation will fail because the pyqryptonight and pyqrandomx cannot be installed on Ubuntu 20.04 Server running on Raspberry Pi 4B.
The Raspberry Pi may not be powerful enough to earn any coins, but it is very good for development and testing. Would you please make the QRL work for the Pi?
The same installation procedure on Ubuntu 20.04 Server with AMD CPU works perfectly.
AES-NI support is required to install the above libraries. I don't think Raspberry Pi has support for AES-NI. This could be checked via following command
cat /cpu/procinfo | grep aes
If the above command doesn't give any output, then it means your hardware doesn't support AES-NI
