Had this issue on Ubuntu 16.04 and on Debian 9. Looks like something is not right with building?
What is the CPU that you are using?
We are using an instruction set: AES-NI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set) that is not supported in old CPUs
While we could work on supporting very old CPUs, they would not be actually effective due to the higher requirements of the cryptonight algorithm.
I agree that it may make sense to automatically detect CPU capabilities and show an appropriate error message.

It's the Xeon X5570
ok, you seem to be running a virtual machine.
Could you tell me what are you using? Vmware, Virtualbox, etc? It would be good to document the environment so we see if there is any chance of supporting that in the near future. At least with the miner disabled.
I run Proxmox on dedicated servers
I have updated the title to be more specific about the problem
