In  retworkx 0.10.0 new generator functions were added for quickly generating heavy hex and heavy square graphs: https://qiskit.org/documentation/retworkx/stubs/retworkx.generators.directed_heavy_hex_graph.html#retworkx.generators.directed_heavy_hex_graph  and https://qiskit.org/documentation/retworkx/stubs/retworkx.generators.directed_heavy_square_graph.html#retworkx.generators.directed_heavy_square_graph. We should leverage these fun and add 2 new constructor methods to the CouplingMap to easily create coupling maps using a heavy hex and heavy square (similar to the existing from_grid and from_ring methods)
Hi! Can I take this up?
Sure, go ahead.
