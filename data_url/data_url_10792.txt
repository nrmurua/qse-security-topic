Description
Trying to interrupt an embedding in a Windows terminal under an ipython interpreter acknowledges
the interrupt but does not return control to user:
To Reproduce
I'm running find_embedding(Q.keys(), sampler.edgelist) where Q is 500 nodes highly connected (about 50% of a clique) and sampler is the DW_2000Q_6. (Low expectations of success, I wanted the error message)
Expected behavior
CNTR-C should return prompt to user.
Environment:
Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here.
This is fixed in the current version, will be included in the next release.

In the meantime, you can set tries = 1, and the first time you hit ctrl-c and it'll bail more or less immediately.
Thank you!
