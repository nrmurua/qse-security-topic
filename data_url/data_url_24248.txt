ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package

QTableModel_AllComponents
It should pass
giving new file
@leo07010 , did this case also resolve with the #432 change?
if not, where are you writing the line mentioned? We would need to understand how to reproduce it.
....just writing the line in jupyter notebook is expected to fail (python makes relative referencing only work within the package, not from jupyter notebook)
yes,it was also resolved
Thanks
