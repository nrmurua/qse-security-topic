The first sentence under the composites heading states:
Should this start with dwave-system composites.. ?
Composite ABC is defined in dimod, so this is probably OK, but I'll defer to @JoelPasvolsky.
Agree, we often refer to Ocean's samplers and composites as dimod samplers and composites because they're derived from the dimod ABC. The ones in this particular repo are a subclass for using D-Wave QCs, either directly or hybridly.
Thanks for the clarification!
