When covalent is run programmatically, even though it says the covalent server has started, the dask cluster takes some time to get set up. Which leads to adding a sleep statement right after doing covalent start. This is not an issue if someone does covalent start on their terminal and then runs their workflow manually because that small amount of time gap is sufficient for dask to set its cluster up.
This will fail with the error (you might have to check the logs):
_graceful_start should have a mechanism to check whether covalent and the dask cluster have started completely and only then exit and print the "Covalent server has started..." line. Ideally, no sleep statements should be present in this function.

I wasn't able to reproduce this, is it resolved?

I just checked, Seems like this issue is auto solved! thanks @madhur-tandon  !
Closing this.
