U1 gates are decomposed into U3:
gives
This is an issue because U1 is free whereas U3 is not.
It seems that U1 is being mapping to U3 here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/09240bb25b8117474b0d15467093126ac8115814/qiskit/extensions/standard/u1.py#L91
Note also that the docstrings discuss U3: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/09240bb25b8117474b0d15467093126ac8115814/qiskit/extensions/standard/u1.py#L75
what is your intention with decompose() here? this is how all gates are defined currently - they all build from U3 and CX as their base. This is due to openqasm's hierarchy, and so all gates fundamentally translate to that universal gate set. decompose() should not be treated as an optimizer.
For optimization you should use transpile(), and say that your backend supports u1 so that the transpiler keeps it.
If a backend does not support u1, then it all goes to u3. A use case of wanting everything to go to u3 could be noise modeling, e.g. as described in this issue #2762
ok, I guess it is my misunderstanding.
