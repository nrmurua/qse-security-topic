Description
In dwave-system==0.5.0, DWaveSampler() selected the solver based on the default configuration file; in dwave-system==0.5.3, DWaveSampler() selects the first sampler returned by client.solvers()
To Reproduce
In [1]: import dwave.cloud as dc
In [2]: dc.config.load_config()
Out[2]:
{'endpoint': 'https://cloud.dwavesys.com/sapi',
'solver': 'DW_2000Q_2',
'token': '***',
'client': 'qpu',
'proxy': None}
In [3]: from dwave.cloud import Client
In [4]: client = Client.from_config()
In [5]: solver = client.get_solver()
In [6]: solver.data['id']
Out[6]: 'DW_2000Q_2'
In [7]: solver.properties['chip_id']
Out[7]: 'DW_2000Q_2'
In [8]: from dwave.system.samplers import DWaveSampler
In [9]: DWaveSampler().properties['chip_id']
Out[9]: 'DW2X_3'
Expected behavior
Solver set in the configuration file should be selected
Environment:
Additional context
I suspect the change for feature filtering is to blame.
pip install dwave-system==0.5.0
In [1]: from dwave.system.samplers import DWaveSampler
In [2]: DWaveSampler().properties['chip_id']
Out[2]: 'DW_2000Q_2'
