PEP 257 says the one-liner "prescribes the function or method's effect as a command ("Do this", "Return that"), not as a description; e.g. don't write "Returns the pathname ..."."
I noticed that dwave_networkx uses descriptions but it does so consistently so I followed that. However, now that I'm looking at other repos like dimod I see they follow PEP 257.
If there's time once the others are 1.0-ready, it seems to me we should convert this one too.
