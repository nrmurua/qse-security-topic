as cirq.Rx() is just an XPowGate instantiation, Rx(pi) becomes x. This is just true up to a global phase, but also might be surprising for users. Also Rx(0) is not id, so it is not consistent.
Recommendations:
Now that we have cirq.GlobalPhaseOperation, I think we should consider removing global_shift from EigenGate resulting in splitting RxGate out of XPowGate.
That's a pretty big change
Yeah, there's no particular rush on making it. We could start by perhaps extracting RxGate as a child class of XPowGate.
As this is QasmOutput related there might be other ways around it - i.e we could handle known gates in the Qasm protocol, this way this Qasm specific structure doesn't have to force anything on the Cirq representation - there are other places where this is an issue, namely the S and T gates  (and maybe CH, CY could be supported too?):
xref #3640.
