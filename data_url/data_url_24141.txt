When creating a negative mask, the gds file has just one junction as desired
When creating a positive mask,  the gds file has junction on (datatype 53 and 54) and layer 1
Only one junction on datatype 53 and 54.
Investigate making of keep-out (nocheese) region.  Don't need the junction to calculate the keep-out region.
Did this not get resolved in your recent PR? @priti-ashvin-shah-ibm
This should been resolved when merged.
