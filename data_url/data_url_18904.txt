Subroutine can return value and return statements must be at the end of subroutine in the current grammar.
This means that a return statement can not be in branch bodies.
This is a fair point--will add a PR to update this.
@hhorii pls see #140.
I confirmed that #140 supports intermediate return. Once it is merged, this issue can be closed.
Closing as #140 is merged
