Right now you can only use a Cirq circuit in execute_with_cdr and related functions. All CDR functionality should be compatible with any QPROGRAM.
@rmlarose A lazy idea: maybe for the release 0.9.0 it could be enough to support  QPROGRAMs in execute_with_cdr and push the generalization of all the other cdr functions to the next release.
