Building a bitstream for a satellite with an ARTIQ version after 47581e0 leads to the satellite not getting a link to the master.
I'm pretty sure 0775ae1, 8f3d06a are the culprit.
If I find time tomorrow I'll check this.
The info output about the io expander is a fix for an unrelated hardware change that is not in upstreamed in ARTIQ yet.
I verified that it has nothing to do with this problem by testing a verbatim ARTIQ earlier but I don't have the console out of that right now.
It never gets an uplink connection after this.
No flash config file on the satellite.

I don't fully understand this comment but maybe that has something to do with it? @dnadlinger
Your guess isn't unreasonable, but I'm also not sure how the commits would be related – AFAIK they should only affect the DRTIO master.
What are the master's clock settings (that this satellite is supposed to connect to)?
To be clear, the changes only (are supposed to) affect Kasli v2 when used as a master, making it such that internal/external clocks can actually be selected at runtime through the rtio_clock config option without also having to recompile the firmware.
How do you come to the impression that the changes are limited to standalone/master? Maybe this was tested.

Yep, that was just a failure of Find All Uses (and apparently, also my subsequent rging) leading me to assume that the siphaser/… code used a different code path for initialisation.
Reopened this until somebody can confirm the issue fixed, as I can't test this locally until next week, and there doesn't seem to be CI coverage for DRTIO satellites.
Also need to be cherry-picked on release-7.
I've now tested 1dd0d34 on a Kasli V2.0.2 satellite and master and all seems to work as before on both sides.
Thanks!
