U gates with long parameters generate a poor visualization using matplotlib as can be seen in the following example that compares ASCII and mpl:

from qiskit.circuit.library.data_preparation import PauliFeatureMap
prep = PauliFeatureMap(2, reps=1, paulis=['ZZ'])
prep.draw('mpl')
a clear and more simple visualization of U gates parameters
option: remove operations inside the parameter and calculate the value
option: short the length of decimal values
option: do gate pink block much bigger to accommodate the string
This visualization is used in Qiskit circuit Pauli Feature Map documentation and following indications we are moving from ASCII hardcoded representation to mpl jupyter-execute code block
Not to belabor the point, but from #4580 comment new version,

Of course it might be nice if the 3.14... got replaced with pi somewhere.
