For example, inverting a fault tolerant Y basis measurement circuit will produce a fault tolerant Y basis initialization circuit. This involves reversing resets into measurements and measurements into resets, so that the detector structure is maintained despite relabelling what's being compared.
Should take "additional flows" to rewrite.
