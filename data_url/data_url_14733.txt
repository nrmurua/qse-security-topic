Some synthesis algorithms may not be exact. They must be exact (including global phase).
But it is often useful to synthesize more relaxed versions of them. If the particular synthesis algorithm supports this, it should expose a subset of the following: upto_phase (most algorithms), upto_diagonal (e.g. relative phase toffoli or the mcg_up_to_diagonal), upto_permutation, upto_approximation (2q basis decomposer).
I'm not sure if the issues mentioned here are still valid.  Would you be able to provide reproducers for them if they are, or otherwise close this issue?
