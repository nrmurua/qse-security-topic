Error message when running Aqua Qsvm :  403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://api-qcon.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/Network/ibm-q/Groups/open/Projects/main/Jobs?access_token=.... NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES, Error code: NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES.
We're running on Open device  (vigo or ourence) and after a chunk of about 280 error messages (NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES) that took about 15 minutes,  the jobs are successfully executed
dev_instance = QuantumInstance(dev_backend, shots=1024, seed_transpiler=50, circuit_caching=False)
qsvm_result = qsvm.run(dev_instance)
Similar problem referenced in issue : Error connecting to quantum devices #584 with Aqua version 0.5. Supposed to be fixed in Aqua 0.6
I noticed issue Qiskit/qiskit#395 in qiskit referencing  "Error msg typo: NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES"
but seems to be related to the typo only ?? :-)
When Aqua, such as via the IBM Q Provider, ends up with a remote connection, we retry job to ensure its success so that the algorithm can run to completion. We do show errors along the way and refusals to run such as lack of credits. These errors are from the backend/provider and we merely react/show these. Since credits are restored over time then at some point jobs can be run again which seems to be what you are seeing.
In the future I would expect this logic in Aqua to delegate over to a WorkEngine as described by this issue in the IBMQ Provider. Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider#333
@patdenim Can this now be closed or do you still have any issue around this?
@woodsp-ibm  hoops Sorry Steve, sure we can close it.
