I tried router in cirq.contrib.routing and it generated one moment with CZ((6, 5), (5, 5)) and CZ((6, 6), (7, 6)) in it. I thought there would be a problem because (6, 5) and (6, 6) are adjacent. I ran validate_moment on this moment and it agrees with me.
Well, I don't know what leads to this problem yet. Just to give you guys a heads-up. Also, I don't know if you have the target of making every moment after routing to be executable, but this seems to be a sensible target.
This is the intended behavior, as Sycamore doesn't have the cross-talk constraints that Bristlecone does.
If you want to run a circuit produced by the routing code on an XmonDevice, just run an optimization pass that moves simultaneous and adjacent 2-qubit gates into separate moments. This will be suboptimal, but because the routing code is targeted at Sycamore, there aren't plans to optimize the routing code to address this.
@Strilanc @mpharrigan Does this seem reasonable?
That's right
