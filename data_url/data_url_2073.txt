Currently only StepResult implements sample_measurement_ops(), which is only available to simulators that computes intermediate steps.

It (and also the associated abstract method sample()) should also be added to SimulationTrialResult to make it easy for simulators that only provide a final state (implements SimulateFinalState) to sample from it.
I'm happy to take a stab at it!

Cirq cync: @95-martin-orion will look at this and decide on whether a convenience method is needed.
Use case no longer exists, closing
