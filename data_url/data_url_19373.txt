Describe the bug
I noticed some strange behavior while trying to test qiboteam/qibotf#17 in my laptop. It seems that installing qibo using python setup.py develop breaks some package used by pip install / python setup.py making it impossible to install other libraries after.
To Reproduce
but qibo is still successfully installed and usable.
3. Try to install some other library, eg. qibojit, using python setup.py develop. This fails with the following error:
and qibojit is not usable. It is still possible to install libraries from pypi using pip, but not from source using pip install ..
It is the first time I notice something like this.
It looks like a conflict between sub-dependencies. Take a look at pypa/packaging#471 and pypa/packaging#481.
As a temporary fix, you can remove packaging==21.x and install packaging==21.0.
