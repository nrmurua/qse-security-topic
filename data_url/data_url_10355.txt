HTTPS certificates used on non-official SAPI endpoints might not be issues/signed by publicly recognized CA (think proxies and customers with on site installations of a D-Wave system).
In that case, we can advise users to install their local CA to a system-wide certificate store, or if they are sure they want to forgo all transport-layer security, they can use the permissive_ssl flag.
