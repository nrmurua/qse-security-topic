Add link to matrix in the docs/readme.
I was thinking of something like this at the top:

plus an explicit link at the bottom.
https://matrix.to/#/#qibo:matrix.org
(to further customize the badge, see the parameters at https://shields.io/badges/matrix)
Looks good to me.
At this point shouldn't we propagate this for all public repos?
I agree, cc @alecandido.
