Combine Client.get_solvers(), Client.get_solver() and Client.solvers() into a single public method.
Optimization currently provided with get_solver(name) (single solver fetch) can be a special case handled with solvers() if full name filter is given.
Propagate these changes to dwave-system/DWaveSampler.
