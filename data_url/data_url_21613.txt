We are currently running into an (unrelated) issue leading to panics in the network stack on the Kasli comms CPU. With panic_restart enabled, the Kasli should come up again after these â€“ and indeed, the CPU reboots, and the startup kernel is executed. However, neither of the two DRTIO links (to other Kasli satellites) comes up:
If left alone, this continues; the links never come up. The satellite log is not very informative (at least at default verbosity):
Reconfiguring the FPGAs using artiq_flash start fixes the issue, though.
All parties on 9c9dc3d.
@sbourdeauducq: This seems very deterministic (haven't seen the links come back ever; sample size ~10). I know you proposed looking into triggering reconfiguration from the CPU as a more robust "fix", but perhaps the root cause is immediately obvious to you here?
No. And there are lots of weird transceiver hardware states that can be entered on Artix7 if you mess with clocks and resets. ICAP is the right solution.
