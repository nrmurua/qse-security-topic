Right now samples key is an alias for solutions list. solutions is returned by SAPI, and we introduced samples as it sometimes makes more sense from user's perspective.
Now that we're implementing pre/post-processing of parameters/response (see #199, #200), it makes sense to have samples be a list of dictionaries which will map only active qubits to states.
