Qiskit's isometry synthesis algorithm can be used to synthesize state preparation circuits.
However for some product states it it not able to find a 0-CNOT circuit.
Example:
Yields:

However this state is synthesizable using only single-qubit gates:
Note: the actual synthesis algorithm produces an 11-CNOT circuit but optimization_level=3 was able to bring this cost down to 3 CNOTs.
How does this algorithm fundamentally work? Can you point me to some resources @ajavadia ? Also, has there been any progress in this project so far?
Updated 2nd part of the original example eliminating deprecated u3:
Furthermore, the first example transpiled generates U3 gates (deprecated)
Hi @ajavadia.
The open-source library qclib (https://github.com/qclib/qclib) has a state preparation (called Low-Rank State Preparation or LRSP) that can adjust the complexity (depth and number of CNOTs) of the circuit to the degree of state entanglement, so it does not use CNOTs for the initialization of a product state (no entanglement).

The paper "Approximated quantum-state preparation with entanglement dependent complexity" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03132) describes the algorithm. It produces more efficient circuits (shallower and with fewer CNOTs) than isometry decomposition, as demonstrated by the following example.
Please let me know if you need additional information.
Kind regards.
