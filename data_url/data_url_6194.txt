Hello hive mind!
I need to build a noise model but I'm fairly new to python and qiskit and so far I haven't been able to do it. I was given the following code which was used in a previous version of qiskit but doesn't seem to work any more.
Please help!
Please follow https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/aer/building_noise_models.ipynb
Closing this issue since it is covered in the tutorials @yaelbh  linked to.
