With the introduction of a delay instruction (#2846) we should add a method pad (or another name) which will take a pulse schedule and return a new schedule with delays inserted in all available timeslots. This will allow one to fix the behaviour of a given schedule by preventing additional pulses to be inserted and allow easier scheduling.
