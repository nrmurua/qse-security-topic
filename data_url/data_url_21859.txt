Using build 20180530 with SAWG 38b5128. Now seeing failure different from #1026. Random characters printed on URART, kernel freeze but no kernel panic. @whitequark continuing conversation started on IRQ with @trxw. https://irclog.whitequark.org/m-labs/2018-06-01#22239059
runtime.elf.zip
No response to ping.
This time panic and garbage characters. Panic message looks different.
Same identical runtime.elf.
Disassembly:
These are definitely legal. The fact that they're load/store instructions is probably just because the CPU spends most execution time spinning one of those these.
What vivado version are you using?
I'm using 2017.4. What version of Vivado are you using?? #910
****** Vivado v2018.1 (64-bit)
Says the build bot.
FWIW, with 2018.1 I've run two different Sayma boards (after the various fixes for bugs like SDRAM, HMC7043 noise, 1V8, etc.) continuously for days without any bug of this sort.
I'm using Vivado 2018.1 (current master doesn't meet timing on the 2017 version I was using), and see occasional illegal instructions on boot.

Have you double checked that your build meets timing? It didn't for me on 2017.4...
Yes.
@sbourdeauducq my question was addressed to @jbqubit (see the text I quoted) as he is still using 2017.4, where Sayma didn't meet timing for me...

Typical use case for Sayma is running a variety of ARTIQ Python scripts interactively and scheduled that exercise a variety of PHYs. What does are you Sayma doing continuously during these tests?
Always running the same kernel that uses SAWG, but there was Ethernet traffic processed by the comms CPU due to TCP keepalive and network broadcasts.
Did you find some way to reproduce those crashes?
I'll use 2018.1 going forward. --without-sawg builds with problem. Now building with SAWG.
I can't reproduce the crashes in this Issue as they are triggered by communication with the Core device via Ethernet. Ethernet is not working on my Sayma.
--without-sawg builds with problem.
What problem? Can you open a new issue?
Ethernet is not working on my Sayma.
It was working before. What broke it?
--without-sawg builds with problem.
Sorry... Typo. --without-sawg build /without/ problem. --sheepish--
Using latest from master 20180604 with SAWG vivado 2018.1 07d4145. Meets timing.  I've run 25 scripts involving SAWG via Ethernet. I don't see any errors on UART.
I think we can close this now.
