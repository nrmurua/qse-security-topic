Currently the C++ quadratic models are all indexed [0, num_variables) always. That makes working with multiple QMs tricky. For instance, say that you had two bqms, x0 + x1 and x1 + x2, that you want to add together. You need to somehow signal to the C++ code that some variables overlap and some do not. We handle this currently in one place 
this would open up nice syntax like
