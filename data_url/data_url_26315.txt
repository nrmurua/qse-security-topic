Thoughts about this change?
This was helpful for developing my local build script â€¦ otherwise, the toolchain script liked to just continue over errors, wasting time before starting from scratch again. Was it a conscious decision not to abort early? This could be debated for things that don't depend on each other.
The toolchain is indeed permissive. It is up to the user to check the toolchain output for error messages. The current toolchain script dumps the last --log-lines (default is 200) of the log file in case of an error while running configure, make, or cmake. I wondering how `set -e' would further help in this context. Do you have an example?
I guess I was just annoyed that I called the toolchain install script in my script and my script did just continue trying to build the main application.
So, it may not be about aborting early, but just propagating/returning non-zero error code?
