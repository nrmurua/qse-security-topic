From https://travis-ci.com/github/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/jobs/358424742#L3190 , in some cases, the transpiler is generating conditional gates without the clbits on which they are conditioned. This was noticed in (but not necessarily caused by) code added in #4622 ( https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/4622/files#diff-dd64919667465e6a3c40b2a4ed00f8e5R117 ) when building instructions from circuits with conditional gates.
Transpile the QASM from the below stack trace at optimization_level=3 targeting FakeJohannesburg.
The minimal code which seems to reproduce the bug is,
During transpilation the dag seems to become invalid, when running _check_condition over nodes, in consolidate_blocks. It seems consolidate_blocks relies on being able to create and simulate a circuit with a classical condition but no classical register.
A workaround would be for circuit_to_instruction to change,
if condition: -> if condition and instruction.num_clbits > 0:
although it seems strange for circuit_to_instruction to have to check both conditions.
@kdk @ewinston The following diff seems to take care of the problem and passes all the auto-tests. If this seems like a reasonable approach, let me know and I'll do a PR.
Thanks @enavarro51 . I agree that looks like a reasonable fix. Can you add a test and open a PR?
Will do. Is a reno required?

Since this fixes a bug from a previous release, a reno would be great.
