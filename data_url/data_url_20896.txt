How about introducing code style checks, something a la gofmt from Golang (I remember someone has mentioned it during workshop)? This could be done by one of the tools below. Format checks could be run by CI for each PR.
Yes, this is a good idea.  We already have a .clang-format style file.  As far as I can tell, there's no way for clang-format to say "these files don't match the style" -- instead you would run clang-format and see if the files change.
Already implemented:
https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/blob/master/Makefile#L95
suggestion here would be run clang-format in docker. that's because locally someone may have different version of clang which won't result in same formatting. Here how it was done in some other project:
https://github.com/riboseinc/rnp/blob/d4f56197b8ab877aaee1706c8ad820ce3d66f3dc/git-hooks/pre-commit.sh#L58
Yeah, we just ran into that issue between @cryptojedi and my versions of Clang-format. Commit fe46514 adds my full -dump-config output to hopefully stabilize it a bit.
I wouldn't like doing it via Docker though, because setting up docker and having to run code as root (if you're in the docker group, you're root) is very annoying.
We ran into the same problem with OQS as well.  We just fixed a version of clang-format and its behaviour seemed to be consistent within a version but across platforms.
