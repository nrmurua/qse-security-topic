In the current workflow, Python to be linted are selected with a double star glob:

But in Bash, the double star is equivalent to a single star, unless shopt -s globstar is used (and it is not, by default).

However, the simple solution is to just truncate the path: selecting only src/ Pylint will already look recursively for the files.
I believe that Pylint is already mostly looking at Python files, but in case it would catch also something else, we will find away to whitelist those files later on (for the time being, nothing seems to affected in this sense).
The result of replacing the glob is that new errors have been found, and now they have to be fixed (possibly the authors of the code affected should either fix it, or explicitly tell to ignore the lint).
Here the current errors:

Thanks @alecandido, could you and/or @Edoardo-Pedicillo apply this changes in #770?
