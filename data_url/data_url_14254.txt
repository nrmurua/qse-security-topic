We are using matplotlib plot directive to generate figure since #9346. The plot directive generate links for users to download generated figures and source code.
Currently the links are not generated and left with (,,,) whenever the plot directive is used.

Go to https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit.html and navigate to the first image
Add generated links (png, html, source) or just hide it completely if we don't need to show the generated files.
This issue was not completely addressed by Qiskit/qiskit-metapackage#1711.
The commas in (,,) disappeared but there are still places with brackets remained ().



Since #10611, this should now be done on Terra.
