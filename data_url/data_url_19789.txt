Tests are failing for Travis with errors about missing Aer module.
This may be related to PR #158, where Terra in tox.ini is changed to be the master branch, but Aer is not changed accordingly.
I discussed this with Matt on Friday, I think we were waiting on some fix (?)
Yeah, I pushed up a fix (which was actually started prior to #158) to fix the backwards compat issue introduced in terra that breaks running it against aer .11: Qiskit/qiskit#2154 But that's blocked because of an Aer bug (which is causing consistent failures on linux python 3.7) and it can't merge until we resolve that.
Ignis has tests on all it's supported environments (except for windows 3.5 and 3.7 because those environments don't have released aer wheels that work) while aer only tests patches on linux with python 3.6. So we should avoid testing with aer from master until coverage is added for the same set of environments.
But since everything here seems to be getting blocked by bugs or broken releases in aer one way or another, I'll try pushing up a patch to install it from source too and see if that unblocks things (even if it's not ideal). At least until we come up with a fix to unblock Qiskit/qiskit#2154 so that we can run with a released version again.
