Bloch raises an error when used in jupyter notebook. This seems to be due to the output of print_figure in _repr_svg_ not being bytecode (maybe it was in the past?) it then defaults to _repr_png_ and renders correctly the bloch sphere.
The Bloch sphere should be plotted correctly without any Error.
