On the main branch. There is a Demo Notebook for Copying a Component in the guide.
I run these parts of the notebook:
When the Metal GUI comes up, I click New QComponent
And then I give it a name, click okay a bunch, and then, instead of a new window and IDE popping up, nothing pops up and the Metal Logs show:
Internal IDE (running off pyqode) should come up along with a new generic component.
Occurred during the PyQt5 to PySide2 transfer - may be related to these things. If you get it to create a new component, remember to text the reload button
