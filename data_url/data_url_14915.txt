TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'ParameterExpression' and 'float'
Run the DD transpiler pass successfully
Don't wrap global phase if parameterized, see same issue in Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-provider#689
Thanks for reporting this. I'm labelling this as good first issue as it can be solved analogously to the referenced PR, Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-provider#689.
@Cryoris Please assign this issue to me.
