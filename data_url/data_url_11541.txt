I'd like to raise the awareness for two known bugs in the performance of VQE:
Whenever I work with VQE, in my private Aqua clone I remove the redundant gates from the circuit. Then I apply some hack, described in Qiskit/qiskit#5236, to fix the transpilation. Users of course don't do all this, hence suffer from significant degradation in run time.
discussion moved to #1015 . Shall we close this issue? @yaelbh please close if this is not needed.
@pbark what about Qiskit/qiskit#5236 - transpilation is not working well when running UCCSD with custom connectivity. This affects users that run on simulators as well as on real devices.
Do we need to keep this 'meta' issue. There are the individual issues that are opened, this is really just adding some higher level context linking them. The issues themselves could be cross-linked with the context.
Agree, closing
