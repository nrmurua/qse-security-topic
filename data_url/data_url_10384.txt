Since client polling schedule is determined by earliest_completion_time returned by SAPI as an absolute ISO8601 time in UTC, correct timing depends on the correctness of user's system clock.
Should we try to detect too big of a discrepancy from the time returned by server (in HTTP headers) and local clock?
Resolution: when too big discrepancy detected, ignore earliest_completion_time and fallback to exponential back-off, starting at 1 second delay.
Closed in #249.
