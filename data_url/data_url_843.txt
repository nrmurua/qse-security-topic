Describe the bug
When calling the adjoint() of a AngledGate, its angle changes sign as expected but its ascii_symbols does not change. This has no impact in circuit execution. The impact is only that it shows a wrong angle when doing print(circuit).
To reproduce
from braket.circuits import Circuit
circ1 = Circuit().rx(0, -0.1)
circ = circ1 + circ1.adjoint()
print(circ)
