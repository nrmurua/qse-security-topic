How to guide https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/orchestration/visualize_lattice.html references draw functionality which is currently not working.
Waiting to hear back from @Prasy12 if a hotfix can be given for this.
@AlejandroEsquivel The hotfix for the lattice.draw() will be issued in a few hours time.
