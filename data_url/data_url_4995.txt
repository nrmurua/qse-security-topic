I had some problems getting QuEST to compile happily on Windows and came across #157
As far as I can tell I have the latest master checked out, but I was still experiencing the problem that was marked as fixed by that issue.  Weirdly the link on that issue gives me a 404.
Either way, to maximise compatibility it would be great to get rid of UNIX specific headers such as unistd.h and sys/time.h.  It looks as though they are both being used for seeding the MT random engine.
I might well be missing something, but:

Well actually since MinGW is incompatible with NVCC, we still need to ensure support for MSVC for Windows GPU users. Reopened...

Currently, I can't get QuEST to compile on Windows without the -DMULTITHREADED=0 flag. Without it I get a bunch of repeated errors:
I know these can be fixed if I compile with -fopenmp for some scratch code that I compile inline with g++. But since the QuEST compilation process is a bit more involved, I don't know how to "simply add fopenmp" to fix these errors.
I know this is a bit different from the OP, but I didn't know if I should open a separate issue.
Hi David,
I don't quite understand the error, but it will assumably go away when I add actual support for Windows compilers (like MSVC) rather than resorting to MinGW. Since I'm in 2 week quarantine right now, there's a good chance I can do this soon :)
Native windows supported added in v3.4.0
