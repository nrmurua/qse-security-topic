It would be nice if Qibo were able to check if a backend is available, and have a function to survey all the registered backends, and list those available.
Possibly, it could be implemented even trying to load it, and catching the failure. But if each backend had a property available it would be even better.
(since the backend might know about the required conditions for availability, and we'd avoid catching a generic error)
