The stochastic noise aware simulator currently does not support reset operations. Code for that is already available here
https://github.com/cda-tum/ddsim/blob/f4459934be255d08b30df9a60bde041f0d1bdb8a/include/StochasticNoiseSimulator.hpp
https://github.com/cda-tum/ddsim/blob/f4459934be255d08b30df9a60bde041f0d1bdb8a/src/StochasticNoiseSimulator.cpp
The code must be implemented again and tested.
