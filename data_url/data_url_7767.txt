With current code and dependencies (CentOS 8.1, python 3.6.8), the basic tests work, but something seemingly unrelated to parallelization is wrong with the tutorial example quimb/docs/examples/ex_mpi_expm_evo.py. See output below.  Apparently it's happening because the Evolution method is being applied with a "callable" Hamiltonian argument, but I'm unclear on how that is supposed to be determined.
This is probably to do with a bad interaction with the Lazy class for constructing rows of hamiltonians locally only and the new time-dependent evolution stuff, I'll have a look.
That was indeed the main, issue though running the example I found another bug as well to do with initializing the SLEPc interface, should be fixed by e18791d. Let me know if its working for you now!
Closing as I was able to replicate and fix. Feel free to re-open @kkissell if its still not working.
Hi there, i use the same code as in the quimb/docs/examples/ex_mpi_expm_evo.py, it also ends with error
The code is as following
I am using Python 3.8.8 and quimb 1.3.0. Did i do something wrong?
