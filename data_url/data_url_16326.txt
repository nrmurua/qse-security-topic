Coming from https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/13937/why-is-circuit-inverse-not-working-for-efficientsu2 I think users expect that BlueprintCircuit are automatically built when internal _data is required. This happens in same situation (like with print) but not always (like with inverse):
This works:
This raises TypeError:
It seems like a reasonable expectation to me that _build should happen always that  _data is required but not there yet.
Going through QuantumCircuit methods i only see compose and inverse using _data without BlueprintCircuit asserting a previous call on _build.
This used to work, therefore tagging as bug
