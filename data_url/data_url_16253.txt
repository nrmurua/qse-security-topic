With travis's recent billing changes that went into effect this month: https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing we're rapidly approach the qiskit project quota for the free trial accounts. This is problematic as both retworkx (for non-x86 jobs) and ibmq provider (for networking reasons) both rely on travis for their CI. We don't want to hit that quota and block development/testing on those projects. So we should try to remove our travis usage for things that dwe can run elsewhere to prioritize access to projects that really need it.
For the coverage job github actions is a good alternative since there is a native coveralls action we can integrate into the job, retworkx has an example of this:
https://github.com/Qiskit/retworkx/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml#L100-L104
The randomized bencharmking job is a bit more problematic because we want it to be non-fatal (and not show up as a red x in the checks api when it fails or block other jobs). Last time I looked into this neither azure or github actions offers a feature like this.
Hi @mtreinish, just to clarify, the steps for the coverage aspect would be as follows(?):
You don't need step 1 and step 2 as separate things, they're basically the same thing. But yeah those are the basic steps, create a new github actions workflow file that contains a single job to run tests with coverage collection. We should run this on PR and on post-merge. The PR pre-merge runs let us look at coverage changes from the PR (to make it easier to check if there is inadequate coverage for example), and post-merge lets us track the coverage over time of the code.
I am new to quantum computing but can work efficiently with python. I would love to work on this issue If you think I can.
Thanks @a-freakish I'll assign to you ðŸ˜„
