Exercises not working due to Statevector class not accepting slices.
Go to https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/bernstein-vazirani.html, and try exercises.
It doesn't work no matter which button I click.
Exercises works.
There is an error in the following part of bv_widget.
vec is Statevector class. The Statevector class does not accept slice and raises QiskitError("Key must be int or a valid binary string.").
I think the following change would solve the problem.
We'd have to adjust the docs too but I think supporting slices is a nice feature! However @chriseclectic or @ikkoham might have an opinion as they know quantum info well ðŸ™‚
Thank you for your opening issue.
I wonder why this was broken in the first place. Maybe it was the introduction of __getitem__ that made it impossible to use __array__. I think __getitem__ is a very complicated interface and probably unnecessary, but I need to look into it a bit more.
(Workaround) If you want a slice of numpy.ndarray, you can use Statevector.data on the user side to explicitly take out the ndarray and use it.
