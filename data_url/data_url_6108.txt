When assembling the qobj to be submitted to the pulse simulator, have the option to automatically set qubit_lo_freq based on the energy levels in the Hamiltonian. The purpose is to streamline this aspect of simulation specification.
Currently, these need to be set by hand. For example, in pulse_sim.ipynb, the qubit_lo_freq terms are set by:
The easiest way to incorporate this quickly is to pass something like qubit_lo_freq = 'from_hamiltonian' to assemble. When the the simulator calls digest_pulse_obj, if qubit_lo_freq == 'from_hamiltonian', it can automatically set the qubit_lo_freq based on the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian (which it already computes anyway).
Update: Trying to pass a string for qubit_lo_freq to assemble results in a validation error. I think now the easiest way to get this through is to pass it within the sim_config argument, as this way it can make it into digest_pulse_obj without any changes to terra.
I'm working on this now, but comments are welcome.
