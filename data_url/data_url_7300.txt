You can currently call e.g. timeevolution.schroedinger with a time-dependent operator. If you do, the latter will be treated as static! We should either warn if non-constant operators are used in this context, or make this do dynamic evolution like schroedinger_dynamic. Same goes for the other evolution functions!
Fixed in #371
