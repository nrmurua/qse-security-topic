When the naming system for the "trivalent octagonal lattice" was being discussed, various people suggested naming schemes for the qubits based off of nice lattice coordinates, and these suggestions were ultimately discarded because Quil (and the low-level hardware protocols) require that qubits by indexed by a (single) nonnegative integer. Some people still would like this kind of naming system to be made available, and it seems that the most natural thing to do is to provide some kind of aliasing scheme so that the current use case is still fulfilled and a nice human interface is also exposed. This may mean an extension to the Quil spec.
Incidentally, qubit naming is something that OpenQASM has that Quil doesn't.
