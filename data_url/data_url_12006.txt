Problem - Each images is printed twice after executing draw('mpl') , in the tutorial for Transpiler Passes and Pass Manager.
Possible Solution - Look at the discussion in the issue number 1265 of Qiskit, the Author also faced a similar issue and there seems to be a possible solution there.

May I work on this issue or you want to take it  @singhmeet11 ?
If possible we can extend this fix in other tutorials too. @nonhermitian
@divshacker I don't think the moderators will have a problem with us fixing the two images problem. Let me create a new issue for solving this issue in the few tutorials that have the same problem. Then we can correct this
