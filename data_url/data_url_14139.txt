Once all the DAGCircuit methods are updated to support manual variable storage and loads, transpile should automatically work, since everything largely just calls DAGCircuit methods and the logic should thread its way through.
However, we still need to add integration testing across transpile calls and post-compilation serialisation (+ deserialisation in the case of QPY) roundtripping.
