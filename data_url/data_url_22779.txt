NB: All those bugs would have been prevented by using YAFFS.
You can get rid of the alignment requirements by doing:
int o;
memcpy(&o, source, 4);
Also you should put the size first in the record, as a size of 0xffffffff is unlikely whereas a string starting with 0xffffffff is more valid. Making the size the size of the full record (including the key) also makes iterations easier (and would also have eased those alignment requirements you had). Don't forget to update artiq_mkfs.
How does one delete a record? Write it with zero length data?
I addressed the issues in this commit that you can cherry-pick on master (it should apply): fallen@2ac8c8c
Thanks for the review and sorry for the delay in fixing those points.
