The decorators deprecate_arg and deprecate_function have a parameter package_name that defaults to qiskit-terra.
Considering that the qiskit metapackage is on track to have a single dependency on qiskit-terra and their versions are going to be the same in the future (see RFC0011), the notion of Terra is getting hidden under the Qiskit brand. As such, it makes sense that the documentation refers less to Terra and invites users to update qiskit.

can i also contribute to this issue ?
Sure! Although, @1ucian0 we can't do this until qiskit releases using the same version number as qiskit-terra, right?
This is going to be tricky, even when the most recent version numbers are aligned.  All existing releases were deprecated using the version of qiskit-terra, and old releases won't (can't) change number.  The old deprecations probably still need to refer to the release of Terra they were deprecated in - I think it'll be very confusing if we change all of those to point to "metapackage" versions instead, since it's quite possible that a lot of people never installed the metapackage.

right. This issue is about planning that transition because I see, like @jakelishman, this might be complicated.
Here some options:
I think this is closed by #10877
