Application
Currently, (de-)serialization of BQMs is partial and with loss of information - vartype is not stored/loaded.
It would be nice to have a complete (de-)serialization of BQM to COO format, like we already have for JSON and BSON. E.g.:
Proposed Solution
Support vartype via p or c in COO.
I see the proposed p and c metadata lines (for program and comment) are qbsolv-specific, and not a part of COO.
As an alternative, I propose we adopt and adapt magic comments from PEP-263.
Or at least something like:
Or maybe model=qubo, or format=...?
I would prefer to stop short of requiring the header
we could then make the vartype a keyword parameters and throw a fit if it's not provided and there is no header?
Sure, we don't need to require header. Comments would be optional.
Ok, adapting the regular expression from PEP-263, we'll support ^[ \t\f]*#.*?vartype[:=][ \t]*([-_.a-zA-Z0-9]+) in the first line. Therefore the following are all valid:
The accepted vartypes are SPIN and BINARY.
Cool, that makes these valid too:
:)
