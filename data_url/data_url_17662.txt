I would like to rename the DirectionMapper to GateDirection or SwapDirection or DirectionSelection or just CXDirection. I think it is important to separate it from mapper pass. This allows us to define the mapper problem as working for any two qubit gate and it just connects with swaps.
This way it is clear that this is not an alternative  mapper pass
