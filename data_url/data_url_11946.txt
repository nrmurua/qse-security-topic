Part of #1401
Shor was deprecated in 0.22 and is planned to be removed for the upcoming 0.24 release Qiskit/qiskit#9831
Hey, is it still wished to improve the tutorial of Shors Algorithm or is it removed forever?
I've created the circuit of this paper in Qiskit: https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205095
and would offer to write a tutorial of Shors algorithm, first with hardcoded U gates and then with the general Implementation in the paper I linked.
Maybe even with some more proofs, since math is what I major in.
Shors algorithm was removed in 0.24 - what exists for Shor now is in the Qiskit learning materials as per the link in the release notes, the relevant part I copied below.

The deprecated modules factorizers and linear_solvers, containing HHL and Shor have been removed from qiskit.algorithms. These functionalities were originally deprecated as part of the 0.22.0 release (released on October 13, 2022). You can access the code through the Qiskit Textbook instead: Linear Solvers (HHL) , Factorizers (Shor)
As this issue is no longer relevant at all I am closing it.
