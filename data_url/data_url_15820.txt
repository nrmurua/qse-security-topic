Implement an evolution gate that can get synthesized into Pauli-evolution gates (or for a simulator backend just with direct matrix exponentiation) such that the compiler can perform optimizations on blocks of evolved Pauli operators before further decomposing into basis gates.
Here's a preliminary design doc: https://gist.github.com/Cryoris/abc9753fd7dfb0cc3b3a83aa58a182e3
