( language/types.html#length ) shows:
length one_second = 1000ms;
length thousand_cycles = 1000dt;
There's no compiler technology reason this cannot be expressed more naturally as
length one_second = 1000 ms;
length thousand_cycles = 1000 dt;
That is valid. The space doesn't make a difference to the compiler.
Thanks @zachschoenfeld33 , I'll check the spec and possibly submit a PR if the text doesn't explain that.
length and stretch are discussed in both types.rst and delays.rst ...
I've been trying to RTFM and figure out the Sphinx syntax for cross-doc links.
I want to link to /language/delays#Circuit%20timing from /language/types in a output-format-independent fashion  and have so far been unsuccessful, any tips?
Explicitly adding a reference label above the section worked. Submitting PR.
