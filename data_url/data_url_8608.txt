For some reason the wheels for scipy has disappeared from the astropy server, so our travis setup fails because installing and building scipy from source takes too long time. Perhaps this will resolve itself at some point, or maybe we have to find an alternative source for a scipy wheel for linux to use on travis.
This is fixed in #300.
