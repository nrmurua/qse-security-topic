I am on intel and python 3.9 is supported.  The only issue I have is that the installation tutorial use python.  That will enable command line to use python ./examples/...py to run but not under jupyter notebook.
However I install again using python3 ... All works.
(BTW, I tried to allow C++ engine and hence do setup the environment variables.)
Just to understand what the issue is: installation on the command line is working just fine, but within the Jupyter notebook it doesn't?
In that case, you need to properly setup your Jupyter notebook kernel to use the correct Python version.
