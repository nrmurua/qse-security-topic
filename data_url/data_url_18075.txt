#641 introduces a regression since the ERROR state does not exist.
IBMQJob misses requesting the complete status when the status is ERROR_VALIDATING_JOB, ERROR_CREATING_JOB and ERROR_RUNNING_JOB.
IBMQJob should ask for status details when hitting one of the final states.
Change the implementation to consider the aforementioned final states and add the proper regression tests.
Fixed via #646
