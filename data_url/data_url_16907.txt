The private _dt introduced in #3309 is not a good solution because one is not able to set config.dt anymore. This is needed for the pulse simulator. We should do a getter/setter.
Related to the warnings discussed in #3372, I think it would be appropriate for the setter to raise a warning if the value obviously looks like it is in nanoseconds, rather than the new standardized seconds.
