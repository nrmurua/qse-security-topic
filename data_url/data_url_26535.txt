The actual name should be libxsmm_gemm_generator, not libxsmm_generator as in the script.
We should remove references of the stand-alone generator in the install script. It is legacy and it is unsupported going forward. Practically nobody uses it as all kernels are JIT-generated.
While we're at it we could also remove install_libsmm.sh.

On x86-64, libsmm finally carried almost 90% kernels taken from libxsmm (if I remember correctly). Btw, our mighty LIBXSMM 2.0 will come up with ARM64 kernels incl. SVE.
