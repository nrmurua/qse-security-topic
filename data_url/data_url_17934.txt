Snapshot command and conditionals are out of date in the cpp simulator
@chriseclectic
The test qobj in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/tree/master/test/python/qobj have been updated to pass for now, but the snapshot has been hacked to work.
This is for Aer to handle. @chriseclectic can you please make sure that it gets done there?
Once Aer is updated, its integration tests in Terra should match.
