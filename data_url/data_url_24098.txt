The pre-commit hook looks at BOTH .py and .ipynb files.
I tried to delete a .ipynb file that was no longer needed, and the yapf formatting raised an error when I tried to commit this change.
The pre-commit hook should only look at .py files, not .ipynb files.
Modify the pre-commit hook so that it only looks at .py files, not .ipynb files.
Merged, should be closed.
