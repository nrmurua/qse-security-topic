It appears that the fidelity function is off by a power of 2. It returns the square root of the conventionally accepted definition of fidelity. For example, we expect that the fidelity between the states |0> and |+> is 0.5, but executing the code below returns the square root of this.
The expected output for both is 0.5.

The fidelity function use the Nielsen & Chuang definition.
In a future release, process_fidelity, will be the fidelity version you expect.
Thank you for the clarification. A suggestion would be to also relabel fidelity to make this clear.
