covalent restart does not store the state of the active execution mode/compute backend. In essence, running covalent restart after covalent start or covalent start --no-cluster always defaults the compute backend to Dask
Running covalent restart after covalent start (starting with Dask backend) or covalent start --no-cluster(starting with Local backend) always defaults the compute backend to Dask. This behavior can be observed by checking that the executor attribute in the UI is set to dask regardless of which compute backend was selected.
covalent restart should store the selected option for the compute backend in memory and restart Covalent as appropriate.
