When performing Pauli x rotations, the values are not normalized after a rotation larger than pi.
Code example:
Example output:
[-0.70710677+0.j          0.-0.70710677j]
Assumption: even though the state is correct, I would say the expected behavior would be to output a normalized state (no minus in the |0>)
I would propose one of the following
Of course, I might also miss something more fundamental, which I would be open to hear more about
I don't think this is the range that is causing the problem as you will also not get a fully normalized state if you do smaller angles.
At some point we did normalize between steps (we did this in old xmon sim), but we no longer appear to do this.
Suggest we add this back, though this will slow down simulation.
@viathor to clarify intent behind this bug, tentative decision from circ cync is not to fix this.
The state is normalized since (1/sqrt2)^2 + (1/sqrt2)^2 = 1.
The signs of the amplitudes
are all consistent with the prevailing convention that defines Rx(a) as
(c.f. eq (4.4) on page 174 in Nielsen & Chuang).
