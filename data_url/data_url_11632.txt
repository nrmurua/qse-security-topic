actually, I could install all qiskit library on supercomputer except qiskit Aqua. I also used pip upgrade command to install the latest version of qiskit.
Thank you for posting an issue. Could you report your environment using our issue template?
Can you provide more information? It sounds as though you had it installed before, so I assume the install went smoothly and without errors? Or did you have errors reported by the install process?
If it installed ok, but you cannot access qiskit.aqua might I suggest uninstalling all of qiskit and installing it again. qiskit-terra provides the base qiskit namespace which the other packages extend. Sometimes there are issues with this and although a package is installed it may not end up being able to be imported if the extension capability fails.

more information.
if you look at last line, No module named 'qiskit.aqua'. It hasn't been installed. I used virtual environment to install it.
Actually, I have another python script for quantum circuit simulation. it runs on supercomputer without error. it means qiskit has been installed. but the problem is about access to qiskit aqua library.
Qiskit 0.7.0 is a very old release from Dec 2018. At that time Aqua was not part of the qiskit meta package and would required a separate installation. The current Qiskit release is 0.19.6, and now would include Aqua. Is there some reason you are trying to work with such an old version?
but you know what I used the pip upgrade to install the latest version.#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=def-rkrems
#SBATCH --time=00:20:00
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1G
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4     # number of cores

virtualenv --no-download $SLURM_TMPDIR/env

pip install numpy --no-index
pip install scipy --no-index
pip install qiskit
pip install matplotlib
#pip install joblib --no-index
python $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR/DawnData.py
what do you suggest me to do?
pip install qiskit -U should upgrade it. pip install --upgrade pip is just upgrading the latest pip package you have installed.
thanks I will try with this.
it didn't work.

actually, the old version is installed again. even with pip install qiskit -U.
is there any command to install new version?
Normally pip install qiskit -U should download a new version - you should see it fetching a bunch of packages over the
internet. The other thing you could try is pip install qiskit==0.19.6 to explicitly tell it the version where 0.19.6 is the newest one.
You also have this in your script virtualenv --no-download $SLURM_TMPDIR/env where no-download is this
--no-download
Do not download preinstalled packages from PyPI.
I imagine that is preventing the upgrade.
BTW you can see the latest qiskit here https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/
Thanks. it works.
Great, you're welcome. I'll close this issue then, as it's resolved, since you now have things working.
