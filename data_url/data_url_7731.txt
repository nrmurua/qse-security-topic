I was working with the Sycamore Quantum Circuit example on Cotengra link and ran into this error while drawing the tensor network graph
Code
tn.graph(iterations=20, color=circ.psi.site_tags, legend=False, figsize=(3, 3))
Error
I assume it is because the forceatlas2_networkx_layout(G, pos, iterations) doesn't take weight_attr as input?
A quick look through forceatlas2 shows that forceatlas2_igraph_layout(G, pos, iterations, weight_attr) uses the 'weight_attr' argument

Yes, quimb-1.4.0
Yes, its a bit odd as it looks like forceatlas2_networkx_layout should also support the weight_attr arg:
https://github.com/bhargavchippada/forceatlas2/blob/da3ece0b559efcc1cee51bd0f1d56db4732ce50c/fa2/forceatlas2.py#L235-L237
But I have also run into this bug, and since the weights likely don't add much, probably easiest just to remove it.
Should be fixed by 08ab480.
