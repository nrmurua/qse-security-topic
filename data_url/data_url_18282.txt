The QASM instruction "measure q[k1] -> q[k2];" with k1 and k2 different integers is not done properly on the real device (when called via run_job).
It behaves as if it were "measure q[k1] -> q[k1];" whatever k2 is.
Thanks this is a problem and we are working on fixing it. In simulation it works fine but for the real hardware it works as you say.
This is a limitation of the current architecture backend and depends on the release of 0.5, when qobj is integrated. Therefore, I'm tagging this issue with "on hold".
