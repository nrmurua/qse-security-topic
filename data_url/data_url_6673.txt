My name is Volkan Erol and I am working as Assistant Professor in Computer Engineering department in Istanbul Okan University. Actually we are interested in your liquid software. My PhD thesis is on Entanglement Measures and Quantum Fisher Information. Personally I am studying nowadays Quantum Machine Learning.
When I was looking at your tutorial I have found that there is a sample for Quantum Linear Programming. If possible, could you please share with the .fsx source file of the following sample.
{picture from Liquid.pdf User's Manual on QLSA}
I would like check it and if possible I will suggest your software to my students.
Best regards,

I've created a version of the source for QLSA and added it to UserCode/DaveWecker. See the README.md
