The Coupling object talks about "qubits" instead of "wires".  In the context of layouts and wire maps, that's confusing. The Layout object denotates wires with numbers. I think the same should happen in Coupling.
@jaygambetta decided that the name "wire" was not good. We are going for "virtual qubit"
