based on #268 ;
My thoughts:
We should have an object that replaces Dict[str, Parameter].
It should have a method apply_mapping(Dict[str, Expression]). We need this for implicit parameter mappings which we need for abstract pulses/replacement pulses that have additional parameters and are wrapped in a MappingPT.
A method like change_namespace(str) or change_scope(str) that is called with the current pulses identifier and allows overwriting parameters for specified pulses.
I have no compelling idea how to get these two together.
