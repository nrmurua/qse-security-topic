When trying to import qiskit, getting:
AttributeError: module 'qiskit.pulse.commands' has no attribute 'Command'

Tried to run:
from qiskit import Aer
Getting same error.
Expecting python to just import qiskit.
This is a bug in python 3.5.2 typing (I think python/typing#259 but it's hard to be sure for something so old). I would recommend updating your python version to the latest the python 3.5 (3.5.9) or downgrade to python 3.5.1. I was not able to reproduce this locally with 3.5.9, and we run also run CI on python 3.5.9 on linux and macOS and 3.5.4 on windows without any issues.
As an aside it's also worth pointing out that python 3.5 support in qiskit is deprecated and will be removed when the upstream python community marks the version as EoL so it's probably not a bad idea to just move to 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8 soon.
Did python 3.5.9 helped @rajnandinimukherjee ?
Otherwise, feel free to reopen.
