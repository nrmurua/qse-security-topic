Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
There is a non-trivial issue relating to the basis and frame which are used to simulate dynamics:
The Hamiltonian can be in either the dressed or product basis:
The Hamiltonian can be represented inone of  (at least) 3 frames:
"The frame rotating with the qubit" can refer to either the qubit as defined in the product basis or the dressed basis
This whole subject is quite confusing.
Describe the solution you'd like
We need a good write-up to explain this to ourselves.
Describe alternatives you've considered
We find a pre-existing write-up which exactly addresses this issue
Additional context
After we have everything laid out in a clear fashion, we can decide how we want this understanding to be reflected in the code. For example:
But that will be a separate discussion
