I am trying to set a qubit to the |0> state and then use it later in my circuit. Whenever I call the cirq.reset or cirq.ResetChannel function, my model is unable to train. I receive the following error code:
This error only arises when I append a reset operation to my circuit:
Cirq version = 0.13.1
Is this something that I am doing wrong, or is this not a feature in cirq 0.13.1? I know tensorflow-quantum 0.7.2 requires cirq-core==0.13.1, but is there any way to reset a qubit in this version of cirq?
