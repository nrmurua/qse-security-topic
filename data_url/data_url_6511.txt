Workflow logs show that the Windows wheel is failing with this error:
@laurynasas any ideas on this? Strictly speaking we shouldn't need flynt in the Windows build (it's just for format-checking), so we can drop it if necessary.
Right, flynt and black packages are only available with cp36+ so given that we build cp36+ on all other platforms we can remove cp35 wheel from Windows builds as well. Will open PR for that.
Unfortunately the 0.10.1 release, having been cut before the above PR, is unable to pick up the fix. I'll cut 0.10.2 (after a couple other small changes in the pipeline) to get things moving again.
qsim v0.10.2 released successfully.
