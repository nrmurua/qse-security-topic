Describe the feature you'd like
Support noise model being an attribute of dm simulators. The noise model is applied to circuit when device.run is called. Users do not need to manually do noise_model.apply(circuit).
How would this feature be used? Please describe.
This feature is crucial for testing before submitting to QPUs. When I use a third party software, sometime the circuit creation step is not available to me. I don't have a chance to do noise_model.apply(circuit).  For example, in an error mitigation (EM) workflow, I input my single circuit and a local simulator. The workflow creates 100 circuits based on my circuit, runs on the local simulator, gets the results, does the post-processing and then returns the processed EM results to me. In this case, I cannot add noise to the circuits (without greatly modify this 3rd party software). Similar to noise being an intrinsic properties of QPUs, I want noise model be an intrinsic properties of simulators so that I can use the same workflow as QPU for testing.
