Converting a QASM2.0 circuit to native_quil does the not preserve the circuit. There are two obvious errors-
If useful, provide a numbered list of the steps that result in the error.
Otherwise, just fill out the "Code Snippet" and "Error Output" sections below.
I am running this code on the QCS server.
Operating System:
Python Version (python -V):
Quilc Version (quilc --version):
QVM Version (qvm --version):
Python Environment Details (pip freeze or conda list):
Just a note that since the conversion of QASM2.0 to Quil happens in quilc, that any fix is likely to be in quil-lang/quilc#823 . If there is anything specific you end up needing out of pyquil definitely let us know!
Hi @dbanty, the fix won't come from quilc. Looks like we need to modify the ISA in the QuantumComputer object generated by pyquil.  qc.to_compiler_isa() gives the backend ISA but there is no method for changing that.
