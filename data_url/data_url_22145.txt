Shouldn't the inferencer be able to cope with this?
Well, the compiler should never raise an exception instead of a diagnostic, so there's at least one clear bug here.
That said, Python arithmetics, which automatically expands widths, and is also polymorphic in terms of operands, is problematic to implement in an unification-based system, so the answer to your question is "not necessarily".
but isn't at least this specific case of i32 -> i64 well defined?
I think it's just a bug, yes.
