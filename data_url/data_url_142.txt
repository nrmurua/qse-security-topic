As mentioned in #302, It would be useful to create a general quake-verify pass for testing purposes. This pass would make sure that the IR has certain properties, e.g., operations having at most two controls (quake-verify{max-controls=2}), or that the kernel does not contain mid-kernel measurements (quake-verify{no-mid-measurements}).
This sounds like a good idea. I have to say I was a bit confused by the title since there already is a verification pass that can be run on the quake code (and is run after the bridge lowers the kernel code).
