Missing CX gate time in backend parameters
Provide data about CX gate application time in the backend instances.
It is impossible for user to recover automatically the time needed to apply a CX gate on a given backend. The information is still given in the backend log page but can't be accessed via the Python API.
outputs with pprint instead of print and with some croped parts:
Include a new field in the backend.parameters dictionnary.
Possible idea:
I want to be able to estimate as precisely as possible the time needed to execute a given quantum circuit.
There is a plan to fix this. The format will be similar to what you suggest.
Any news about this issue? Do you have an idea of when the times will be available via the QISKit API?
Pinging @jaygambetta, @dcmckayibm and @ajavadia. Are there plans to include this kind of information?
Yes but it goes in the properties that comes from the api. It will not happen until we combine calibrations and parameters and get a new command in api
Putting "on hold" until the feature in the API is ready.
Closing as this is really part of the API and when the API changes this information will update as such.
