We currently support QASM output and there is some work being done by @balopat for QASM imports. We should also support QUIL (https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03355)  because it's another popular ISA that's currently used. We can't support the whole instruction set because it's meant for hybrid architectures, but we can support whatever our QASM implementation supports.
@vtomole what would it take to get this done if I'm new to the code but I've worked with Qiskit previously and continue to do so?
@aditya-giri You can start with #2983
@vtomole Sure, lemme just familiarize myself with the code a little and then I'll get started. Would you be able to help me with that? Also can you look at #2862? Looks like some low hanging fruit for me to pick off.
@aditya-giri Sure. it's good to start with good first issues if you are beginning. I just assigned that to you.
Great, thanks!
We now have quil_import and quil_ouput.  Feel free to re-open if we missed something.
