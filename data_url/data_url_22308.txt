I tried installing artiq from the dev channel and ran into the following error,
Looking at the channels using conda info
I could install it previously using conda create -n artiq-dev-master -c http://conda.anaconda.org/m-labs/label/dev artiq but it installed only artiq from the dev channel but its dependencies from the main channel. I then couldn't launch the artiq_dashboard. I thought that's maybe from some conflict in the dependent packages so tried to install it all from the dev channel.
You need to add both dev and main channels.
Okay, thanks. That's what I had done previously but I couldn't get the artiq_dashboard to work.
