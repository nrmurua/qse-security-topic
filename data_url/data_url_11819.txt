mct's 'noancilla' mode would fail test_sat_oracle:
steps to reproduce:
add 'noancilla' in SAT's config dictionary here
add 'noancilla' in test_sat_oracle here
run test_sat_oracle
ideally all modes of mct should work anywhere mct is used, provided that the number of ancilla  isn't an issue
@hushaohan the 'noancilla' mode also fails in test_mct.py. For now, I just deleted it.
#338
@tigerjack thx for fixing test_mct.py!
we'll fix mct's 'noancilla' mode soon :)
thanks @tigerjack and @hushaohan for testing, mode ´noancilla´ should work properly now, see PR #357
fixed by #357
