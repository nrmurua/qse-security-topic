Description of the issue
Problem: The current requirements pin sphinx to version 3.2.* which is too old for recent releases of its alabaster theme package - see the CI error here
Solution: Update sphinx and any dependent packages to their recent versions.  Sphinx is currently at version 7.2.6, https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/#history.
Cirq version
1.4.0.dev at d33b1a7.
I can take this on
Sure, Thank you!
@smburdick - this seems a bit urgent, as the current state results in CI failures, for example, #6413.
Are you available to do a PR in a next few days?
No worries if you have other commitments.  I can take over on this one and there will be a plenty of other issues to help us with in the future.  :-)
