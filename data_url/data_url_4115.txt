Currently Perceval uses float64 as a default for storing parameters. For simulation with increasing number of modes/photons, this induces a natural 2x slowdown for numerical precision beyond any QPU native precision.
A nice feature would be to enable a mode in Perceval allowing to switch in simple precision - this could be done with global parameter containing type to use, but will also require exqalibur to accept both simple and double precision calls.
