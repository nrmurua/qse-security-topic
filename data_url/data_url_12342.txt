Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow-quantum (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow-quantum
why?
Unable to recreate, pip install tensorflow-quantum just worked for me on a brand new environment. Results in Successfully installed cachetools-4.2.4 cirq-core-0.13.1 cirq-google-0.13.1 duet-0.2.7 google-api-core-1.21.0 google-auth-1.18.0 googleapis-common-protos-1.52.0 networkx-2.8.8 protobuf-3.17.3 sympy-1.8 tensorflow-quantum-0.7.2
One cause for this error is using a Python version currently not supported by TensorFlow Quantum, like 3.10 or 3.11.
As specified on the website, TensorFlow Quantum is supported on Python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.
Running the "Hello, many worlds" tutorial in Google Colab gives the same error (once you remove the specific version that doesn't work either).
Although yesterday I was able to run the tutorial in Google Colab, today I cannot manage to install it.
Colab silently upgraded default python to 3.10.11 I think. It has broken a number of people's codes and I have heard a number of people encountering similar issues for a variety of packages.
