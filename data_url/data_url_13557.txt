There is a problem in the way we handle seeds in the mitiq.pec module.
The bug appears if an integer seed is used in sample_circuit or execute_with_pec since
both functions make repeated calls to sample_sequence  each time with the same seed.
@rmlarose , what about if we require the seed to always be of type np.RandomState instead of Union[np.RandomState, int] ?
Alternatively we should internally convert integer seeds to np.RandomState in all sampling functions and in execute_with_pec.
Both options are good for me.
