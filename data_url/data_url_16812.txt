Pulse Commands were initially created to allow the pulse to be only defined once as a SamplePulse and then have its usage tracked based on the pulse instance. Every Instruction instance was then defined as containing a Command and its Channel operands that the command is applied to.
This change may result in some breaking changes, but I have a couple of ideas to make this mostly backward compatible.
Requirements for closure of this issue include:
I believe this has resulted in a confusing API with many statements that look like
which yields an instruction. Or called more explicitly:
If we were to unify commands with instructions a generic instruction would accept a list of operands that could be either a numeric parameter like a complex or a channel to operate on, eg.:
For example, a frame change would go from,
or explicitly,
to
where ShiftPhase is of type Instruction.
The current behavior of pulses could be fixed by redefining Pulse as a Type and defining a Play instruction:
