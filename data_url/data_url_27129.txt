From our Hydra:
Can be reproduced locally with the Flake.
Is that an "impurity" in one of the git submodules (e.g. refering to master)?
EDIT: it passes here on my sides with the sources in store.
Yup, saw it passing in your Hydra. I'm not sure about the git submodules, as it is actually checking out commits (from git submodule status in the dalton repo). The fetchgit also succeeds in intialising them. It fails after it has initialised the submodules. I've also tried leaveDotGit in fetchgit but it does not help. ðŸ˜ž
.gitsubmodules does not specify a specific revision. That is probably the source of the issue.
