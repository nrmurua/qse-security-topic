Description
It looks to me that the submodule might link to the version at creation time, not current one; for example, dwave_networkx imports an older version and gets error:
To Reproduce
Open a new virtualenv, clone recursive dwave-ocean-sdk, build docs. dnx gives an error on chimera_elimination_order because the file docs/reference/generators.rst is not the current version 0.8.3
Expected behavior
Latest version of all files of submodules
Environment:
Additional context
See the problem in RTD build 267998 from 2019-12-11
This is an error in the specific version of dwave-networkx. If you try building the docs in dnx at https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave_networkx/tree/0.8.3 you'll get the same warning.
