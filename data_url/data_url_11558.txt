The __init__ function for MatrixOp in aqua/operators/primitive_ops/matrix_op.py contains the following lines
I believe that this error message needs an improvement since it is misleading and incorrect for the following two reasons
1. Currently the only thing called MatrixOperator in qiskit seems to be the legacy matrix operator class in Aqua (aqua/operators/legacy/matrix_operator.py). If one tries to initialize a MatrixOp with a legacy matrix operator
the following error will be raised
which is indeed misleading.
2. The MatrixOp class apparently allows initialization with different types of objects (e.g. a numpy array). If one tries initialization with something not supported (e.g. op.MatrixOp("abc")) the following error message will be raised
which will deceive the user into thinking that only one type of object is allowed for initialization, which is MatrixOperator, which leads us to the previous point.
