Documentation is up and working well for OpenFermion but we don't have the sphinx docs or readthedocs up for our three plugins.
@dabacon I added the docs folder to OpenFermion-ProjectQ. Can you help me link those to readthedocs? Note that I've decided that for little changes like this which don't touch actual code, it should be acceptable to override the code review. But NEVER for actual code.
Done
