More or less by definition, the default_pass_manager should work for the default transpilation process.  This means that things like basis_gates, initial_layout, skip_numeric_passes and seed_mapper can be set to default values, thus requiring only the coupling_map of the device to be a required input
This makes using this pass manager as a template for others, much easier (e.g. #2179)
it does a transpiler_config :-). I know you dont like it and want to have it overloaded with the coupling map.
I think you would want a script
but then I dont know why you would want this and can't use just the transpile script. I see with your other issues that if you had a replace function then I can see.
The PR #2672 removed the default pass manager. Is this issue still applicable?
Nope.
