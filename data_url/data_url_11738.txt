In the tutorial section 'Creating Your First Qiskit Chemistry Programming Experiment', the line:
from qiskit.chemistry.components.initial_states import HartreeFock
produces the error:
No module named qiskit.chemistry.components
I think the tutorial needs to be updated if the code has been deprecated. I apologise if this is an issue local to me.
The tutorials work, are tested and kept in sync with the current release in Pypi, not with the latest code in github.
The readme you are looking at has been updated to reflect the code as it exists in master. I imagine you have installed the stable release from PyPi. In which case look at this link which should give you what you need https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/tree/stable
That's perfect - thank you both.
