Description of the issue
Depending on the order of qubits and the qubits in the pairs you can get different outputs, which I don't think is the expected behavior. Basically if qubits = [q0, q1], but the pair in pattern  is reversed, i.e. pattern = [[(q1, q0)], []] then no two qubit gate will show up in the circuit. See below for example
How to reproduce the issue
outputs
, which is missing the CZ gates. However, if I sort the pair then
outputs
which is what I expected.
Cirq version
'1.3.0.dev20230802160330'
Nevermind, I realized this is intended behavior.
Apologize for the confusion. I now convinced myself this is a bug. I think the problem lies here

where we only construct pairs (a, b), but not (b_a)
