For the beta release we'll need a getting started that shows how to install the library and shows examples of how to use the library.
I propose that the examples show one how to:
Other suggestions for the getting started?
@nathanshammah Since you are already doing #34 this is a sub-issue of that. Can you assign this to yourself as well?
Sure. I am actually tinkering with jupyter notebooks that would do that. Nothing working smooth yet but it is helping with some ideas and questions I have.
I also think that it is nice to add two or three other simple examples :
They have an overlap with the examples on the backends, but they may target a different need.
From my limited understanding and my guess, it could be that "Factories" would be more general than for ZNE. Maybe I am wrong, or it was not settled, but Factory could be a staple that interfaces also with other techniques such as quasiprobability, etc. In any case at this point they look to me like QuTiP's Qobj and Pennylane's QNode. They are a quite flexible class whose objects are used to do things in mitiq. Having something about them is helpful.
Some researchers may get to know mitiq even without a proper knowledge of the quantum circuit stacks, but really as a curiosity into QEM. These two examples would tackle the most widely known approach and an innovation.
Good points.
Should we make separate issues and assignees to avoid duplicated work? Summarizing from above, it looks like the examples we want to have now are:
Examples
I think we can discuss an example template (e.g., Jupyter notebook? script?) and once we all agree, branch off to develop the above examples with the template.
Closing this in favor of separate issues #65, #66, #67, and #68 addressing the content of this issue.
Please reopen @willzeng or @nathanshammah if I missed anything.
