Does mesolve for Lindblad Equation support non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Currently, I am working on some code with three Hamiltonians added up for a total Hamiltonian. One of these, a Hamiltonian to account for trapping in the system, causes the trace not to be preserved -> non-Hermitian. Now, currently, the simulation acts like this trapping Hamiltonian vanishes so I am thinking maybe mesolve cannot support non-Hermitian Hamiltonians? If so, can support for this be added?
There is nothing in the code that should prevent one from doing that, provided that the problem is still in Lindblad form.  The mesolve routine does not normalize or check the trace for the return density matrices, so I naively think that it should work.
@nonhermitian Technically speaking, the Hamiltonian in the Lindblad Equation is Hermitian, so that is why I am asking. So it doesn't check if the Hamiltonian is Hermitian? Does it assume that it is Hermitian but doesn't check?
It does not check for hermicity. But as you suggest the equation itself is designed for a valid Hamiltonian

@nonhermitian so would it work for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian or not?
If no other change is required to the master equation besides the non-hermitian hamiltonian then yes.
