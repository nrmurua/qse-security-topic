In this function you implicitly assume that a user has pandas installed, but it's not currently a dependency in requirements.txt
Would be great to add.
Hi @JordanAWS , we deliberately do not have a direct dependency on pandas since it is a rather weighty library and we only include a few methods, like this one, for convenience. We use a similar pattern for NetworkX.
We do include it in our tests/requirements.txt for testing.
I do think we should raise a better error message and update the docstring to indicate this.
Good plan, thanks for the super quick response!
