Issue is that plt isn't defined if matplotlib isn't installed.
Ignis should run if matplotlib is not installed in the environment because it is an optional dependency.
a. On case of ImportError, set plt = unittest.mock.MagicMock()
b. Have plt.axes references be forward references by changing to "plt.axes" (enclosing in string quotes).
Ugh, type hints they just cause more trouble than they solve anything. I'll push up a fix removing them there and fix this. Although I'm surprised the minimal dep CI job didn't catch this since it should run all the unit tests without matplotlib.
We're probably going to push out a qiskit-terra 0.16.1 in the next week. I'll plan to include an ignis 0.5.1 at the same time to bundle this in the 0.23.1 metapackage release.
oh, it looks like we lost the minimal deps CI job in the migration to github actions. I'll add that back too
Thanks @mtreinish for the fix. I assumed it was something like that, but thanks for the quick fix :)
