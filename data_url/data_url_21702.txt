Since the core_log controller forwards all log messages from the core device to the master logging machinery, it sets its own logging level to "TRACE". This results in the above message being emitted in the log (artiq_client show log) while all other similar DEBUG messages from other controllers are suppressed (at the source). Those messages are typically not useful. I don't see how the user can suppress them.
Either change the log level mangling in core_log to not generate the message.
None.
