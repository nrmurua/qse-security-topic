Computation of expectation value value in MPS assumes qubits are ordered in ascending order. Otherwise the result may be incorrect. This requires two separate fixes - one for Pauli expectation value and one for matrix expectation value.
There are two suitable tests that are currently in test_qasm_simulator_statevector.py: QasmSnapshotExpValPauliTests and QasmSnapshotExpValPauliTests.
These should be added also to test_qasm_simulator_matrix_product_state.py
