Hello, our research group is trying to take advantage of the simulation power of Liquid. Is there a way to perform simulations on user QASM code (perhaps by translating QASM code to something that's compatible with Liquid), or does the circuit have to be compiled and simulated all within Liquid? By the way, is the UserSample() function in Liquid/linux/Main.fs built for this purpose? Thank you!
I think what you suggest would be the easiest. Just translate the QASM code (pretty much line for line) to LIQUi|> gate function calls. You could then set it up as a script to run fairly easily. The example in my UserCode directory goes the other way, translating a LIQUi|> circuit to QASM for use in other simulators. You could use Teleport.fsx in the samples folder as a templet for how to write a script.
Thank you very much for the reply!
