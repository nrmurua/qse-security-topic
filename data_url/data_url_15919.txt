AerPauliExpectation shows the following deprecate msg:
SaveExpectationValue / SaveExpectationValueVariance should be used instead.
@ikkoham Any chance you could take a look at this please.
Got it
@ikkoham Here is Aer PR for changing these pending warnings to actual deprecation warnings: Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1270
@chriseclectic Thanks you so much.
