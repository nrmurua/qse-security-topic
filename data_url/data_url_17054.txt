If the circuit contains a conditional classical control gate, the matplotlib output drawing of the circuit fails, via both circuit.draw(output='mpl') as well as circuit_drawer(circuit,output='mpl')
but
the draw works as text output , this worked in the previous version of qiskit 0.9 , updating I'm getting this error
removing the classical control gate the whole circuit draws perfectly.
creating any circuit with a classical controlled gate does this , for example the following code.
It should be able to draw the circuit with conditional classic control , this worked on previous qiskit version perfectly
Fixing the attribute error that's raised
AttributeError: 'Clbit' object has no attribute 'reg'
I attach the a pdf that causes the error on a bigger circuit or any circuit with both circuit_drawer and .draw(output='mpl') functions

The fix is already in progress with: #3032
Also, running it on the IBMQ-backends fail the jobs with classical controlled gates, tried on ibmq_ourense(ID: 5d638a4c606ca90019629d9e as well as ibmq_16_melbourne( ID : 5d638afd7fb37100186712b5)
however removing those classical control gates, ran it successfully on the ourense
yes the real devices do not support conditionals currently. these circuits have to be simulated for now.
fixed in #3032
