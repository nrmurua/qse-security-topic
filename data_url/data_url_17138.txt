RecursionError raises when trying to get instructions in a schedule with 1000 instructions.
This is caused by a rapid growth of the depth of schedule tree. It can be improved by modifying the implementation of union not to increase the tree depth.
We will address this by implementing a flat representation of a schedule in which each schedule only tracks a set of time-ordered instructions, removing the tree-based schedule description. When two schedules are combined their instructions will be copied into a new schedule. I realize this is what you initially proposed ðŸ˜„.
