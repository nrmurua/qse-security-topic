If an instrument has a property which raises an exception when gotten, the resulting error trace obscures the source of the error.
Take the following subclass of an instrument:
Accessing the foo property raises the following error, which has no traceback or reference whatsoever to what actually causes the error, which is the missing bar attribute:
This behavior makes these sorts of errors extremely cumbersome to debug if you're not aware of it. Instead, there should be a traceback to an AttributeError when getting self.bar in this example.
