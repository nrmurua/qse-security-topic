This method would take a stim.PauliString and postselect the result of measuring it, similar to postselect_z.
This could be implemented internally by calling measure_obs with the measurement bias temporarily set, or by decomposing into a circuit. However, it needs to be the case that if the postselection fails then the simulator states remains unchanged, so there needs to be some additional work to make sure measure_obs doesn't trash the state in that case or that the decomposed circuit doesn't stop halfway through when the "imposible result" exception is raised.
