Dear sir,
I am facing this issue while compiling Gromacs 2023 with Cp2K.
CMake Error at cmake/gmxManageCP2K.cmake:74 (message):
pkg-config could not find libcp2k, define CP2K_LINKER_FLAGS for custom
linking of libcp2k
the cmake command used was
cmake .. -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DREGRESSIONTEST_DOWNLOAD=ON -DGMX_MPI=on-DGMX_GPU=CUDA -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DGMXAPI=OFF -DGMX_INSTALL_NBLIB_API=OFF -DGMX_CP2K=ON -DCP2K_DIR=/storage3/gayatrip/cp2k-try2/cp2k/lib/local/psmp
Kindly guide me how I can install it.
Have a look at this script, which we're using for our daily test of Gromacs-CP2K.
thanks for this report. I was intending to test gromacs-cp2k with cmake but did not have time yet
