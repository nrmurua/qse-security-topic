When running the dashboard, I occasionally see 'asyncio:Fatal write error on socket transport' errors. I have not found a way to reliably reproduce this.
I am running from the master branch (dd21c07), with the master on Linux, and the dashboard on Windows 7. These errors have been occurring for quite a while - they have not been recently introduced.
Full message:
Is this #979 or is it between the dashboard and the master?
And it is also not just an old connection to a nonexistent dashboard istance or applet timing out?
I believe this is between the dashboard and master, as I only see these errors when a dashboard is running. I see these errors without any applets started.  I don't know if this is due to old connections to a nonexistent dashboard instance.
What prints this, the master?
Try enabling the debug mode of asyncio, which may or may not give more information.

@sbourdeauducq the master prints this.
I've enabled debug and will see what I get out.
