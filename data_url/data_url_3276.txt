The following Quil snippet will erroneously fail to parse.
There are two issues:
The lark grammar expects variables after AS MATRIX, which isn't correct.
The lark grammar only recognizes function call expressions in all caps (e.g. "COS", not "cos"). The Quil spec is ambiguous on what casing is valid, but it uses the lowercase form in it's own examples, so both should be supported.
Just attempt to parse the snippet with pyQuil.
