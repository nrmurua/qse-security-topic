The OpenQASM3 Spec for Arrays contains the following statement:
https://openqasm.com/language/types.html#arrays
The reference to an array's outer dimension is ambiguous, because the current Spec does not define the storage ordering for Arrays. The memory contents of an array's outer dimension is dependent on the array's storage ordering.
Proposed remedy:
There are subtle implications when deciding the storage ordering for Arrays. The Row Major ordering provides optimization advantages to the compiler that are not available with Column Major ordering.
I'm going to wait to hear from the TSC before attempting to turn this Issue into a Pull Request.
