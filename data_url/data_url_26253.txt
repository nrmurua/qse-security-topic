Given a quantum state provided as a density matrix or vector, determine whether the state is NPT (has negative partial transpose). If some of the eigenvalues of the transpose of the density operator representing the state are strictly smaller than zero, we say the state is NPT.
Note: A state is NPT if it is not PPT, so this should be a direct if not is_ppt(...) function call. It's mostly just providing a wrapper for ease of use.
