I would like the repo aqua-tutorial to be merged into a folder in here. This should provide more advanced quantum applications and include contributions from the community about how they are using aqua.
This should be linked from the qiskit/aqua which is really only there to highlight how to use aqua and its features. This folder should focus on teaching how developers how to write applications using qiskit aqua.
the landing from the main file is
3.5 Developing Quantum Applications with Qiskit Aqua
Learn how to develop and the fundamentals of quantum applications using Qiskit Aqua
@pistoia can you start by moving the aqua-tutorials here and then we get someone else to think about the learning path.
@chunfuchen @pistoia is everything from aqua-tutorial here now. Can we close this and delete the other tutorial
all aqua-tutorials are here, I think we can close this.
