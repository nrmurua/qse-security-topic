Interestingly, assert_allclose_up_to_global_phase has a comment explicitly recommending against specifying a default atol:
This was suggested by @Strilanc in #729. @dabacon
Part of the reason to make sure to specify atol for assert_all_close_up_to_global_phase is likely that we are modeled after numpy's downstream is_close.  Numpy's method is not symmetric.  The guidance in documentation https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.isclose.html is that you should select this carefully (also known as until your tests pass).  That said, even numpy has defauls for rtol and atol.
My suggestion is that if our tools delegate rtol and atol they should use numpy's defaults.
I think for testing methods it is best for each test to specify its tolerance. It is convenient to have default tolerances (and we do have this in some places) but really it is something that should be thought about for each comparison IMO. I'll close this pending someone else feeling strongly enough to re-open it.
