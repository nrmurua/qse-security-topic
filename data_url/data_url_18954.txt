Dear IBM quantum team,
A zip file with quantum circuits from the IBM quantum experience community is attached. It would be great if some circuits can be merged with examples.
Thanks, Bram (user sensor1)
qasm_circuits.zip
@SENSOR1  Added a few of the examples after minor bug fixing - will go through the rest shortly
Thanks @adcorcol and @SENSOR1 if there are more lets keep adding them. I will close this comment since we have added them to the repository
