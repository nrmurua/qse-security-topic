As the title says, the shape of a dataset is not preserved when it is exported from one database to another one. See below for more details.
ds_source.get_parameter_data('dmm_v1')['dmm_v1']['dmm_v1'].shape and ds_target.get_parameter_data('dmm_v1')['dmm_v1']['dmm_v1'].shape should return in both cases (20, 20)
ds_source.get_parameter_data('dmm_v1')['dmm_v1']['dmm_v1'].shape returns (20, 20)
ds_target.get_parameter_data('dmm_v1')['dmm_v1']['dmm_v1'].shape returns (400,)
It would be nice if the shape would be preserved as it facilitates further data processing.

@jenshnielsen thanks for this rapid fix.
