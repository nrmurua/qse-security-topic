When I do an adiabatic evolution with a callback.Gap it prints abc over and over again.
When I do an adiabatic evolution without callbacks enabled, the printing stops.
Something similar happens when comparing matrices with
so it might be in the .dense.matrix module. Also, when running this last line twice on a jupyter notebook, the second time the abc print disappears
Thanks, here is the line:

Yes, I also noticed that when I was doing the tests for the Trotter Hamiltonian. It is a leftover from some "debugging" I was doing and I forgot to remove it (sorry!)
I suggest to fix that directly in #216.

I agree. Just fixed it there.
