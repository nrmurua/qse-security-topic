It is currently not possible to apply a mixture without generating huge matrices. There also appears to be a missing concept around the notion of a "reset", which should be usable inside of monte carlo unitary simulations but currently forces the density matrix simulator.
After taking a closer look, I think Cirq actually has a monte carlo like simulator already in the sparse_simulator module with the _run_sweep_repeat method. Maybe I'm missing something @Strilanc ?
We now have apply_channel and apply_mixture.   @Strilanc is working on a common method _act_on_ which may end up deprecating these.
