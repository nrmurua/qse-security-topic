An unrelated thing here is I think maybe we need a similar property lookup as to DAGNode.condtion so for op nodes we just pull the name directly from the op node. something like:
just because it seems like there is a lot of mixing of node.name and node.op.name and while they should always be the same thing, it's probably good to actually enforce that.
