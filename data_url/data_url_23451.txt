Related to isue #56 there is another problem, internal conversion of values.
Sometimes the data you get or set in a measurement is not what that data actually represents.
For instance:
Both cases deal with manual additions/changes to instruments, or rather the representation of their values.
Should we have, Is there, or is there planned to have a standardized conversion of this?
@MerlinSmiles  can you rephrase this?
@giulioungaretti Not sure how to rephrase, what does not make sense?
Its kindof related to the signal chan thing from @WilliamHPNielsen
I am confused by this "Sometimes the data you get or set in a measurement is not what that data actually represents. "
Lets say you have a DMM measuring the output of and current amplifier, you measure voltage but it represents current.
Right now I use i.e. the parameter that is inside the ithaco driver or the parameter that is inside the SR560 diver, but the whole conversion thing is much more general and IMHO we should not write the same thing for each situation.
Right now I use the ithaco thing for a totally different instrument.
I think this is mostly solved by the parameter aliases in the station configurator i.e. bx in this example https://github.com/qdev-dk/qdev-wrappers/blob/master/examples/station_configurator/exampleConfig.yaml
We plan to move the configurator into qcodes main
... or by DelegateParameter class which will also moved to qcodes main soon (with some rework).
The future looks bright ðŸ˜Ž
