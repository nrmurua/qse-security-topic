When trying to run experiments like PEC like with thousands of sampled circuits split into many Jobs, Python runs out of memory because all the circuits persist in memory inside AerJobs.circuits
A toy example like this captures the problem
The general issue is a batch of unique circuits is run as a job, and then we wish to free the memory used by those circuits after the job starts so we can start generating a new batch of circuits without running out of memory. But currently this freeing can never happen as all circuits persist in the AerJobs
One solution would be to not store the circuits in the job and deprecate the AerJob.circuits method. Alternatively having some way so that the circuits being stored is optional.
Currently I am attempting to work around this by writing a function like
and running the above jobs like:
Releasing AerJob._circuits after its submission will free memory, I think. I would like to deprecate AerJob.circuits but it is a public API now and it will be removed after at least three months. Meanwhile, we may be able to provide an environment variable that release circuits after submission.
