In the following Quil snippet
the matrix internally attached to the GATE object has sign errors in the (0, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), and (3, 2) entries, but the correct (3, 3) entry. The error appears to be in the precedence of unary negation: -a+b is interpreted incorrectly as -(a+b).
This prevents such DEFGATEs from running on the QPU stack.
