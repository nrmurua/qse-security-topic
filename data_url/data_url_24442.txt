If a component fails to build because the user specified an incorrect name in the options or had a python error in their build function, the component just fails partially and while there can be a log error message when you do design.rebuild() in general the error message isn't handled well.
We should maybe add a hook to capture the logger messages and errors when we rebuild, this way each component that fails to build will have a record attached to it as to why it failed to build. We can then Have a gui tab display that record when needed.
Clearer reporting of build failures to the user.
The build of a component in self.make can throw an error, would be nice to capture that error somehow and associate it also with the component, so that we can report not only which QC failed but also why and at what line
