When trying to import maxcut_qaoa I get an ImportError stating that it cannot import name NoReturn. I think it's a bug but I'm not whether or not I'm making the mistake myself. The error originates from the quilatom.py file, when trying to import NoReturn from typing. I checked, and I got the latest version of typing, namely 3.7.4.1.
Thanks in advance!

Operating System: Windows 10
Python Version: 3.6.1
Quilc Version: 1.19.0
QVM Version: 1.17.1
According to this similar issue it looks like NoReturn was introduced in Python 3.6.5. Thanks for raising this. I'm not sure there's anything to fix here, other than making it clear that Python 3.6.5 is the minimum requirement rather than just Python 3.6.

I guess that was it, thanks for your help @notmgsk
