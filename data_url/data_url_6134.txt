Certain circuits with reset instructions in them cause a segmentation fault when using the MPS simulator.
I'm not sure if the MPS is supposed to support reset instructions or not,
This circuit causes seg-fault for me:
Circuit executes correctly
Not sure what is causing this, but if the x gate isn't present on the qubit not being reset it seems to execute without crashing.
Added support for the reset function. See PR #393.
