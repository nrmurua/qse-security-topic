Dear developers,
I'm having issues in compiling the CP2K software.
The way I'm installing it, is the following:
git clone https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k.git
Using the the arch/Linux-intel-x86_64-minimal.psmp, I execute the MakeFile with this command: make -j 6 ARCH=Linux-x86-64-intel-minimal VERSION=psmp
It seems like the error points to /usr/bin/ld, in which it can't find -lfabric. I am using intel compiler (intel v.19.1.2.254) to install this, where the cpu model is Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2698 v3 @ 2.30GHz.
This appears to be rather a problem of the Intel/MKL installation than a CP2K issue. Make sure that Intel/MKL is installed properly on your system.
