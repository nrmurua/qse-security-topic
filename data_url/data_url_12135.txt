What are the instructions for using a local clone of the newest IBMQProvider?  I cloned qiskit-ibmq-provider and am referring to the clone with my PYTHONPATH, nevertheless the code goes to the installed version of ibmq.
I think this is more of a question for the docs in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit as the tutorials assume the user has installed qiskit.
I need the instructions for myself. I'm trying to adjust Aer and Ignis notebooks to the IBMQ provider that's in the master branch. But I don't know how to run these revised notebooks.
Why not just install the latest qiskit, perhaps in an env. Or you can just drop the provider package into the local qiskit dir
Ignis and Aer notebooks are up-to-date with respect to IBMQ, both here and in the community tutorials.
