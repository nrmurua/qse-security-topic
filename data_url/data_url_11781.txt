Currently, the construct_circuit method is linked to a self._circuit object. Therefore, a variational form with an initial state is directly linked to a particular circuit.
If you want to use the same variational form with the same initial state as part of different circuits (--> circuit.append) this is prone to raising an issue.
In particular, this is a problem when using trained variational forms (see variational distributions) for state loading in the context of QAE.
Thus, it would be helpful if you could pass in a circuit such that the initial state is 'appended' to the given circuit.
