To install the CUDA Quantum python bindings, you must currently build cudaq with the CUDAQ_ENABLE_PYTHON flag set to true and point your python path to the installed .so file. We should allow for installation with pip and/or eventually conda.
Example:
pip install cudaq
would install the cudaq python module and make it accessible via import as import cudaq.
