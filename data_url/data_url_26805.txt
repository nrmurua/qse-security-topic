As far as I can tell, the compilation flag -D__DBCSR_ACC=2 isn't documented.
It enables the multiplication of large (>80) blocks on GPU by CUBLAS (see https://github.com/cp2k/dbcsr/blob/develop/src/mm/dbcsr_acc_operations.F#L149-L195)
This type of documentation issue would be solved by #351.
Indeed, the subtleties of compiling DBCSR shouldn't have to all be documented inside CP2K. Rather, a version of DBCSR with sensible options should be compiled by the toolchain.
And a question for @alazzaro : why doesn't the arch file for Piz Daint's GPU partition use -D__DBCSR_ACC=2 ?
Closing this issue since it doesn't require the flag anymore (see PR cp2k/dbcsr#334 )
