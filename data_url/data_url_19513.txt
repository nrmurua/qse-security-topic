As commented in today's meeting, in order to properly simulate the errors present on a real machine, there has to be a way to decompose multi-controlled gates up to Toffoli, CNOT and single qubit gates.
There has been a recent implementation in the new cirq version:
https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/cirq.decompose_multi_controlled_x.html?highlight=decompose
(as one example, there are a few more decompositions)
I implemented a function that specifically decomposed a multi-CNOT gate with one work qubit present in the Hash notebooks:
Both my implementation and cirq's are based on the following paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9503016
I think implementing something similar is important for error studies and scaling purposes.
