Internet access is being restricted severely in many institutions. Access to the AFWS TCP port and to the AFWS protocol is often not possible or only after negotiations leading to user frustration.
Implement the AFWS protocol over HTTPS with standard ports.
Getting rid of the hardcoded/shipped CA (and associated problems) replacing it with standard certificate chain of trust.
What do you mean by "associated problems"? The feature of SSL meant to block MITM attacks blocking a MITM attack?
Otherwise the self-signed certificate is no different than CA certificates shipped with browsers and OSes.
We can simply tunnel the AFWS protocol into WebSocket instead, no? And upgrade the connection to SSL only once the protocol is switched to WebSocket, so that the MITM software thinks the connection is not encrypted and gets out of the way.
Client needs to send:
Server needs to send:
And set proxyPass/proxyWebsockets in nginx.
With "problems" i meant e.g. the hassle associated with "trust by shipping the certificate" instead of trust by signatures, the problems with transitioning it/rolling it over, and the scenario of trying to revoke it.
WebSocket looks like it might work. Anything that reduces frustration.
Got some PoC code working, will polish a bit and push shortly.
Technically AFWS can be used with an external CA, it just seems to be more hassle than just shipping a self-signed certificate. And that's orthogonal to HTTP (even with ACME; for example we are using letsencrypt for IMAP/SMTP).
Agreed. The certificate stuff is orthogonal.
Done.
