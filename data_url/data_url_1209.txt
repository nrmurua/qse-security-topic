Description of the issue
Build Protos test fails with ERROR: Uncommitted generated files found! Please generate and commit these files using dev_tools/build-protos.sh:, eventhough the dev_tools/build-protos.sh was run and the files commited (e.g. https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/actions/runs/5621595069/job/15232679900?pr=6212).
The script dev_tools/build-protos.sh also pulls files not affected by the change. This might be related to the recent proto version update.
How to reproduce the issue
Any valid change to the proto files will probably trigger it. for example #6212
this is a python & dependency version problem. The test runs with python=3.9 and grpcio-tools~=1.56.0. My virtual env had python=3.10 and grpcio-tools=1.56.2.
I fixed the issue by generating the protos in an environment with the correct verions
