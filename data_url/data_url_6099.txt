BUG TEMPLATE 
When calling
evals, estates = backend_sim.get_dressed_energies(rabi_qobj)
I am seeing a warning raised:
It seems the pulse simulator is using the numpy matrix class which is deprecated.
FEATURE REQUEST TEMPLATE 
ENHANCEMENT REQUEST TEMPLATE 
@taalexander which version of scipy do you have? I think it's coming somewhere from scipy.sparse: there are some threads about this warning appearing in scipy.sparse, and as far as I can tell the matrix class is never being directly used anywhere in the pulse simulator.
I've just tried a few versions of scipy, and I get the warning in 1.2.0 and 1.2.1, but I don't get the warning in 1.3.0 and 1.3.1
I'm was on 1.1.0, upgrading to 1.3.0 seems to have done the trick.
