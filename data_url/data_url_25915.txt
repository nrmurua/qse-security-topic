We should replace the print calls when verbose=True in scans with tqdm from the tqdm library. Alternatively, we make it the default and find a way to mute the library's prints.
Describe the solution you'd like
Additional context
Our verbosity options are currently very rudimentary and tqdm is one of the most used Python libraries.
I would make sure to check in with some other people on what are the tools they're using for logging, as I know some people did some research on that and would be good to make it consistent across the codebase.
@mstechly, what do you mean with tools for logging? This would only print the scan progress in ASCII characters.
