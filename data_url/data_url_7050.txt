The circuit deserializer can create gates that overlap with controls. The auto-reflow will fix the issue as soon as the user interacts with the gate (it doesn't happen right away to avoid perturbing the saved state). But until that happens such gates should be disabled.
Failing to do so creates... interesting... effects. Some gates become non-unitary. Some read from following qubits instead of internal qubits. Some smash and burn.
