The Host method get_data_qubit can be renamed to get_qubit for simplicity.
@stephendiadamo Going through the docs, I noticed a get_data_qubits function. Should we also rename get_data_qubits to get_qubits for simplicity?
@WingCode that makes sense! Yes, I would say to make that change too.
@WingCode it should also be deprecated out, rather than replaced.
@stephendiadamo Are we depreciating get_data_qubits in favour of get_all_qubits_from_host ?
I am asking because usually with depreciation we include a nice little message for an alternative function which achieves a similar utility or a reason why the function has been deprecated.
@WingCode No, those two methods have two different behaviours. Just we want to deprecate get_data_qubits to get_qubits and get_data_qubit to get_qubit.
@stephendiadamo Forgot to ask, could you assign this issue to me?
