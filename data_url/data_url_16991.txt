The latex drawer draws too much "empty circuit" after the last gate.
It's already visible on a small circuit:

But the larger the circuit, the more noticeable it gets:

Draw any circuit using the latex drawer.
Draw the circuit shorter after the last gate.
#3243 should fix this issue. Running the circuit example above with that fix yields:

Although I actually see another bug in that image, the subscript is only on the first numeral in the label for register indexes >=10 this causes a rendering problem, I'll open another issue and fix for that shortly.

Looks great!
