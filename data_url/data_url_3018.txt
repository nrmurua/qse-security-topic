We no longer include the generated code because the engine code can use straight python dictionaries.  However we should probably include bazel rules here anyway.
Would like to help with this if i knew what it meant. I'm willing to learn Bazel but there are no tutorials for Python: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/getting-started.html
Looks like Bazel rules are language agnostic. This is what I have in a BUILD file in cirq/api/google/v1
@vtomole have you check to see if this compiles in Bazel?  If so I think we should add these (without making bazel a requirement of Cirq, but I think this will be useful...at least it will be inside of Google!)
Bazel can compile it. Should I also send the WORKSPACE file? It's in Cirq/ and it contains
Cirq$ bazel build //cirq/api/google/v1:program_proto 
and friends can't succeed without it.
I had to kill the bazel step on travis because the jdk download started 404ing
we have valid BUILD files, but aren't using or requiring bazel.  I think we should close.
