If I have to find the concurrence between two entangled particles, do we have any package in CQC to find the amount of entanglement like concurrence and fidelity??
If there are any examples you can provide, that would be great.
@ganeshmylavarapu-qp Using the CQC interface one cannot directly access the qubit states (although there might be some extended feature in the future, see #209). This is because the CQC interface it meant to replicate the interface that would be used in a real quantum network in which case one cannot access quantum state. As for a real quantum network, one can on the other hand generate and measure a state many times to collect statistics and estimate fidelity or state. There is for example an example which shows how one can estimate the QBER (quantum-bit error rate) which you can find here https://github.com/SoftwareQuTech/CQC-Python/tree/master/examples/pythonLib/QBER. Given the QBER, one can estimate the fidelity.
