The QDK QCTraceSimulator class runs a quantum program without actually simulating the state of a quantum computer. For this reason, the quantum trace simulator is able to run quantum programs that use thousands of qubits. It is useful for two main purposes:
Debugging classical code that is part of a quantum program.
Estimating the resources required to run a given instance of a quantum program on a quantum computer. In fact, the Resources estimator, which provides a more limited set of metrics, is built upon the trace simulator.

Revisiting this, I think it would be useful, especially in conjunction with some of the algorithmic projects that Junyu and other interns will be working on this summer. We would likely handle it on a provider-by-provider basis, as I doubt this is a feature that's universal across all of our supported front/backends. Tagging this for enhancement and we can address it in a month or two.
