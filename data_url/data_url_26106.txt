Here are a few things that we want to ensure are reflected in the CHANGELOG.md file upon next release. There will surely be other things we'll want to add as well, but for now, jotting these down. Feel free to adapt/change/etc. @purva-thakre if you think I've not captured something you've done as well.
I think if I manage to get an automated release workflow spun up before the next release, you might not have to manually list these. #359
I just did not get a chance to take a look at what a workflow like this requires because it talks about github tokens etc.
