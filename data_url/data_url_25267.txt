The current implementation of the describe action does not seem to be compatible with the Executor plugin repos. So far, we have been replicating the changelog in each repo which makes it more difficult to maintain in the long run. The current implementation of the describe action gives the following error:
Furthermore, when the changelog fails, it doesn't produce a new tag successfully as a result of which the test workflow also fails with error shown below.
The step that fails is:
The error msg is:
Use the following changelog.yml in any of the executor plugin repos which uses the actions in the Covalent repo:
Instead of the changelog workflow failing with the error above after it is merged to develop, it should properly update the version.
Furthermore, the test action should also pass.
To fix the describe action:
we might have to alter the logic in the following snippet:
When PR's get merged the commit often have two parents. The describe action here is failing at the step that checks that the commit action has 1 parent in which case it does not. One solution could be to replace this logic with a function called recursively so that it traverses the entire commit tree including the case where the commit has multiple parents.
