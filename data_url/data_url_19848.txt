Previously, Patch3D objects wouldn't update colors, to which a workaround was made to plot several versions of the same object in the same location and to select one as the visible object. This bug was tracked in matplotlib/matplotlib#3370.
A recent pull request fixes this bug matplotlib/matplotlib#18189. The workaround can thus be removed.
Enhanced 3D plotting is performed via patches, but encounters error matplotlib/matplotlib#18815, and is solved by matplotlib/matplotlib#18816.
