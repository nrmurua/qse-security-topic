There is a memory leak in the VideoMode object. The issue is that closing the VideoMode by closing the window does not destroy the object. A minimal script to show the issue is given below.
For some reason both closing the GUI window and performing a del on the object does not allow the garbage collector to remove the object.
@Christian-Volk For now the only solution is to restart the session after a high number of videomodes have been created
@lucblom Can you look into this?
