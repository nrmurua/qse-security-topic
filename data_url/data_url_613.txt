Implement a new AcceleratorDecorator that exposes an n_runs option. The Decorator will then execute the delegated Accelerator n_runs times to accrue better measurement statistics. After teach execution, it will need to aggregate the measurement count dictionaries some how.
This will provide a way to increase ibm-shots past 8192.
