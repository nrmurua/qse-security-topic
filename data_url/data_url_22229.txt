Electron multiplying CCD cameras can perform as well as PMTs for many applications. They have the advantage of many more pixels, lower price per pixel, and all the obvious offerings of being able to spatially localize (i.e. image) photons.
By implementing a Camera Link receiver, an ARTIQ DRTIO satellite could within a few 100 Âµs receive the frame and perform cropping, binning, and photon counting on multiple ROIs in a scalable way.
Configuration of the camera would be out-of-band over the "usual" channel, i.e. the vendor's libraries and an ARTIQ controller.
An array of "ROI engines" listening to the pixel stream would be configured to gate on pixels within their respective ROI, perform configurable binning, and then post the result as an RTIO input event.

Done and seems to work except:
@jordens Can you review the code, and also look into these two points? Since you can get physical access to the camera it may be simpler.
Maybe you sample each bit twice, i.e. by using DDR buffer
A couple things now. I'll do a detailed review later:
The WaitResolution state should be removed. The camera is generally not used as a video camera, it's not delivering frames all the time, we can't block on that.
It won't block, it just waits and then displays whatever values are there after a fixed time.
If that's 2048 rows it's probably due to the frame transfer area. If it's 2048 columns, that's weird. Are you saying the same pixel values are received twice?
Yes.
Pixel doubling presumably to meet min f requirement.
