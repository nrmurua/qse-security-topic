As a follow up to #5324 we need to improve the default selection for parallel_map on OSX. In that PR we changed it to default to not be enabled for all macOS users, however this was probably a bit too conservative. We should improve the logic to find the problematic OS and Python version combinations and disable it by default on those platforms (and likely warn about it). In other cases we can leave the previous default and enable multiple processes by default.
