The following fails:
Run above.
It should work.
It seems that execute was modified:
to include extra kwargs for Aer, but compile was not.
I think this is by design. It is part of separating CompileConfig and RunConfig (see #1629, and #978.).
Qobj is the experiment payload, and you only need circuits and a CompileConfig to generate it (e.g. coupling_map, native gate set, etc.)
RunConfig configures your runtime environment, like shots, max_credits, memory, etc.
The idea is that you would compile something once, but run it multiple times and on different backends, without having to recompile.
In this regard, I think it was decided that noise_model is part of RunConfig, so you could for example simulate the same payload with different noise. @chriseclectic can comment more.
Ok.  However unless one read the issues you linked to they would not know this.
