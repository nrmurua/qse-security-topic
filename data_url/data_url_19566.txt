Code to produce the error:
The error:
This one is somewhat weird; when I look at this file throwing the error on your github, it isn't identical, but when I install either the package as downloaded by pip install or by installing from the git repository, I still get the same file version that is throwing the error.
Edit:
need to actually force an install of sqimfil 0.3.4 by going into the github download of the package, going to opt/sqimfil, and force installing; pip installation or installing the package itself will install 0.3.3
Thanks; I'm working through another couple of known issues and, once I'm through with that, will force exact versions in the top-level setup.py to always pick up the latest in future releases.
Regression test has been added.
Fixed; path of type '5' (random chosen) was never executed in any of the previous tests and had a bunch of issues.
And released on PyPI.
