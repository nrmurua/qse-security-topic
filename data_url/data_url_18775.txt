While we can defcal gates, resets, and measurements, can we define how qubit delays are implemented as well?
In principle the grammar lets us currently do the following:
This is perhaps uncomfortable given that, unlike the invocation of parameterized gates, which uses parentheses, the delay uses a different form using square brackets.
My suggestion would be to either provide a special case defcal
Or continue with the former defcal and change the delay syntax
This was discussed at the TSC meeting on October 14th. In summary this is a great idea for mapping qubits to frames.
We had previous discussed adding  a duration argument to the defcal definition but dismissed it at the time as having no interesting use case. This however is a compelling use case.
The suggestion is to move forward with the syntax you suggested:
and to keep the delay invocation as is. We would welcome a PR making this change to the grammar and spec!
