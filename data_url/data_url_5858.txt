The description of the arguments of the class methods AerProvider.backend() and AerProvider.get_backends() is imcomplete here.
which parts seems to be incomplete? i think it is well defined
There's no documentation for the argument filters in AerProvider.backends. Or should the documentation currently used for **kwarg be the one for filters instead?
As backends returns a list of backends, filters can be applied,
backends(name=None, filters=None, **kwargs).
In get_backend, it returns a specific backend by "specific filtering", so there isn't the need for a filters argument.
I think the parameter section of backendcan be updated with filters
argument in the docs.
You could take a look at the source code for any further clarifications.
Let me close this issue. If this issue still remains, please open a new issue.
