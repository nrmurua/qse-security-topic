I expect adding pause() permit yieldings. It looks like this is broken. Or am I doing something wrong?
Problem appears to be in worker_impl.py
Also, documentation is not explicit about how to call pause.
Obviously you need a scheduler (and a master) to use pause. artiq_run doesn't have a scheduler, it's just a stand-alone single-shot experiment running tool. worker_impl is not used by artiq_run.
As for the doc: http://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual/management_system.html#pauses

Indeed. My bad. But we found a tiny bug. :)
Just confirmed that when using artiq_gui to schedule experiments that things work fine. This is after I add self.scheduler.pause() to the above program.
