QPROGRAM - Union of all supported quantum program types
QPROGRAM_LIBS - list of package names you pass as argument to the transpile method / convert to package function
In README we describe how each item in QPROGRAM_LIBS maps to a type in QPROGRAM. But there's some overlap and possible confusion with "qasm2" (str), "qasm3" (str), and "openqasm3" (openqasm3.ast.Program). Would probably make it more clear if we made QPROGRAM_LIBS a dict that mapped these package names to their corresponding QPROGRAM type.
