Rarely works, usually gives one of:
MapperError: 'two_qubit_kak: KAK decomposition does not return input unitary.'
ValueError: math domain error
MapperError: 'two_qubit_kak: Matrix A does not match xx,yy,zz decomposition.'
However, this always works:
This may be the same issue with the euler_angles_1q function as seen in #1965.
This is fixed
