Hi all!
I was wondering if there were any plans to upgrade tfq to be compatible with the newer versions of sympy? I am currently working on a project that requires sympy>=1.7, but I see there is a strict requirement on sympy==1.5 within the requirements.txt. I am hoping to work with tensorflow-quantum, but I am currently blocked by this compatibility issue.
Happy to help in any way that I can!
Thanks!
Hi @simonwa7 thanks for raising the issue.
This is absolutely something we can work on and probably get done pretty quick.
I'll look into this later this week.
@jaeyoo I have this faint memory of us choosing sympy 1.5 because it behaved better when serializing (particularly with rounding and strange numpy interactions ??? ), do you remember if there were any other reasons we locked onto 1.5 ?
Possibly also useful #423
Hmm i don't remember it. l am pretty open to upgrade to Sympy 1.7.
Thank you @MichaelBroughton and @jaeyoo :) This is really helpful!
This should now appear in the latest tfq-nightly install
