Right now we can give parameters a Validator at construction, but it is not possible to update the validator. We can call _set_vals, but the underscore suggests we should not do this as a user.
Do we want to enable setting the Validator? This would make it possible to set validators for instruments depending on the hardware that is attached.
I think that's a good idea. We can also use validators to set software limits that can be changed by the user.
Discussed either on slack or other issue, decission was to have a 'soft' validator (that can be changed) for say device protection. Don't mess with the driver post creation.
