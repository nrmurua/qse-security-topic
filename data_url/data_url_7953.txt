The new version of cython does not seems to be compatible with other cython. The error is not in our code but when cimporting from scipy.
For version 4.X, we already don't support cython 3.X.
For qutip 5.X, we have a few options, but I propose to drop support for python <=3.9. It can now be officially dropped according to scientific python. Other projects may start to drop support also and we may have to do more and more work around if we continue supporting if.
