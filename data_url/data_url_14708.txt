Should we allow something like
A possible use case would be using this circuit in machine learning algorithms as a reference kernel that doesn't do any quantum operations on the input data:
this is what the qiskit.aqua.components.feature_maps.RawFeatureVector does right now.
Though I'm not sure if such a feature should be contained to the machine learning applications or if we want to allow this in a more general setting.
I think this is a good idea, given that there's a solid use case for it and we already have gates that accept ParameterExpressions and can't be unrolled until fully bound (e.g. HamiltonianGate).
FYI, Qiskit ML introduced this in qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning#21.

Is the plan to migrate this to terra, or should this be closed?
I think it should be migrated, we added it in ML because it was release critical ðŸ™‚
