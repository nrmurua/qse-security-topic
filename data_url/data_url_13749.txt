This is another dependencies thing. In a new virtual environment, the following code results in an import error.
The error is
when mitiq/__init__.py attempts to import Program from pyQuil.
This is because pyQuil is not a dependency for mitiq (but is for mitiq/pyquil). Of course similar behavior will happen with importing QuantumCircuit from Qiskit.
While we could argue one should not run import mitiq, I feel like its such a common thing this is going to repeatedly pop up -- especially for first-time users as this is a standard thing to do to learn the library.
Sound the alarms frequently and loudly to not import mitiq.
Something else to handle this dependency subtlety.
Thoughts and ideas welcome!
I have an idea for this. See PR #86
Very nice!
