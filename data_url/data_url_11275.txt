It looks like Travis is failing on the two open pull requests for reasons that are totally unrelated to those pull requests. I think that perhaps something in the scipy linear programming module has changed? I'm assigning this issue to those with failing open pull requests but @jarrodmcc and I are also going to try to get to the bottom of this!
It seems to have an issue with importing the scipy.optimize module. This is very strange.
The problem is that just importing scipy does not let you access scipy.optimize. I fixed this in my PR. I have no idea why the tests passed up til now though. Seems like some weird import behavior in scipy that was fixed in the latest version.
Also "dim = 6 * 5 / 2" is a float, not able to be used for shape = (dim, dim).
With Kevin's change and this one, it's able to pass all tests now.
