When trying to use Braket Qexecutor in the qelectron and running the encompassing electron on AWS Batch using the respective plugin, the following error is thrown in the Batch container:
I'm assuming this is because there is no AWS related config set in the container - this isn't an issue if we use the Braket executor from a local executor like Dask or Local since all of the AWS related config is already set in the ~/.aws directory which is the default place boto3 looks at.
Resolving this might require modifying the Braket Qexecutor so that it has a options to provide the necessary config options or even credentials if necessary.
