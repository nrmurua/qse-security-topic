Summary: currently ReferenceDensitySimulator fails because of small negative and imaginary probabilities.
Recommendations: we should be able to specify the tolerance for removing small imaginary and negative components of the measurement probabilities. At the very least the tolerance should be generously set to 1e-9 to 1e-7.
Details: If you run the code below a ValueError with message probabilities are not non-negative is returned. The code breaks at line 183 of ~/pyquil/pyquil/reference_simulator.py in sample_bitstrings(self, n_samples).
In my local version of pyQuil I was able to fix the error by modifying the code in sample_bitstrings to add a tolerance argument to np.real_if_close and explicitly set small negative probabilities to zero.
Code:
