Hello,
I run pyrpl GUI and I want to calibrate the channels in the Lockbox. I use the FabryPerot class (but I tested the HighFinesse FP and the CustomLockBox as well). When I try to calibrate (calibrate or calibrate all) I get the following error:
asyncio.base_futures.InvalidStateError: Result is not set
This error traceback to the following:

Tested on Win 10 64bits, master branch with Python 3.6 and python3-only branch with Python 3.6,3.7.2 and 3.8.
In the master branch I tried also python Python 3.7.2 and 3.8 however  the GUI would start but immediately freeze, throwing the error:
AttributeError: module 'qtpy.QtCore' has no attribute 'pyqtBoundSignal'
Added minor issue:
In python 3.7.2 and 3.8, python3-only
import pyrpl throw the following

This is easily fixable by removing skipping the lines
I suspect is due to some version of some package related to my installation but I am not sure. Any help would be strongly appreciated,
Thanks
Emanuele
Hi
I just want to say that I am experiencing the same error when trying to run calibrate on the lockbox module.
I have tried both the master branch and python3-only branch. I am running python 3.6.13 on a 64bit windows 11 machine.
Any help would be appreciated.
Best
