Thanks for your error report. Unfortunately, this is a bit too short to let us meaningfully comment on it (compiler version, options, ?). Also, this code exists identically in the upstream repos it actually originates with/is maintained in, e.g., in PQCrystals, so I'm afraid we can't really do something about it other than say that we know this code builds on Windows (see AppVeyor testing here).
To complement @baentsch's comment, we now use cmake to build on Windows (we used to have VS projects), as documented here. See the appveyor build script for details. If this doesn't work for you, please provide more details on your build process. Thanks.
Fixed: Visual studio doesnt like making unsigned ints negative so casting the var to int then back fixes it.
I would invite @Dan-J-D to report this upstream (here or here ), so it's getting fixed for everyone.
