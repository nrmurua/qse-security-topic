Make this look better
Hey @nonhermitian
Can I have a go at this issue?
Sure go for it!
Hey @nonhermitian
Got the error and it was just a simple rounding off error in the QuantumState module particularly
        return self._vector_to_dict( self.probabilities(qargs=qargs, decimals=decimals), self.dims(qargs), string_labels=True)
The decimals argument was responsible for the number of digits we round off to and what I wanted to confirm once was that is a 10 digit precision sufficient if None is mentioned?
By default I would drop everything < 1e-15 as those are all floating point zeros.
Hey @nonhermitian
I tried to make a PR but since I updated the docs too, it fails on 1 of the lint tests. Was I not supposed to do that?
It looks like you forgot to run black on the files, that's why the linter job fails ðŸ™‚
It's strange, I did run black on the file and the linter fails still. ðŸ˜•
This is a very old issue, sorry, but I'm going to close it as "won't fix": I don't think that truncation of outputs is something we should be doing automatically because we don't have the context to know what the user cares about - we might be truncating important numerics. Even if not, this would be a breaking API change.  probabilities_dict takes a decimals argument to allow the user to manually specify truncation, and this can be used to produce the preferred neater output.
