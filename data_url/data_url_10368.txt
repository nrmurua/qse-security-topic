OS: Mac OS X High Sierra
When running 'dwave config create' I did not see some of the default values that I expected to see and ultimately, writing the config file failed.
Steps to reproduce:
Created virtual environment doing the following:
virtualenv ocean
cd ocean
source ./bin/activate
Installed the Ocean SDK:
pip install dwave-ocean-sdk
Tried to create configuration file:
dwave config create
Please see the attached screenshot.

Duplicate of #197. Fixed in #205.
