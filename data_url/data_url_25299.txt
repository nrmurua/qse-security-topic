When hosting covalent server on a remote machine, the get_result function throws an  AttributeError exception when trying to retrieve even a successfully completed workflow's result. Submission does not seem to be a problem, and when checking the result on the UI, it seems that the workflow was also completed successfully.
Can be reproduced by submitting the workflow on a remote covalent server, and calling the get_result function to retrieve the result.
The following is the traceback:
get_result should return the result object instead of throwing an exception. An addition to the scope of this issue is to ease the access to get result from a remote server; similar to how a user can pass a url to ct.dispatch, they should be able to pass a url to ct.get_result as well.
It seems that this issue comes from networkx dependency not matching between the client and the server. Even though both were installed using the same method. We should probably look into pinning its version instead.

Slightly increasing the scope of this issue to deal with a small QoL improvement for remote covalent server.
