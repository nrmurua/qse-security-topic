Describe the bug
The results of the "QubitRegister::ExpectationValueX", "...Y" and "...Z" are incorrect if the state is not normalized.
To Reproduce
The error can be seen from the following code snippet:
Additional context
I was able to track down the problem. In the expectation value functions, a gate is applied to change the basis to the appropriate Pauli operator, and then the value is calculated via the lines 24, 50 and 72 of "src/qureg_expectval.cpp":
This expression assumes the vector is normalized. In particular 1. -> (state norm)^2 for this to be correct in general.
