An update from MPICH 4.0.3 to 4.1.x is currently disabled by the build of the DBCSR library which is required for the CP2K build. The problem is already described by the DBCSR issue #661 and by the comment in the routine header of mp_alloc_mem_:
The routine uses the Fortran 2008 types, i.e. C_PTR for mp_baseptr implying USE mpi_f08, while still the old Fortran MPI module is employed by USE MPI which returns an INTEGER of MPI_ADDRESS_KIND for mp_baseptr. It seems that from MPICH 4.1 transitional interfaces have been dropped eventually which allowed the compilation in the past.
I may have a look at it because I have already some experiences in that respect with CP2K.
Great, thanks @fstein93
Please try again, now DBCSR support MPI F08 interface.
The issue is resolved with DBCSR release 2.6.0.
Thanks to @alazzaro and @fstein93
