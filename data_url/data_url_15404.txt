When running QuantumCircuit.draw(output='latex', filename='qteleport.pdf'), I get the following output:
Use .draw with filename='something.pdf' on linux.
The pdf file should be created in the cwd.
It might be an issue with Pillow / Linux root permissions. Perhaps give a way to specify the output directory to bypass automatic use of /tmp.
I temporarily got around the issue with:
Also just found out that
QuantumCircuit.draw('mpl').savefig('qc.pdf')
works as I'd expect
QuantumCircuit.draw(output='latex', filename='qc.pdf')
to. Trying
QuantumCircuit.draw('latex').save('qc.pdf')
gives the image output, but the top and bottom parts of the image are cut off.
If possible, could you try a development version of Qiskit Terra and change this line: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/eaf55816470fd64c934b36b7684a02e133dfbc5f/qiskit/visualization/circuit_visualization.py#L491

You're working on a system where the /tmp directory is mounted on a different file-system to your working directory, and I don't have easy access to a system like that to test on.  The shutil.move form should handle the cross-filesystem copy correctly, but it'd be good if you'd be able to test it for us.  Thanks!
That did it! It was just on line 445 for me for some reason.
That's great!  Would you be interested in making a PR to apply that change? (No pressure.)
The line-number difference isn't important - it'll just be that we've made some changes to the file I linked to between Terra 0.21.0 (which you have installed) and the current development version, which I linked to.
Done. Let me know if there's something more I can do in terms of the tests/documentation contributing steps, as I'm not familiar with tox.
Fixed by #8629.
