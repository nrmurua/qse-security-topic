I find that using conda to install all of the packages needed for the documentation works, except for installing Sphinx. For some reason conda only installs version 1.7.4 of Sphinx, but I believe a version 2.x.x is needed. However in my conda environment if I run pip install -U Sphinx, this installs version 2.2.2 of Sphinx, and running make html afterwards works perfectly.
Is this taken care of by specifying version info in requirements for doc? I don't think it's our responsibility to teach the user how to install the correct version of a required package, otherwise.
Agreed.
