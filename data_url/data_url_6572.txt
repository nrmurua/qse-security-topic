The function "compute_amplitudes" does not exist in the Cirq simulator interface, so it doesn't really make sense for the qsimcirq API to support this function. We should either add "compute_amplitudes" to the cirq simulator interface or remove this function for now.
The SimulatesAmplitudes interface has this method:
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/eb4ad794a9213c20c800fa59199a29f353ca7994/cirq/sim/simulator.py#L126
That said, it does recommend implementing "compute_amplitudes_sweep" instead - we may want to shift to that method.
Qsimcirq simulator should API documentation on what is supported.
This documentation will be available in the upcoming devsite.
