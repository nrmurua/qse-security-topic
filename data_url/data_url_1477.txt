Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Checking at 4ebfb1c the unit test collection is not reproducible, because UT parameters depend on random numbers and value order in sets / dicts.  As a result, it is not possible to execute tests in parallel using the -n N, --numprocesses=N option, because pytest first checks if all worker jobs have the same collection of tests.  This fails, because test names are different in each job:
This irreproducibility makes it also trickier to re-run failing unit tests if their parameters are random.
Describe the solution you'd like
Replace parameters in sets or dicts with fixed-order containers or sort them before test parametrization.
Use deterministic seeding for random number generation when running unit tests.
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered

What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
