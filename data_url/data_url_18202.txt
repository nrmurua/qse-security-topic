Currently the state_fidelity function in tools.qi.qi.py is defined using the Nielsen and Chuang [1]  convention of
F(|a>,|b>) =  |<a|b>| (for pure states).
This should be changed by the convention more commonly used in more recent papers and by other authors (Eg. [2, 3]):
F(|a>,|b>) = |<a|b>|^2.

Lets change it to the square as it is the standard that many of us have been using. We should of done this the first time.
