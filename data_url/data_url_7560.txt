Current differentiation strategy is limited to loyal simulation of quantum differentiation in
https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00745
The complexity is O(M^2) with M the number of parameters.
Back propagation is much more efficient in simulation, it has O(N) simulation complexity.
Blocks marked by ∂ sign will be differentiated automatically using g1 = gradient(circuit, δ) , where δ = ∂f/∂ψ*.
Then, for the loyal simulation on quantum circuit, we provide QDiff interface.
This looks good to me. gradient is also compatible with other AD tools. but can you give a single PR for this?
Refactoring is for autodiff.
