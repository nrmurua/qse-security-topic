There seems to be a bug in pyquil that causes a segmentation fault in the following situation. Please consider the following mini application written in C++ that creates the QASM code in the host application and invokes the Python interpreter:
Remark: In my real program am not using PyRun_SimpleString but the problem is the same.
When I compile the code under macOS 10.13.6 as follows
I receive the following error
Removing the second run() from the main() function solves the problem.
The segmentation fault occurs already at the import pyquil line.
Hi, @mmoelle1. I don't think this is an issue with pyQuil. Rather I think this is a problem with your code and Python's ref counting. See the following debug session:
I'm going to tentatively close this, and suggest you ask some Python gurus for guidance on using the C/C++ API. If they send you back, then we can reopen it with more information.
Thanks. I have posted this question here. What still makes me think that it is a 'specialty' of pyquil is the fact that I am using the above approach for many other Python modules without problems and that the error occurs already for this code:
