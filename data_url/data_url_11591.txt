The readme sample unit test, that ensures the sample continues to work with whatever changes are going on, seems to fail on occasion in the build. I have not looked to see whether the test is failing with perhaps a valid alternate answer that should be catered to in the assertion its correct, or whether this sample needs seeding to ensure the output is consistent each time. Here is a failure from earlier today as an example
I have also seen it fail where the issue is around NaN in the samples, which seems of greater concern since one would hope no matter whether it gave a correct answer or not NaN seems more like some logic bug.
Here is one that has just happened with NaN, as I mentioned I had seen in original message here. Though this error seems to originate from BasicAer as the first source of failure
How about replacing BasicAer with Aer?
The above issue has not been seen in a while. An issue was fixed during Cvar implementation #1345 in SPSA that had potential to be the source of this failure. Since the issue has not been seen in a while the issue, that was noticed/fixed for a different problem, may indeed have been the source. I am therefore closing this issue since it no longer seems to be valid.
