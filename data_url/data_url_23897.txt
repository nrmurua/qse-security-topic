This doesn't make any sense to me, but dragScaling = -1 and -2 have the same key (though different shape in Q as expected)
I'm ðŸ˜•...  Pulse.hashshape() is just hashing the shapeParams but
Seems to be a hash collision with hashing a tuple of something and -1 or -2 e.g.
Actually it's caused by a hash collision between -1 and -2: both hash to -2 ????
Seems to be that Python uses -1 to denote a hash failure so -1 gets shifted to -2 so we may want to salt any integers.
interesting, I guess I'll shy away from those DRAG integers... but it seems dangerous as it could happen elsewhere
Yeah, definitely dangerous. Colm and I just discussed a proper fix.
