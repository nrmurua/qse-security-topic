Right now our docs push the following syntax:
However, this does not make it clear that the program is being mutated and also is a bit verbose. We also support the following syntax but not too many people know about it:
Should we push this syntax in docs and examples instead? It makes it clear where the mutation is and also has fewer parenthesis.
The only concern is that it doesn't match the Python syntax for lists which expects an iterable (ie. it's the concat method instead of the append method, although we could easily support both in one). But also the Python += on lists is very unexpected and dumb since it behaves differently than + so we shouldn't worry about being different than it.
For me, += syntax is pretty clear.
It might be a little confusing with "measure" function since "measurement" and "gate" are two different categories, but I don't think it's a major problem, rather a matter of habit.
The old syntax feels somewhat unwieldy to me, so I will go with the +=.
On the other hand I'm not sure if the += isn't more prone to bugs. I don't have any definite opinion, just an intuition.
Maybe the fact that you need to use the old syntax makes me more aware that it's a special type, not a regular one and I treat with more caution?
