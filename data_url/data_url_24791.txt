The library should generate a MATLAB file which defines a special-measure scan.
The scan configures an Alazar PCI digitizer and the AtsAverage.dll which preprocesses and reduces the acquired data on-the-fly based on so called masks which define the measurement windows. It can perform different operations such as downsampling or repetitive signal averaging.
For this we need to:
Questions:
We can possibly configure and run the whole scan from python if the operation configuration is also done there and the library 'owns' the MATLAB engine.
For the identification of measurement windows, this depends on issue #66 .
Further, this issue is related to issue #64 , which is also concerced with Python-MATLAB interaction., as well as issue #65 , concerning the definition of scanlines in the toolkit. These efforts should be coordinated. Especially, I think this issue depends on the results of the ones mentioned above and implementation should thus be postponed.
However, since this is also relevant for the other ticket, answers to the questions should be given. I'll start with some guesses (in order corresponding to the questions above) and hope someone from @qutech/owners @qutech/bluhm-group can elaborate:
I will close this now as the scope of qupulse was narrowed
Should the library provide the possibility to control MATLAB from there using the MATLAB python interface?
No.
Where happens the configuration of the operations(downsampling, repetitive signal averaging, etc.)?
Not a qupulse task.
Do we need measurement window 'flagging'? This could be useful to assign different operations to different measurement windows.
Measurement windows have names
Where happens the data anlysis?
Not in qupulse.
