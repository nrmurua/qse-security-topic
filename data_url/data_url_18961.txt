Support simulations in the interaction picture.
Similar to selecting dressed/lab frame or open/closed system dynamics, allow for the selection of interaction picture representation during simulation.
None.
The interaction picture is preferable for gate synthesis, as ideal representations are often implicitly written in the local qubit frame. In addition, in this frame during free evolution, populations and phases are static, which should help to remove fast oscillating contributions to goal functions and other measures.
