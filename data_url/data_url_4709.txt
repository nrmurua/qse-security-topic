When running GBS for molecular vibronic spectra, I would occasionally (~5% of the time) get the following error:
I've tried with different molecules, but this error would only occur to one of them.
The data used comes from Firefly electronic structure calculation and model formic acid. Here is a snippet (data included) that will eventually throw an error (at iteration ~15-30)

I have gotten this error on small molecules too but when I increase the number of samples above some threshold. Maybe this is the limit of simulator.
Hi @pwndr3 and @wait-a-sec. The error "probabilities do not sum to 1" is a known numpy issue that can be fixed by renormalizing the probability vector. Please note that we have fixed this in the latest release, Release 0.16.0, of The Walrus. Please install the latest version of The Walrus (0.16.0) and that will solve the problem. Thanks.
Thank you for informing @soranjh !
Thanks @soranjh, closing issue!
