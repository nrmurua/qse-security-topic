A subsection Classical bits and registers describes as
Classical registers and bits support bitwise operators and the corresponding assignment operators between registers of the same size: and &, or |, xor ^.
and a subsection Integers describes as
Integer types support addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *, and integer division /; the corresponding assignments +=, -=, *=, and /=; as well as increment ++ and decrement --.
In a surface code in examples, ^ is used as "power" operation for integers, I guess.
If operator is like Python, ^ is XOR and ** is POWER.
I think ** should be power to allow for the XOR ^.
I agree let's use ** for power.
@hhorii would you be able to update the examples and document to reflect this? We will also want to update the ANTLR grammar
