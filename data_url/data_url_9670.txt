Hello, could you please explain where this error is coming from and how can I fix it?
Thanks!
I also tried this from the temp directory and got the same error:
Try setting your QMASMPATH environment variable to include the directory containing stdcell.qmasm.  stdcell.qmasm is part of edif2qmasm so look in your edif2qmasm installation directory.  For example,
Thank you, my bad, I did not read carefully that part of the documentation. What I have now though is this error:
Not sure which D-Wave's libraries are referred to here. I have installed the dwave ocean sdk.
pip install dwave-ocean-sdk && dwave config create
Do I need other libraries?
I was able, however, to generate the qubo file, but I am not sure how to run it
Unfortunately, QMASM is based on D-Wave's now-deprecated proprietary SAPI library.  I'm currently in the process of porting QMASM to Ocean (as in, I just started today, and it looks like it'll take some time), at which point the commands you list above will be valid.
For now, go with --format=qbsolv, as you wrote above.  You can download qbsolv from GitHub: https://github.com/dwavesystems/qbsolv
