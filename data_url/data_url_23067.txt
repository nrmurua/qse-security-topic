Is this really mandatory to have pandas as a requirement ? I would advocate for not going down that road now that it is still possible...
hmm. So far we are not using pandas, but it is really practical and not so slow imho. Especially the dataframe should be reconsidered i think. The big changes of the pandas API that we experienced a few years ago were because (I think) Continuum Analytics started to professionally polish the repository for data science. I do believe the code now has a large user community which would be equally unhappy to see API changes. So I deem it unlikely that we will run into problems. Or are there other problems with pandas that I am not aware of?
I fully agree that we should allow for storing "multichannel curves" for instance for (time, channel1, channel2), or (frequency, spectrum1, spectrum2, cross_spectrum), which is the purpose of the dataframe, but in principle this would be possible with multidimensional numpy array.
I just got very frustrated by pandas because of:
If you really believe these problems are behind us, then maybe we can go for it...
OK, but I find it weird that most of the time series.index is working fine, but in rare occasions, it becomes an array of 'object' which leads to very cryptic error messages (especially for inexperienced users).
