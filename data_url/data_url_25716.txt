After following the how-to here, https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/orchestration/construct_c_task.html, cell block 3 fails with the following error:
seems to be a gcc/clang related error.
Edit: Adding platform info:
MacOS 12.3.1 Apple M1
gcc command uses clang in the backend
Python 3.8.13, clang 12.0.0
this problem is due to clang not properly building the library
@wjcunningham7 can this be closed?
