Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
While QuTiP currently provides extensive functionality for computing open systems propagators, it would be helpful to provide convenience functions for common channels, such as depolarizing noise, dephasing noise, amplitude damping, generalized amplitude damping, and overrotation.  This would both help users new to open quantum systems start working with how different channels transform mixed states, and would allow experienced users to quickly define phenomenological models.
Describe the solution you'd like
Adding the following new functions (not sure what the most appropriate subpackage would be):
It may also be good to consider introducing a function to represent simple overrotation channels (e.g.: ∫ 𝑒^{−𝑖𝐻θ} Pr(θ) 𝑑θ), perhaps by Monte Carlo sampling.
Describe alternatives you've considered
