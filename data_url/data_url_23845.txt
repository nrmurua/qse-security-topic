When I try installing Qcodes with python setup.py develop I get an error:
So I have a specific branch of pyqtgraph installed that has a somehow funny version number, but it is larger than the required 0.9.10.
Is there any way to make this work without swiching the pyqtgraph branch and then switching it back?
That check happens after setup() has finished, so you're probably good to go already... anyway, it's not saying the version is too small, it's just barfing on the version string. After I sort out the more pressing issue you uncovered last night, I'll make a fix for this - unless you want to do it, it's a pretty easy except ValueError: at the very end with another template asking you to manually ensure that the version is OK.
