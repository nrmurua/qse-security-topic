I installed artiq 2.3 on our virtual box using,
With the following packages in the environment,
If I try to run artiq_flash I get the following error,
I'm not sure why it's looking for files in a different environment there.

@r-srinivas this is fixed and the next 2.4 release will contain that fix. Meanwhile as a workaround with artiq 2.3, you should be able to conda install sphinx_rtd_theme sphinxcontrib-wavedrom sphinx-argparse python=3.5.2 (after having created the initial environment) or conda create -n artiq-2017-05-04 artiq-kc705-nist_qc2 sphinx_rtd_theme sphinxcontrib-wavedrom sphinx-argparse python=3.5.2 -c m-labs/channel/main.
