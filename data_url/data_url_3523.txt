The term "parametric program" appears in several sections in the documentation referring to different things. The intended use of "parametric program" is in reference to the new parametric compilation feature Quil 2.0 offers, so older references should be changed.
There are two consistent references to Quil 2.0 parametric programs in the "Installation and Getting Started" section: one explaining what's changed in Quil to enable parametric programs and another demonstrating how you'd migrate some sample code from pyQuil 1.9 to 2.0, both of which were updated recently.
There is another extraneous, 6 month old reference to parametric programs in the Advanced Usage section, which uses the pyquil.parametric.ParametricProgram class. This should be renamed so as to avoid confusion with the new Quil 2.0 parametric program compilation feature.
