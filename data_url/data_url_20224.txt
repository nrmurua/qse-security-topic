On my Windows 10 Enterprise VM, with with Ninja build tool and MSVC compiler. Target platform as reported by speed_sig: AMD64-Windows-10.0.18363.

For 64-bit builds:
Rainbow-Vc-Cyclic keypair generation takes 71.156 seconds, as measured by speed_sig. Signing takes 35.61 seconds. It once increased the runtime of ninja run_tests by 10 minutes, but this seems to be non-deterministic.
The SPHINCS and Rainbow variants seem in general to impose a big slow down on ninja run_tests.
kat_sig with Falcon-512 and Falcon-1024 results in heap corruption errors.
I don't think we officially support win32. If that's in scope, we should at a minimum add CI tests for it (appveyor currently only target x64). Do we support/test 32-bit on linux/mac?
No, we don't support/test 32-bit on Linux or Mac.  Do any of our use cases have a need for 32-bit?
I don't think we need to support 32-bit. First error case above is therefore a non-issue. We should investigate the slowdown on x64 bit. Is there optimized code in there that only runs on Linux? That could explain the speed difference.
On what platform did you experience errors on Falcon-512/1024, @xvzcf ? kat_sig completes successfully with these algs on my Windows machine.
It was a VM image with 4G of RAM assigned to it.
I tried running kat_sig Falcon-512 and kat_sig Falcon-1024 again, and both worked fine. It is likely this change that fixed the problem.
Shall we close this issue then?
I think there's still the outstanding issue of the speed of the Rainbow and SPHINCS variants. I'll just note them here: #698 and close this.
