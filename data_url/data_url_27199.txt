Similar to Scott Aaronson's shors description. Add an intuition section to each algorithm describing on a high level how the algorithm works. (Ideally not more than a quick paragraph) (I think it makes the most sense to add this just after the Problem Outline section) (We could then have it such that we let people know that the first sections, [problem outline, benchmarking, intuition] are good introductions to the algorithms, and the other sections can get a bit more involved)
Ieally this section will have a visualization of Quantum Circuit Composer describing via bloch spheres what the algorithm is doing. Must include a section somewhere in the repo describing the bloch sphere
Visualization is only really possible/helpful for DJ, BV, and QFT. The other algorithms have too much entanglement, meaning that the visualization like what we include in DJ's gif is impossible. How do we feel about that idea? One suggestion would be to add these visualizations in these benchmarks. We would probably want this to be a separate section different from intuition.
