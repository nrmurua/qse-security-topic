In __init__ method of qbraid.transpiler.cirq.CirqMomentWrapper:
self._instructions = [CirqInstructionWrapper(i) for i in moment.instructions]
However,
So, must extract qubits from Cirq.Moment object in order to create instruction wrapper.
NOTE: If we don't move forward with moment wrapper classes, this issue is null.
The same issue exists in BraketMomentWrapper.
