Not sure how much overlap there is. linear-algebra.lisp defines things like make-matrix, matrix-multiply, and kronecker-multiply that are also available in MAGICL.
this is a little tricky; QVM doesn't share the same representation. Maybe they should, but maybe not
@stylewarning how so? They don't use same row/column ordering?
