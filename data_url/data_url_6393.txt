It's probably a good idea to add more of the supported third-party stack to the Qrack Repo CI, so we can know immediately when our support for those project fails. Their unit tests also hit edge cases that are hard for Qrack's unit tests to hit directly.
This should be the next PR, after #204.
Resolved by #206. The Qiskit provider is not yet included, but I'm debating the return this would give for the time and complication.
