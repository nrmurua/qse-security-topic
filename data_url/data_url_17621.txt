I recently upgraded from 0.6.1 to >0.7 and I was unable to import QuantumCircuit from qiskit. I then decided to go back down (to 0.6.1) so I could actually import it. Is there a reason for this as I missed something? Was QuantumCircuit deprecated?
python3 -m pip install -U qiskit qiskit-aqua
Code should run as before

See #1599
Closing as this is the same issue as #1599.
