I disabled CPPDEBUG flag conditional in deploy because travis was throwing an error:
Worker information
/Users/travis/.travis/job_stages: line 599: conditional binary operator expected
/Users/travis/.travis/job_stages: line 599: expected )' /Users/travis/.travis/job_stages: line 599: syntax error near $CPPDEBUG)'
/Users/travis/.travis/job_stages: line 599: `  if [[ (-v $CPPDEBUG) && ("$TRAVIS_TAG" != "") ]]; then'
I believe that it was serving a purpose and should be reactivated.
Additionally, the linux builds were failing because they were expecting the flag and not seeing it.
Fixed by PR #14
