Transpiling a circuit with an XYX basis and setting the basis translation method to synthesis doesn't actually change the basis.

The hadamard gates get translated to Rx(pi) Ry(-pi/2)
This is expected since UnitarySynthesis only decompose UnitaryGates to the target basis, see lines 85 and 96. Should run over all op_nodes ?
I think the issue is actually earlier in the pass manager. With the translation method set to synthesis it is running collect2q blocks and consolidate blocks to generate the unitary gates which then unitary synthesis can decompose into the target basis set. But, because this circuit is all 1q it's not collecting any blocks and not creating the unitary gates for unitary synthesis to decompose.
Oh, i see. Thanks for clarifying it.
So after some "investigation", i found out that this problem arises even with 2q gates if they are in a block with length 1. For example, transpiling the following circuit doesn't replace  the cz gate. Probably, line 114 is the root.
Furthermore, should there be a pass that collects consecutive 1q gates?
For the two qubit bug found by @georgios-ts , I agree L114 should be extended to check basis_gates. For the consolidation of 1q gates, #5216 seems the right approach.
Hello, Could I step into this?
@SeifMostafa sorry we missed that one. Are you still interested?
