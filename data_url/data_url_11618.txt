I am working on implementing an image classifier following this tutorial: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/legacy_tutorials/aqua/machine_learning/qsvm_classification.ipynb.
I was able to run the code and get results using a virtual quantum computer in my local computer. But when I run the same code in "ibmq_qasm_simulator" it is giving me this error: "Job timed out after 10000 seconds. [5201]".  any idea how to solve this? I am using 10 qubits (i.e., number of features after PCA). Thanks in advance. (edited)
@jyu00 Jessie, do you have any thoughts here. Maybe the algorithm and resulting job is just too complex as the 5201 would suggest. Its certainly a long time to run to determine that before failing.
The 5201 is a safeguard designed to ensure a job doesn't get stuck for some reason (hence the long timeout). I ran the same notebook on ibmq_qasm_simulator and got the same error. However it ran fine locally on Aer qasm_simulator, so it's not an issue with the job itself. I've opened an issue with the IQX dispatcher team.
@woodsp-ibm This should be working now.
@jyu00 Thanks for looking into this and having a resolution so quickly.
@mahfuz195 Please give your notebook another try as it should work now.
@mahfuz195 Since this should be working I am going to close this issue. If the same problem is still happening then please feel free to re-open this issue.
