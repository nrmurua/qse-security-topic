Code example? I can't make this happen.
Hi @nonhermitian . As of the latest branch, the pi/1 does not get plotted despite proving pi/1 as an arguent to u3 in latex drawer.  I am just getting te below when I try to replicate the problem.

Ok great
If you create a circuit with qc.u3(..., -pi/1,...) is python who reduce that expression. That why is key to see how OP managed to create the original drawing.
