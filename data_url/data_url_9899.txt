Especially with the inclusion of CQM, it would be good to allow samples provided to .energy() and .energies() functions to contain a superset of the variables in the relevant model.
An example of why this is useful:
Given a CQM
and proposed solution {'x': 1, 'y': 0, 'z': 1}, we cannot currently check the energy of any of the individual components. If we allowed energy checks to be more loose, we could do
Additional Considerations
We could toggle this behavior with a keyword argument. In which case my preference would be something like strict defaulting to False.
Additional Context
This contradicts part of #244
Sounds intuitive. I would expect the strict=False behavior to work (if I was a new Ocean user).
And strict=False wouldn't be a backwards compat break, so üëç
