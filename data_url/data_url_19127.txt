For convenience, it would be nice to have a mesolve method for the Objective class, to propagate the initial state, or any other given state.
There should also be a propagate routine that gets passed a propagator (just like optimize_pulses). This way, one could easily compare the two propagations to check for "discretization errors".
This is especially useful in combination with #16
