QuasiDistribution currently has a private class field, _num_bits. This field can be useful in post-processing results, and this private field is currently the only way of retrieving this information from the outputs of Qiskit Runtime Sampler primitive.
Make this field public, so users needing this information may build stable code using this property.
Have discussed with @mtreinish . If you'd like to assign this to me, I could submit something here.
Maybe the reason this class field is private is because it can be unclear just what it represents.
num_bits can represent:
Are we just adding confusion by making this field public if it doesn't even give information about the size of the "register" the bitstrings were sampled from (which I think its name implies)?
As it stands, if the most significant bits are never sampled positively, they are essentially lost.
Since QuasiDistribution is limited in its knowledge of the actual distribution, I think allowing users to pass information about the distribution along in their Sampler experiments via QuantumCircuit.metadata is a more flexible/less destructive approach for now.
Qiskit Aer Sampler primitive already provides information about the size of the distribution, and I believe my particular issue is better resolved in qiskit-ibm-runtime. Closing this issue, as I don't believe the reference Sampler implementation in Qiskit should be handling metadata (at least I don't see that it currently does much/any of that).
