Add a trivial example notebook for the state-to-state optimization in a two-level system
Prerequisite for #13
Small nitpick: can we move the import on top of the introductory paragraph?
More importantly: I think this would be better with a shape function other than a constant 1. There is a flattop function defined in krotov.shapes that you could use to ensure the optimized control is zero at t=0 and t=T.
Also, I added some documentation on how to use nice qm-specific tex macros like \Ket{\Psi} instead of \left\vert\Psi\right\rangle in the example notebooks: https://krotov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#math-in-example-notebooks
Let's use these.
Remarks should be resolved.
That's looking pretty good. I went over it to fix some minor typos etc, and to clarify two issues that I felt were still a bit confusing:
There is one last remaining (indirect) problem with the notebook: there seems to be something wrong with the propagation, because the norm of the state increases (which I noticed from the fidelity taking values greater than 1). For debugging, I'm now printing out the norm in the info-hook. We'll need an independent test (probably in ./tests/test_propagators) to look into this. Could be worth a separate issue.
Actually, it's because the control Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian. I don't think this is what you intended (it's definitely not σₓ).
BTW, QuTiP contains Pauli-Matrices directly, e.g.: http://qutip.org/docs/4.1/apidoc/functions.html#qutip.operators.sigmax
