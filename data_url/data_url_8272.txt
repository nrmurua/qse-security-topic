When using qutip.propagator with unitary_mode='single' and parallel=False, the result does not have the same dims as the Hamiltonian, for other setting it does work.
Minimal example (tested with qutip 4.4.1):
It should be addressed by PR #1153.
The problem seems to be in line 161 of qutip.propagator, here,
the qeye(N) resets the dimensions of H, which up to then retains the correct Hilbert space structure, which should be H.dims[0].
