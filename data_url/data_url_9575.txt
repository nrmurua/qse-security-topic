Right now the SLM mask is drawn as a shaded background on the first pulse of the sequence, with the id of the masked qubits written in the bottom left corner.
One idea would be to show the mask on the register graph as well, highlighting which qubits are masked. The issue is that Register doesn't have access to the SLM mask, only Sequence does. A possible solution would be to add a representation of the register in Sequence.draw, either before or after the sequence itself.
