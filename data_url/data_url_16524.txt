Since the release of numpy 1.19.0 CI started failing on 2 tests:
test_qasm_2q_unitary
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/test/python/circuit/test_unitary.py#L248-L271
and
`test_pulse_limits:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/test/python/pulse/test_pulse_lib.py#L60-L89
It's not clear if this is a bug in numpy or a usage bug in terra. If it's an iss
This is being pinned in CI with #4599
Run the tests with numpy 1.19.0
The tests pass
Find the source of the bug, and fix or report it upstream
The pulse side of the failures should be fixed with: #4613
Ok I've figured out where this is going wrong, but don't have a fix yet. Basically running:
returns U3(0, -pi/4, -pi/4) for qubit 0 on windows with numpy 1.19.0 which causes the qasm tests to fail. While on linux and mac with numpy 1.19.0 it's still returning the correct U3(0, 0, 0). We'll have to figure out where it's going wrong in the decomposition function to fix this, so it is definitely something we should fix before 0.15.0.
