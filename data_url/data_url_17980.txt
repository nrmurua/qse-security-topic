If the API encounters an exception during job submission before a job is actually submitted to the server IBMQJob._future.result() returns None but self._future_captured_exception is not raised. Instead 'error' is checked for in None which raises a different exception and hides the root one inside IBMQuantumExperience.
raise self._future_captured_exception for this case
