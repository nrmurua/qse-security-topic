Hi,
I am trying to parallelize a hybrid network using a gpu, but I'm unsure if TFQ supports gpus yet.  I have seen previous issues that said TFQ does not support gpus but that it was being looked into. Is there any update on that?
GPU support is in progress. You might be able to install it from #759 (although there are some issues I have heard of), but you can see a number of PRs not yet closed in relation to this https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/pulls.
