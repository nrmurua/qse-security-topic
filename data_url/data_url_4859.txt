A similar API as tc.templates.parameterized_measurements, tc.templates.parameterized_measurements(c, structures=[0, 2, 1]) returns $\langle Y_1X_2 \rangle$, and the new API tc.templates.parameterized_local_measurements(c, structures=[0, 2, 1]) is expected to return a tensor as $Tensor([\langle I_0 \rangle, \langle Y_1 \rangle, \langle X_2 \rangle])$.
Similar to parameterized_measurements, but do expectation on each obs instead of obs list, and remember to set reuse=True as default.

@XiaoTailong, I think this feature deserves to be added in the codebase based on our discussion: tensor controlled jittable local expectations
