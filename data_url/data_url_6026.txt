It is possible to use the qasm simulator with 'method': 'density_matrix' to get density matrix results. The tutorial should include an example of this.
This repository is supposed to be archived. @nonhermitian can point to the correct location and format for a user guide on density-matrix simulation.
Actually we need to continue to use this repo for a variety of reasons.
I, and I'm sure many others, find this repo to be far more useful than the highly abstract docs. I would not recommend getting rid of it.
That was never what was going to happen.
I'd like to pick this up if this is something that needs work...
This is now in the aer provider tutorial
