plot_range behaves as expected for values that start at 0.

However when we don't start at 0, the plot becomes unusably small when the numbers get further from 0. For example,

Create a schedule that has pulse lasting up to 800 dt and adjust the plot range to plot from 800 to 850. (as shown in the photos above)
The plot size should not change.

@nkanazawa1989 any ideas?
This is due to channel aliases. The text position should be updated properly. Please assign me if no one volunteered.
