Qrack's overload of the << for 128 bit unsigned integers currently truncates to an unsigned 64 bit integer for printing. Ultimately, this should print 128 bits of decimal.
I marked this TODO, because I'm working on another branch that might make 128 bit QUnit simulation more practically useful. I plan to implement 128 bit decimal printing as part of that.
This was resolved by #252.
