In the device simulator of QuTiP (qutip.qip.device), a quantum computing device is characterized by the class Processor and its subclasses. It contains information about the available control pulses. In addition, a compiler is used to compile a set of universal quantum gates (e.g. RX, RY and ISWAP) into the corresponding control pulses. Together, they can automatically compiler an arbitrary quantum circuit into control pulses, create the time-dependent Hamiltonian representation and run the simulation using QuTiP solvers.
However, in the current version, this compilation is done for each gate sequentially. At each time step, there is only one control pulse active. In practice, it is inefficient because usually several gates can be performed parallelly (e.g. X gate on qubit 0 and qubit 1). To make the compilation more practical, it is necessary to introduce a scheduler that schedules the control pulses. A similar example is https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/pulse.html#schedules.
Describe the solution you'd like
There is existing research (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00023.pdf) on gate-level scheduling. It studies which gates can be performed at the same time. In the most general case, however, gate-level scheduling is not enough, since different gates often have different runtime (.e.g. CNOT usually takes longer time than X gate).
Despite the difference, pulse-level scheduling can be done in a similar way as gate-level scheduling by generating a graph (see the reference above). The difference is that each pulse will have its own duration.
The possible implementation in qutip.qip could be in two steps:
