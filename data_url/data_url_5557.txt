Sampler with shots=None only works if each classical bit is set by a measurement at the end of the circuit.

Sampler should support calculating exact probabilities for circuits with arbitrary measurements
My understanding is that this will not be simple to fix in Aer.  However, I wanted to have an open issue to refer to.  In the meantime, I have created my own Sampler implementation based on Qiskit Terra's Statevector that supports mid-circuit measurements correctly: https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/blob/main/circuit_knitting_toolbox/utils/simulation.py

As you mentioned, we need time to support quasi_dists of a dynamic circuit in Aer. Instead, I think, your ExactSample can use AerStatevector that inherits Statevector of quantum_info.
