In order to make life easier for qsimcirq translations and TFQ translations, would it be possible to implement kraus operators / channels that have one to one functionality with Cirq ?
In python I can just do something like:
and then place it inside of my circuit.
In qsim I can construct channels and kraus ops but it looks like I have to do things kind of by hand with "custom" gates. It would be nice to instead just do:
Much like we do with Cirq's gates in cirq_gates.h.
+1 - this seems like a nice feature to support our C++ qsim users.
In the meantime, Mike, you can take a look at our Cirq-to-qsim translations in PR #287. In particular:
If you need a temporary workaround, you could duplicate portions of those methods for the necessary behavior.
Thx. Left a few general comments on things. I think in our case it'd be worth waiting for a a nice way to create the 1:1 Cirq channels and get this solved. Doing the workarounds on gates back in the day and then moving onto cirq_gates.h once they were added wasn't a ton of fun so I think we might wait until this is in, we're in no rush on this feature for TFQ until there's a clean way to do it :)
