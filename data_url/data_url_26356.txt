When the blue-moon ensemble combines with RESPA, the Lagrangian multipliers are incorrect. The SHAKE Lagrangian Multipliers from RESPA are much smaller than the normal constrained MD.
Hi @jingganglan, thanks for reporting. Were you able to track this down further, ideally to a specific line of code?
I tried to narrow down this issue with Vladimir a few days ago.
It should relate to sr/motion/integrator.F   line 268 and 321
Vladimir's guess is shake/rattle must be applied after first/second multi-force parts in addition to those substeps. And only those to be printed.
Now the RESPA prints the SHAKE Lagrangian for both forces.
@rybkinjr will support referencing the code in more detail.
@rybkinjr any updates on this?
