Currently, the CI is failing on master with macos with py 3.9, seemingly due to qiskit aer deprecation
See the environment details below for the full error message. Not clear why this pops up only in py3.9 mac-os, but we've been informed of this issue happening also locally for notebooks in the research repo.

I believe CI failed due to the fact that a test failed (see here), not because of the PendingDeprecationWarning. The test that's failing is being tracked in #1509.
As you can see in this build (https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/actions/runs/3512731403/jobs/5892663542#step:5:3633) the warnings exist, but CI still passes.
This particular PendingDeprecationWarning cannot be fixed at the moment. Rather it seems to be a warning that a future qiskit version will have a DeprecationWarning which I believe will fail our CI. I'll close this for now, but feel free to reopen if you think something needs addressed that's not tracked elsewhere.
