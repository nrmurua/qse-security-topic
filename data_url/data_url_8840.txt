I get the following warning when compiling stim:
and when running pymatching tests in debug (but not release) mode with the latest stim commit as a dependency, I get the error below. It looks like the warning and address sanitizer might be complaining about the same thing, though perhaps they're separate issues. I think the address sanitization error is an issue with stim rather than pymatching as it doesn't happen if I switch back to stim v1.9.0 leaving everything else the same.
Still getting the address sanitization error in debug mode with commit a2379f1 unfortunately
@oscarhiggott could you check if #488 fixed this?
I just tried again and get a similar error unfortunately:
@oscarhiggott Could you check if this also happens when you run Stim's tests?
If so, could you narrow down which test it is? E.g. use --gtest_filter=... to run half of them and bisect down to just one (ideally one in the mem/ directory as opposed to one in the simulators directory).
