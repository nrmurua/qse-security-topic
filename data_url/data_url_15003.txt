Transpilation should work normally like for a real backend with coupling_map=None and an arbitrary number of qubits.
No idea. But the trace log seems to indicate the issue is with the TrivialLayout pass when coupling map = None. Though that setting coupling_map=None without specifying a backend with the default pm function does work.
I think the issue is the pass manager is initializing a coupling map as CouplingMap(None), and this has size 0, when it should have infinite size.
