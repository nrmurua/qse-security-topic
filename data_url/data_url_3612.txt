Using Mac Os - Python 3.6, homebrew install, pip and my_env.
Ran pyquil-config-setup and pasted in API key
Issue now with running python3 run_quil.py hello_world.quil
Would love to see this working.
Hi @davidccbryant, I noticed you just closed the issue. What was the problem?
I get a similar error  if I edit my .pyquil_config key to an invalid value. Have you confirmed that you did indeed get your user_id and key correct in the config setup script? And is the url value in the config https://api.rigetti.com/qvm?
In any event, it should provide a better error message
@davidccbryant Ok great. If you feel this issue is resolved, please mark it as closed. I will check to see if we have issues for an improved error message if possible, and the missing url during setup.
