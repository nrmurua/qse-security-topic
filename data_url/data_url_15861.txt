When trying to serialize a QuantumCircuit using qpy, I got
The circuit I used:
There are actually 2 bugs here. The first is that initialize takes it's statevector as a single parameter on init but stores it as a list internally. This is why we get the conversion error on complex because every other instruction that takes complex does it as a numpy array as a single parameter. The other half though is with qft (and I think all blueprint circuits from the circuit library) passing the stored parameters to the constructor doesn't build an equivalent circuit object that can be appended to the reconstructed circuit in the deserializer. The only way I could come up with for handling this.  I'll push a fix for this in a few minutes (it might have to wait for 0.18.1 though).
One thing you can do while waiting for the fix to merge is I think if you decompose() both initialize and qft prior to saving the qpy circuit it should work fine. Granted it's not exactly the same but it will at least work around the hard failure (I think).
