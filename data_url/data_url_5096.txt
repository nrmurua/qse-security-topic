We need to introduce the Dry Run feature in XACC/TN-QVM. I believe Thien has already done this in TN-QVM for the direct quantum circuit contraction. The goal is to be able to get the Flop count for a given quantum circuit without actually running it. So, we need to connect XACC to this new TN-QVM feature to allow XACC users to specify the DryRun option instead of the actual run. Alex, what would the best solution be on the XACC side? DryRun is a property of Accelerator, so we need to be able to modify the Accelerator behavior between ActualRun and DryRun (classical resource estimate only).
@tnguyen-ornl isn't this basically already done in your latest PR? Should just be a getAccelerator call with appropriate input heterogeneous map
Should be this right? https://github.com/tnguyen-ornl/tnqvm/blob/tnguyen%2Fsycamore/examples/sycamore/sycamore_circ_contract_flops.cpp#L44
Yea, this feature was implemented in the latest pending PR. We added a special boolean key calc-contract-cost-flops to ask for a 'dry-run'.
Never mind :)
