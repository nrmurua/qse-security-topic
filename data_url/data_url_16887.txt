During Qiskit Camp Asia 19, the group qiskit-community/qiskit-camp-asia-19#4 (@burgholzer, @boschmitt, and @HartwigB) noticed that Layout2qDistance might not be a good way to measure how good a layout is.
The following data was produced with https://github.com/boschmitt/qiskit-terra/blob/benchmarks/circuits.py and compares the scoring with the amount of CXs gates added by StochasticSwap. Note that the correlation is worst in cases where the circuit is small.
An analysis pass with a better correlation between the scoring and the final result might be useful.



The numbers are coming from circuits created with . However, in order to measure the depth better, probably something like this would be better:
@boschmitt mentions that the scoring algorithm should be paired with a specific mapping algorithm. Layout2qDistance is probably good for BasicSwap.
I'm going to close this as completed now - since this issue was active, we've added several new layout methods (including our default Sabre-like implementation), and how we handle layout in the transpiler has been completely overhauled (more than once!).  Layout2qDistance actually isn't even used any more in the preset managers.  Please feel free to re-open if there's more to discuss about it.
