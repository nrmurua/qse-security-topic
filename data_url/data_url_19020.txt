There are quite a few gates used throughout the library which do not have a straightforward representation in native qiskit. This severely limits qiskit and c3-toolset interoperability. This pretty much means these gates can not be intuitively used when one accesses the c3-toolset simulator through the qiskit interface. This applies to gates like rx90p, rx90m, rxp, ry90p etc. These are defined as parametric gates in qiskit but there is non-existent very limited support for parametric gates in c3-toolset. So we need a qiskit compatible definition of these gates.
Ref: 
A qiskit compatible gate library that allows one to easily use the gates mentioned above in qiskit circuits for simulations using both the c3-toolset and the qiskit simulator. These gates should be as much like native gates as possible, allowing for maximum usability in native qiskit circuits. This is usually achievable by making sure all the methods of Gate class work in the inherited custom gates. A new module like c3.qiskit.gates would make it convenient to use them in simulations.
