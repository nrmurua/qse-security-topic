I had installed qiskit-aer package, but it is not detected system-wide.  May I know what steps I have missed ?

Im having the exact same problem since I began updating a few of the libraries.
I have a MacBook Pro running OS Monterrey V12.4
python version 3.9.10
hugodelgado-marti@MacBook-Pro-3 ~ % pip list | grep qiskit
qiskit                    0.37.0
qiskit-aer                0.10.4
qiskit-aqua               0.9.5
qiskit-ibmq-provider      0.19.2
qiskit-ignis              0.7.1
qiskit-terra              0.21.0
Yet I keep getting the error:
MissingOptionalLibraryError: "The 'qiskit-aer' library is required to use 'Aer provider'. You can install it with 'pip install qiskit-aer'."
On ipython I ran the same command and got:
hugodelgado-marti@MacBook-Pro-3 ~ % ipython
Python 3.9.10 (main, Jan 15 2022, 11:48:04)

Someone suggested that the OS system does not have correct lapack or blas libraries.
I am using openblas instead of blas.
Any comments about this ?
I found another post where they recommend installing cmake and scikit-build.
Did the work for me. I also updated several other packages but these two seem to be the culprits.
not for me though, both cmake and python-scikit-build packages were already pre-installed.
can you try to install qiskit-aer with virtual environment?

Please reopen this if you still encounter this issue even if you use virtual environment.
