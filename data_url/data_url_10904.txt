Create the option to set the initial state of the tabu search.
This could speed things up by providing a good starting point if known. Alternatively, this could trap it in a sub-optimal low-energy well. Especially becomes irrelevant if large-scale randomisation is done.
Low priority
Use case of this for me is when comparing or hybridizing different solvers.  For example, in one case I get a set of starting answers from a GA (a method that has a population of candidates), and then aim to tune them up with QBSolv.   Hypothesis being that QBSolv is working ok as a sort of hillclimber, but it is too greedy, and needs a broader set of starting conditions.
