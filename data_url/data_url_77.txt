It will be great to have the exp_paul function take the spin_op as the input or the string form of it. I believe the issue with H.to_string() is that it dumps coefficients and exp_pauli takes pauli words only, but I haven't fully investigated it yet.
In C++, we have H.to_string(/*printCoeffs*/ false);. This just needs to be exposed in py_spin_operator.cpp, although just taking the spin_op as input (with an exception thrown if its more than one term) is cleaner / better.
