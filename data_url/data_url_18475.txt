Currently, the layout algorithm in quilc makes heavy use of "SWAP virtualization": the removal from the quantum program of those SWAPs which can be classically handled by relabeling the logical assignment to physical pieces of hardware. Some users would appreciate selectively disabling this feature, independently at the start and end of the program, so that they can see the full array of SWAPs being used.
