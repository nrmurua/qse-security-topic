Calibration information is lost when using "+"(extend) for a lhs calibrated circuit.
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.circuit.library import RZXGate
from qiskit.pulse import Schedule
qc_cal = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc_cal.rzx(0.5, 0, 1)
qc_cal.add_calibration(RZXGate, (0, 1), params=[0.5], schedule=Schedule())
print(qc_cal.calibrations)
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)
new_circ_cal_on_lhs = qc_cal + qc
print(new_circ_cal_on_lhs.calibrations) #calibration information is lost
new_circ_cal_on_rhs = qc +qc_cal
print(new_circ_cal_on_rhs.calibrations) #calibration information is kept
For the calibrations information to be maintained when making new circuit from "calibrated_circuit+uncalibrated_circuit"
Modify extend function to check and add calibrations from lhs circuit.
Fixed by #5910
Hi @taalexander - this issue still exists even with #5910.   #5910 fixes calibrations that exist in the right hand circuit but not the left.  (The above code should confirm this)
