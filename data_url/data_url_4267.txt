When I try to run the examples using the IBM quantum computer (Instead of the simulation), I always get the following (or similar) error message:
Hi,
This error is probably caused because you have installed ProjectQ via pip which installs the latest version of the master branch. So you should go and run the examples from the master branch as they are compatible with your installed version of ProjectQ (which does not yet have a setup parameter for the MainEngine)
Unfortunately, IBM has changed in the meantime since your latest update of master branch (and hence the latest projectq version on pip) their chip specs: one CNOT goes now the other direction which would cause errors. This is right now being fixed in #231
So your options right now are:
Note:
FYI: #231 and #233 have been merged into the develop branch. So the easiest solution (until the release of version 0.4) is to install the develop version of ProjectQ and then your IBM hardware runs should work fine provided that the queue at IBM is not too long (a new feature handling this is coming soon)
The new release of ProjectQ v0.4 is out. Please install that version and everything should work fine.
