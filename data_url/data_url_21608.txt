Given an ARTIQ experiment (e.g. the SinaraTester class in artiq/frontend/artiq_sinara_tester.py) containing a while loop checking keypress of "Enter" (e.g. see these lines), when the user runs it on ARTIQ commit b257200 or above, the loop seems to stop after a few iterations, while this does not happen before this commit.
Instead of step 4, the LED should blink continuously. Once the user hits Enter, the second LEd (on SFP2) will blink instead.
By git-cloning ARTIQ in step 1, the expected behaviour can be easily reproduced by replacing step 2 with checking out older commits on the local repo.
Here is a simpler experiment that also shows the inability to keep detecting Enter keypress: https://gist.github.com/HarryMakes/f619d195bbfcbc92cf0fc89fb92ea09d
In commits before b257200, e.g. 69f0699, when running this experiment (with artiq_run and a corresponding device_db.py), the current LED will stay on until the user press Enter, which is when the next LED will be lit up and stay on until the user press Enter again and end the experiment.
The reason for this is due to missing type conversion which raise an exception, cannot concat bool to bytearray.
I'm checking if there is any other problems as well.
This patch should be sufficient.
I think we should generate an exhaustive list of RPC with various type for testing... This kind of type error is annoying. I wish there is compile time check :(
Test successful with the change. Thanks for the fix!
