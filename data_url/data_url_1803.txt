Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Part of #3235.
Concise serialization (#3601) is available for Cirq objects, but not yet supported for FrozenCircuit.
Describe the solution you'd like
FrozenCircuit needs the _serialization_key_ magic method to enable efficient serialization. This should be a fairly small code change, but may require nontrivial updates to its JSON serialization test.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
Also part of #3438.
