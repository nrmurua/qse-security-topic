The exception should have been caught in the kernel.
Unable to reproduce: this works as expected.
This is one of the unittests. Could you try
ARTIQ_ROOT=. python setup.py test -s artiq.test.coredevice.rtio.CoredeviceTest.test_pulse_rate
assuming that you have a useful device_db.pyon in .?
Yes, I just did that too and the test passes.
This is pipistrello here. Maybe the first guess (1000 ns) works for you on kc705 already. Could you try reducing that (a lot) so that it definitely underflows?
Ah yes.
Fixed now.
