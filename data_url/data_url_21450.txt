When archiving a dataset using an HDF5 group, the ARTIQ browser can not read the HDF5 file anymore and crashes instead.
Create a HDF5 file with a dataset that contains a group. That can be done by using a '/' in the key of the dataset.
Now open this file using the ARTIQ browser, the program crashes.
This issue was originally posted here: https://gitlab.com/duke-artiq/dax/-/issues/110
No crash and datasets (including groups) are shown correctly.
So the issue is caused by the line for k, v in f["datasets"].items(). This line returns all items in the 'datasets' group of the HDF5 archive. If there are groups within the datasets group, this iterator will return those as h5py.Group objects instead of h5py.Dataset objects.
