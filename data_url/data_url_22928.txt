Hello guys! Quick question from us here at QUANTOP :)  The options "extra_module" and "extra_module_state" in Lockbox are currently not implemented, is that correct? If so, I can happily implement them, but what branch should I use as the base for the change? Because I can't quite see whether the master branch is the most up-to-date at the moment. The develop-0.9.3 seems to work for us, but maybe there's a better option. Thanks a lot!
best use develop-0.9.3, and sorry for the late answer, and thanks for getting involved!
and yes, they are currently only saving the setting, not actually implementing the selected modification.
