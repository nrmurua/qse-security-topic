The method .on_qubits() of circuits does not support measurement gates.
Code to reproduce this issue
I understand that this is a way to protect the user to put measurement gates before any other gate, but since we have already created measurements that work as intermediate steps, this should be changed.
Hi, I have checked what happens if we change to gates.M(0, collapse=True), and it works as expected, so from my side there is no complaint about this issue. We can close it.
The resulting circuit when applying this change is:
