Hello,
I am trying to package python-quantum-blackbird to openSUSE Tumbleweed.
There was a suggesting that code at Visitor.cpp line 262 might have something to do with it.
python3-antlr4-python3-runtime-4.8-1
python3-numpy-1.18.4
python3-sympy-1.6
cmake-3.18.0
doxygen-1.8.18
gcc-c++-10-1
libantlr4-runtime-devel-4.8
antlr-devel-2.7.7
uuid-devel-1.6.2
Full log: https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/home:andythe_great/python-quantum-blackbird/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/x86_64
Thanks
Hi @kevinsmia1939! Note that the C++ portion of Blackbird is currently deprecated and quite outdated. I would recommend only packaging the Python portion.
Thanks for reply, I will drop C++ portion, will the C++ portion be available on the next release?
