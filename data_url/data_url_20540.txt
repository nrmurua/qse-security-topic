After open-quantum-safe/liboqs#1431 landed, liboqsgets built with OpenSSL3 symbols when OpenSSL3 is installed by default on the build platform. In consequence, these symbols cannot be found when building oqs-openssl111 using that liboqs (as these symbols are not present in any OpenSSL111 fork).
--> I'd now strongly urge to declare this fork deprecated as the build becomes somewhat convoluted (or surprising):
Alternatively, liboqs must be built with -DOQS_USE_OPENSSL=OFF -- which I'd call at least "surprising" for a build of oqs-openssl.
Okay, that is getting worse and worse.
Would you be okay with trying to squeeze out one last release of this fork to match the upcoming liboqs 0.8.0 release, and then deprecate it?
Sure. We can (and need to) "resolve" this issue with a documentation update, then.
