The dashboard does not run on current master 3f812c4.
Run artiq_dashboard - the process terminates with the error:
From a bisection, this problem was introduced by d8b1e59
@airwoodix I assume this is working for you, and that you are using the Artiq dashboard? Do you have some divergence in your environment from upstream Artiq?
This looks like you have persistent datasets that are not stored in the new format. Maybe this helps?
Indeed!
The release notes seem a bit misleading here
The internal dataset representation was changed to support tracking HDF5 options like e.g. a compression method. This requires changes to code reading the dataset persistence file (dataset_db.pyon) and to custom applets.
To my mind, what this does not say is that e.g. the artiq_master is no longer compatible with artiq 6 datset_db.pyons. It also doesn't give any guidance as to what a user has to do to their dataset_db to make it compatible.

Agreed, sorry for the inconvenience! Does #1828 look better to you?
