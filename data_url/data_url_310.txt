The cmake files are missing dependencies. Incremental builds thus fail erroneously.
The new config is not installed and the new pass is not run. If tests require the new pass they fail.
The config files should be copied if modified into the build tree.
Not a regression
No response
I think @amccaskey fixed this already?
