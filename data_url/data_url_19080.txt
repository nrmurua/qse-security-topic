Until recently, https://readthedocs.org (RTD) has been the only reasonable option for hosting open source documentation. However, I find their injection of advertisements into the rendered documentation entirely unacceptable.
Also, the way RTD is implemented causes regular headaches: As they do not allow to define arbitrary commands for generating the documentation, there's always a lot of hoops to jump through for anything non-standard. Any errors in the documentation of previous releases are impossible to fix.
Doctr is a recent solution to all these problems: It lets Travis CI build the documentation as part of the automated testing, and then deploys the generated HTML pages directly to the project's Github-pages (the gh-pages branch, which gets hosted at https://<orgname>.github.io/<projectname>.)
We can set up forwarding on RTD to gh-pages, and the SciPost paper already references the gh-pages. Thus, no link breakage should occur by switching from RTD to gh-pages/doctr
