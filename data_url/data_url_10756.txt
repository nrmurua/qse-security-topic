I'm looking for a canonical citation, and I'm probably not the only one. @boothby

I like this suggestion, Andrew.  I'm unsure of what to do for authorship.  The original citation for the heuristic embedding algorithm is due to Cai, McReady and Roy (where the implementation is my butchering of Jun Cai's original); the original citation for the busclique algorithm is due to Boothby, King, and Roy (implementation all mine); there is also original work by Stefan Hannie under my loose direction; and we're working towards including work from the Glasgow group!  Add to that, we've had a handful of people working on CI/build and documentation.
I'm open to suggestion here.
It's a bit tricky because it's on the dwavesystems hub, but I would suggest clearly citing both those papers in the README, and for the repo having yourself as first author, plus whomever you deem appropriate.  Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown!
