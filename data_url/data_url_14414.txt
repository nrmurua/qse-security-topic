Creating a circuit with a Delay instruction with any time unit (for example, "us"), serializing the circuit to a QPY file, then deserializing the circuit results in the deserialized circuit's Delay having a time unit of "dt".
The duration unit for the deserialized circuit should be the same as in the original circuit, "us" in the example above.
QPY currently serializes and deserializes the params of an instruction, and the params currently only include the duration, and not the unit for a Delay. The unit is a separate attribute of the Instruction class. The unit of the duration could possibly be added to the params of a Delay instruction.
Hmm, yeah your proposed solution sounds correct, we'll have to add special case handling for delay to store the  units on the params list. Do you want to have a go at pushing a pr to fix this?
