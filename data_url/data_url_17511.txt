The initial pulse schedule described by (#1919) contained a very basic internal representation (IR) which is insufficiently general to represent conditionals. The PulseSchedule will be enhanced to use a DAG as its internal representation and should inherit from the same base DAG as the DAGCircuit.
Closing as this is not the direction we are heading in. Will update soon with plan for conditionals.
