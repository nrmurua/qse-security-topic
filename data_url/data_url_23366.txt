example data
@jenshnielsen Where can I find the branch in which you are addressing this issue?
There is no branch at the moment. The relevant export functions lives on the dataset branch.
Before Christmas I got as far as doing a simple example in the webui of exporting from the database. But all that code lives in the example. Currently I cannot launch the webui because of the issue that we discussed yesterday that is waiting for a webui fix. The following will do a liveplot in the webui of the data from an experiment

Also, how does the webui know where to look for the JSON file?
