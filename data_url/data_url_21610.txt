Dual EEM Sampler without SU-Servo possible?
Is the dual EEM mode only usable as SU-Servo?
When specifying ports: [8, 9] in contrast to ports: [8] and using artiq_ddb_template, there is now difference in the resulting device_db.
In both cases we get:
thx :)
Yes. For kernels the speed is dominated by the RTIO/CPU overhead, so using two-EEM mode will not help. There are potential other uses for dual-EEM (e.g. RTIO DMA-in) but they are currently unfunded.
@sbourdeauducq semi-related, but how easy would it be to use wide-RTIO channels for inputs as well to provide a faster interface like the one for Fastino?
