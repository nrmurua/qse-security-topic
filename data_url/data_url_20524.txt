Issue first reported in PR #12
A fresh checkout - using the master branch of libOQS - fails the OpenSSH regression tests reporting random looking memory corruption errors. A manual run also does not succeed.
I tried annotating with a few printf's and it seems that the kem structure returned from libOQS contains obviously wrong values.
I need to investigate this further. But this should block any further work on this fork.
This problem will probably go away after discovering the reason for open-quantum-safe/liboqs#420
Resolved by discussion in open-quantum-safe/liboqs#420.
