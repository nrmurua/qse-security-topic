For the QuadraticProgram test it fails for me when I run it PyCharm because of the way the .lp files are accessed where it says test/optim.... etc as path name it assumes the current working folder which may be fine when done from command line. Check out test_driver_hdf5 (chemistry) where it uses get_resource_path to help locate the file relative to the test class. This way, as long as the relative path between the test file and resource stays the same it does not matter what the current working folder is.
