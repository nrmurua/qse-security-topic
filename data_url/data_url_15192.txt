I am trying to run some dynamic circuits (meaning classical conditional operations) on an ibmq backend by following some of the tutorials I have found on this. I am running into a couple of errors - the primary one that is confusing me is that I am trying to test out a very very simple dynamic circuit with just a single qubit and just a single if else statement. The problem is that I can not seem to transpile this circuit - I get transpiler error from the equivalence library. From what I can tell this error is not reported elsewhere, and I also think that my local Qiskit version is up to date. I also think that I am implementing the conditional correctly, for example I am not using the now potentially deprecated qc.x(0).c_if(cr[0], 1).
When I execute the code snippet returns the following error:
No response
this is an issue with the device configuration. Temporarily you may add
to work around this. I will file a bug report.
After further inspection of your code and Auckland the problem is that you are not using the new qiskit_ibm_provider which is required for dynamic circuit access
Please see the documentation here for more information
I tried the following code:
And I got this error: AttributeError: 'IBMQBackend' object has no attribute 'target'
Please see the documentation linked above - you must use the new provider, not IBMQ.
Yep, the module qiskit_ibm_provider fixes all of the problems. And adding the IfElseOp is not required.
