@elrama- @AdriaanRol
The print statement in this driver are pretty interesting!
Is there any reason for https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/instrument_drivers/signal_hound/USB_SA124B.py#L271 ?
I am thinking of replacing  the three print statement with a single log.error with a multi line string!
@giulioungaretti I agree on using logging for these things. My preference would be logging.warning but my guess is you want to build in some logging module for QCoDeS?
In any case @elrama- is on holidays now so I don't expect him to react, but I do remember that he spent some time on these error messages as it took some time to figure out how the driver worked.
Good to see driver improvements happening üëç
@AdriaanRol https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/pull/416/files#diff-227f5982ce997835113c6c7997170267R271 is my proposal :D
If you raise after, it should be an logging.error rather than a warning but that it's more of a decision the driver artist has to make.
Yes you guessed right :D !
