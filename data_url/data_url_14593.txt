When converting an EvolvedOp operator from a Pauli Hamiltonian via PauliTrotterEvolution, the evolved Hamiltonian is not recognized as consisting only of Paulis in certain cases.

PauliTrotterEvolution should simplify the expression as in the following equivalent operator:

Perhaps parsing the summed operators to ensure Paulis are recognized so that more efficient opflow methods can be used.
Thanks. It is difficult to support this in the current design of opflow and quantum_info.
I'm planning to make this possible so that we can support it.
I'm sorry it will be late because it will be after the PauliList refactoring of SparsePauliOp.
Add: As a workaround, explicitly write SummedOp[PauliOp] like.
