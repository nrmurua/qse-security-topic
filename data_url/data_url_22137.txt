Conda now spits this out when installing ARTIQ:
The solution is to use the new noarch system (https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/condas-new-noarch-packages).
But of course, it doesn't always work. Entry points are broken (http://buildbot.m-labs.hk/builders/conda-lin64/builds/310/steps/conda_build/logs/stdio), and usage of setuptools is problematic.
Current status on 3.0:
lit, outputcheck and artiq are difficult to fix due to the above-mentioned entry point breakage.
And rebuilding quamash is also difficult due to the Qt5 packaging mess.
Quamash fixed, it wasn't a mess for once.
Conda entry point breakage is fixed here, but not in releases yet:
conda/conda-build@6aa32e1
All fixed.
Getting pre-link warnings again today with a fresh install on a Windows 7 machine.  I made sure to update conda first, running 4.3.27 py27hcd9d231_0.  The only wrinkle I can think of here is that my root environment from which I am creating the new environment to install ARTIQ is a Python 2 environment, but my impression was that conda ought to be able to handle this.  Full output is below.
The problematic packages (chardet, prettytable, aiohttp) are now in conda-forge, and the conda-forge versions (which do not have the problem) should be used instead of ours. I will move ours into an obsolete label so that conda won't easily find them.
