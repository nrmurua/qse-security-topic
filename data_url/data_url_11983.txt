Encounter below error while trying to do a local build.
Expand to see the detailed error log
my current requirements-dev.txt looks like this based on this #1317 (comment):
Building successfully without error
This happens when we install pydot through pip install pydot and that too through graphviz instead we should install it through conda conda install pydot. This removes the dot error.
pydot itself contains graphviz-2.38 so we can add pydot to requirements-dev.txt
You need to have graphviz installed, it's not a python dependency so you have to install it independently see: https://graphviz.org/download/ for instructions on how to do this
I see! So this is similar to pandoc. I was confused by the documentation of the python interface package of the same name https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html
