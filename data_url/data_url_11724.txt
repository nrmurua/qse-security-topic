When running VQE with COBYLA as optimizer, convergence messages are not shown, even when setting disp to True.
Display a snapshot of energy and parameters in every iteration of the optimizer.
Looking at the code of cobyla: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/optimize/cobyla.py
The function _minimize_cobyla sets iprint to either 0 or 1, depending on the value of the Boolean parameter disp. When I interfere with cobyla code and hard code iprint to be equal to 3, I see the information that I'm looking for. However there is no way for a caller of  _minimize_function to control iprint from outside and set it to 2 or 3.
The desired functionality can be obtained by using parameter callback of VQE.
disp is to see the internal operation of the optimizer and using the common scipy minimise as you see its either False or True. This ends up printed to console. Some people want to see internal behavior to get a better understanding of behavior of the optimizer on the problem. Now I see the fmin function has a disp and has values of 1 thru 3. It could be possible to switch COBYLA optimizer in Aqua over to calling fmin (we had this for L_BFGS since we could access function that was wanted).
If however you are simply looking at the parameters and cost function value, which are available in a common way outside of any optimizer via the callback functions we have on variational algorithms, which seems to be your expected behavior as indicated above, then it seems there is no issue as such. Here is a notebook that shows callback use https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-community-tutorials/blob/master/aqua/vqe_convergence.ipynb though of course you can do anything with the values such as store in file etc.
Whether we want at some point, to avoid what we seems to be some limitation of minimise, and use fmin directly, I guess depends whether the information at level 3 is of of value for users of COBYLA that want to see its internals. I think this issue could be closed at present since your expected behavior is already satisfied by Aqua
Thanks for the answer, closing.
