qiskit-terra: 0.20.0
QuantumCircuit objects sort their list of parameters alphabetically by the parameter names, and AFAICT this is not documented. I think it would help to point it out on the assign_parameters and bind_parameters documentation, and maybe on the QuantumCircuit page.
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters.html
I'm bringing this up because the behavior seems surprising given that circuit.parameters kind of looks like a list, but does not preserve order of insertion like a list. Clueless users like me then assume assign_parameters() will, when given a list of values, bind those values to the parameters in order of insertion. This assumption leads to trouble that's tricky to notice, diagnose, and fix. (E.g., ParameterVector('angles_11') gets bound with the values intended for ParameterVector('angles_2') )

That's a very good idea! We should also add it in QuantumCircuit.parameters while at it ðŸ™‚
