DWaveSampler converts edges to remove duplicates:
self._edgelist = sorted(set(tuple(sorted(edge)) for edge in self.solver.edges))
So when users look at coupler/edges in cloud-client:
with Client.from_config() as client:
...:     solver = client.get_solver()
...:     print(len(solver.edges))
...:     print(len(solver.couplers))
...:
11806
11806
They get different numbers from when they look in dwave-system:
from dwave.system.samplers import DWaveSampler
len(sampler.edgelist)
5903
len(sampler.properties['couplers'])
5903
I expect this will confuse some users. What's the motivation for this difference? If it's needed, it should at least be noted ... somewhere
