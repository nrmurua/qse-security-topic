Describe the bug
operator-ket's superrep is None at creation.
But Qobj.__matmul__ set the superrep of the output to the one of the left Qobj.
Thus super-operator @ operator-ket result  in an operator-ket with superrep != None.
Some operations, such as addition, cannot be done between object with different superrep.
To Reproduce
the last operation result in a TypeError.
