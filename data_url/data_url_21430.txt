We would like to use artiq on Windows without conda (which makes package management difficult since both pip and conda are available and often necessary). However, this is currently blocked by the llvm-tools requirement, which is only available through conda. llvm has binary packages for Windows (https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases), but they do not contain the llvm-addr2line program which is used in 
I would like to change the usage of llvm-addr2line to llvm-symbolizer, which is available with the llvm binary packages. Since llvm-addr2line is an alias of llvm-symbolizer, the problem can be resolved with little code change: See master...Jayich-Lab:artiq:mf/llvm-addr2line-to-llvm-symbolizer. If this change looks good, I can raise a PR for it.
If there is another way that we can resolve the problem (using artiq on Windows without using conda), please let me know too.
If changing to llvm-symbolizer doesn't lead to incompatibilities on any platform (please test: Linux/Nix, Windows/Conda, Windows/MSYS2) then we can just do it.
