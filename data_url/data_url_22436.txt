I can see the DDS and TTL panels that display the status of the various DDS' and TTLs on my Linux virtual box but not on Windows. I can however, change the frequency of the DDS on windows and the updated frequency shows up on the virtual box GUI. Is there something I have to do to activate the DDS and TTL panels on windows?
