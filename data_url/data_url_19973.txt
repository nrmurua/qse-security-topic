https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/dbelyavs/liboqs-draft/build/5499498/ is an attempt to build 0.7.2 with the patch from #1377
As a quick workaround, would the build pass if you disable HQC (-DOQS_ENABLE_KEM_HQC=OFF as cmake argument)? At worst until we resolve #1319.
I'm not in a hurry, for (semi)production purposes I would anyway just disable -Werror.
If you are aware of this problem, feel free to close this issue.
Current main branch enables -Werror when a special variable is set.
Thank you! Closing.
