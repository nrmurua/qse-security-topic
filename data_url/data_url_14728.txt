The duration for a channel is now reported the same as its stop time. I believe this should be stop_time - start_time to actually be the duration.

@ajavadia Can I work on the issue?
I went through the code base and found that there have been certain tests written in test_schedule.py for sched.ch_duration(). I have to modify them also right?

yes the tests will have to change to reflect the new behavior. also a release note is required to document the change.
