Hello,
(this is all using branch pyrpl-developer-0.9.3)
I am currently trying to open PyRPL in Vivado 2015.4 in order to view the block diagrams and eventually make FPGA changes for what I am working on. However, I am running into some difficulty when doing this. The steps I have taken are:
a project is generated but no block diagrams are shown (Open block design button is grayed out)
Lastly, if I wanted to begin to edit the FPGA code, can you give advice on what is the top level module file from where I should begin.
Thank you for your help.

Everything is explained here and the links therein: https://pyrpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/fpga_compilation.html
I only use the command-line mode, never open the Vivado GUI. But I think that is possle too, just cannot support you with this.
The top-level fpga module is contained in pyrpl/fpga/rtl/red_pitaya_top.v.
@anyone who uses the Vivado GUI, anything to help getting that up would be appreciated here.
