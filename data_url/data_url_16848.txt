As @taalexander astutely pointed out, it makes more sense for the transpiler to accept individual properties rather than a monolithic BackendProperties. For example readout_errors, cx_errors, gate_durations, etc, etc. This would be in the same vain as how it currently accepts basis_gates and coupling_map, rather than BackendConfiguration.
Of course transpile(circuit, backend) would still work, but now we would be allowed to override specific properties.
This should be done after #3035. It applies to the NoiseAdaptiveLayout pass and the CrosstalkAdaptiveSchedule pass.
So essentially, the goal is to allow the direct passing of the parameters in BackendProperties init method to the transpiler?
I'm not positive I still agree with this earlier sentiment as the Backend has evolved to be a representation of a target machine for Qiskit (not the transport representation it once was). Perhaps this should be closed now @ajavadia?
Ah ok, I'm just looking around for good first issues.
âœ… As mentioned above, there have been significant changes in the code structure as to what Backend signifies now! If OP does not have an update on the same, we can safely close this issue! ðŸ˜„
Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
At the very least, this issue is somewhat superseded by work on BackendV2, and we have other trackers for how we want to handle transpilation with respect to those backends (the main one being #7113).  I'll close this in favour of #7113.
