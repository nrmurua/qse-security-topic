As part of our larger move towards more dynamic circuits, Erick (@ewinston) has been upgrading various transpiler passes to support the control-flow operations IfElseBlock, ForLoopOp and WhileLoopOp.  These features aren't completely or stable yet, so we're not publicising them in the release notes in 0.21.  This issue is a tracking issue for the next milestone, to remind us to write and publish them.
