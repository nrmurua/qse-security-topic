A new version 1.16 of numpy  was released recently, which resulted in a number of linter warnings that might hint towards incompatible changes.
In #1678 the version was pinned to <1.16, to give us time to investigate further and take the appropiate actions - the release notes might give some good hints.
Closed with #1848
