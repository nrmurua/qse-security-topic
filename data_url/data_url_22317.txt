is it possible to make a single alias in the device_database for e.g. multiple ttl channels?
How is that supposed to work? Toggle all TTLs at the same time?
And what about inputs?
yes, that was the idea.
We often have the situation that we need to turn many TTLs on at the same time.
In older systems that was often solved with a bit mask, so you could just add up the ttl channels and toggle them together. I see that that's not possible here, but it would still be nice to have something similar on the low level.
if i want to do this right now i need to do a setattr_device for each physical channel and then a pulse for each of them, with parallel. is that correct?
we used to do this with inputs and outputs. I don't know how to deal with that in the current framework.
You can create a class that contains methods that toggle the multiple TTLs. Something like:
or:
How is an input from several TTLs supposed to work?
