There's an error if one of the standard deviations is zero
eg
ValueError: Residuals are not finite in the initial point.
See a fix in #34.
curve_fit gets a parameter called sigma (which in our case is 'std'), which "determines the uncertainty in ydata" (see: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html).
There was an error since in the curve_fit code one calculates 1/sigma, and if one of the values in sigma is 0, you see the error above.
The suggested solution is to define Sigma as 'None' if one of the values in std is zero (sigma is an optional parameter - the default is None).
