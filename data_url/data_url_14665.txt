In qiskit the plotting of schedules to matplotlib figure windows happens in a new window by default. Can we modify the interface so the user can specify which window to plot to?
For example the qiskit.pulse.schedule.Schedule has a draw method, which calls the qiskit.visualization.pulse_drawer, which calls the _matplotlib.WaveformDrawer.draw which has the code
This would be modified to
where figure_number should be passed along the different methods. Alternatively, instead of the figure number or handle the matplotlib axes could be passed.
(this feature request holds for other types of plotting as well)
