After a simple profiling of a covalent example, it was found that almost 98% of the total time (to dispatch) was spent in get_serialized_function_str inside which, It seems like getting imports is main the culprit. We need to modify/move this function so that dispatching a job doesn't take a long time when a lot of electrons are involved.
Example used for profiling:
Time taken to dispatch ~ 2-3 minutes
Afterwards the following in covalent/_shared_files/utils.py : get_serialized_function_str was commented out,
Then the time taken gets reduced to ~ 0.005 seconds
This issue blocks the PR #66 as it will most likely amplify the impact.
