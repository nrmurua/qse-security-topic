Also we need a better error message mentioning what types of gates we take, rather than just "that's not an xmon gate".
Perhaps also (2-qubit) subclasses of KnownMatrixGate?
Is it ever worth it to define a decomposition of a two-qubit KnownMatrixGate, or is the matrix decomposition procedure implemented optimal in some sense?
The matrix decomposition is optimal in terms of CZ cost, but not optimal in terms of human readability. There's no need to define a decomposition if you've defined a matrix.
