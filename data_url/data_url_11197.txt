I have some code which looks like this:
which measures the X & Y expectation values of qubit 0 and 1 and multiplies them with the coefficients named disc_weights[0] & disc_weights[1] respectively. How do I get a matrix representation of this?
You can use the 'get_sparse_operator' function and then cast to dense:
from openfermion import get_sparse_operator
matrix = get_sparse_operator(psi).todense()
