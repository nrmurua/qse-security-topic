I tried this example code snippet :   from here
`from pyquil.paulis import ID, sX, sY, sZ
a = 0.5 * ID
b = -0.75 * sX(0) * sY(1) * sZ(3)
c = (5-2j) * sZ(1) * sX(2)
sigma = a + b + c
print("sigma = {}".format(sigma))`
I get error with the
a = 0.5 * ID line  the following :
##TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'float' and 'function'.
Can't understand why ? Any idea ?
That link is to an outdated version of the pyquil docs for pyquil 1.9. The latest pyquil version is 2.19.0. Probably ID was changed from a variable to a function at some point. The corresponding docs for the current version can be found here:
http://docs.rigetti.com/en/v2.19.0/advanced_usage.html#pauli-operator-algebra
where the example in question has changed to (note that parenthesis after ID):
perfect, thanks. works
Probably the best place for these kinds of questions is on the public Rigetti Slack workspace.

I'm actually not that familiar with forest-benchmarking or grove. If you don't get a response on slack by early next week, you might consider opening an issue in the forest-benchmarking repo.
