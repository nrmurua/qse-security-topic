At this stage it's not clear if this is an issue with hypotesis (an upstream bug) or specific to the way we use mypy
Worked around in #1163
We should wait for HypothesisWorks/hypothesis#1359 to be fixed before investigating further. That bug seems to at least be part of the issue.
This has been fixed in a later hypothesis release
