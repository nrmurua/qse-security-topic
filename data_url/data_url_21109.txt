But when i start the node i get:
:~/QRL# python start_qrl.py
dependencies not satisfied, run [pip3 install -r requirements.txt] first.
The 'pyqrllib>=0.1.20' distribution was not found and is required by the application
You are installing with pip3 (python 3) and running with python (python 2).
use python3 start_qrl.py instead
python (python 2) does not find the package, because it does not exist for python 2.
I agree that we could show an error saying Python2 is not supported or similar
:~/QRL#  python3 start_qrl.py
dependencies not satisfied, run [pip3 install -r requirements.txt] first.
(pyasn1 0.1.9 (/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages), Requirement.parse('pyasn1<0.4.0,>=0.3.4'), {'pyasn1-modules'})
Ok, that is different...  something is looking for pyasn1..
I will keep this open for investigation.
if you want to move forward, run pip3 install pyasn1
which operating system are you using?

Oke, so i reinstalled that pip package and node started without any problems.
Fixed.
Yes, you were using 0.1.9 and I locally have 0.3.6
Probably I should have asked you to upgrade.
pip3 install -U pyasn1
