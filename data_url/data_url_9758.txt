Description
bqm offsets are not appearing in .coo files
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
the file should look like:
but it looks like:
Environment
Would be pretty straightforward to add another header line,
or
unless there was a particular reason you wanted it on it's own line like above?
On it's own line it looks a bit more like it's part of the problem's weights. But I don't know if this could mess with the parsing in older dimod versions.
FWIW, I like @pau557's suggestion. The next logical step is to generalize it to store one polynomial term/coefficient per line:
Then BinaryPolynomial could use it as well.
Obviously, that would not be the COO anymore. ðŸ¤£
If we want to keep calling it COO, the only option, IMO, is to store it in a header. In which case, header output should default to true if offset != 0. (Also if vartype != binary.)
