Currently the conversion cuts off just before those sections start in docstrings, to avoid interacting with Napoleon too much.
This is a bit vague, but my guess is that this is a task to make convert_markdown_mathjax_for_rst from docs/conf.py to work with the code the that the Napolean extension (Google docstrings) has processed i.e.  the code that is skipped here 
This is for sphinx originally - the devsite works well. Closing.
