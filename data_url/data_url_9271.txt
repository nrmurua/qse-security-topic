In discretize, the general version of the code has a hard time when discretizing functions with discontinuities.
Describe the solution you'd like
The function should be able to detect discontinuities and treat them appropriately, like how the code treats piecewise constant functions.
A possible solution would be a better symbolic waveform engine that will hint at where such discontinuities can exist.
