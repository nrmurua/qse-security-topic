quilc now (post-PR210) supports an ISA format which is more expressive in desired gateset and which associates fidelity information directly to individual gates. This isn't necessary for continued interoperation of pyQuil and quilc, but it will provide users substantially improved flexibility. Modify the ISA serialization code to aim for this new target (cf. pyquil/device.py:44 , and perhaps a wrapper over TargetDevice in pyquil/api/_compiler.py:24 ).
