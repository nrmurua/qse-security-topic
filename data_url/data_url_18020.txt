Stop statevector simulators from requiring that the user provides the number of shots.
@chriseclectic is this done. If so can you close
The current behaviour of the statevector simulators is to always set the shots to 1, regardless of the user specified number of shots, and adds a message to the logger if the input shots is != 1.
Then this is closed.
