Hi,
In the source code of mesolve, the derivative are defined via L * rho where L is Liouvillian. But when the size is too large, L is of huge dimension. I have two questions:
I am not sure what you mean by too large. The dimensions are not really the issue. It is the number of nonzero elements that matter.
I am also puzzled by evolution using only collapse operators. Anytime you evolve a system you need the Hamiltonian. The Liouvillian has both coherent and dissipative terms in a single operator.
Hi Paul,
Sorry let me clarify.
Thank you.
The Liouvillian is defined via equation #3.  I think your asking is it better to make a single operator, or take each term in equation #3 separately.  If that is your question then the answer is yes, building the Liouvillian is much better.

Hi Paul,
It seems by direct multiplication is faster than defining the Liouvillian in small problem size. They give the same result. I do not know if this is the case in general for small problem size. (maybe possible improvement if it is)
