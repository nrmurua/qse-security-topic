I'm trying to draw the following simple circuit with LaTex

However, the output is empty when I pass the option output='latex'.
The problem is only present with the Initialize gate. Also, the problem is not present for different numbers of quantum/classical registers, e.g. the circuit is drawn correctly if one quantum register is removed.
Run the following code in JupyterLab
For example if we remove one quantum register, the circuit is rendered correctly. Try
Using the following Qiskit version (the one from the IBM Quantum Lab):
I'm able to get the drawing you're having trouble with:

It probably has something to do with you using 0.17.1.
The problem was indeed the outdated package, thanks.
