According to google scholar, reading among those papers that cite the Mitiq white paper and use Mitiq, it turns out that several of them have used Mitiq's ZNE for quantum simulation toy models and tests on hardware. See a screenshot from a slide, below, for a summarized view. Given this fact, it seems like to me that adding to the documentation, in the examples section, one tutorial (or more) about quantum simulation with Mitiq would prove useful.

Add a tutorial about quantum simulation to the documentation. One could even reach out to the authors of such papers if they wish to provide a tutorial.
Some loose ideas for a specific tutorial:
See among papers citing and using Mitiq https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=1985661232443186918&as_sdt=5
There is one example about the simulation of a simple Hamiltonian energy (without a VQA approach).
Hi @nathanshammah I am a new contributor to mitiq. This issue could be a hands-on-learning assignment for me to learn more about mitiq. I would love to work on it.
Reopening this because there are still some tutorials that could be added and the wrong issue was closed previously.
@tinaoberoi This issue has multiple sub-issues. Would you like one of the sub-issues to be assigned to you? Feel free to comment on that particular one.
