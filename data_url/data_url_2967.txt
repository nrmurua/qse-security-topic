Let me know if this sounds okay ?
Any other suggestions also welcome.
Sure that sounds fine. I recommend using one of the QFT implementations that runs on a grid, if possible.
These needs to be done in the next few weeks. @iamvamsi , when are you planning to have this done?
Craig, sorry for the delay. You can expect the commits in a day or two.
@Strilanc : Added the qft on grid. Please review for comments.
Also I seem to getting error
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'examples.quantum_fourier_transform'
when running examples_test.py on my local set up.
python quantum_fourier_transform.py is working fine producing the output mentioned in the comments.
Are you running the tests with the repo root in your python path?
(If not, you may accidentally be testing against an installed version of cirq instead of the source code.)
Yes, I am doing it. Thanks @Strilanc :)
Another question I have is regarding the linearity (or planarity).
I defined qubits using XmonQubit method with params (0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1)
I assume this structure on lattice:
(0,0)-------(0,1)
|                    |
|                    |
(1,0)--------(1,1)
Please correct me if I am wrong here.
This leads me to assume (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) and (1,0) are linear.
Yes, that's the correct structure.
I'm not sure what you mean by "linear". The pairs of coordinates are integer points on the plane, and two points are adjacent if their distance is exactly one.
Makes sense.
Need to make small changes and I'll submit it finally.
