Updated CI nightly design https://www.notion.so/Executor-Plugin-CI-5c702cfe221f4b11be23a148e4551a78#e8305b6d492748e78fcfa8b3483dc520
Acceptance criteria
 Curate a stable environment to run performance benchmarks on nightly (ubuntu 20.04 only, more can be added later)
 Update the stress tests to report results in a uniform manner so that they can be post-processed afterwards
 Run load tests and generate results
 Sketch out high level nightly benchmark pipeline in order to clearly layout the distinct stages, workflow, artifacts and archival
 Generate concise reports (pdf?) from nightly runs (performance stress tests and load tests) that can be assessed at a later date
