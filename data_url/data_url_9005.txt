I would like to act a random two-qubit gate (generated using stim.Tableau.random(2)) on a given state which is an instance of TableauSimulator class. I noticed that in the developing version documentation, there is a method do_tableau which seems to do the exact task I want. Since we do not have the access to developing version at this point, is there any alternative way to do this? Many thanks!
You can extract the underlying tableau state and apply to that as in https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/a/26913/119
