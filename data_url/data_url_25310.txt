Bugs
 Clicking on page numbers >=11 seem to be throwing "Please contact adminstrator error"
 Total dispatcher time showing wrong number (For ex - says 4 days even though it was deployed <1 day ago)
 Runtime is counting down for workflows in the running state
 The terminal feature does not seem to work in a self-hosted deployment, where the covalent service is running as root. Error given below.

ENVIRONMENT SETUP
We are using this as a testbed to see how Covalent performs in a single-instance configuration on the cloud, in part to test the HPC backend.  You can use the tools there to reproduce some of the errors I mentioned earlier.  The repo contains two important parts:
1.covalent-ec2-ami contains a Makefile which is used to create an AMI for Covalent using Ansible and Packer.  This starts Covalent as a systemd service on boot and also includes many of our plugins.
2.covalent-ec2-server contains a terraform script as well as several modules, used to deploy both the server (using the AMI) and backend infrastructure required to test plugins.  Largely those additions are IAM.  One of the near-term additions will include the addition of an nginx server, so that we can use a systemd template and load-balance requests to N copies of the Covalent server.  The goal here is to see how far we can push this in the context of SaaS Alpha.
Deployment commands :


At the moment the event loop gets overloaded around 5 concurrent users but it's only single-threaded application, so we hope that using systemd templates would allow us to take advantage of all cores on something like a 32-core instance, then support ~100 users.
