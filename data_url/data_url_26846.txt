When building CP2K with support for SIRIUS, I get the following when running cp2k --help:
@mtaillefumier unfortunately this only happens when building CP2K with SIRIUS support.
this is with SIRIUS v6.1.5 and libvdwxc v0.4.0 and CP2K  9b85492
I will have to find a way to fix it. XC_FUNCTIONALS should take a list of strings but I do not know how to do that with the cp2k parser. It has no implication though since I use the cp2k XC_FUNCTIONAL information instead.
@mtaillefumier In the section &GENPOT for PARAMETERS a list of words (strings) is read/parsed. See line 1354 in input_cp2k_mm.F

Hi, is this problem solved already? (I want to ask before doing a very annoying process of update on offline cluster...).
This error breaks codes using the cp2k_shell server, since those expect to receive only " * READY" line upon startup, such as in ASE CP2K calculator.
Thank you!
fixed by this pull request. #877
