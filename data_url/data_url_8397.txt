Current 106 tests are failing. All seeming 'Metrics' test.
All failing with:
I will try and reproduce locally
I have managed to reproduce.
It would that conda is currently installing an openblas version of numpy even when mkl version is set. I guess this is a mistake by Anaconda that they will fix soon. Probably because they rushed the fix for #871
This means that the 'metrics' tests with "known issues" are not skipped.
What does not make sense is why the 'NOMKL' tests are failing.
Some questions:
The "known issues" are definitely still there. They cause whatever dnorm does using cvxpy to fail, just through having mkl as a conda package. test_metrics uses the qutip.settings.has_mkl to determine whether to skip the dnorm tests. This however is False whenever blas_info is not mkl, mkl could still be installed.
The main issue causing these errors though is that cvxpy.Variable and cvxpy.Parameter expect the first arg to be a tuple with dimensions. We are passing num_rows, num_cols is two args. Who knows how this has happened - cvxpy changed its interface?
As far as the "known issues" go, these are discussed in #484.
I don't think the issues I saw recently  are the same as in that one.
I think this is just an MKL install problem.
It's difficult to test at the moment, as I don't seem to be able to create a conda env with mkl blas
