Good to see this Prof Stebila. Just curious, is the first PQ sig scheme supported going to be XMSS?
I am guessing yes, judging from the code I see in the branch.
Hi. If you are referring to the XMSS scheme already in the OpenSSH-Portable repo, then this is a separate project, disjoint from the effort by OQS. That XMSS code is added by the OpenSSH developers.
The supported algorithms will most likely include all the signature schemes supported by libOQS.
Got it. Thank for the quick response @himsen  , I appreciate it.
I probably should not be asking this question in this repo, but liboqs seems to only include picnic and qTesla currently. Are you aware if other sig algorithms coming soon in liboqs?
@dstebila would be the person to answer that :)
I just noticed this issue! I hope my PR #22 doesn't conflict with some of your work in progress
Fixed by #22
