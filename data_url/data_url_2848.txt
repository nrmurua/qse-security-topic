Currently MergeInteractions only optimizes a series of one- and two-qubit gates if two or more of those gates are two-qubit gates.  This works as intended for circuits with CZ gates because MergeInteractions can't improve a sub-circuit with a single CZ.  This gives unexpected results for circuits with other two-qubit gates like the YXXY gate because it only decomposes it if it is next to another two-qubit gate on the same qubits.
