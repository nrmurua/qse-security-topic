Using visitor pattern to implement the CNOT -> XX decomposition in IonTrapTwoQubitPass IRTransformation
to improve code readability and maintainability.
e.g., decompose 2-qubit gates into CNOT gates then revisit, etc.
Hi, i'd would like to work on this issue as an assignee ;  i have started the coding using the gitpod environment, following the vistor pattern;   i'm currently looking at how totest the new code..
Thanks @stevescia. I've assigned this to you. There is an existing test for this feature.
Thien, I have the basics of the visitor pattern implemented and the unittests pass.
I am seeing that the cnot visitor is being triggered by the "XX" instruction, leading to additional instructions being added to the composite..  not sure if this is a bug, or an expected side offect of the visit instructions inside AllGateVisitor.hpp for the xx gate.  please advise if something can be impl'd to avoid this trigger.
i worked around the above with a name check, in the CNOT visitor like:
