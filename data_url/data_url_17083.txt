As of this morning, import qiskit has the following stack trace:
>>> import qiskit
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
File "/Users/lia.yeh/Documents/qiskit-terra/qiskit/init.py", line 23, in 
from . import util
File "/Users/lia.yeh/Documents/qiskit-terra/qiskit/util.py", line 23, in 
from marshmallow.warnings import ChangedInMarshmallow3Warning
[... stack trace continues within marshmallow]
Did this break this morning for anyone else?
import qiskit succeeds
Remove lines 23 and 56-60 of qiskit-terra/qiskit/util.py
Seems to be only when I import qiskit from command line within a directory in qiskit, so I'm closing this issue.
