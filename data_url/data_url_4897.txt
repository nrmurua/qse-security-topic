Currently, QuEST has some overzealous validation which will demand the user's numerical inputs are precise in their required properties. For example, that the user's input unitary matrix has unitarity up to machine-epsilon.
This can currently be changed by the user, by redefining REAL_EPS, e.g.
Is there a more elegant way to handle this (even just a rename of REAL_EPS)
