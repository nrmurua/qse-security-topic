Hi! I'm considering doing a little benchmark of the post quantum ciphers in a openssl playground (mainly kex & signature algorithms). I've tested the command line server that comes with the openssl server and generated a self signed certificate with the pq signature of choice. I could connect to this server via the  openssl s_client tool, which lets you specify with the -curves parameter the  algorithm. This option is not available with the s_time command, very handy when benchmarking TLS connections. How do I specifically force a KEX algorithm in the test server/client connection with s_time. Are there any workarounds that you might know?
Thank you!
Hi Ricardo, I haven't tried the s_time command so I am not sure how it works.  We haven't explicitly enabled or tested PQ support in s_time.  If you look at it and can let us know what needs to change or want to submit a patch to that effect, we'd be happy to have it.
The -curves parameter is available with the openssl s_server command, so why not use that to drive the test?
For example, this command pair performs a KEM=kyber512 perf test:
OK, you have to start the server with another KEM each time, but it's a quick workaround.
Available via this (PR #155) and this
