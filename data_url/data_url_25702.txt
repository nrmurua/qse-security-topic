To summarize, the changelog_reminder workflow fails because it can edit the PR, but Github only gives actions read-only access to PRs created from forks.
@cjao we have a new bug on this action
https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/runs/6727761730?check_suite_focus=true
I expect it's because the action is still trying to run in the fork so it doesn't have access to secrets in our account ðŸ˜¢
I agree (just learned about how secrets work). Let's try the pull_request_target trigger approach.
