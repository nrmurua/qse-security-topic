Hi!
I am integrating liboqs into another project where I am heavily relying on CMake's *Config.cmake files via find_package(), whenever that's possible for my dependencies.
Since liboqs has switched to CMake for building, I am wondering if you are planning to support mentioned configuration files.
These would also greatly benefit the packaging for various GNU/Linux Distributions, where liboqs could be installed via the global package manager.

Is this feature on your schedule?
As the project is still at an experimental stage (see this), we currently have no plans of adding liboqs to Linux package managers. That being said, adding a ProjectConfig.cmake for other purposes is certainly something I intend to look into.
Could you try checking out this commit and seeing if find_package() works for you?
Thank you for your effort @xvzcf!
The cmake configuration files where created and installed without requiring any change of the build scripts.
However, two problems occured:
1: I wasn't able to find the module via find_package
The configuration file was deployed in /usr/lib/cmake/oqs/liboqsConfig.cmake
The command fails analogously, when searching for liboqs.
According to the documentation, the correct pattern has to be of the form of <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/cmake/<name>*/
Changing the DESTINATION property of the config export to  ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}/cmake/liboqs fixes the problem.
2: The installation destination for the public header files was changed
I am not sure, if this was done on purpose, but I can not build the example executable  stated in the wiki.
Reverting the change fixed the issue.
This is the minimum example CMakeLists.txt I used:
main.c is  https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Minimal-example-of-a-post-quantum-KEM
And the patch to get it to work:
Closed by #840
