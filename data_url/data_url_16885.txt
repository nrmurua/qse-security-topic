Aqua travis is failing due to missing library "seaborn":

Just add the statement: "from qiskit.execute import execute"
Seaborn should not be required since it is part of optional visualization feature
Do not throw exception if seaborn is not present.
It is imported in the has matplotlib block, and listed as part of the same visualization extras package.
The recent gate_map.py change seems to hinge on a single flag as to whether matplotlib is installed and if set assumes it can import seaborn. So if a system has matplotlib installed, but not seaborn, as they installed matplotlib but not via the Terra visualization option on pip install, which gets other stuff including seaborn, then things fail as reported. So if they have matplotlib but do not even use Terra visualization this would end up forcing such a user to install seaborn too.
Yeah I think we need to revisit the optional import blocks in gate map this same thing actually has been blocking the benchmarking runs at https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit the benchmark runs have all been failing with a seaborn import error since #3508 merged and no updates have been pushed.
