Given a results object that comes from the execution of a list of quantum circuits, the retrieval of the results for the different circuits does not work for
for qc in qc_list.
Fetch the results corresponding to the individual quantum circuits.
This issue arises from assign_parameters returning QuantumCircuit instances with the same name. There is an open (but stalled) PR with a possible fix #3775 .
Thanks I see.
