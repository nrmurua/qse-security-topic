Could you fix it? Thank you!
Hi Alaric,
It looks like the issue might be the default encoding on your system, see this relevant bug report: facebookresearch/DrQA#31
By default, Python 3.6 should be using unicode encoding, but it looks like your system is using ASCII. What is the output of the following command?
Thanks for reply. The output is utf-8.
Actually, I was using the ubuntu docker image, which might be relavant to this problem. Then I changed to use ubuntu on a virtual machine, and it worked. So personally, this problem has been solved, and you can feel free to close this issue. Though others might need a solution.
Thanks again!
