Related to my last comment in #78.
From the user perspective, this is an important issue and will determine how effective users actually use the code.
The docstrings of functions have to somehow magically go through the processes stuff, but it is actually needed for all important things in the notebook, at any point, I as a user want to do shift tab and see what that function does.
The same goes for available arguments, I only figured out that update=True exists for the snapshot by digging through the code on my way to figure out where to implement it, we cannot expect this from a regular user.
Are they not? I use this on a daily basis in QCodes, or is this related to the recent change in using the servers to host instruments? If so then I'd say this is quite a big usability issue.
No, i.e. station.snapshot(<shift><tab>) shows me *args, **kwargs

I would have never figured out that update=True existed without digging through all the code, including the multiprocessing.
Maybe something like this is what we need, or the one that is linked to in the header. Might not work with that remote stuff, but for a lot of other things.
It would also be nice to have the arguments, a lot of *args and **kwargs are in the code, which doesn't help the user a lot.
This is probably been fixed along the way.
Qcodes had a *args, **kwargs abuse problem that we fixed little by tittle.
@MerlinSmiles  you fixed it (8926f45)
