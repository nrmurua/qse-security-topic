Describe the bug
I am quite confused about the example of grover algorithm in maximum_search_constant_mpi.py
Screenshots

Additional context
The 'num1' is the shallow copy of num so when the 'num1' list being modified, the 'num' list will be modified too. Therefore the X gates that come after didn't apply on the circuit. Is this a mistake or the design of oracle.
This does look like an error and what was probably intended was to do a deep copy of num as you guessed.

OK, thanks for reply
