Given a channel specified by either its Choi matrix or its Kraus representation, determine if the channel is trace-preserving.
For the definition of what constitutes a channel to be trace-preserving, refer to Section 2.2.1 of https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/TQI/TQI.pdf
This would involve creating channel_props/is_trace_preserving.py and adding the logic there. Refer to other files in the same directory, namely is_completely_positive.py, is_herm_preserving.py, etc. for ensuring consistency amongst the other related functions.
The function prototype would follow this form:
This task would also require adding test coverage for the function along with ensuring it is included in the docs. Refer to the style guide and code contributing guidelines for more information.
