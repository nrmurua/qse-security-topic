@kdk noticed that transpile might return a circuit that is not in the given basis:
[...] CXDirection is inserting Hadamards, which can't be unrolled to U1 gates (only U2 or U3) [...]
So there is an issue here in that if the circuit can't be expressed in terms of the requested basis, we should raise an error instead of returning a circuit in the wrong basis.
Here an example:
I wonder if this is something we could fit in under #3604
I think so...
Following up on some offline discussion, there is still an issue here (though the original example currently raises from Optimize1qGates at optimization_levels other than zero, and both the BasisTranslator and Unroller should raise if asked to translate to a basis they can't reach).
The remaining issue is that CXDirection runs after unrolling/translation and inserts U2Gates instead of Hadamards.

Probably the right fix is to move CXDirection to run after the routing passes but before the translation passes.
Will be resolved as part of #5609 .
