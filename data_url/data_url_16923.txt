I ran a 4-qubit Grover's Algorithm searching for 0000 and 0010 on the IBM backend and did not get even remotely similar results to the simulated runs. I've tried ibmq_vigo, london, essex, none of them are close to the local simulation.
The code for amplification step:

And the simulations:
Local:

IBMQ_vigo:

I've already seen a related issue with 3 qbit Grover, but the results are ok when i run, not that bad as the 4 qbits Grover. Is there any solution for this problem?
Is there any solution for this problem?
If I understand the problem correctly, the short answer is "no, no yet".
The slightly longer answer:
I think it might be just the noise in the real quantum chips. You might get slightly better results with optimization level 3. You can also try different backends. However, the current quantum chips are noise and you are trying a relatively deep circuit, so you get "noisy" results. Maybe
@kdk, @nonhermitian, @taalexander have more insights.
Hi! Thank you for the answer. Could you tell me more about this optimization lvl 3?
If you are running execute, you can add the parameter optimization_level=3.
Thank you very much @1ucian0 . I've tried this but it was not so good for 4 qbit. For 3 qbit i noticed a better performance. Thank you, again.
