Hi!
There's a bug when using controlled gates, with gates which fit "under" the control lane - see attached picture. I don't think there's any parameter in the Gate constructor which controls this, is there?

Thanks a lot!

You're correct, there's no concept of layering (LiquidTikZ.tex is pretty simple). OTOH, it's layed out in a straightforward table, so you can go in and hand edit (many of our users do just that). Notice that these wires are drawn with \qwxB which is a quantum wire that is "bent". You can edit the amount of bend in the definition of \qwxB (and \cwxB for classical vertical wires). Putting in a bend is usually enough for you to tell where a wire goes when it goes under another (or when there's lots of vertical wires on top of each other).
