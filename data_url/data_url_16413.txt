parallel_map is implemented using ProcessPoolExecutor and the documentation  mentions as follows.
The __main__ module must be importable by worker subprocesses. This means that ProcessPoolExecutor will not work in the interactive interpreter.
It seems to be critical on Python 3.8 of Mac. I prepared before.py and after.py as follows.
Although both run successfully on Python 3.7, before.py fails on Python 3.8 of my Mac.
It would be nice to mention it in Qiskit documentation too.

#4779 looks similar.
My Python 3.7 environment is as follows.
OS: macOS 10.15.6
Python: 3.7.8
My Python 3.8 environment is as follows.
OS: macOS 10.15.6 (same PC as above)
Python: 3.8.5
Reference: All example concurrent.futures code is failing with “BrokenProcessPool”

Error message of before.py on python 3.8:

This is fixed in master branch, so may be solved if 0.15.0 is released.
Thank you. I found #4404 fixes the issue. I hope it will be released soon.
Fwiw, this was documented in the release notes for the release which added 3.8 support: https://qiskit.org/documentation/release_notes.html#known-issues (although that probably was long enough ago that it's not sufficient anymore)
