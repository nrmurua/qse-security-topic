The positioning in time of gates in a circuit is not possible right now. Meaning that adding gates to the queue via circuit.add() does not define when the gates should be executed, even if certain gates should be executed at the same time currently this cannot be controlled efficiently.
There exist already an attributed called circuit.queue.moments where the gates are placed in their earliest position and stored in lists for each clock cycle, e.g. each time frame where gates are executed simultaneously.
But storing or manipulating gates directly in the moments property does not affect the circuit.queue property which can be misleading, also it could break other code.
Here a proposition how to proceed, discussed in the meeting with @stavros11, @igres26 and @ingoroth :
