Hi ScaffCC developers,
I am also a KDE developer, and I am maintaing K3B, it uses GPL https://github.com/KDE/k3b/blob/master/COPYING
But I argue that it is better to take place of sqct in ScaffCC, because sqct uses GPL https://github.com/epiqc/ScaffCC/blob/master/Rotations/sqct/COPYING gridsynth is the same issue http://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/newsynth/#license
I supports ScaffCC uses BSD LICENSE, it is commercial friendly, just like LLVM would switch to Apache too http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2017-August/116266.html
And I prefer to use LLVM Toolchain to build ScaffCC https://github.com/ScaffCC/ScaffCC/commit/f111ce2ba3040730279fbbac3378b8fb241f1260 I tested to build for Fedora 25, but sqct might not depends on OpenMP?
Regards,
Leslie Zhai
Another usecase: build ARMmbed via LLVM Toolchain ARMmbed/mbed-os#5574 No GPL source is used in generated executable!
