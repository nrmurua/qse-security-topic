The multi controlled gates have been moved to Aqua, left are the boolean logic gates and the MCMT gate. The multi-control multi-target gate can be moved to Terra already. To implement the boolean logic gates as Gate types we need the multi-controlled X gate to be implemented.
mcmt gate still needs to be removed from Aqua
