In method Scan_an_option_get_capacitance_matrix, allow user to choose if the last design_render should be cleared.
When the user is scanning an option, and getting the capacitance matrices.  After the method is completed, the user may want to look at what is in q3D.  Presently, q3d is cleaned after each calculation of capacitance.  User requested an option to leave the design in q3d.
