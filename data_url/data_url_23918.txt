This is a weird issue and looks important to figure out as this could ruin two-qubit RB. Please see if this issue is reproducible to you.
I noticed that if I keep running a cell script in jupyter notebook to create two-qubit RB sequences with the same Clifford gate selection, I get some of target gates changing in the irregular way (See the picture attached below). So far I got four different gate combinations. I haven't checked if there are more of this randomness in other location yet.
To see this happen, try running the 4th cell in the jupyter notebook I attached multiple time. Alternatively, try running 5th and 6th cell in a row multiple times to see how actual pulse representation comes out.
Referring to #165, I tried removing @_memoize from def CNOT, but it didn't fix this issue.
I am using the master branch of QGL.

I don't think this is an issue, these are different representations of the same Clifford, chosen randomly. See
Cliffords.C1Seqs and 
Oh, you are right. I overlooked the single Clifford. Thank!
