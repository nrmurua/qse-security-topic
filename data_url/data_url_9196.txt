There are a number of non-Gaussian states that can be prepared by heralding Gaussian states using photon-number-resolving detectors. For example in https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.022341 several recipes for generating Fock, cat and cubic-phase states are studied. More recently there are preprints by Shringarpure and Franson (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08028) and Thekkadath et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10314) discussing new setups to generate non-Gaussian states. It would be good to setup a gallery in The Walrus documentation where each of these schemes (and any other that I am missing or that are developed in the future) can be found and studied using the tools available in this library.
