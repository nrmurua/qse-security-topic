See python/mypy#1174 for full context, but there are common idioms where you may want to re-use a variable name
Mypy currently complains. They added a flag: python/mypy#6197 which may or may not become the default at some point. I say we add this to our mypy configuration.
ref #3767
I have mixed feelings about this. Sometimes it's nice to redefine variables (I often encounter this when a function accepts an arg with a union type but we then convert it to a single type and want the rest of the code to use this "narrowed" type). But other times a redefinition is inadvertent and mypy flagging it can actually detect bugs (sometimes bugs like this only surface when refactoring). It looks like --allow-redefinition only applies in certain limited situations, which is good, but I'd still be a bit leery about adding it.
I'm going through the numpy stuff and there are a non-zero number of places where redefinitions are used, especially when constructing arrays:
Discussion in Cirq sync:
From mypy: --allow_redefinition only allows redefinition within the same block and nesting depth.
