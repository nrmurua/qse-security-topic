Potential flake that I've seen once in CI as well as (I think) once on my mac locally:
It wasn't a flake.
Adding some info in case someone runs into something similar.
What was happening is that the cirq-google dependencies were missing on the CI job due to my refactors.
This triggered the conditional import of cirq_google package to fail.
The json_serialization_test.py file checks for cirq_google being present on the PYTHONPATH - and then it assumes that it is included - and asserts the deprecationwarning to be emitted. But, because of the missing dependencies, import google in the protobuf files fail, leading to an import error in cirq/__init__.py which caught by a way too wide Exception handling mechanism (#4106 should fix this and result in a better error message)...resulting in an inconsistent state: cirq_google is on the path but cirq.google does not exist.
