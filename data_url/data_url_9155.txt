The discussion of sampling algorithms can be greatly improved by for example following the what is done here https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08068
@nquesada are the sampling algorithms that you mention here already implemented?
At the time I mean the algorithms that are currently implemented which come from https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023005 .
Eventually we should add the newest ones from https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15595 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01622
