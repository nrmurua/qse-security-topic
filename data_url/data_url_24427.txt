Currently there is two "MetalGUI", one is a function, the other is a class, but they do roughly the same thing. Objective: decide which way to go and cleanup the code
From Zlatko: Oh, so now I see what you mean. The function was defined as a front end to call the class initially.
The reason was that the user might not have PyQt5 or the gui packages / they may not have run the %gui qt loop.
Maybe this is no longer needed. It seems that the gui is a pretty important part of the package and the requriemetns are in the requirements.txt.
The kicking up of the QApplicaiton instance could be handled in the gui class i suppose.
remove unnecessary complexity
