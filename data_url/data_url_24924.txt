Firstly, this is a great library for exploring parameter regimes/ connectivity in different SC qubit architectures! It appears to me that functions for calculating coherence properties are lacking.
For example, including the calculation of T_phi following @petergthatsme 's work on ZP paper would be very useful for users.
Thanks, Pranav - I agree. Peter and I talked about this already, and itâ€™s on our to-do list.
@petergthatsme We should bump this in priority; bigger impact than ARPACK-related questions.
I'm closing this as the core noise functionality has been implemented in version 1.3 (and more predefined noise channels will be still added in the near future, especially for the more complex qubits like the zeropi and other upcoming ones) .
