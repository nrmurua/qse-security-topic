which feels wrong. We could fix it by defining _mixture_ for Circuit. This method makes perfect sense but one potential pitfall is that if a Circuit has m mixture operations that each have k possibilities, the length of the Circuit mixture is k^m. This can easily be exponential in the size of the circuit.
Related to #408.
Fixing this also addresses #1783.
This is definitely not correct behavior (verified it still exists).
Update: has_mixture appears to have been fixed:
However,
Keeping the bug open until mixture is implemented for circuits. One step towards this goal is under review in #4550.
