I was going to comment this on the qibojit PR but since this is merged I am writing here. I believe the following point is still open, right?
@stavros11 let me put this info here, I believe we should include a warning message about set_threads when if the backend is tensorflow or numpy, in fact, I believe this function does not work as expected for these backends.
I was adding the warnings now, an issue though is that the set_threads method  that is exposed to the user changes the threads for all created backends. This means that if numpy/tensorflow backends are created but a different backend (qibotf or qibojit) is active, then the numpy/tensorflow warnings will be raised if the user uses set_threads. @scarrazza, do you think we should modify set_threads to only change the threads of the active backend?
Thanks, indeed I had a look at the code and I agree that we should change the threads of the active backend.
