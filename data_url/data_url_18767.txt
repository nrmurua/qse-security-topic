The array concatenation operator specified in the "Types" section is not listed in the operator precedence table.  We need to clarify the precedence of the ++ array concatenation operator.  It seems that it is supposed to have the highest precedence from the grammar:
However, I believe that the original intent was for it to have the same precedence as the ** power operator.  Therefore, concatenating function calls reads clearly.
