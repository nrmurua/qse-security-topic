e.g.
void multiArbitraryControlledUnitary(qureg, controlQubits, controlStates, numControlQubits, targetQubit, ComplexMatrix2 u)
where the additional arg controlStates is a numControlQubits-length bit array which describes the state of controlQubits on which application of u is conditioned.
This allows multiplexors to be implemented easier, as can be used in a decomposition of general two-qubit unitaries in issue #92
(reminder: on top of multiControlledUnitary validations, this will need to validate controlStates are in {0, 1})
