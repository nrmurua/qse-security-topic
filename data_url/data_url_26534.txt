Dear CP2K developers,
I noticed interesting bug:
If you use cp2k.sopt or cp2k.ssmp for mixed calculations, your forces evaluation output will be printed in the same file (*-r-1.out). It doesn't effect restart or wavefunctions printing - only messes up with output.
I detected it by running example_multiple_force_eval.py from aiida-cp2k plugin.
Best regards,
Vasyl

You probably have to explicitly set different filenames.
