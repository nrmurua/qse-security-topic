How can I perform non diagonal measurement using the current scheme of Primitives.Estimator?
Say there are 2 states A and B that are distinct, constructed by qiskit.QuantumCircuit.
How can I carry out the following operation?
It's not an expectation value, so we cannot support it.
I think you could run the circuit U_A - P_a - U_B^dagger and sum over a, where H = \sum_a P_a and U_Xs are the quantum circuits which prepare the state A and B.
