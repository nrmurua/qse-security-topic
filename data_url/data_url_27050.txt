Add LAPACK to QUICK. Should get compiled if the user does not have system LAPACK or MKL installed.
@multiplemonomials added double precision and double complex  LAPACK routines to sr/lapack. Both BLAS (src/blas) and LAPACK libraries get built by CMake if no system BLAS and LAPACK is available.
@Madu86 Do you want to add this to your configure build system? I will leave this issue open for the moment.
fwiw I just copied the Amber builtin LAPACK, so no idea if it has the correct things.
@agoetz Yes, I can add it. Let me first finish issues that I am currently working on.
It has all we need and more. It does not contain functions for single precision and complex data types but we do not need those. What we could do is actually remove functions that we are not using. At the very least we could remove the double complex functions. LAPACK (and BLAS) naming convention is starting letter of function s = single precision, d = double precision, c = complex, z = double complex.
LAPACK (subset of functions used in QUICK or AMBER) was added. Works with CMake. Needs to be added to configure based build.
@Madu86 this looks like it is resolved. Can we close this issue?
Yes!
