@kevinsung pointed out some complaints raised by Pylint with my style changes in #317 (lines with no assignment intended to raise errors). It might make sense to switch things over completely to Pylint instead of PEP8 - it has other features that might be helpful as well. Thoughts / objections?
interested to hear thoughts from @Strilanc
I think it would be good to have pylint run as part of continuous integration.
If you can setup pylint to run automatically as part of continuous integration then definitely do it. @Strilanc might have some idea how to do that. I would love this.
I agree with the move to Pylint, while linting with PEP8/pycodestyle, I noticed there were quite a few code issues it didn't pick up, which Pylint did. It's also pretty simple to integrate with Travis. Alternatively you can add a continuous-integration linting service like Codacy, which automates Pylint with pull requests.
I recently linted and noted about 150 violations throughout OpenFermion. I now consider this very high priority.
Looks like we've decided on a plan. Closing in favor of #416 .
