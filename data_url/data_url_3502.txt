It would be nice if the WavefunctionSimulator supported setting memory references to fixed values in pyQuil programs.
Say I have a Quil program p with a parameter alpha declared as DECLARE alpha REAL[2]. I would like to be able to call wf.wavefunction(p, params={alpha: [0.5, 0.2]}) to get the wavefunction with the 2 entries of memory reference alpha set to the given list-like object.
yeah this would be nice. You can hack in a solution by putting MOVE quil instructions at the top of your program
(This is also what an official solution would look like under the hood.)
Thanks! This works.
FYI, there is now an official solution to this problem, via memory_map in the WavefunctionSimulator (https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/blob/master/pyquil/api/_wavefunction_simulator.py#L55). Thus, closing this issue.
