Before I tried to use the new hybrid solver, I checked available solvers using dwave solvers command. I could not find 'hybrid_v1' on version 0.7.0:
However, when I downgraded dwave-cloud-client to v. 0.6.3, 'hybrid_v1' was listed on available solvers:
Looks like you have constrained the client to qpu, or the solver to QPU-based in your dwave.conf.
You can verify this by running dwave solvers --list --all.
Try removing client = qpu from your config. That way a generic, non-QPU specific client will be used.
Thank you so much! I could find the 'hybrid_v1' solver when I commented out client = qpu:
My dwave.conf was
and removed the last line.
