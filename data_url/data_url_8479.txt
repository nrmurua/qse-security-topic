There is some concern that some users are forgetting to cite qutip when using it in their work. This thread is for ideas of how to add reminders into the library.
One idea was to randomly print a message on import qutip. I am not sure on whether this would go against established etiquette. Anyone have a view on this?
Adding a reminder in qutip.about() would seem to be a good idea, but not sure how often it would be seen
Having reminder in the repr of the Result object would seem appropriate.
"If this result is interesting, please cite QuTiP in your publication"
@sahmed95 Yes, very nice idea. Making life easier for people is always a good idea. We could have something on the website as well that generates bibtex for the qutip papers and the Zenodo DOI that people can copy direct into their bib files, like on the Zenodo site.
My two cents on this but if providing an easy citation formatting function, I think it would be relevant to have the QuTiP version mentionned in the citation. Many QuTiP citations I see in papers just mention something like "Thanks to QuTiP developpers, all simulations were made under QuTiP", without any explicit mention of version. Having a versionned citation might help track the impact of potential bugs in QuTiP code on results.
@Phyks I agree that it would help having a version specific citation, for the repeatability reasons you mention. We do have a Zenodo DOI

Some others are worried though that if we offer this, then users may not cite the papers. Paper citations are very important
