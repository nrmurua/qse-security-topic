The matplotlib circuit drawer is unconditionally using latex mode for all gate names. This is a change in behavior from previous releases and can lead to weird results. For example, having a gate named my_gate^22 will result in this being drawn:

but the string should
my_gate^22
like:

but obviously without the rendering bug (I used an older qiskit version to show the previous behavior which had other bugs)
Run:
The gate title text is not in latex mode by default anymore, the documented behavior is to use $ around the latex portions of the string.
Fix the default change.
