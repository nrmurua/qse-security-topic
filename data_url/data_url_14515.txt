To support string parameters in gates I subclassed the qiskit Gate. Using this in circuits works fine, but not with the QPY serialization. The serialization with QPY works, but deserialization results in an error CircuitError: "Invalid param type <class 'str'> for gate wait."
A minimal example:
Deserialization should be supported as well.
No response
Can I have a go at this issue? The problem seems to be that the load method does not have access to the overloaded validate_parameter method (which is present in the Gate instance[here]) when it tries to reconstruct the circuit.
