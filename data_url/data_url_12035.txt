There is a typo in 01_algorithm_introduction.ipynb
It is at the last of the paragraph right after 5th code cell;
"... for the specific chemistry problem being solved. which it has to do the same thing."
Modify the sentence as below;
"... for the specific chemistry problem being solved, which it has to do the same thing."
Or simply delete the last part as below;
"... for the specific chemistry problem being solved."
I'd like to work on this fix , as it would help me practice with pull requests and working on issues. What are the best resources for learning to do this properly?
This should have been fixed by #1096. Please reopen if the issue still persists.
