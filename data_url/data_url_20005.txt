I found this issue while I was working on a project that compares between different PQC algorithms regarding one of my subjects in master, and wanted to notify you about it.
Kindly check attached image, I compared 5 algorithms together the only one that has mismatching values of signature length is Falcon-512.
Here is code snippet I used to calculate signature size which I believe it gives accurate value
print("Signature size: ",len(signature)," Bytes")

Where do you take the value "655" from? Manually from the specs? Further, this deviation does not occur with Falcon-1024? If so, this were a duplicate of open-quantum-safe/openssl#395; Issue is already visible upstream in https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/blob/d3fcc0fa8d868835a92545fbd08c17497a787102/crypto_sign/falcon-512/META.yml#L6
Yes from details function : signer.details, but problem still occurs with Falcon-1024 where actual signature size = 1279  Bytes , while details function return 1330.
Also all Picnic_* algorithms have same issue , kindly check attached image for example.

I have changed the title so that it matches perfectly the content of the issue.
Yes from details function
The origin of value "690" in the case of falcon-512 is understood. I was wondering where you take the "Signature Size" values in your output from? Both for falcon as well as for picnic ("655" in the case of falcon-512).

I used len() function from py on the signature itself
Thanks for the cooperative team and for the quick response and fix, Thank you baentsch for your effort !
I'm happy for contributing to this library
If no one minds, I'm closing this issue.
