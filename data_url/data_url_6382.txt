Long ago, I thought I was being clever by storing just phase angles for controlled phase gate buffers, since the composition of gates became addition and the norm of each argument is always 1. In retrospect, this was a horrible idea, for float math, because of the difference in float denormalization across the range of the angle representation; the precision becomes horrible at anti-phase, (M_PI  or 1). This became clear to me when I attempted to add a FLT_EPSILON for equality. The best fix for this, ironically, seems to be to simply replace the angle representation with full complex numbers again! Since the complex numbers will always have a norm of 1, denormalization is naturally (roughly or exactly) constant around the entire unit circle.
