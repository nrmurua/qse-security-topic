The auto_sweep function in the Keysight N52xx driver is broken. This feature allows data to be taken directly off screen without running a scan when disabled, which is necessary when measuring multiple parameters at once.
It looks like the check for auto_sweep was accidentally disabled in commit 78a989f
When running the below snippet the PNA should only take a single measurement
The pna will run the trace twice, once for magnitude and once for phase.

Haha right - no it doesn't matter and it's an easy fix. Thanks for looking at it so quickly :)
