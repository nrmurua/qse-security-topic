I forked and pushed a branch that contains minimal edits for the test suite to pass without warnings on today's master branch of Julia. If you are interested, I'll make a PR.
Yes please!
Good! I just pushed another branch that updates CI, test format, etc.
Hi John!  Sure we'd love a PR.  I think Travis is currently failing on the 1.0 and nightly builds at the moment since versions > 0.7.x require the master branch of Cliffords.jl
Yes it is failing. I'll try to get Travis to use the master branch of Cliffords.jl
Finding the right incantation is a PITA, but Travis is now using the master branch of Cliffords.jl and the tests pass.
I think we can close this issue now.
