Folding functions support a fidelities keyword argument, but there is no way to pass this information through via zne.execute_with_zne.

It would be nice to support this kwarg in zne.execute_with_zne so one doesn't have to call the folding function "manually" with a fidelities argument, then do the fitting separately.
One can set the fidelities and other folding options to use with execute_with_zne as shown here:

We often do similar things with the executor options.
But maybe this is not practical enough for the user?
I think that's fine and even preferable because that's the strategy for executor options as you note. I could've sworn there used to be an keyword arg for this, but maybe I'm mistaken.
