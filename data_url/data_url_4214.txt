Hi,
I assume you have installed ProjectQ v0.3.6 or below via pypi in that case the examples and documention of the master branch are valid.
In the meantime, we have introduced get_engine_list in the develop branch. This minor change unfortunately makes the new example codes not run with the previous version. On the plus side, this then allows to use our new setups discussed in the compiler_tutorial and the new setups with mappers #243
As IBM has changed some of their chip layout since the release of ProjectQ v0.3.6, you currently need to install the latest version from the develop branch (download repo, in the top directory python -m pip install --user .) The new version 0.4 of ProjectQ is almost done and will be uploaded to pypi in the next days. (Waiting for #241 to be integrated)
The new release of ProjectQ v0.4 is out. Please install that version and everything should work fine.
