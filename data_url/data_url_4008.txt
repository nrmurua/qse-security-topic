A configuration file for virtual platforms (eqasm_compiler = none) requires every instruction to have a matrix definition. If these JSON attributes would not be obligatory anymore, the configuration file will be simplified and reduced in size.
Proposed solution:
Make instruction matrix definitions optional for at least virtual platforms.
@lriesebos , for experiments the matrix is often unknown, additionally we do not use the functionality that requires the matrix. As such our matrices are generally incorrect. Not having to specify the matrices would at least make it clear that it is unknown.
As such not specifying this would also help us (experimentalists).
yes, this makes sense and should be optional. once a user tries to use a feature which requires matrix and if the matrix is not specified, he should get an un-known matrix error.
Implemented in 0.10.0
