Hi , I used https://openquantumsafe.org/liboqs/getting-started.html to install liboqs on my debian machine , i checked present documentation but couldnot find any documentation to uninstall , is there any standard procedure to uninstall liboqs conveniently.
As we don't provide an installer (rpm/deb) there's no uninstaller either. So, if you simply ran ninja installyou need to manually remove the files installed in that step (location dependent on the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX you installed when building; if unset the default location is /usr/local). The files installed are then in the usual include and libdirectories (named oqs and liboqs* respectively).
ok thank you sir
