The CXCancellation pass currently only looks for adjacent CX-CX gates (on the same qubits) as opportunities for optimization, but it should support a broader set of both self-inverse gates and generic gate-inverse pairs.
One option (similar to what was done for CXDirection in #5609 ) would be to include in CXCancellation additional gate-inverse rules for which it can search the circuit to find applications.  It would be better though to add an optional attribute to Instruction instances to denote which Instruction (if any) is know ahead of time to be an instruction's inverse.
This PR #6855 can be used to complete this feature request -- all that would be required would be to search for the correct inputs for the new pass prior to running. I unlinked the PR to leave this issue open after it's merged.
