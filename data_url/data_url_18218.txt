The following functions in qiskit/tools/qcvv/tomography.py throw an error [lines 920-989]:
I believe the source of the error comes from 'pauli' being written in lower case in these functions' arguments, while on line 333 we check for 'Pauli' (upper case).
So to fix, make all function arguments into 'Pauli'.
I encountered this error while running the following tutorials:
@ajavadia Yes, those tutorials need updating! Just to confirm: is the error only in the tutorials, not the functions themselves?
I suppose we could also add a str.lower() to the function defs so capitalisation doesn't matter.
Hi @chriseclectic, no the bug is in the functions. The functions will throw an error whenever they are called. It just happens that the tutorials call them.
The fix is just to convert all the meas_basis='pauli' to meas_basis='Pauli' in function definitions. I'm just saying since those are deprecated functions, you may want to not use them in the tutorials at all. But this fix will stop errors for now.
Thanks for PR#237! The tutorials work now. Closing this issue.
