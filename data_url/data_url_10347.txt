Hello,
Have run into an issue where I submit a sampling request and get back an error indicating that annealing_time the parameters is out of range when I don't think it is based on the annealing_time_range property.  Additionally the error trace shows a in equality that looks odd.  If I back off the annealing time this problem goes away but I am not sure why.
Here is a short piece of code and the resulting stack trace.  The version of the code this came from isn't the current version but because I think the issue may be on the server it may still be relevent.
According to properties annealing_time_range => [1, 2000]
So when I run:
I get this:
Hi @schnorea! The error message is not too informative, but the explanation is pretty simple.
Namely, the total problem runtime must be within problem_run_duration_range.
The upper limit for the solver you were submitting was 1000000 μs (1 second), and the total problem duration was:
When you plug in 5000 reads and 1000 μs anneal time, with default programming_thermalization = default_programming_thermalization = 1000 μs, and readout_thermalization = default_readout_thermalization 0 μs:
