It may be a useful idea to create special implementations for comparative and type-like magic methods.  Some ideas:
len returns number of configurations
eq compares turboDir strings instead of instance references
int, float, return latest DFT energy in respective types.  Seems like a silly implementation for int though, which could maybe be better used for something else, or forgotten.
str returns string-type of turboDir OR string-type of latest DFT energy.  Not really sure which would be better.  Leaning towards turboDir but I don't know.
len and eq have been given specific implementations
these nominated uses of "int", "float", and "str" are non-intuitive. These uses should be given descriptive names such as ".getEnergy()" and ".getDir()"
We'll do that instead.  I'll close this issue.
