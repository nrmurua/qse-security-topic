so I get this idea from optimizing cnot structure, I think it will be good for visualize if we can print with depth layer.
maybe can make an interactable plot, for highlighting the multi-qubit gate.

Thanks @poig, the animation looks fantastic. But one clarification: is this PR about computing gate layers or about drawing them?
Please take a look at the QuantumCircuit.depth() function which internally computes the level for every gate in the circuit. (Maybe there are other Qiskit functions that do this as well).

The animation is from https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit.html#supplementary-information
Drawing them with QuantumCircuit.depth(), because it will loop over every gate, and giving each gate depthline2016     max_level = max(levels), the main problem is how to draw duplicate gate like the animation example.
Oh, so the real question is how to draw things (no experience here on my part). There seems to be another new related issue: #8374.

I think #8374 can be easily done with #8063.
@poig so do you want to draw a barrier of sorts when a layer ends or do you want all the gates to be printed on top of each other?

I think it will be great if make it optional, but giving it color for identifying the multi-qubit gate is also a problem.
I like to work on this issue, I can implement the functionality of printing a barrier at the end of each layer, please assign it to me. Any suggestions on how to proceed is also appreciated.

it will look messy when it comes to a huge number of qubits, so take care of the gate order, and add label to the barrier, like qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate, will be great.
it maybe look something like this:
