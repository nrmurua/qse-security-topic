Converting circuit into gate using the QuantumCircuit.to_gate property, and then applying the Gate.control method raises the error 'Cannot make controlled gate with id instruction'. This actually means that you cannot create a control gate if you have an id instruction in your circuit. However, when the circuit with no IdGate is used, the Gate.control work just fine.
The Identity gate IdGate should not compromise the control instruction.
I believe this should be resolved by pr #3950.
âœ… : Edit: Issue still reproducible! (Thanks to santa @1ucian0)

Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
Funnily enough, this one is essentially the same issue as #7399.
Nice! I just confirmed that #7403 fixes this issue.
This was fixed by a combination of #7146 and #10607.
