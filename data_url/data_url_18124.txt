It seems that the queue_position is always of the multiplicity of three.
The pending jobs is 6, but the queue_position is 21...
But ...
Hi @rraymondhp. queue_position and pending_jobs are not the same.
Pending jobs is the number of actual jobs pending to be executed on the backend.
But queue_position is not as straightforward, as there are different queues based on user level and priority. So we calculate a worst-case position for your queue position. Being a multiple of 3 is apparently a product of this worst-case calculation. I'll double check.
Ok I confirmed that the multiples of 3 are indeed due to reporting a conservative queue position, considering there are 3 queues. Your actual job position will be equal or smaller than this.
So I am closing this as not a bug.
