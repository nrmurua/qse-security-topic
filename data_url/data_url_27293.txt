Since our QuTiP clone (as in light-weight QuTiP) is almost ready (I am in the process of writing tests), it would be great to reproduce some more tutorials using our tools. We should be able to reproduce two papers: one is the unitary learning paper and the other one is the cavity control paper.
The tutorials should give the users an idea of the usefulness of the library and also introduce them to the usage of it (on top of what would be in the docs).
