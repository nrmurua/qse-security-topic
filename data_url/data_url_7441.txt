I am running the notebook 2.yao_basics on a Macbook pro with the M1 chip under Big Sur using Julia 1.8.2 . I execute:
and get the error message:
Why is this happening?
Here is my Project.toml:
The Manifest is 300+ lines, so I am not posting it. But I am attaching it. Apparently, I cannot attach toml files. Presumably for security reasons.
Any insight will be appreciated. Thanks.
Thanks for reporting the issue, the documentation seems to be outdated, we will update it soon.
In your case, a minimal fix is adding a parameter type as the first argument
The previous implementation does not consider generic types, like symbolic parameters.
In the latest version, we make the interface more generic, this is why we need a new argument.
The docstring is usually updated more frequently than the tutorial. You can check the docstring by typing ? in an REPL, followed by the function that you want to query.
Thank you!
