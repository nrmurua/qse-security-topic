Running the constant-time tests with the generic optimization target (cmake -GNinja -DOQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF -DOQS_OPT_TARGET=generic -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DOQS_ENABLE_TEST_CONSTANT_TIME=ON ..) results in failures for Sphincs+ and McEliece. We haven't been running CT tests for these algorithms in CI and until recently we weren't running CT tests for the generic target due to a CI configuration bug.
The full constant-time tests need to be run (locally) with the generic configuration and the suppression files updated so that there are no more failures.
