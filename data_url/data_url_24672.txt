After sequencing a pulse to obtain a program, it is often desirable to change some parameters without starting the entire sequencing again. Ideally this would also be supported by hardware drivers to avoid costly re-uploads of pulses (if possible) to the hardware device.
Task:
Implement a method update_program(parameters) to achieve this desired behavior.
It is currently unclear whether this should be part of the Loop class (which is currently not exposed to end-users) or of the PulseTemplate class (then taking a Loop instance which will be updated as an argument). It could also be conceivable to wrap the Loop class in a class Program which can expose a clean interface to the user and handle a Loop instance internally.
Also depends on changes to parameter management, especially the ability to mark parameters as volatile. Due to that, this issue should be tackled after #280 is completed.
As a first step we will implement this for repetition numbers.
The data acquisition machinery also needs support for this.
Was implemented in release 0.5
