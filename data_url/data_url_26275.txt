Write a function to determine if a given superoperator is a quantum channel. A valid quantum channel is a superoperator that is both trace-preserving and completely positive.
This feature should be placed inside of toqito/channel_props/is_quantum_channel.py with unit tests inside of tests/test_channel_props/test_is_channel.py. Also, ensure that the docs are updated by updating docs/channels.rst and placing toqito.channel_props.is_quantum_channel under Properties of Quantum Channels.
This feature is contingent on implementing: #11, which allows one to determine whether a superoperator is trace-preserving. The other component, determining whether a given superoperator is completely positive is found in is_completely_positive.py

Thank you!
Looks great, @victor-onofre! Just added a few minor comments.
Thank you for reviewing my code @vprusso. I have made the changes to the function.
