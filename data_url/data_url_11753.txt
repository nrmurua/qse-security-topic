I would like a feature which keeps track of how long the QSVM (or any aqua algorithm, for that matter) takes to run, ignoring queue times and such. This includes how long it takes to construct the circuits, and then how long it takes for the circuits to execute. But please ignore or list separately the time spent waiting in queue. I would like to analyze time efficiency of the qsvm with different data sizes / feature maps, but this is impossible without a standardized way to keep track of how long the algorithm takes to run. If there already exists a way to do this, please let me know.
Do you mind turning on the DEBUG mode to see what is missed?
For execution times of functionality on your local machine you might consider a Python profiler which can give you detailed breakdown of timings.
While you can easily get the overall run times to compare various configurations when using a local simulator with any Aqua algorithm the job completion for real devices does not currently report executions times.
