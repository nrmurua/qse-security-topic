Are there plans to include in OpenFermion methods to perform the double rank factorization method of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14460 and the tensor hypercontraction method https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03494, for example once they are published?
Thanks!
I am not sure if we will include the double factorization method. It would definitely be in scope though and we'd welcome the contribution. The tensor hypercontraction method is available in QChem and we will likely also add functionality to OpenFermion to use it in the context of fault-tolerant resource estimates, eventually. That's a larger project on a roadmap but I can't say when we would be finished with adding the functionality.
The features requested have been included in the merged PR above and are now available (https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion/tree/master/src/openfermion/resource_estimates).
Thanks for including them!
