Would be nice to add manylinux aarch64 builds to the CI (e.g. for raspberry pi support). E.g. cp3x-manylinux_aarch64 builds. With cibuildwheel this currently requires emulation e.g. using qemu, however this leads to c++: error: unrecognized command-line option ‘-mno-avx2’ (see also #65). Another option might be to use cross-compilation on linux once cibuildwheel supports it.
