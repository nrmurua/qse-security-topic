Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Some operator matrices passed to targeted_left_multiply are onehot (times a constant). Kraus components in particular. I could be wrong, but I believe these can be sped up beyond the default einsum implementation.
Plausibly even the _apply_kraus_multi_qubit that calls it could be sped up for onehot operators, as there may be a way to do everything in one step. But I'm even less certain here.
Describe the solution you'd like
Investigate and fix if possible.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
Closing since it creates extra overhead in the nominal case.
