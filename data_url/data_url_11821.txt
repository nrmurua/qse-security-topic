Circuit cache does not work - logging shows a miss at every reuse attempt.
Allowed misses param seems to have no effect. Circuit cache is cleared each time a miss is encounter resetting the misses count.
Can we improve on the debug log indicating index out of range for a cache miss when the cache is empty. A miss is expected - the index out of range ends up seeming that it could be a logic error rather than business as usual.
I can't close this, but I think it's fixed?
fixed by #333
