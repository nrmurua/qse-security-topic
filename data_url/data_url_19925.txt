OpenSSL 1.1.1 is already EOL this September, https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2023/09/11/eol-111/, needs to update to use OpenSSL 3
Can you explain further what you mean in this issue?  liboqs already works with OpenSSL 3 and we have the oqs-provider project which integrates algorithms from liboqs with OpenSSL 3.
@dstebila already pointed out that liboqs has no up- or downstream dependencies on OpenSSL111/works with&for OpenSSL3.
needs to update to use OpenSSL 3
therefore is not sufficiently clear as a problem statement, so closing this issue in consequence. Please consider opening a bug report with more details if you disagree, @chenrui333 .
