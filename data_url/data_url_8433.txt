Hi all,
I have a simple toy model of a 2-dim Hamiltonian. When I use
mesolve(H, c_states[prepare], t, [Qobj([[0,0],[0,0]])], args={'tau': tau})
I get the right result - however, if I try
mesolve(H, c_states[prepare], t, [], args={'tau': tau}) or
mesolve(H, c_states[prepare], t, c_ops=[], args={'tau': tau})
the result is most definitely wrong.
Any ideas?
You may want to give a more complete example.
Ok, my mistake. I thought mesolve would return density matrices, but it returned states...
My bad, sorry.
It reverts to the sesolve function for no collapse.
