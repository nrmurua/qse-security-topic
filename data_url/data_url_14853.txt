I am wondering if QITE is implemented in some way already in Qiskit so that we can use it. As far as I can tell, the ImaginaryTimeEvolver class is currently NotImplemented. It would be nice to include it in Qiskit as QITE is now a major research of interest.
ImaginaryTimeEvolver is an abstract base class that defines an interface.  VarQITE and SciPyImaginaryEvolver are both concrete realisations of that interface.
For what it's worth, further questions about qiskit.algorithms should likely be directed to https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms/, which is where the algorithms components of Qiskit are relocating to.
Thanks very much for the reply. I will close the thread now.
