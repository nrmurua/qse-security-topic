Another non-deterministic failure. I think seeding is the fix for this.
Actually seeding doesn't help and this test is quite brittle. @andreamari can you take a look?
Hi @rmlarose:
The fact that without seed we get non-deterministic failures is probably ok (the default number of samples is not very large).
The fact that the seed doesn't seem to help is likely related to this bug #452.
Once we solve #452 we should be able to correctly seed this test.
Sounds good @andreamari - opened #453 to fix the bug, PTAL when you can.
I think this issue was fixed by #453. If not, please reopen.
#453 partially fixed it, but #460 completely fixed it.
