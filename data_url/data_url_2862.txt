#284 was fixed by #335 , but I think this is still pretty limiting because I anticipate people will want to use something closer to LaTeX notation than Python identifier names. I have an alternative proposal: instead of decorating with Symbol(), we decorate with quotes "" instead. I'm proposing that this apply to all Symbols, so the changes in #335 would be overridden. What do people think of that?
We can probably expand the rules to include characters used in LaTeX symbols, mainly \{}.
I've found that I also want to use -.
Ah, - is a pretty strong case.
I think having Symbols delimited by quotes would make them easier to distinguish from the names of the gates.
Example:

Oh, you want the quotes to show up even when escaping is not necessary?
The two diagrams seem visually about the same to me, to be honest. It might be because the quotes don't really have an orientation, so visually they act more like separators (pick a quote; it may have the exponent before or after it). Might be improved by using smart quotes, or parens.
Hmm okay I don't feel strongly about it.
