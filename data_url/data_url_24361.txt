#175 is being broken up.
Renderer provide eigenmode. This may be done.  Need to investigate. There are pyepr command to do this.Â  Not sure if eigenmode what is returned. ( Want output to be  3xn modes)
Similar: eignmode and cpw
Practical example: of tuning fork and it's resonator frequencies.
Chip developers need this.
As of today, QRenender HFSS would need to have the quality factor (lossy aspect) as part of the output , along with the frequencies.  Presently, getting 2xn.  Where n being the number of mode.
