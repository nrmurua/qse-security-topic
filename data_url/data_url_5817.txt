I wonder if optimize_noise_threshold applies for noisy circuit simulation, or just:
as shown here:

and here:

Just to check: you're asking whether it should say something like
Sets the qubits threshold for application circuit optimization passes on noisy circuits.  Passes include ...
I think, since this documentation is currently just a copy of the point above it for the optimize_ideal_threshold option?
@chriseclectic: this (and optimize_ideal_threshold) now appear to be dummy options with no effect - the most recent reference I could find to them being accessed was removed in #698.
@jakelishman Yeah I think this is no longer used anywhere since refactoring circuit truncation to be done during circuit loading, and fusion has its own option value, so it should be removed from the backend options. optimize_ideal_threadhold is probably also unused now too.
