When treating correlated decay with a MCWF approach, one needs to use diagonaljumps. Since MCWF methods are used when memory efficiency is important, it makes sense to use it in combination with lazy operators. For correlated decay, one then needs a diagonaljumps function that can handle lazy operators. Something like:
