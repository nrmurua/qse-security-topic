Description of the issue
pip install cirq --pre may break with cirq installation if some of cirq dependencies release a dev package with API changes to PyPI.  The --pre option seems to affect cirq as well as any of its requirements.  See #6129 for an example breakage.
Cirq version
v0.15.0-298-g24abfa1d
Proposed solution
Add a daily CI test to perform a fresh pip install --pre cirq from PyPI and execute unit tests on the installed code.
This requires updates to our pytest configuration; as things are pytest requires the ./conftest.py from the Cirq repository root, but this file is not distributed in cirq wheels.
I'm trying to work on this issue, any pointers on how to start?
I'd suggest to add a new CI workflow ci-daily.yml scheduled to run every day, see #6046 for an example.
Then you can use the Pytest Ubuntu, Pytest Windows, Pytest MacOs jobs as starting points,
but modify their Install requirements parts to do
instead of installing from the dev.env.txt package list.
I think you will also need to do
to be able to run check/pytest at line 171

The idea is to install the pre-release cirq wheel and its dependencies from PyPI and verify things still work.
