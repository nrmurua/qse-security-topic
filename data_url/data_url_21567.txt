Not sure if this has been noticed but a few build failures are currently hidden in Hydra's evaluation error tab: https://nixbld.m-labs.hk/jobset/artiq/full-beta#tabs-errors
Fixed this issue, now there is an obscure error that is difficult to debug due to https://git.m-labs.hk/M-Labs/nix-scripts/issues/36
Maybe it's OOM
Yes, it's OOM. Hopefully will get better after https://git.m-labs.hk/M-Labs/nix-scripts/pulls/41
