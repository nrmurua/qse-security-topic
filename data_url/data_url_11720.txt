In many quantum algorithms, the classical output of a specific run of a quantum circuit is "successful"/useful when certain qubits collapse into a specific state. One can think of these "indication" qubits as flags. Count statistics of the remaining measured qubits then need to be accumulated as normal. In other words, the same machinery that is present in
get_subsystems_counts(complete_system_counts)
needs to be done for the subset of counts where the flag is present.
This is called quantum post-selection.
We propose something along the lines of the following function definition:
def get_subsystems_counts_post_selected(complete_system_counts, indication_register, flag_string)
which returns a list of dictionaries of counts of measured bit strings for all the other registers for when the indication_register matches the flag_string bit string.
#794 closes this issue.
