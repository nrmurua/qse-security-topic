Core device silently hangs when a kernel assigns a variable that's too large.
Creating a list of 32471025 int64s causes a silent hang on the core device. This can be recovered by deleteing the experiment in the ARTIQ GUI. Creating a larger list of e.g. 1E8 int64s causes a full crash, after which the core device and artiq_master must be restarted.
Execute:
Success if variable fits within RAM, error message if not.
