following #682
Provide faculties for automatic readout correction. Probably depends a bit on #712
A simple correction scheme where for each Experiment you measure your ansatz in a specified basis and the identity in the same basis. Use the second measurement to re-normalize the first.

I am not sure what you mean by ansatz and identity here, @mpharrigan.  That aside, I think the only way to make this scale in a sane way is to depend on symmetrization ( #712 ).  With that, assuming readout error correlations are negligible, you just need to calibrate N parameters for as many qubits, and rescale observed expectations based on which qubits have a non-trivial Pauli operator (for the expectation value).
