Seaborn dependency on distutils causes tests to fail with DeprecationWarning: distutils Version classes are deprecated. Use packaging.version instead.
Any new PRs to the Terra repo have failed checks with the same errors: DeprecationWarning: distutils Version classes are deprecated. Use packaging.version instead.
The error is unrelated to changes in the PRs and therefore should not surface.
The dependency appears to have been fixed in September 2021: mwaskom/seaborn@a0f7bf8 but there has been no release of Seaborn since.
I can confirm this. It is a shame that there is no newer release of Seaborn.
