Now that we're switching the default executor to Dask, users will want to know the status of the Dask cluster. covalent status should briefly summarize the cluster's status, for instance, something like
Dask cluster is running. Go to http://localhost:8787/status for more details.
or
Dask cluster has failed. Try restarting Covalent.
