When a job submission to IonQ fails, we currently point the user to their IonQ account to actually return the error.
We need clarification on what any errors being returned from IonQ look like generally, then we can add an extra line of code for dumping the whole error code to the programmer.

Hi @splch, would you mind clarifying what the job failure map will look like in general? Here's an example that I've seen:
Will it always have just two keys; "code" and "error"? Does that hold true if there were multiple errors in the submission? Thanks!

Hi! We have 2 cases: first if the API request fails which is outlined in our API spec, and second where a job fails running which will always return code and error. So yes, you're correct that is how the failed jobs error will look ðŸ˜„
