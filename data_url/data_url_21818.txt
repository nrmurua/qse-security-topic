I am using Urukul with kasli, and there is a mismatch in the ref clk value in ptb and tester variants.
In tester variant, the clock frequency seems not right. The output frequency is setfreq/1.25.
In PTB variant
In tester variant,
How to change it?
Please provide some context. What is your reference clock, how is the board populated, how is it connected, and what's the reference frequency? See the documentation for info on the fields and arguments.
Kasli is flashed with Tester variant.
Urukul DDS is connected to EEM1 and EEM0, DIO in EEM5, Sampler in EEM3,2.
Before flashing Tester variant, The clock frequency of Urukul was 1GHz and after flashing tester variant, it seems to have a clock frequency of 800MHz.
For ex: Setting 300MHz in Urukul Channel shows 240MHz as an output frequency, which is 300/1.25
How is the clocking circuitry on the board populated, how is it connected? How do you actually want to clock it?
The Clock to the Urukul is managed by Kasli and I didn't populate anything other than EEM connectors.
Did I understand your question properly?
Are you using the on board 100 MHz oscillator or the kasli 125 MHz clock via mmcx? See the schematic for the clocking circuit and the board population.
onboard 100 MHz oscillator.
Then you should change "refclk": 125e6. That's documented.
Reflash needed?
No
Works!!! Thank you
