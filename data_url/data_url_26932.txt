The idea here is to create a mode of operation that will preform the task of relaying information between different networks.
The relaying would be between either physically or virtually segmented networks. One use case for example would be connecting servers which exist behind a firewall with servers that run either behind a different firewall or in the cloud.
The relay can not handle encryption/decryption, as this would allow for a breach in security.
This will require a fairly large reworking of the data schema in use currently. Up to this point it has been the idea that the networks would be flat, while this will still be supported it needs to support multiple networks.
Securing the different networks is something that will be tackled in a different issue.
