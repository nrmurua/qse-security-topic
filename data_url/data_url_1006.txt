Currently, only three gates: PauliString, PhasedXPowGate and PhasedISwapPowGate override the _value_equality_values_cls_ method to return different class types for comparison based on the phase exponent / number of elements in the pauli string.
For phased* gates specifically, This is not ideal and causes confusion because of multiple reasons:
Therefore, I propose that we remove equality across types from PhasedXPowGate and PhasedISwapPowGate and use specialized gate families where such cross type equality checks are needed.

We should do this.
