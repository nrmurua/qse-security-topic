The "Get Involved!" section at the bottom of the README links to https://slack.rigetti.com/, but the connection times out for me.
I am able to connect to https://www.rigetti.com/ without problems.
The pyQuil documentation has a direct link to https://rigetti-forest.slack.com, without a rigetti.com redirect. Perhaps we ought to do the same.
