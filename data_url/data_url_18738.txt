Hello,
I would like to use quantum blackbird with test suite. However, on Github release, I can only download 0.2.1. Which Strawberryfield require at least 0.2.3.
So I would like to request for blackbird 0.2.3 with test or above on Github. Sorry if it came out as pushy, did not mean it.
Thank you.

Thanks for raising this issue @kevinsmia1939 ! We will be making an updated release shortly.
Hi @kevinsmia1939,
There's now a v.0.2.4 release of Blackbird on GitHub, which you can find here. This is the same version as the latest release on PyPI, but with the tests included.
