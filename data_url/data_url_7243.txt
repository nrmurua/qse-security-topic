It will be hard to define a reference.
Compare against quantumoptics.jl
I think it would be worthwhile just to illustrate how simulation times scale with eg.
We could also consider comparing the simulation times using our constructed Hamiltonian versus constructing an analogous Hamiltonian completely within the preconstructed framework of QuantumOptics.jl. If there's a substantial improvement in efficiency for certain classes of dynamics, it would be worth highlighting that.
