The current implementation of Executor.execute_in_conda_env() has a few issues.
It is actually a feature of LocalExecutor(), not general executors, because it shells out to a Python interpreter on the dispatcher's computer.
It actually passes the string representation of function inputs to the shell script and therefore would not work with general input types, such as object references.
This can be closed now. As of #1169, BaseExecutor no longer contains any conda env logic.
