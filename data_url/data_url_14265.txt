It would be nice to test the ParameterExpression & co both for symengine and sympy. As @mtreinish explained in a comment in the link above, currently both are tested implicitly since the CI on Windows doesn't support symengine. However to properly test this and keep the tests in the future we should explicitly test both engines.
