If we have a circuit depending on parameters, it is possible to set some parameters as trainable or not trainable. Then, it is possible to recover only the trainable one or all of them. Can we add a feature to retrieve the non trainable parameters as well?
As a related request, we could use the set_parameters method to modify trainable or non trainable parameters.
