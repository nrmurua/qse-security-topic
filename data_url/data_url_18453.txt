There are some setf calls in chip-reader.lisp (and perhaps in chip-specification.lisp) that can't be converted to use the pretty chip-spec-... accessors because they aren't accessorsâ€”we only wrote their reader halves. Someone with some free time and an interest in code cleanliness could add these setters and convert the verbose / abstraction-breaking setfs to use them instead.
(Such call sites can be pretty reliably found with C-s (setf (vnth.)
This sounds like a job for @appleby. But it really is a good first issue, so if anyone else comes across this and wants to tackle it, be my guest. Otherwise, I will get around to it "eventually."
