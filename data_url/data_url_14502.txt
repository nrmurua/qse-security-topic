TemplateOptimization appears in documentation here.
However, relevant classes in the following files do not seem to appear in documentation:
qiskit/transpiler/passes/optimization/template_matching/template_matching.py
qiskit/transpiler/passes/optimization/template_matching/template_substitution.py
qiskit/transpiler/passes/optimization/template_matching/backward_match.py
qiskit/transpiler/passes/optimization/template_matching/forward_match.py
qiskit/transpiler/passes/optimization/template_matching/maximal_matches.py
See documentation search
If there is consensus, these classes should appear in API docs, along with source code, like this.

I'm not entirely sure that those classes are meant to be public, in which case they don't need to be documented - I think they're just internal data structures for the pass.  It's not entirely clear to me from the history of #4552, though.  Those template classes have very sparse documentation, so it really would be good to get proper documentation written for them if they're meant to be public.  I'd also point out that the module source code is not the principle form of API documentation - that's something that Sphinx largely does by default.
(I would also check that you're using the latest version of the Qiskit documentation when you're looking stuff up - some of your links are to very old versions of the documentation, though the same problem is present in the current version.)
