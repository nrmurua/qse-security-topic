As I discussed with @stavros11 in person, Qiskit has a built-in function that returns all marginal expectation values from commuting observables of a fixed measurement set. A function like this is useful for several applications, e.g. evaluating several terms of a Hamiltonian with just one measurement setup.
I'm not sure if this is relevant anymore, so I'm closing it.
