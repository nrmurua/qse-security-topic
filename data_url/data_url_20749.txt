SPX_WOTS_LEN2 is defined as 3 (here)
SPX_WOTS_LOGW is defined as 4 (couple of lines before)
(SPX_WOTS_LEN2 * SPX_WOTS_LOGW + 7) / 8 then equals 2.375, thus the array creation fails, because it obviously requires integer number.
Am I completely stupid and overlooking something?
I see that these values are taken from here, just hard coded for SPX_WOTS_W = 16 and SPX_N = 32. However I see that PQClean's tests are working fine. How so?
Ok, so I guess array initialization with float size just floors the number automatically.
In C, integers do not get promoted to floats, so division truncates.
