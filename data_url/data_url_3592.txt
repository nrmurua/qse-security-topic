Hi,
This feels embarrassing but I have been trying for a while and have not been able to import pyquil.

I used pip3 install and it worked fine, path of the config seems fine.
Though...

What could have gone wrong?
@vaibhawc Are you still having this problem?
I am sorry for this extremely late reply. I am not a regular coder.
I am still getting this error.
try installing anaconda and then using conda install -c rigetti pyquil. This generally just works ™️
If I had to guess, you probably installed pyquil into a different python environment than the one you're trying to import it from. I think if you're going to use the system python3 then you have to install with pip3. pip will probably install for python 2
I followed what you said in first point.
I am still getting same errors.

I am unable to guess what could have gone wrong.
try conda install -c rigetti --force pyquil to force it to re-install
That made it work!
Please explain what could have went wrong and why this worked.?
