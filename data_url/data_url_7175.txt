@benoitseron As I was saying the changes are from this line and the definition of GramMatrix above. Do you agree to define Input in this way?
It is a small change just to avoid repetitive stuff as
G = GramMatrix{ToyModel}(n, gram_matrix_toy_model(n, x))
input = Input{ToyModel}(first_modes(n,m), G)
which now will simply be
input = Input{ToyModel}(first_modes(n,m), distinguishability).
This allows also to have (almost) the same args of the functions
In addition, I still think that defining Input in this way won't make things more difficult when implementing others kind of states
