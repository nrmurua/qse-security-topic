@tnguyen-ornl at some point will you try to build xacc with homebrew installed GCC 10 and see if you see the same error.
I can confirm that I'm also seeing this error when installing the latest GCC 10 with homebrew.
Looks like this is a version mismatch issue b/w Apple-provided headers and the one Homebrew is using.
For example, homebrew is providing a header, e.g. /usr/local/Cellar/gcc/10.2.0_2/lib/gcc/10/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin18/10.2.0/include-fixed/stdio.h, based off the latest Apple SDK version which is beyond the one we could install on mojave.
Looking at the Apple source code for the stdio.h, they switched to including the header _ctermid.h since version 13XX
https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-1353.11.2/include/stdio.h.auto.html
Before that, the stdio.h has the content of _ctermid.h inlined in stdio.h
https://opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/Libc-1272.250.1/include/stdio.h.auto.html
This is similar to the one in /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr/include/stdio.h.
It means that the SDK on mojave won't have the _ctermid.h file that the .../10.2.0/include-fixed/stdio.h expected.
Note that this is more complicated than this _ctermid.h header alone. Manually copying this file to the SDK reveals other incompatiblity issues (one of them seems related to https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=90835).
To fix this locally, I need to resort to forcing Homebrew to use gcc.rb Formula at commit fe1fe412dacc2efea86ba07abf6378db0fe7a3cb. This seems to work around this issue for the time-being while waiting for a proper fix from Homebrew (or Apple provides a way to upgrade the SDK on mojave)
to use working gcc
