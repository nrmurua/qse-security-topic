after QPY serialization + deserialization
prints:
both outputs should be the same, i.e. with open-controls, and _dirty_ancillas=True for the final operation

Thanks for this report.  I agree, this just looks like an oversight in QPY - these multi-controlled gate objects aren't heavily used in most cases (they're more properly compiler syntheses, but for historical reasons exposed through the circuit library), which is probably how they've got overlooked.  You're right that they need their additional attributes handling specially in QPY.
