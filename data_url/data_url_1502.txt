Description of the issue
The last release(s) did not get synced to Zenodo for some reason, it still shows 0.12.0 as the latest.

Cirq version
0.13.1
Pinging @MichaelBroughton for insight. We might have missed a step in the 0.13 release - it's possible that the release doc needs to be updated to include this.
I wasn't able to find any docs for how this was setup. I'm like 40% sure I can't access the Cirq Github Zenodo entry here when I log in on the website. https://zenodo.org/record/5182845#.YdapfnXMKUk It appears to be linked to the quantumlib organization via webhooks (although I can't seem to get history on them for some reason), @balopat would you be able to give a little more information on how to access this and test it ?
Hey @MichaelBroughton,
As, after I left Google, my "owner" status on the project was revoked, it probably removed the authorization for the zenodo github automation integration. Reference docs: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content.
The bad news is that, surprisingly, Zenodo does not support sharing of uploads between multiple users zenodo/zenodo#151 ðŸ‘Ž . The good news is that support is coming soon.
Options I see:
Any other thoughts?
Ah, they replied - through support we can transfer the ownership to one person. Who should that be?
I think I have ownership of Cirq, ReCirq and qsim.
Ideally it would be a group account, rather than a person, so that if we encounter this again before their multiple-user support goes through we don't have to do this again. Not sure if there's a good account for that, though.
I have made an account for quacs at google.com.  Can we transfer ownership to that account?
I have stored the password in our lovely internal password tool.
Updated Zenodo to cirq 0.14.1 and added instructions on how to do this in the future.
