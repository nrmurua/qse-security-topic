Hi,
I install strawberryfield 0.17.0 from github release and run pytest on openSUSE Tumbleweed
I got the error below.
Since the test did not pass, do I need _einsum_v1 patch? How do I get it?
Is it fine to ignore this error? Or something wrong with my installation?

Hi @kevinsmia1939, it is fine to ignore this, this is just a test comment (it is not an error or a warning)
