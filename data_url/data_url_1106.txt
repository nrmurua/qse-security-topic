Currently it doesn't check that the args match for gates. See TODO in serializable_device.py
Assigned this one to @dstrain115 because he left the TODO with his name in it, but feel free to unassign :)
Likely stale now that we are deprecating SerializableDevice, but will assign to myself to double check later whether this applies to the new device implementation.
