udev rule applied. problem persists following reboot.
Can you run:
$ lsusb -t | grep ftdi_sio
It should print something like:
|__ Port 1: Dev 13, If 0, Class=Vendor Specific Class, Driver=ftdi_sio, 480M
But with different "Port" and "Dev" value.
Can you then do:
$ ls -lh /dev/bus/usb/001 if Port is 1
It's difficult to find the real issue without your help.
Do you have xc3sprog installed? Also, the script should display a better error message when xc3sprog is not found.
I'm away from Boulder. I'll be back on Thursday and will check this then.

Just tested it OK with the latest conda package (1626).
