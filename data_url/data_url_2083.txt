I'm using pycharm and running the following script in console (I think this takes you to an iPython environment)
The resulting output seems to continue the circuit diagram into the next line.

I suspect that this is an iPython issue, as I do not see this if I just run the script directly or in a colab notebook. Any suggestions on how to fix this?
It turns out you need to turn off the "Soft-Wrap" option in the console settings (top right button below).
