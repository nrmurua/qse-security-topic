To remove the results returned by Scipy's minimize function.
Note: Some of the evaluations made using the scipy minimize function, for methods that use the jacobian, are not kept tracked off.
To create a way to record the number of evaluations from both the function calls to optimise_this and the those used to compute the jacobian.
The Backend Class returns the appropriate callback function for the jacobian evaluations. We can make modifications to that callback to capture the information we need to return to the user.
To make sure every call to .expectation of the backend class is recorded/kept track off.
For methods like BFGS, it calls the optimise_this method. We need to make sure we are updating the log lists appropriately.
Pull Request Removes the scipy.minimize output.
For now the "number of evals" key in the output dictionary only records the evaluations performed with respect to the number of times optimize_this was called in the OptimizeVQA function.
We still have to implement a way of logging the number of evaluations required for computing the jacobian in gradient-based methods.
