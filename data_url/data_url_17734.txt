After #1278 and #1276, the latex and matplotlib have a bug in drawing conditional gates:
This code:
was drawn correctly before these 2 recent PR merges:

but with this patch the conditional vertical wire is gone:

This is also an issue with the mpl drawer:

But the text drawer is fine:
Yeah, taking a brief look at the code this is being caused by the _get_instructions() output returning different data from the transpiler json format. It used to be op['conditional'] which would have a hex bitmask value. Now it's returning a bit label and is op['condition'] (so the drawers don't even know there is a conditional) we'll need to adjust the drawing code for conditionals to handle the new info.
