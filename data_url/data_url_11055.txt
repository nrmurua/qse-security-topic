I am trying to install quantum-grove through Anaconda and also using "pip install -e " after downloading the grove-master zip file. But there is error every time. I have attached the screenshot what it is saying every time. I have already installed pyquil-master using "pip install -e", no issue occurred at that time.

Thanks for reporting this @riyasett . We'll have a look and update you if we find out what happened.
@mpharrigan would you mind taking a stab at this?
Hello,
Finally, it worked. I don't know how. I was just kept trying to install it in the same way and it is finally installed. Thank you all...
@riyasett Glad to hear it finally worked. I will close this ticket now. Feel free to re-open if you run into any new troubles
