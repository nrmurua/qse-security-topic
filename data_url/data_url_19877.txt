Preserving @baentsch's suggestion from #1618 so that it doesn't get buried after the merge:
I don't know how to change the "2 approvals needed" rule to only apply to certain directories -- we can apply it only to certain branches, but I don't see directories as an option.
Hmm -- just read the documentation and I also didn't find a way how to do that. A bit disappointing, I'd say. But what I did find is an option that demands approval by code owners. And that can be set to specific directories, right? So what about the idea to carefully define code ownership(s), set this flag and revert back to just 1 review needed for PRs? Not ideal if there's a sole code owner designated for some sections and that person isn't around -- in such case the 4 eyes rule would be better again...
