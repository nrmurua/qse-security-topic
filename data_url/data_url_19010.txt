Currently jobs submitted to the qiskit interface can only contain a single circuit. Even if the qiskit experiment object has more than one circuit, the same is ignored in the present implementation.
It should be possible to submit multiple distinct qiskit circuits in a single job as part of the experiment object. These circuits should be run on the simulator and the results returned in the qiskit result object using the standard API.
See for example how the calibration runs in the Full Loop are extremely slow because each ORBIT circuit is submitted as a separate job
It is important to also note here that currently the qiskit interface recomputes the propagators every time a job is submitted and run. There needs to be a check to ensure that propagators are recomputed only when model or signal parameters have been updated or when a recompute is manually triggered by the user. It might be prudent to have the default setting be "recomputation for every new job" once the "multi-circuit-experiment" section has been implemented. It is fair to assume that all circuits in an experiment object have the same set of model/signal parameters and do not need a propagator recomputation during the course of execution of the experiment.
