The definition of clbit_labels was changed in #879 by @dcmckayibm.
It used to be something like:
[["c", 2], ["d", 3]] , which assigns contiguous regions of memory to each register.
Now it is like this, where single classical bits can be assigned to arbitrary locations of memory.
[["c", 1], ["c", 0], ["d", 0], ["d", 2], ["d", 1]]
I agree with this change. However, the schema currently also allows something like this for clbit_labels.
[["c", 1], ["c", 0], ["d", 0], ["d", 2], ["d", 1], null, null]
I don't think the schema should allow this. I want to have a convention that for each experiment, memory_slots defines the total amount of classical (slow) memory bits for that experiment, and clbit_labels have a 1-1 correspondence with those.
It is fine for qubit_labels to have null, as the device can have more qubits than used for an experiment. But clbit_labels should just be as many classical bits as the experiment uses.
By the way this information is important for Terra to be able to rebuild the original circuit registers in the Result.
I agree.
Sure
