Currently nist-branch isn't building on Linux because we aren't able to combine our various binaries into a single library without running into problems.  This issue is a place for us to discuss. @smashra if you are still having trouble with this, can you try to write up a quick summary of where things stand. Maybe @tlepoint will have some ideas.
Fixed in ea810c8.
