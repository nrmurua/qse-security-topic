I believe this is a feature that exists for instance in Mathematica:
Whenever a message repeats itself several times, just write in the console that other occurences of the message will be removed.
Maybe there is even support for that in the logging module ?
For instance when acquiring with a too small number of avg with the network analyzer, you get a new Info message after each trace, which is very annoying...
