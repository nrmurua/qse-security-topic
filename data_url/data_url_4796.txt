At the moment, the test suite currently accepts Fock basis cutoff dimension as a test hyperparameter. However, I've noticed that this is something very rarely used, and every single test in the test suite is written to pass with a cutoff dimension of 6 (the current default).
I suggest we remove this as a test parameter/fixture, and simply use 6 as the global default, while allowing tests to override this default if needed. This is better for three reasons:
It removes any confusion from a user passing a specific cutoff parameter to the test suite, and not realising that some tests override this
it is better practice to write tests for a particular fixed cutoff value
It is near impossible to write tests that will pass for any cutoff value. Tests which we know work could fail simply by passing --cutoff=5 rather than the default of 6, which is poor UX for a user.

Except for the ones that don't ðŸ˜º
Anyway, I think this is a good change, will make things much more clear, and is pretty easy to do (just remove the user's ability to change this)
Closing obsolete issue. Fixed when porting test suite to pytest in v0.10.0.
