After reading https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3468263 one might be tempted to activate more compiler warning flags than just -Wall -Wextra). When doing this in liboqs (only adding -Wnull-dereference and -Wduplicated-branches) the following code "shortcomings" are unearthed:
-> Might it be worth while notifying upstream code maintainers of this and if fixed, also activating these warnings when building liboqs? Another idea may be to activate -fanalyzer when moving to gcc10/11. Any other flags worth while adding to make the code even more robust?
Not receiving comments probably means this is not exactly relevant. Keeping open for some time, but labeling "future work"
re: -fanalyzer: I've experimented with it in PQClean/PQClean#449 but it has problems with the current version of the SPHINCS+ implementation in PQClean/liboqs. Once PQClean/PQClean#470 is merged I think the implementations in PQClean all pass under -fanalyzer (and I want to rebase that PR and undraft it then)
