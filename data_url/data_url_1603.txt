Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
It would be great if the processor would "know" what gateset it accepts - instead of having to pass that in. I find this rather odd. While there is a way to list processors using the Engine API or the UI, there is no way to tell what gate set a processor accepts. The processor.get_device() method takes a list of gate sets which then it uses to validate operations.
Describe the solution you'd like
Instead it would be great if a gate set could be determined based on a processor ID.
Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
Alternative is to ask someone, use documentation/datasheets (if available).
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
@verult I think this can be closed as part of the device spec work.
Yep, closing in favor of #5050
