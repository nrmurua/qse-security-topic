It would be useful to add support for at least some controlled parametric gates. For example compiling
fails with the error Condition CL-QUIL::UNKNOWN-GATE-PARAMETER. The function gate-matrix first checks that all elements of the matrix are numerical values, which they are not.
The same error is thrown with the following program which writes RY explicitly
A circuit equivalent to CONTROLLED RY(theta[0]) q1 q2 that can be successfully compiled and applied is
Closed by #484.
