When a delay gate is created with units that are not dt, qpy doesn't keep track of the units.
print(str(qc) == str(new_qc)) should print True

@jakelishman  Can you please assign me this issue and issue #10582 ? I can try to fix these since they both require modification of qpy.
@Abhiraj-Shrotriya: sure, I can assign you.  This should hopefully be relatively simple change, though we'll need to be careful with backwards compatibility of the format.
@jakelishman I have fixed the issue. But I am having problems making the CIRCUIT_INSTRUCTION_V2 in qpy/binaryio/formats.py backwards compatible since unit_size must be added to it.
Should I make a V3 for it?
something like this:
Yeah, I think we'll need to make a CIRCUIT_INSTRUCTION_V3, because this problem actually runs deeper than just Delay; there's a duration and unit field on all Instruction instances not just Delay, which QPY is currently ignoring, resulting in things like #10582.  The complete solution is to add serialisation for those two fields to all instructions, and that'll definitely need the new CIRCUIT_INSTRUCTION version.
My method adds the unit field for all Instruction. My code has solved most of the problems suggested by you.
I will now work towards creating a CIRCUIT_INSTRUCTION_V3.
Any more suggestions?

Hi,
I was a little busy for the past few days but now I can work towards making a Pull Request. The work is almost over.
I am sorry for the delay. I aim to make a pull request soon.
I just wanted to ask how to implement qpy version control.
Thank you.
