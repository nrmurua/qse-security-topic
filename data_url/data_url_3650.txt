I tried to do:
	p.defgate("GROVER ORACLE", orac) 
       p.inst(tuple(["GROVER ORACLE"] + list(range(int(np.log2(len(data)))))))
which gave me the following error:
pyquil.api.errors.QVMError: Token doesn't represent an argument where expected: #S(CL-QUIL::TOKEN :TYPE :OR :PAYLOAD NIL)
It was quite unclear what the error was until I tried with another name of the Gate. The error could possibly say something like "A Gate's name cannot be multiple words" or something to make it clearer that the issue is with the gates name and not something about the "TYPE:OR".
A similar error occurs with the code:
	p.defgate("GROVER DIFF", diff)
	p.inst(tuple(["GROVER DIFF"] + list(range(int(np.log2(len(data)))))))
pyquil.api.errors.QVMError: Found formal argument where not allowed: #S(CL-QUIL::TOKEN :TYPE :NAME :PAYLOAD "DIFF") 
But that is a bit more clear because of the "DIFF" in the error, however still not telling me that the error is due to multiple words in the name.
This is a Quilc-related issue. Going to close here and reopen there.
could you link the new issue?
