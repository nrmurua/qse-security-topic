I am looking for the doc folder with the reference manual, and I cannot find it
You need to run doxygen from the project's root folder. This will generate a ./doc folder, with html and latex documentation. This is mentioned on the main page of the repo, https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp#installation-instructions-and-further-documentation
