Currently there is a known issue with /problems SAPI endpoint and filtering by non-problem-id fields (e.g. solver, status, label, etc).
We will disable live unittests for the SAPI problem filtering (as we don't actually use the feature in the cloud client yet), but I'm creating this issue as a reminder to enable them back once the SAPI bug is fixed.
