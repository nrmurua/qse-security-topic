Cutting and pasting the example given in "Overview of Estimator" almost works. But, Estimator is not imported.
This is the API doc for Primitives, not in the docstring for the Estimator class.

does allow the example to run.
The same problem occurs for Sampler. Is this intentional? Maybe the idea is that in an example in a description of a class, the reader is expected to copy the example code and then add a line to import the class being described ?
Whether it's intentional or not, I think adding a single line to these examples would make them more convenient to use.
The example for Estimator fails because of a missing import statement.
Copy and paste the example into a Python session.
The example should run and print the output.
Add a line in the example to import the class.
Hi there! Thank you for the detailed description, this is my first contrib. I started off fixing this and updated the class descriptions + example usages to match the non-depricated parts of the code.
Thank you @sebastian-mair !
