There is no link / broken link to the MEP template at
https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#proposing-a-new-feature-to-mitiq
Hi,
By the broken link are you referring to the discord link?
No, it refers to the fact that docs/mep/0000-feature-proposal-TEMPLATE.md. in the page of the link above does not take one to the linked file.
