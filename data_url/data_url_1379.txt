Summarize the task
SimulationTrialResult has the following line:

To improve this, Initially I thought we should create an interface with qubit_map and bind TSimulatorState to that. However on second thought, I think it's best to add an explicit qubit_map parameter to the SimulationTrialResult initializer. This allows more flexibility in how users implement simulators: this way it doesn't necessarily require carrying qubit_map as part of the simulator state.
Acceptance criteria - when is the task considered done?
TSimulatorState should not be bound to Any anymore.

I may have changed my mind again on this. #5317 is an example of adding qubit_map to the TrialResult constructor. It's pretty invasive and requires a deprecation cycle that messily intertwines with another deprecation on that function.
Just creating the interface is completely backwards-compatible (though requires implementations to actually inherit that interface, to satisfy mypy. Or we can just keep it as-is.
