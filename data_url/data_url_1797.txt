Feature: State, device, gate visualizations
Problem: Currently there is a visualization of state vectors as a bar graph, but very little to visualize states or results.  This feature would be to provide these visualizations.  In addition there are visualizations specific to device characterizations: the coupling heatmap as well as integrated histograms.
Rough requirements:

Cirq sync: this is complete...enough. We can open new issues if more visualizations are needed.
