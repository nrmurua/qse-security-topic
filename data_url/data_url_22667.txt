Looks like this may be python3.5 dependency. See below.
OK, this is something I caused. There are both py34 and py35 builds of pyqtgraph uploaded, but it seems that conda's dependency resolver is unable to select the right one.
In retrospect the py35 migration should have been done in a separate channel.
I should finish the migration in a moment.
The migration has been finished.
I confirm that the install now works.
Note for other users of conda deployment. Due to ARTIQ's new python 3.5
dependency you'll have to create a new environment for python 3.5 and
install ARTIQ in it.
