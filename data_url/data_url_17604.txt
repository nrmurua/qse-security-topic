If random.seed is set, and some time afterwards compile is called for a set of more than one circuit: the compilation does not terminate.
When interrupted, the following appears:
This example runs forever.
It runs fast if the line random.seed = 1 is removed, or if we compile only qc instead of [qc, qc1].
Actually the correct syntax is:
And then it's OK, so I'm not sure if there is really a bug here.
There is not, you are seeding the generator wrong:

Also, I doubt that that actually sets the seed of the qasm_simulator.  You should pass seed=1 to compile.
