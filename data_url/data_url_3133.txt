QuantumComputer.run_symmetrized_readout calls _measure_bitstrings, which calls QuantumComputer.run with no memory_map argument, so there is no way to inject parameters into the executable after compiling and before running within _measure_bitstrings, so run_symmetrized_readout doesn't work with parametric programs at present.
I'm tempted to add a memory_map argument to the compile method call within _measure_bitstrings, and expose that argument through QuantumComputer.run_symmetrized_readout.
The following program will always return all 0s because there is no opportunity to inject parameters alpha or beta to the compiled executable to rotate the state to have some |1> population:
