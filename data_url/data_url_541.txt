For our project, which uses XACC and Boost, there is a conflict where Boost (boost/config/detail/select_stdlib_config.hpp) has lines like
#include <version>
Since our include path for headers has XACC's paths first, it resolves to XACC's  (whereas Boost wants to pickup the Standard Library header with this name).
Is it possible to give include/xacc/version a different name instead?
Yea sure thing. I'll take care of that now. Will rename to xacc_version
@simon-ty everything fixed for you now?
