FakeRueschlikon is missing props, conf, and (optionally) defs files are missing at
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/tree/main/qiskit/test/mock/backends/rueschlikon
FakeTenerife could still use conf and (optionally) defs files too at:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/tree/main/qiskit/test/mock/backends/tenerife
FakeTokyo could still use conf and (optionally) defs files too at:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/tree/main/qiskit/test/mock/backends/tokyo
I don't know the full details for all three backends, but RÃ¼schlikon at least was very old and was decommissioned years ago.  With the machines long gone, we don't have enough calibrations to completely create those files, but also as in #7684, the files themselves are more an implementation detail anyway.
