On the master branch, I get an Broken pipe error when running the example notebook with
gates = MockGates('gates', model=model,server_name=None) and then later run the loop.
I can track this back all the way to the #70 merge.
@MerlinSmiles If your instruments are not in servers, they are not compatible with background loops - do they work in foreground loops? (other issues with foreground loops aside...)
I see. Then there should be a proper error message, that does not allow this combination.
All my instruments work üëç
Most errors I saw was when using non background loops...
