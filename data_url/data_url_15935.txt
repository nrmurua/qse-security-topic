When generating an entangling map by virtue of numpy arrays (e.g. np.arange(num)) it raises a ValueError
ValueError: Invalid value of entanglement: [[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]]
Minimal working example
Since map1 == map_by_hand1 is the same value, it is expected that both are viable options to pass as entangling maps.
change the isinstance() check in n_local
Is it fixed?Can I work on it?
I do not believe anyone is looking at this - any PR would be linked back to the issue and there is none. Please, if you'd like to take a look at do so. Again a unit test, as I commented in the the issue you raised.
I tried creating a PR but it shows commits from earlier issue I was working on. How do I get around that? @Cryoris @woodsp-ibm
You can rebase, starting from the first commit you want to remove (say with the SHA SHA_FIRST) and then mark all commits with drop that you don't want:
I am lost here. Can I instead delete my fork and refork and start over? @Cryoris
If you're talking about #6556 the commit history looks fine to me, you can leave that as is.
@Cryoris I deleted my fork and did all from start
