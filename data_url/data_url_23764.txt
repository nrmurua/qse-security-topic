Like every other scienc-y project we need to add a bibtex/similar ref.
Great suggestion from @eendebakpt !
We'll use zenodo  DOI, once v0.1.2 is released!

The author list is all broken, but can be fixed by adding a .zenodo.json  to the root dir, and maintaining the list manually.
If somebody cares a lot about the author list,  say something :D
