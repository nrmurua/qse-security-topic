I looked into this when I saw #5665 filed earlier this morning:
#5665 (comment)
So I took a quick look to dig into this issue this morning. The issue is the CommutativeCancellation transpiler pass isn't basis gate aware and only knows how to use the U1 gates for z rotations: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/transpiler/passes/optimization/commutative_cancellation.py
To fix this we probably either need to update the pass to basis aware, or update the default level2 pass manager to run basis translation in the fixed point loop after we run commutative cancellation.
@mtreinish I have a version which updates the pass to be basis aware. I thought this might avoid calling basis translation again.
My concern with that was it's still only going to work for a subset of basis out there. I don't think we can remove the basis translator and still handle any universal basis set. Like what if the basis is composed of completely custom gates?
I think we probably should do both approaches together, with ewinston@90864c5 commutative cancellation will use the basis if it knows about it, but if it doesn't it'll use a standard gate and rely on the basis translator to handle the conversion.
@mtreinish I think using both approaches sounds like a reasonable short term solution. If we don't guarantee transformation passes keep within a target basis then following up with translation would be necessary. Perhaps an intermediate solution (not in this issue) would for passes to indicate whether they respect target basis. Then applying the basis translator could be done only when needed.
