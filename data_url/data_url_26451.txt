See COSTA issue #19.
@mtaillefumier Could you have a look at this issue?
@mkrack: It should be fixed now with #2781.
Confirmed, the build of generic cp2k binaries works again.
Thanks for the fix @mtaillefumier
I need to fix yet another small issue in the cp2k cmake build system. I thought I had it fixed already but it is not.
