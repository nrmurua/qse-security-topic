Trying to install artiq 3.1 from the conda channel on Windows 7 gives the following error:
Well the package is there:
https://anaconda.org/m-labs/llvmlite-artiq
Try installing it manually...
We only have 0.10.0dev for 32-bit Windows.
Is that 32-bit Windows? Conda + win32 + python3.5 is broken. Reintroducing win32 needs #652.
Hi.
Yes, that was on 32 bit windows.  Trying to install on Linux gives a dependency error for prettytable:
Error: Dependency missing in current linux-64 channels:
- artiq-kc705-nist_qc2 3.1* -> artiq 3.1 py_0+git4c2f25eq -> prettytable
The Linux version we're running is 64 bit Ubunutu 14.04.5 LTS.  I'll see if I can install the prettytable package manually.
We can also try building from source, we were just trying to avoid the extra compile time.
Are you perhaps missing the conda-forge channel?
It was missing the conda-forge channel.  That fixed it.
