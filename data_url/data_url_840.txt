Describe the feature you'd like
The local simulator supports using OpenQASM gate modifiers through its OpenQASM interface. I would like to be able to use gate modifiers from the BDK Circuit class when using the local simulator.
How would this feature be used? Please describe.
Users could modify gates in a circuit as it is constructed. For example:
Describe alternatives you've considered
This is currently attainable by using an OpenQASM string to define the circuit.
Additional context
I will begin working on the implementation for this feature on the branch feature/gate-modifiers
