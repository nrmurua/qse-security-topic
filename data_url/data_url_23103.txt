In IQ mode, even the smallest non-zero value of quadrature_factor (4e-3) seems to saturate the scope trace when a 1V amplitude signal is inputed in the spectrum analyzer. That's probably not normal ?
This might have been intentional for a better SNR at the time. Does it behave normal if you enter with a reduced amplitude (0.5V)? In that case, we can just reduce the gain of the first mutliplication by a factor of 2, possibly adding an extra bit after the decimal point and it should be much clearer, right?
OK, coming back to the problem, it looks like there are actually 2 problems:
the debugging chain:
maybe swap the scope traces and see if the problem persists
OK, so to summarize our discussion:
