Using 2.0rc1 on windows if I set up arguments as follows,
On the gui I see,
x0:2
x1:11
x3:1e3
x4:1e4
x5:1e5
However, the value 100001 gets printed. Would it be possible to have the displayed instead of 1e5?. Increasing ndecimals can solve this but it changes the type of the argument from int to float.
