Hello,
I tried to build openfermion on linux openSUSE Tumbleweed.
I noticed that there are files that were placed in usr/openfermion/.
This location are discourage and should be avoid.
Thanks.
Can you tell us what commands you used to produce that output?

Hello,
I use openSUSE build service which can build package from source code.
This is the repository I made for openfermion.
https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:andythe_great/python-openfermion
Here is the .spec file which contain instruction to build the package from source.
https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/home:andythe_great/python-openfermion/python-openfermion.spec?expand=1
Here is the RPMLINT output that you see.

@kevinsmia1939 to my knowledge we don't explicitly put any files in /usr/openfermion.  I'm not familiar with this build system so I can't even guess why you are hitting this particular problem.  Has this come up with any other python projects and this build system?

I have a feeling that if the data_files is not given a relative directory, it would go to /usr/ by default?
It was given openfermion/examples as directory but it understand as /usr/openfermion/examples?

At present, we only officially support installation via pip, and we follow normal Python packaging guidelines for setup.py. We strongly encourage the use of a virtual environment to avoid polluting system directories.
It's great that you're packaging this up for a linux distro! We'll accept any patches that makes your life easier and doesn't interfere with normal installation into a python virtualenv.
