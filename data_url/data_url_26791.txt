Is there a reason why the Dockerfiles in cp2k/tools/toolchain/ aren't mentioned in cp2k/INSTALL.md ?
Unfortunately, so far we only use docker for testing. We don't have a Dockerfile to build a production binary. Until then, I think, it makes little sense to point the users to the toolchain Dockerfile.
I'll rename this issue accordingly.
