Method tune_sync_delay in class AD9910 throws underflow error, even when called with (presumably) enough slack.
After initialising cpld and all AD9910 channels, I call method tune_sync_delay() on one of the channels, but an RTIOUnderflow exception is reported in clear_smp_err when it tries to write to SPI bus or pulse io_update high.
Check valid sync_delays and windows and return optimum values.
Sometimes finds valid delay and window and sometimes throws RTIOUnderflow exception.
I haven't seen this and can't reproduce it here. But this is likely fixed by the above change. Could you try?
Does this also affect 4.0? If yes, and this fixes it, it should be cherry-picked.
Commit  b25ab1f fixed this issue, but I have not tried under the 4.0 version yet.
