/usr/local/include/dimod/iterators.h:82:5: error: 'const' qualifier on reference type 'dimod::ConstQuadraticIterator::reference' (aka 'dimod::ConstQuadraticIterator::value_type &') has no effect [-Werror,-Wignored-reference-qualifiers]
const reference operator*() const { return *term_ptr_; }
I believe you're on an older version, because in 0.11.6 that line does not match.
Sorry, /usr/local/include/dimod had old, stray installation of the previous version.
