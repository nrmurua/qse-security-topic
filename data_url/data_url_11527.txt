On some runs of GroverOptimizer, it may fail a range assertion in GroverOptimizer._twos_complement.
This code executes non-deterministically since we cannot currently set a seed for a QuantumInstance #1408, and will often succeed but occasionally throws the following exception:
The algorithm terminates without exceptions for any simulator output, including noisy ones.
It's best to wait until #1408 has been fixed so you can target a specific simulator seed that reliably hits the exception.
The assertion in GroverOptimizer._twos_complement is for the wrong range: an n-bit twos complement number lives in the range [-2^(n-1), 2^(n-1)). In particular, if you pass a number between -2^n and -2^(n-1) into this method, not only will it pass the assertion, but the output may not have the correct number of bits in the bitstring, so both branches of this method should ideally go via the same formatting procedure.
Regardless of the value of threshold, adding it to a number will change its range and so potentially require additional bits to express as a twos complement binary string. Increasing the number of bits used in the conversion here would be needed for correctness. I don't really understand the use of the variable v in this method, but if it is possible to rewrite this method to not require converting back to a bitstring, that would probably be much easier to maintain.
I can confirm this issue and also that using the two's complement of v is not required, that's also what #1386 tackled. I'm pulling up a PR to remove that part.
we planned to use this as part of a TKET seminar next week, any workaround/quick solution would be highly appreciated :-)
This should be fixed, let us know if it's working now!

Although this was fixed on the master branch on 23 Nov 2020, it is still present in the 0.8.2 release of qiskit-aqua (released 8 Feb 2021).
What is the schedule for releasing the fix?
