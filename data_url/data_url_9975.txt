When a large BinaryPolynomial instance is converted to a QUBO using make_quadratic, the recursive procedure exceeds maximum recursion depth.
Here is an example that reproduces the problem.
This should successfully return a bqm object instance. However, an error is raised instead,
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
and,
TypeError: unsupported callable
