(I have the feeling there is already an issue for this topic but can't seem to find it - apologies if it ends up being a duplicated issue).
After #1323, the basis_gates for a backend is defined in its configuration as a list:
Traditionally, we have been passing a comma-separated string around for the internal functions (throughout the transpiler layers), which is a tad ackward and cumbersome (specially since the final "consumers" of the basis gates end up splitting the string into a list, such as the DAGBackend).
Actually one of the changes in #1323 was actually to "stringify" back the basis gates at the right point in the transpilation process, mostly for avoiding modifying the function signatures. It might be a good time to avoid that going back and forth entirely, making it always a list throughout the whole transpilation process.
Remove the default value for basis_gates in the functions involved in the transpilation process, updating the docstrings and ensuring that it is handled properly at the main entry point. A potential drawback is that we might need to change the format of the argument in the public compile() method, deprecating or similar (although might not be a concern if we mostly keep the change internal).
