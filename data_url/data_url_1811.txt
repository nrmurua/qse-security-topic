Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
The transform_qubits method in Circuit and Operation only accepts functions. In contrast, CircuitOperation also accepts qubit-to-qubit maps in with_qubit_mapping (Highlighted by @maffoo in #3580).
Describe the solution you'd like
The transform_qubits method should be updated to also accept qubit-to-qubit maps everywhere that it is defined.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - nice to have, but not urgent; we should do it in the next couple of quarters
