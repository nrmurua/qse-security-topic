Currently results are stored in local FS. We need to change this so that they are stored in a DB.
No response
This issue is now going to track the implementation of the data/workflow microservice, which is limited to the following API methods.
GET /workflow/results/{dispatch_id}
Queries the DB on dispatch_id key. The DB should return unique IDs for results objects associated with this workflow. This service should then call /fs/download to get the results objects and return them to the user.
PUT /workflow/results/{dispatch_id}
Queries the DB on dispatch_id key. The DB should return unique IDs for results objects associated with this workflow. This service should then call /fs/upload to update the results objects in the object store. It may also update the DB record with new IDs if new objects are created.
POST /workflow/results
Uploads results to the object store by calling /fs/upload. Inserts a new DB record with dispatch_id key and values for the unique ID of the results object. Returns dispatch ID.
Important note, we are changing the original plan so that we are not storing results in the DB directly. Results are stored in the object store.
