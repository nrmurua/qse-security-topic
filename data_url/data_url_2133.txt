The on method always returns an operation with gate IdentityGate not my subclass. This has seriously messed me up and wasn't always the case
git blame shows #1765
update: it returns an IdentityOperation which obliterates the custom logic in my subclass
You can override on, but as noted in #2520 the proper fix is likely to just delete the now-redundant IdentityOperate.
I believe this has been fixed with the removal of IdentityOperation.
