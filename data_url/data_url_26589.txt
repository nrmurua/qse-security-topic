Hello,
Used with CP2K, USPEX creates a file containing the cell parameters and atom positions named "subsys.uspex", which can conveniently be included in the Specific files cp2k_options_1 with the line:
@include 'subsys.uspex'
The problem is that the section &SUBSYS in my cp2k_options_1 already contains info about atom types like:
&SUBSYS
&KIND C
BASIS_SET DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH
POTENTIAL GTH-NLCC-PBE-q4
&END KIND
&END SUBSYS
@include 'subsys.uspex'
and the keyword &SUBSYS cannot be used more than once, whereas it is also present in subsys.uspex:
&SUBSYS
&CELL
ABC [angstrom] 4.0505422775 5.829809608 2.280013981
ALPHA_BETA_GAMMA [deg] 90 90 90
PERIODIC XYZ

&END
&END SUBSYS
I tried to find the source file to remove the lines &SUBSYS and &END SUBSYS created by USPEX, but there is none. My guess is it's embedded in the MATLAB file, which cannot be openly modified. So I have no way to make USPEX work properly with CP2K. Besides it should rather be a 'cell.uspex' file rather than a 'subsys.uspex' file which is created by USPEX.
Please advise.
Thank you,
Xavier
Seems to me a problem for the USPEX developers.
Or you can run a script ahead of CP2K that strips your file
from the &SUBSYS ...&END SUBSYS lines.
Indeed more an USPEX problem. I also posted it in USPEX forum.
USPEX generates hundreds or thousands of structures for crystal discovery. And I don't know yet if ducking a script after USPEX generates a structure and before CP2K reads the input file is possible.
Maybe the easiest way at that time would be to modify the "@include" function of CP2K to ditch the 1st and last lines. Or it could work with just ditching the 1st line if I use @include to close the &SUBSYS section. Do you know the source file of CP2K managing the @include function?
If you want to hack it for personal use:
src/input/cp_parser_inpp_methods.F -- line 119
Note that USPEX 10.5.1 corrects this issue.
