iirc, This discrepancy didn't show up the first time you tried a windows build in Travis. If that is correct, could you provide some detail on what changed between then and now in the build?
Is it a problem with rendering PhasedX gates in particular or is it a problem with optimizers.merge_single_qubit_gates_into_phased_x_z?
@c-poole These tests weren't in the codebase last time I ran the Windows Travis build (about a month ago).
@mlihc15 Yeah, this probably doesn't have to do with the rendering because the only problem we seem to be having here is Y^-0.5 not being converted to PhasedX(-0.5)^0.5. This seems to be related to Windows somehow.
If you try to construct a PhasedX(-0.5)^0.5 cirq will recognize that as a Y^-0.5 and return that instead, but this relies on the -0.5 in the PhasedX passing a float equality comparison, so it isn't too terribly surprising that floating point comparisons are causing system dependent differences. What seems to matter in this test is whether the circuits produced are equivalent and whether they pass the validate_circuit method of ion_device. I rewrote the tests with this in mind and they pass so I'll put in a PR for it.
