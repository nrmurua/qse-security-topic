When a user writes a circuit against an abstract qubit set like LineQubit, and then wants to place that onto an XmonDevice, there needs to be code that goes through each of the operations rewriting the qubits and checking that the new operation is actually valid. Thus: switch_device.
It should take a device new_device, and a function qubit_func that takes an existing qubit and returns the qubit on the new device.
@dabacon This is part of adding device to circuit. @mrwojtek You will probably find this useful for the placement code, since you need a step like this.
I'm going through our external APIs:
Other options I can think of:
Here is the rough workflow that I imagine:
@mrwojtek pointed out that it is very easy to accidentally pass a qubit order for the line qubits into the simulate/run methods, instead of the xmon qubits.
This is fixed now. Circuit has a method with_device, which is what switch_device turned into.
