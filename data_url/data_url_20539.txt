When i run the command
make -j
I face the following error please help me to solve this issue
make[1]: *** [Makefile:3188: crypto/ec/oqs_meth.o] Error 1 make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/moeed/openssl' make: *** [Makefile:178: build_libs] Error 2
@Moeed148a You didn't give more details about your problem but I believe that it is the same as mine:
crypto/ec/oqs_meth.c error: 'OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_1024_90s' undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean 'OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_1024'?
257 |       return OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_1024_90s;
and this repeat to all algorithms that I know there are not standardized:
257 |       return OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_1024_90s;
254 |       return OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_768_90s;
251 |       return OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_512_90s;
212 |       return OQS_SIG_alg_sphincs_shake256_128f_simple;
208 |       return OQS_SIG_alg_sphincs_sha256_128s_simple;
204 |       return OQS_SIG_alg_sphincs_sha256_128f_robust;
200 |       return OQS_SIG_alg_sphincs_haraka_128f_simple;
196 |       return OQS_SIG_alg_sphincs_haraka_128f_robust;
185 |       return OQS_SIG_alg_dilithium_5_aes;
182 |       return OQS_SIG_alg_dilithium_3_aes;
179 |       return OQS_SIG_alg_dilithium_2_aes;
You should edit this file crypto/ec/oqs_meth.c and remove these references.
Another file that you have to edit is ssl/statem/../ssl_local.h and remove references to:
OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_1024_90s;
OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_768_90s;
OQS_KEM_alg_kyber_512_90s;
It is just a try to help and you should wait until some in the project answer you.
This will be fixed once #445 lands.
I have made the changes in the file and got the following status when i run make -j command. Is this is completely installed and also i want to generate the kyber512 keypair which command i will use?

See https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl#running.
A more complete set of command sequences to exercise liboqs and openssl are contained in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/scripts/runtests.sh.
I have followed the following commands
sudo apt install cmake gcc libtool libssl-dev make ninja-build git
I have downloaded Openssl 1.1.1
git clone --branch OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl.git OPENSSL
I have downloaded the liboqs
git clone --branch main https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
Then i make directory and move to build directory in liboqs
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/moeed/Desktop/OPENSSL/oqs ..
ninja
ninja install
Build the fork
./Configure no-shared linux-x86_64 -lm
make
After this i run the following command
apps/openssl req -x509 -new -newkey kyber512 -keyout kyber512_CA.key -out kyber512_CA.crt -nodes -subj "/CN=oqstest CA" -days 365 -config apps/openssl.cnf
Then i got the following error
Unknown algorithm kyber512

My Operating system is ubuntu 20
Openssl version is OpenSSL 1.1.1f  31 Mar 2020
Kindly help me
I'm getting different error when running make -j



@yacoubhanna You are falling into the trap documented in the Note at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/#step-1-build-and-install-liboqs (OpenSSL 3 vs 1). Allow me to suggest using OpenSSL3 (and oqsprovider) to avoid all these problems.
My Operating system is ubuntu 20 Openssl version is OpenSSL 1.1.1f 31 Mar 2020
Kindly help me
You are apparently not using the oqs-openssl binary, so no PQ algorithms are available. In a first-term CS course I'd suggest checking PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
I have checked the PATH. The file is liboqs.a (which is the static one) and I can't able to find the liboqs.so (shared library).
What i do now.

Even when the chech the openssl version it shows the following

But after the installing the shared library when i run it show the following error


While the liboqs.so.2 is available in the

I'd seriously suggest you use a pre-build docker image with well-defined environment, e.g., "openquantumsafe/curl" (openssl111) or "openquantumsafe/oqs-ossl3" (openssl3).
Closing due to inactivity. Feel free to re-open when new information is available (and/or openssl3 doesn't work).
