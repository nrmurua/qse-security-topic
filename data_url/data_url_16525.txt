There are situations where matplotlib representation of the circuit fails
In the following circuit example, crx gates and x gates are overlapped, wires are not shown so the entire circuit is not well represented by matplotlib however the ASCII representation is correct:

A correct visualisation of the circuit using mpl
Confirmed, this seems to affect the entanglement gates CRX and CRY -- CRZ and all other work.
This is one of a number of issues with the mpl drawer. See my comment from yesterday at #4580.
This visualization is used in Qiskit circuit n-local documentation and following indications we are moving from ASCII hardcoded representation to mpl jupyter-execute code block
Right. This displays fine with the new version I mentioned in the #4580 comment.
