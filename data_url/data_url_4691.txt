It works to use feed-forwarding to use measured values as parameters in gate applications. Specifically, there seems to be an issue with older MeasuredParameter objects being cached and reused when using together with mathematical operation (such as in the example below).
Consistently, but only under very specific circumstances where SymPy seems to be caching symbolic parameters.
