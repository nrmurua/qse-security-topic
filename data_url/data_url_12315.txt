when I trying to do import tensorflow_quantum as tfq
I got error like this :
NotFoundError: NotFoundError: D:\download\anaconda\envs\tensorflowq\Lib\site-packages\tensorflow_quantum\core\ops_tfq_simulate_ops.so not found
Package lists: python = 3.7.0    tensorflow = 2.2.0    tensorflow-quantum = 0.3.1    cirq = 0.8.0
What should I do?
tfq 0.3.1 has requirements tensorflow==2.1.0 based on the requirements txt
your suggested solution worked, thank you very much!
