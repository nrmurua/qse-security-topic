Have you read this paper?
I understand Quantum++ has the MODMUL to facilitate Shor's algorithm, but an oracle built from fundamental quantum gates would be much more intuitive and compelling. I have googled and found that a lot of papers are trying to achieve that with little success, let alone implementing that in a C++ library.
If Quantum++ implements a function that could return a string that represents an oracle in QASM format for , would that be a first in the industry?
Right now, I have to make that oracle piece by piece following the recipe of that paper, but have not succeeded. It is quite a hassle! Waiting for the beacon of hope from Quantum++! LOL!
I have improved my learning. It turns out that there are so many ways to build circuits for Shor's Algorithm. This paper compares 19 of them with each other. There is no need to single out one for implementation.
Building circuits belongs to application projects rather than platforms like qpp. So, I close this one.
