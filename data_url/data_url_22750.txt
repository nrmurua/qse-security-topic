Peter, have you had a chance to look at this?
Context: trigger Core Device based on external stimulus from another laboratory instrument.
e.g. Apply 1 KHz square wave to PMT1, ideally QRTIQ generates TTL0 pulse in response after well-defined (short) delay
§ What is latency?
□ 55 us with observation that at(t0); delay(55_us) is faster than at(t0+55_us)
□ 1.900 us with a trick to bypass the compiler to remove all rational math
® use syscall() in python
Can this optimization be built-in to compiler?
@jboulder Yes, this should be optimized when the new-py2llvm branch lands.
With the new APIs:
The performance should already be much better since there is no rational math anymore.
Yes. This works. Nice! My KC705 requires a delay of 5 us (instead of 3 us).
