First off, thank you very much again for all of your help. At the current stage of my experiment, I am trying to run my model on Google Colab, which requires that quimb be reinstalled with each new session. When I run the experiment, I get the following error:
AttributeError: 'Circuit' object has no attribute 'su4'
Based on this, I think there may be an error in the installation scripts for quimb, and I am wondering what can be done to resolve this.
I think you likely just need to install from the github develop branch.
Thank you very much for getting back to me. I am trying to run
!pip install https://github.com/jcmgray/quimb
on my colab notebook, but I am getting the error
ERROR: Cannot unpack file /tmp/pip-unpack-leogwvsb/quimb (downloaded from /tmp/pip-req-build-4zb25gdz, content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8); cannot detect archive format ERROR: Cannot determine archive format of /tmp/pip-req-build-4zb25gdz
Is this because I did not get the URL for the repository exactly right?
Did you try the following?
I don't have Colab, so I can't check, but I think you normally need the "git+" for pip.
Problem solved! Thanks again for your help!
