Get AttributeError: 'Pandas' object has no attribute 'key' from logger warning for if pad_height < jj_y_height condition.
Have jj_y_height greater than the pad_height to satisfy the condition in line 1779.
Log the intended warning by correctly referencing the key?
Not sure what key was supposed to reference in the junction table. Either way change warning string to not reference missing attribute of the row.
