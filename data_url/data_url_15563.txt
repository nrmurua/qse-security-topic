Pairs of adjacent X gates are reduced to identity only in optimization level 2. Optimization level 1 overlooks them. I know that optimization has no guarantees, nevertheless I'd expect this case to be addressed already at level 1.
Optimization levels 1 and 2 should agree for the above example.

I see the same also with I and II
You just need a list of basis gates set. The optimization passes run in level 1 to do the 1q simplification need to know the basis set to perform the optimization (under the covers it calculates the unitary of series of 1q gates and synthesizes that into the minimal amount of gates in the target basis, but without basis set it doesn't know what to use and skips). Level 2 doesn't have this constraint because it runs additional more expensive optimization passes which are basis independent.
For example if you change the last 2 lines of your script to:
you'll get the same result circuit with just a measurement.
Great, thanks
