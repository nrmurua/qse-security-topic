For quick access and visibility, it will be good to have a link to the docs\sphinx\examples directory in the top directory - either via a README or a symbolic link, if that is possible. I understand the rationale behind its current location, but the examples are a little hard to find. Ideally, it should be one of the most noticeable things in the repo.
