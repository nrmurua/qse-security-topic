In the CLI code, there's an option to install a time limit ( https://github.com/rigetti/quilc/blob/master/app/src/entry-point.lisp#L62 ), but the RPCQ server timeout is hard coded ( https://github.com/rigetti/quilc/blob/master/app/src/rpc-server.lisp#L172 ) at 60 seconds.
Cross reference: rigetti/rpcq#39 .
