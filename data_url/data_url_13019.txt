On the most up to date topology-dev branch, the fold method sometimes gives the wrong unitary. The minimal qasm code that produces this error is in the file part13 and contains:
The error can be seen by taking the norm of the original circuit and the partitioned circuit using this code:
The expected outcome is that the norm is 0.0.
The observed outcome is 39.1918....
