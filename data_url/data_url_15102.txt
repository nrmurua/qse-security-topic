Generating a preset pass manager  with a fake backend V2 raises AttributeError.
no error is expected. Maybe an optional dependency is missing? If that's the case, probably an error with more info.

You need to recompile your rust module. An update to the rust module was merged recently and you're using an old version of the compiled module that is missing the new functionality the python code is expecting. You can just run python setup.py build_rust --inplace to rebuild it for an existing editable install (see: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-qiskit-terra-from-source )
