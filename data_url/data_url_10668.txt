I ran the code on the following page and tested some versions of dwave-cloud-client to work LeapHybridSampler.
https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/system/en/stable/reference/samplers.html#leaphybridsampler
version 0.7.0:
version 0.6.2:
I confirmed LeapHybridSampler works in the following versions.
I installed them by the command as below. dwave-cloud-client is downgraded from 0.7.0 to 0.6.3.
@maruzhang, LeapHybridSampler should work with the cloud client 0.7.0.
Can you please share your code that's not working (a reduced, minimal example), together with dwave.conf, if you have created one? Please omit your token and other sensitive details. Thanks.
Thank you, @randomir. My dwave.conf has a problem. By commenting out client = qpu, I confirmed the hybrid sampler works with the cloud client 0.7.0.
I referenced the following issue:
