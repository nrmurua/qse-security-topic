The tools/verify_wheels.py script: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/tools/verify_wheels.py is what we use to validate are built binaries prior to upload to pypi. It just quickly sanity checks each simulator and validates that everything compiled works and is accessible from python. However, it was originally written prior to the introduction of the pulse simulator. To make sure that we are building binaries that include a functional pulse simulator we should add a test case that exercises it to the script. This doesn't need to be exhaustive just something the puts together a small schedule and checks the results to validate it works.
The existing cases in there for the qasm, statevector, and unitary simulators just took the contents from a single unit test and converted them to a standalone test case.
