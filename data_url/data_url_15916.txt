The ParameterExpression supports common functions like cos and sin, but not abs. A minimal example:
Enhencemant: add abs to the ParameterExpression class.
Notes: Methods like cos have been added in this PR: #4854
There is an open PR to add relational operations for the ParameterExpression #5278, but that does not add abs.
Hey @peendebak
Shall I have a go at this issue?
@TheGupta2012 That would be great! Make sure to check the references PRs. Adding the abs should be quite similar.
