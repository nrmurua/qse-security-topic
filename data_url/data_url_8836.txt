In colab this takes down the runtime:
If the architecture detection is overriden to use the sse2 build instead of avx2, the crash disappears. gdb doesn't show any avx instructions near the crash, other than vzeroupper, but it shouldn't actually be a problem.
I currently have no earthly idea why this is happening... going to disable the avx2 option as a precaution, for now.
