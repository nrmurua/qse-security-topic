The test method assert_qasm_is_consistent_with_unitary doesn't use the protocols.qasm method. Instead, it uses the line
My understanding is that the reason protocols.qasm isn't used is that it doesn't let us pass in qubits in the reverse order, which is necessary due to qiskit using the reverse qubit ordering convention to convert a QASM to a unitary.
Blocking #1165
@Strilanc I think the correct thing to do is to not have qubits[::-1] anywhere, and to instead reorder the unitary returned by qiskit in tests. What do you think?
I agree.
#1176 fixes the order thing; the remaining issue is that simply calling protocols.qasm(op) won't work due to the different qasm protocols that can be implemented; some require QasmArgs, some require qubits.
Check out how assert_decompose_is_consistent_with_unitary does it. It just special cases operations and gates, since that's basically the distinction between qubits and no qubits. An alternative strategy would be to do runtime inspection of the method, but I'm happy with something simple that works on cases we care about for now.
I looks like we can make isinstance work by explicitly declaring protocols to be runtime checkable. I'm not sure we want to do that though; I'll try the special cases strategy you suggested.
