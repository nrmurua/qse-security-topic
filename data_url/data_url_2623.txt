Note that it is necessary to override EigenGate's equality method, and methods such as _with_exponent, because they don't account for the phase parameter. For the most part, PhasedXGate will look quite a lot like XPowGate but with the phase parameter added.
If we do this we should also do PhasedXZPowGate
I made an attempt at this and I really don't think it is worth doing.  One ends up having to override many of the EigenGate methods and the code becomes much less readable as one has to constantly flip up to EigenGate to understand it.
