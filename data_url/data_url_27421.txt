Not quite a bug, but no more suitable alternative label exists yet...
If I create an environment, it is usually just to store data to a different location, i.e. to set properties.data_folder to something new when e.g. measuring multiple samples on the same setup.
When it comes to setting up pulse sequences, silq complains that the pulses cannot be found in silq.config.pulses, because it's actually looking in silq.config['environment:pulses']. This means it overlooks anything set in config.pulses, however I rarely want to define new pulses for each and every environment.
I suggest the silq config be changed to look in the default config if an environment is set and the item cannot be found in the environment config. However, this should be thought through carefully.
Hmm I thought I programmed it such that it first looks into the environment config, but if that entry doesn't exist it reverts to the default config... Maybe there's a bug in the code?
