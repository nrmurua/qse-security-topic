Problem: Currently all projects are installed in the documents folder of the specified users and additionally, if desired, also on the desktop.
Fix: Add configuration parameter for installation path in config.cfg and logically include it in install_everything.sh. Also don't forget to update the docs. The desired behaviour is to support a "default" option, which uses the users documents folder. Instead of default, any folder path can be set.
