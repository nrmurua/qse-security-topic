Our installation breaks since yesterday as by default we are using the latest pybind11 which is now v2.2.0.
A workaround for the moment is to install pybind v2.1.1 (pip install pybind==2.1.1) prior to installing ProjectQ until we have fixed the compatibility issues.
The build failure can be seen in #142 (or any other pull request after rebuilding it)
A work around for this issue has been submitted. ProjectQ v0.3.3 should work fine again.
Soon we will make ProjectQ compatible with the latest version of pybind11.
This is an issue with the newest version of pybind11. There is a PR on their github which indicates that this will be fixed in v2.2.1.
Closing this issue since this bug has been fixed in v2.2.1 of pybind11. ProjectQ requirements will exclude the buggy version 2.2.0.
