The IQX jupyter notebooks page shows the tutorials based on the qiskit-tutorials/qiskit path which comes from the stable/0.15.x branch structure:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/tree/stable/0.15.x/qiskit

With the master branch changes to restructure the directories, that qiskit subdirectory no longer exists and the paths have changed, e.g. qiskit/1_start_here.ipynb from stable/0.15.x is now start_here.ipynb from the root of the repo on the master branch. The advanced and fundamentals directories are also gone. I realize this was an intentional restructure but it prevents a smooth transition from the tutorials stable/0.15.x branch to the master or stable/0.19.x branch for the IQX jupyter notebooks UI.
Internally we upgraded to the master branch of the tutorials and found that the paths in the IQX UI were broken.
The IQX jupyter notebooks UI should continue to work regardless of the change in directory structure in the tutorials repo.
The simplest solution to continue to start from a start here notebook would be to just create a qiskit/ symbolic link in the tutorials repo back to the root of the project where the renamed start_here.ipynb file exists.
Note that this wouldn't fix the loss of the advanced and fundamentals directories but that's probably less of a concern, the bigger issue is getting to the correct start here notebook which then links to the other notebooks (including being able to get to the legacy notebooks which may or may not work with qiskit>=0.19.0).
It might also be worth creating a symlink from qiskit/advanced to legacy_tutorials since that's where those notebooks seem to have gone now but I'm not sure. Similarly, qiskit/fundamentals could link to tutorials since that's where that content seems to have moved.
This is because we have moved away from simply pointing people to a github repo and actually putting the tutorials inside the qiskit docs. We actually do not need a start_here anymore, but it was left because there is no harm in keeping it around anyway.
The legacy tutorials are either too long in runtime, do not work, or make api calls to the iqx. The latter was chosen not to be possible in the qiskit docs build process. So hosting them first requires modifications. This is why they are legacy.
Closing as not a bug.
