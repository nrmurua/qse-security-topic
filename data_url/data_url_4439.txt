It might be useful to modify the ZNE implementation to accept a user defined gate for the pair insertions used to realize the different noise levels. The current implementation makes use of CNOT gates since the 2-qubit gates are usually the noisiest, but in principle it should work with any other gate, even the single qubit ones.
This would allow for running ZNE and vnCDR for 1 qubit circuits as well.
After a discussion with @AlejandroSopena , we figured that it might be sufficient to let the user choose between the CNOT and the $R_X(\pi/2)$ gates. In the case of $R_X$ gates the insertion would simply correspond to $R_X(\pi/2)R_X(-\pi/2)$.
