QuTiP is currently distributed through both Anaconda's conda-forge channel (conda install qutip) and PyPI (pip install qutip).
It could be helpful to the maintainers to have the project also on the test channel of PyPI, https://test.pypi.org, testing the distribution before uploading a new release on the actual PyPI channel. The instructions are straightforward. Placing this as a memo for v. 4.4. Testing this would be helpful also as we attempt the wheels configuration (#933), which, as I understood from @Ericgig, might not be so straightforward given the low-level calls that QuTiP makes in some functions.
Added by @Ericgig during 4.4.0 release. See https://test.pypi.org/project/qutip/. Closing it.
