In the case where not all operations have OperationRepresentations associated with them, the user is warned every time execute_w_pec is called. In the case that execute_w_pecis called many times, as in learning-based PEC, this results in numerous warning messages, which users already should know because they are learning representations one operation at a time.
Create an option in execute_w_pec to turn off the representation warnings. The warnings can be on by default, but the user should be able to turn them off :)
I'm used to seeing people ignore warnings using the warnings package as documented here:
Is there a reason that we should allow users to ignore these more easily? I'm not sure of the original intention, but presumably the warnings are there for a reason.
Log from the Mitiq office hours discussion with @natestemen @Misty-W:
More context on OperationRepresentation is given in the documentation on PEC, here.
We are discussing whether to
Option 2 to be explored by @Misty-W.
Solution: use warnings filter instead of explicit option in PEC.
