Inspired by @warrench feedback:
Ability to "query" a drawn route to know the exact full length.
Needs to manage pass-through (such as T inductive), junctions (such as Y junctions), terminations inside components, capacitive terminations, etc...
Eventually, length is the key variable that designers will look for in a route. Doing that by fixing the length requires some computation, given that components do have internally "portions" of the route, which are not accounted in Qroute length measurement.
