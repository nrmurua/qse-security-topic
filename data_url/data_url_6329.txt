Over at https://github.com/vm6502q/cirq-qrack, we have work toward integration of Qrack with Cirq via a plugin, based on the qulacs team's Cirq plugin and the qiskit-provider-qrack plugin, including work from Adam Kelly of QGPU.
I'm not very familiar with the conventions of Cirq. The Qiskit plugin returns a dictionary counter of measurement samples, but I haven't fully converted this to Cirq's sampled result format. The biggest parts of what remain are to finish unit test comparison logic between Cirq histograms and to convert the Qrack QasmSimulator to return a result in the expected Cirq format for sampling.
QasmSimulator in the repository linked above needs to pass its unit tests, with the proper result format for a Cirq simulator run() method.
Now that the unitaryHACK is over, and we've had no takers on the bounty, I'm finishing this plugin.
