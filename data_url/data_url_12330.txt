I am trying to install tensorflow quantum following the document given in the webpage but it's showing error and doesn't work.
What exact steps did you do? What os and other system info is in play? Is anything from #762 or #757 or #767 relevant since these are all recent issues with the similar symptoms?
I am using windows and tried to install in co-lab by using pip install tensorflow-quantum==0.7.2 and also I have tried it in anaconda with python==3.7 but there it installs but when I try to import tfq it says there is no such module.
That sounds like the issues I linked. Colabs default Python version isnâ€™t supported.
