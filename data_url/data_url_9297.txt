currently creating subspace for large graph is quite slow, would be nice to have a progress bar for blockade_subspace too, this was trivial to do via @progress for preivous implementation,
but after Happy-Diode/RydbergEmulator.jl#116 the progress will be harder to estimate due to the parallel reduction algorithm. would need some more investigation on this
