When running long sequences with the APS2 if the waveform data cross a cache line the prefetcher can't keep up. The experiment proceeds, but the data are random.
Verified this for example with the following test sequence:
[[X(q,length = l), MEAS(q)] for l in np.arange(2e-6,50e-6,2e-6)]
Just as a note to others, this is an issue with the APS2 waveform cache. For longer pulses that aren't constructed with time/amplitude pairs (constant functions), these pulses can chew through all the on-system waveform memory. You can get around this issue by using waveforms made like in the echo-CR case: 
Long term, we're hoping to have some checks at compile time to make sure you aren't overflowing the waveform memory.
