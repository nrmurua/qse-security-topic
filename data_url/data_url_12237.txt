Couldn't locate a solution to my problem on the wiki link provided above
I ran " conda env create -f QISKitenv.yml " just as the guide asked me to do so, and I get following error -

@rraymondhp
Can you help me see this error off please!
@a07r  Sorry for the late response.
It seems that you do not have psutil installed in your system and failed to compile it from the source.
Would you please try installing psutil following the link below?
https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/blob/master/INSTALL.rst
@rraymondhp  I tried that, error is still the same as above even after installing psutil
I used " conda install -c anaconda psutil " to install it and it ran successfully.
there's another line that says error, perhaps that can help you get a clue,
Running setup.py bdist_wheel for psutil ... error
Running setup.py install for psutil ... error
Maybe my setup.py is not right, I just can't locate it to go see what's inside it?
Edit : Perhaps if you would like to see the whole picture then maybe I will share all that's happening when I run " conda env update -f QISKitenv.yml " in my machine.
Hi,
Do you still have this problem? If not I recalled that someone proposed to fix the version of each package used by qiskit for smooth installation. The instruction is here:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/wiki/FAQ-and-Troubleshootings
Please let me know if you the above works. If not, I will look for other way around.
Hi Rudy,
Yes I am still facing the issue, the Issue that above FAQ link opens to is for Ubuntu OS. I am running Redhat 7.5
The instructions on the FAQ link suggests to update existing QISKitenv file, Here's a peak at my current QISKitenv file -
[aman@oc7415214385 qiskit-tutorial]$ cat QISKitenv.yml
name: QISKitenv
dependencies:
Do you want me to replace it with whatever is there on FAQ page.
Note: I have been to FAQ page before and tried running "conda update -c anaconda automat" as well "conda install -c conda-forge cvxopt" the commands completed successfully but didn't changed my error.
I have reported this issue in slack channel [ #qiskit-community ]
Robert Loredo, pointed out - "qiskit-acqua 0.1.2 has requirement numpy<1.15,>=1.13, but you'll have numpy 1.15.1 which is incompatible." could be a cause. and hence I went ahead and got the numpy downgraded to 1.14.5 from 1.15.1 and pip list and conda list confirms that i have numpy 1.14.5 running on my conda, it's just that when I run "conda env update -f QISKitenv.yml" it somehow still finds numpy 1.15.1
@rraymondhp Can you spare some time and help me please!
Update:
Update:
I think it is better to create the env with numpy=1.13 as follows:
I made this video to demonstrate the above for anyone who wants to install it on Red Hat 7.5 & CentOS 7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OAjz7M1av4
____________________________________________________________________________
In the comment below I downgraded numpy=1.15 to numpy=1.13 and I got rid of the error:
however I get the following error when I run any example:
ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import

Hi a07r,
I think everytime you run conda env update -f QISKitenv.yml you install the newest numpy (numpy=1.15) even if you have downgraded it before in the same env. To force installing numpy=1.13 try the following:
Let me know if the above steps work and/or if you face other errors
Hi Muneer,
Somehow I had lot of dependencies missing on my machine, I had to install them one after the other and was successful in doing so. but for some reason they never showed up on my QISKitenv.yml file not sure if that's a hard requirement (you can see my yml file in this issue). Not knowing if I have to manually add them in the yml file I went ahead and followed the steps that you have shared in your Youtube video i.e. reinstalling afresh by hard coding numpy to be 1.13 in the yml file. and I now have following error -

Hi, I wonder if you have switched to the QISKitenv before updating and installing with pip. You have to do source activate QISKitenv before installing and/or upgrading in the environment. Otherwise the updates and installs are not properly done at the intended environment.
Please refer to this for conda env:
https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
Hi,
It's doing all it's doing after I ran " conda env create -f QISKitenv.yml " and get above error.. I don't know why it's trying to update and install using pip on it's own.
Am I missing anything here?
Edit: I think I should be able to run source activate QISKitenv once conda env create -f QISKitenv.yml completes successfully.
It seems that you do not have gcc installed. Depends on your Linux distribution, but you have to install the gcc package first.
Hi Again, That solved the problem. It isn't throwing me any error anymore.
Thanks a lot!
Great,
This command installs gcc on Red Hat and CentOS:
yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'
@muneerqu I have directly installed gcc alone using yum.. What do you reckon? Shall I run above yum command or not?
If everything works fine, don't install it. Just keep it as a reference for the future.
Great.. I can close this issue.
