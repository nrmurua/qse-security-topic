Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Some quantum computing libraries (e.g.: pyGSTi) use the Pauli basis for Liouville space, as opposed to QuTiP's column-stacking basis, making it difficult to interoperate between the two.
Describe the solution you'd like
A new pair of functions super_to_superpauli and superpauli_to_super for converting between these representations. (qutip.visualization.hinton already includes super_to_superpauli as a private function, but this could potentially be exposed to user code.)
Describe alternatives you've considered
