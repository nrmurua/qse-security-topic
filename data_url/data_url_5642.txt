As reported in https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/32681/nonsensical-projection-of-initialized-qubits-in-qiskit, using the AerSimulator to run a circuit containing an Initialize instruction with an integer as parameter breaks, due to
The Initialize instruction should be supported by Aer.
Not sure if this is something we should fix on the Terra side, as indeed the .params attribute it a list of length 1, which might be a bit confusing, or if this should be handled in Aer. The cleanest solution might be to convert the integer to a label in Terra's class, as that's already happening under the hood (and that's handled correctly by Aer).
Officially this is a problem for Aer to deal with, but Terra really doesn't make it easy to support the Initialize operation for simulators. There's like 3 completely different forms that the params could be, which all have very different semantics.
