The tests in QS/regtest-tddfpt-lri are failing with the Intel, ARM, i386, and CUDA (Pascal) regression tests. The issue persists for the Intel compiler with -O0 -g using only one MPI task and one OMP thread.
The TDDFPT-LRI tests are still failing with Intel 20.4 (19.1.3), i386 and ARMv7l after #1825.
Fixed via #1837.
