When I run the  hello_quantum.py example it fails  with qiskit.transpiler.exceptions.TranspilerError: 'Number of qubits (2) in circuit8 is greater than maximum (1) in the coupling_map'
because IBM Armonk is in the list of available providers and it has only one qubit, which is insufficient to run the example.
install credentials
run hello_quantum.py
The example should run on both the simulator and the least busy provider with sufficient qubits
Filter providers with this code:
and use it like this
I'd be happy to submit a PR to the example if that would be useful, but maybe Armonk should not be in the list of available backends.
Sure, please feel free to push a pull request to update the example. One suggestion I'd make on your example is to do some thing like:
instead of manually filtering in a separate function, just to keep the example simpler.
The ibmq provider uses https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/providers/providerutils.py#L22 which lets you pass a callable filter (in addition to filtering on configuration or status).
