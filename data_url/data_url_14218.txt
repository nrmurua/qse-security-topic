This issue is a continuation of #9488.
ScheduleConfig class has only attributes of inst_map, meas_map, and dt.
Target class was inplemented in order to store infomation of a backend. So the ScheduleConfig class can be replaced with Target class and it makes sense when we consider the transition from backendV1 to backendV2.
We would like to deprecate the ScheduleConfig class and should replace all the attributes of the ScheduleConfig class with the Target class.
E.g.
To realize this replacement, we have to two things.
make the Target class be aware of meas_map. One possible approach is adding a new attribute meas_map to the from_configuration function and we can prepare for the Target class that has the info of the ScheduleConfig.
replace the ScheduleConfig with the Target in such as sequence, schedule ,and so on.
Thanks @to24toro . This proposal makes sense.
