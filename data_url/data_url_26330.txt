Assuming a MD run on water:
The following COLVARs should be equal at all times:
And they are! However, as I understand it, the following COLVARs should also be equal at all times:
And they are not. Even worse, COLVAR № 2 does not change at all during the MD run (from .metadynLog):
…and so on. Experimenting with similar setups, it seems that the problem is not just with the reported values. In e.g. a MTD run, COLVARs defined this way have no effect.
This seems mildly reminiscent of #211. I have attached an input file to reproduce the issue:
