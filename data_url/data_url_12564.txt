When I attempt to run the VQT example in the Research branch, in Colab, it seems to crash. I've tried to diagnose the problem, as I initially assumed it was an issue with my computer/runtime, but I can't seem to fix it, and the error message says it is crashing for an "unknown reason".
It is possible that this is an issue on my end, but I thought I would open an issue anyways.
I just ran the notebook from end to end in a remote colab. One thing that did happen is when installation rolled around it told me I needed tf 2.2 for the latest version of tf probability to work. We don't yet support tf 2.2 so I opted to downgrade tf prob to 0.9 and then everything worked. If I went the route of the 2.2 upgrade I got the "unknown reason" crash which usually means a segfault somewhere in C++ code.
Does this work for you too ?
@MichaelBroughton This worked for me, thank you!
