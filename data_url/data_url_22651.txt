Confirmed that get_encoder_counter() returns int when using stand-alone thorlabs_tcube_controller and artiq_rpctool. However, when accessing device in experiment a call to self.thor_tcube.get_encoder_counter() returns None. This is also true of self.thor_tcube.get_dc_status_update().
Are you using "best_effort: true" in device_db?
My guess is you are, and it fails to connect and therefore can only return None (it should print a warning in the log too). I just checked that BestEffortClient returns the correct values when the connection is successful.
Yes, I was using "best_effort:true" in device_db. I see, so it's a connection issue that's suppressed with BestEffortClient and returns None.
If you have confirmed that, can you close the issue?
