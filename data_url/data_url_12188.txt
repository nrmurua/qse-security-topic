Qiskit version:- 0.7.2
Python version:3.7
when I type pip install qiskit
it says " invalid syntax "

This is what happens when you try to run pip install qiskit inside of the Python terminal.  You need to be on the Windows command line to run pip
closing as @nonhermitian is correct. If you still have questions please reopen.
