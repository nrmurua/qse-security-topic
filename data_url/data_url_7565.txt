what is your package status? I guess this might because you got the wrong version of LuxurySparse.jl. Could you please type status  in the package mode?
sorry for the instability at the moment, we will have v0.2 for Julia 1.0 by the end of this month. And thx for the issue.
Do I have to explicitly add LuxurySparse?
(v1.0) pkg> status
Status C:\Users\xxxx\.julia\environments\v1.0\Project.toml
[8f4d0f93] Conda v1.0.1
[a93c6f00] DataFrames v0.13.0
[c91e804a] Gadfly v0.7.0
[91a5bcdd] Plots v0.19.2
[438e738f] PyCall v1.17.1
[ce6b1742] RDatasets v0.4.0
[5872b779] Yao v0.1.4
We do not support Julia 1.0 for current release versions, since they were released before v1.0. If you would like to try our master branch (which just support v1.0 the other day), you could use the following command
please notice, the master branch is the develop branch and it may not be stable at the moment.
Thank you! Yao v0.2.0 #master works, I could run the example code from the documentation.
@LaszloHars I just tag a deprecation fix for Julia 1.0 (v0.6 support is dropped) as v0.2.0 (since METADATA only allow minor update to drop old Julia release support, we will add other features in v0.3.0 by the end of this month), try it with
or wait for JuliaLang/METADATA.jl#16898 and simply update your old package
Or just use the master branch (which may not be stable)
#125 is fixed now
