Hi,
I have installed quick via minconda (AmberTools21) but I am missing any examples
that will finish within a couple of minutes. I went here but there are no examples
how to use QUICK and sander in a QM/MM approach
(https://quick-docs.readthedocs.io/en/21.3.0/hands-on-tutorials.html)
Basically I am left with literally no information whatsoever.
So I wonder if there are any simple example files for the conda installation with sander and QUICK. Maybe an optimization, or an MD calculation over 10 steps, or a simple energy calculation. It would be nice to have them on the github or here (https://quick-docs.readthedocs.io/). Could be copy/paste instead of downloading large protein files. Basically very simple examples for first time users, even smaller than morphine shown here (https://quick-docs.readthedocs.io/en/21.3.0/performance.html#accuracy-of-energies-and-gradients). Maybe molecules 50-120 Dalton.
Thank you!
Hi @tobigithub ,
You can find a few QM/MM MD examples in $AMBERHOME/test/qmmm_Quick/QMMM_MD folder. Have you already checked them? I am not sure if there are other tests. @agoetz @vwcruzeiro Can you please comment?

Thanks for pointing this out.
Hi @Madu86,
Are these examples in the QMMM folder?  I only have ambertools installed (v21, v20 shown below).

I could not find the folder I just want  a simple example like water or benzene MD. I could not find any folder like QMMM_MD_QUICK only QMMM_MD_Q-Chem or QMMM_MD_ADF
hm, I am not sure why the tests are missing. I have no experience with miniconda based Amber installation. @agoetz @vwcruzeiro Any idea? Usually, there are tests for file based QM/MM in $AMBERHOME/test/qmmm_EXTERN/QMMM_MD_Quick folder. I am attaching them here:
QMMM_MD_Quick.tar.gz
For API version, tests should be located in $AMBERHOME/test/qmmm_Quick folder.
qmmm_Quick.tar.gz
