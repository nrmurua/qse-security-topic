When running the example code teleport.py, I got the following error:
File "â€¦\Python3.7.3\lib\site-packages\qiskit\mapper_mapping.py", line 397, in swap_mapper
for k, v in initial_layout.items()}
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'items'
run the code in the most currently installed terra:  examples/python/teleport.py,
Should not have such error.
debug if the definition and usage of object initial_layout is consistent in:
..\Python3.7.3\lib\site-packages\qiskit\mapper_mapping.py
I have made the changes in file teleport.py according to bug fixing #2193.
From: initial_layout = [q[0], q[1], q[2]]
To:     initial_layout = {q[0]: 0,
q[1]: 1,
q[2]: 2}
When I run it,  I still get error, which says:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "...qiskit-terra-master\examples\python\teleport.py", line 76, in 
job = execute(qc, backend=backend, coupling_map=coupling_map, shots=1024,initial_layout=initial_layout)
......
File "C...\Python3.7.3\lib\site-packages\qiskit\mapper_mapping.py", line 397, in 
for k, v in initial_layout.items()}
TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable
By reviewing related bug report (#1711), I feel the issue probably is: Initial_layout has trouble when coupling_map is present.  I removed the initial_layout attribute in the last two execute() in file teleport.py as:
job = execute(qc, backend=backend, coupling_map=coupling_map, shots=1024)
Then I don't see any error and I get the two final results:
{'1 0 1': 6, '0 0 1': 231, '0 1 1': 260, '1 1 0': 2, '1 0 0': 8, '0 0 0': 247, '1 1 1': 1, '0 1 0': 269}
{'1 0 1': 1, '0 0 1': 254, '0 1 1': 251, '1 1 0': 9, '1 0 0': 5, '0 0 0': 241, '1 1 1': 5, '0 1 0': 258}
Hi @xmwang672 there has been a change to how the layout is passed between the version you are running against and master. The fix sadly only accounted for the changes to master, not past versions.
However,  if you change the initial layout to
it should work!
Hi,
I am facing the same issue and am not able to resolve it.
My code:
The part where the error occurs:
Hi @ananya-p , this looks like a more general python issue, so you may have better luck asking on e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/ . Looking quickly though, it looks like your code expects output to be a python dict, but it is being returned from client.run_command as a list. Hope that helps, good luck!
