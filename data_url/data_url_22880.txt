When running the oscilloscope code in section 3.2.3 of this tutorial, I get "InvalidStateError: Result is not set." when I reach line 57,
ch1, ch2 = res.result()
This error happens when you try to get the result of a future that isn't done, so its results are not yet available. According to this documentation, however, the future will never be done running:
This Future object is the one controlling the acquisition in
rolling_mode. It will never be fullfilled (done), since rolling_mode
is always continuous, but the timer/slot mechanism to control the
rolling_mode acquisition is encapsulated in this object.
If I create a loop to end when the future stops running, to see if it's running, finishing, and then re-running in a loop, it never ends, so it seems like it just starts running the first time and never stops. So how can I ever get a result?
Did you ever get to the bottom of this, I am having the same issue.
