16QMUX chip was made special as a quick fix to adjust the numbering scheme. Instead we should modify build-nq-trivalent-chip to have the correct numbering, then implement build-16qmux out of that.
Would this be enough to satisfy this issue
No: the qubits in build-16QMUX-chip follow a different indexing convention than those in build-nQ-trivalent-chip. I think an ideal solution would take width and height options that describe how many octagons there are tiled in each direction. Someone will need to talk to internal sources (and so maybe this isn't a "good first issue") to figure out what the octagon numbering conventions are when there are more than 3 of them.
