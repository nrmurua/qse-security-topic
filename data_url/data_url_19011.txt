When trying to optimize gates with a very small anharmonicity and using lbfgs optimizer  the algorithm runs out of the quantity bounds.
I have written, an mwe. But ironically one can't upload scripts when having an issue.
However, I took a screenshot of the error.
It should stay in the bounds.

dev branch, c3-toolset 1.4
None
Solved: Don't give the bounds to many digits or fractions. Seems that the optimizer can then jump over the bounds
