There is a compiler warning treated as an error if using gcc11.3.0.
This is fine if using gcc12.
From looking at the code, I think the logic is fine since this code path is inside if (constVal) and the optional constVal will only ever be set if allocOffset is too.
Not sure if gcc11 is officially supported or not. If so, we may need to adjust the code to prevent this invalid warning.
Compile CUDA Quantum with gcc11.3.
Can compile if gcc11.3 is a supported compiler version.
