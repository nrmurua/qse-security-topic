This is a traceback from a dwave-system integration test (Python 3.4 on OS X):
The reason could be related to SAPI webservice Keep-Alive timeouts: server closes connection, and client tries to write while not realising the connection (http session) is closed.
In that case we could retry on BadStatusLine, or RemoteDisconnected (in py3.5+).
All signs point to web server configuration error, since the problem can not be reproduced after server config upgrade.
For other deployments, this might help: https://stackoverflow.com/a/47077330/404556.
The alternative of client-side-instructed preemptive connection closing (sending Connection: close) also proved to be effective.
Possible cause: psf/requests#4664.
Implementing #414 should serve as a workaround here.
Reopening until fix from #414 is verified.
