GitHub Pages Action fails on external PRs (from forks) due to permission problems.

@crazy4pi314  do you think this change can be a solution the issue?  It seems to work in that PR.
Debugging a bit with @Misty-W last night, I think the deploy failing was related to the fact her PR was from a fork... when she did it as a Branch directly on the main repo (as dependabot does) it's fine. The solution is to add the right conditions to the action so it doesn't try to deploy unless it's like a merged PR on the main repo. I had it as a part of regular docs builds so they wouldn't have to be built again as it's the longest part. Probably the better solution it to investigate caching ðŸ˜Š
