There are a couple of util files that given the algorithms move need to be considered and probably deprecated/removed from Qiskit and be copied/refactored to qiskit-algorithms.
I do not believe either is used outside of algorithms - these originated from Aqua and were copied over when Aqua was split/refactored into the various repos.
Update: It seems that  algorithm_globals got used here too qiskit/synthesis/evolution/qdrift.py - I had not realized it had any usage outside of opflow and algorithms (also originally from Aqua). This will have to be taken care of in someway.
For 1. I had raised this yesterday on qiskit-algorithms /qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms#21. Since algorithms use the current qiskit.utils RNG and users seed that we need to sort a way to migrate users over to a similar copy of the code in algorithms. I think we can have that copy appropriately check the seed in this and warn if its not None and update itself to use this seed for its own seed. This way I think we can transition over. Anyway something to be investigated and checked out.
For 2. I think it can simply be copied to qiskit-algorithms and the algorithms can use that instead of the Qiskit one here, this one gets deprecated and removed. Its just used for  parameter validation so when you constructed an algorithm if values had ranges, min, max etc we used this to have common code and common message being raised.
