Computing expected value for the Pauli operator 'YY' on a Bell state generated in the standard way results in 1 instead of -1 on both the stabilizer simulator and the extended stabilizer simulator (which use different algorithms for this computation).
Both simulators should return -1.
It looks like the stabilizer algorithm is wrong (probably makes assumptions about measurement that aren't valid for entangled states).
I tested a new algorithm for stabilizer simulator for computing the Pauli expval that works for the quantum_info operators, but to implement it in Aer we would need a function for computing the conjugation of a Pauli by a Clifford: P -> C^\dagger . P. C:
Here is a function to do this in Qiskit:
Edit: @ShellyGarion found that above function sometimes returns incorrect values for N >= 4 qubits. I think this is probably due to a bug somewhere in the code computing the Pauli evolution.
The fix for the Pauli evolve bug in Terra is in Qiskit/qiskit#6287
Closing since expval is currently disabled for extended stabilizer until we have a proper algorithm.
