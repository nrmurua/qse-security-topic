I was wondering if it were possible to display the working tree in the file explorer. One of the main reasons we have held back on using git integration thus far with artiq is that more often than not, we are changing parts of the code to debug an experiment. In terms of workflow it's a bit of a pain to have to make changes, commit, then push it to the artiq repository in order to see any changes as opposed to just changing the source code and running it again. One can open files outside the repository, but it is a bit of a pain to have to do this for multiple experiments. What would make this process much easier would be having the working tree in the explorer window, or in a separate panel/tab along with the committed files in the repository.
Hi
These GUIs clients might be of use to you:

I use TortoiseGit on my laptop and another software called Beyond Compare to see the diff. But most of those GUI clients have their own in-built file comparison tool also.
