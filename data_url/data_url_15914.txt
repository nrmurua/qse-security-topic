nakanishi_fujii_todo() optimizer fail to return OptimizeResult except in the case of args = ().
I tried to run the following code
and then I got the following error
nakanishi_fujii_todo() should return OptimizeResult without errors.
OptimizeResult(fun=fun(np.copy(x0)), x=x0, nit=niter, nfev=funcalls, success=(niter > 1)) should be OptimizeResult(fun=fun(np.copy(x0), *args), x=x0, nit=niter, nfev=funcalls, success=(niter > 1))
@riuriuriuriu Thank you for reporting the issue. I think your suggestion is the correct direction.
@Qiskit/terra-core Could you add some labels? mod: algorithms and good first issue.
