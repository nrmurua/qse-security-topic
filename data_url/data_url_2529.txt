Currently we assume a unix environment https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development.html
We should also try to simplify the install, e.g. not depend on virtualenvwrapper and use a similar process to openfermioncirq where we leverage pip's -e argument.
Do we have a handle on how these install instructions should differ?
I think we already recommend using pip -e in recommendations.
