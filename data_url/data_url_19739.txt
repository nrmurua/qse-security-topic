cvxpy is not installed as a requirement because it is not in the setup requirements
Is this considered a bug? I thought this was deliberate - use cvxpy if installed, but if not - revert to scipy. This leaves the choice to the user.
I am not sure how the user is supposed to know this though. Unless one looks at the dev requirements or has the code raise the exception, there is no mention of this anywhere.
