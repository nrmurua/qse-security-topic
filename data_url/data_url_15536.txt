Transpilation gives impossible qubit layout. For example, it disconnects qubits that need to be connected. @nbronn brought this to my attention.

Here is the output of circuit.draw(output="mpl") to demonstrate that all the qubits should be connected:

Transpilation should give a reasonable qubit layout.
This seems to happen only with optimization_level set to 3.
Oh, actually I just realized this could be happening because the circuit I posted doesn't do anything. I'll reopen if I find another example.
