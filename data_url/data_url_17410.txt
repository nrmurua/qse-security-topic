I'm not sure this is going to be fixable, we switched optimize 1q gates in #1738 to resolve things numerically which resulted in a very significant speed up. If we're passing in sympy expressions for parameters which are not able to represented as a float I don't see how we can run optimize 1q on them short of adding back sympy to the pass (which I don't want to do) so that we can call simplify() in the hopes that the terms in the expressions for gates cancel without needing the undefined parameter in the expression to do the evaluation. (I'm not sure if it could provide any meaningful optimization if the parameters aren't defined though)
We need to make the transpiler be smart here and use a PassManager that does not invoke Optimize1qGates (or any other pass that involves numerical optimizations based on gate parameters -- another example is the ConsolidateBlocks pass in #2134)
