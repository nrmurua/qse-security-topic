requirements-dev.txt includes the cvxpy package, which requires a C++ compiler. I was building Aer on WSL2 on my windows system and the pip install -r requirements-dev.txt failed to install cvxpy, because I was missing g++.
I assume running sudo apt install build-essential will install g++ and mitigate this error, so maybe we could switch the order of commands and document that build-essential needs to be installed before installing the python packages?
Unfortunately, we cannot include all our dependencies requirements as our own requirements.
IRCC build-essentials package on Ubuntu comes with a g++ version (depending on your distro it could be an older version or not).
Try installing it directly: sudo apt-get install g++
Anyway, Aer doesn't build cvxpy by iteself, I guess you are trying to install with pip install . , right?
I'd go to cvxpy documentation to see what other dependencies requires, and try install them.
I see what you mean. But I believe asking Linux developers to install build-essentials first before running pip install -r requirements-dev.txt will fix this issue. Sorry if I phrased it a little poorly in the issue description - I'm not saying we should include all the dependencies' requirements as our own, just that we could avoid this error by asking developers to install build-essentials before doing anything else.
Oh, ok, I see. We mention it but after pip install -r requirements-dev.txt instructions.
Makes sense.
I guess it's a matter of rearrange the texts.
