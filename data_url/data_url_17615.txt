There are many places in the code where it has a variable param which we should replace with params. This issue just notes that we should change this.
This is a follow on from #1634
Hi @jaygambetta could I work on this issue? I see you mentioned in #1634 the files which are affected by this but I will have a look to see if it is anywhere else.
Sounds great.
