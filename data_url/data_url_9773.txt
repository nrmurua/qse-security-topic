The BQM file-like serialization encodes each neighborhood as a block of the file. Similarly, AdjVectorBQM and AdjMapBQM store their neighborhoods in separate blocks of memory. In principle we could parallelize the loading, for performance on very large BQMs.
That sounds good, but the bottleneck is usually due to (serial) I/O. For example disk and memory R/W are more or less serial.
