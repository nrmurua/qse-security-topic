1- Make the function signature the same for both functions
2- Make the iplot_histogram default when using jupyter and connected to internet.
In order to easily switch between the plot_histogram and iplot_histogram functions, both need some changes.
1- The plot_histogram function must be able to plot multiple histograms in one figure, just like iplot_histogram does.
2- We have to stay backward-compatible. Therefore, the iplot_histogram(counts) should work.
So I'm thinking we use this function signature?
iplot_histogram
In the above, I'm proposing splitting the executions_results arg into a counts arg and a legend arg. I don't think we need the device thing at all.
plot_histogram
plot_histogram has a number_to_keep arg which i think should be absorbed in options. It will be a breaking change, but it does not affect as many users as the regular counts arg.
