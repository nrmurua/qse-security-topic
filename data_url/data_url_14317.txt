Right now we have a mix of the legacy approach to modeling a backend in the transpiler (basis_gates, CouplingMap, etc) and the new approach, the Target class. This causes friction when adding new passes or maintaining existing ones because we have to support dual paths for everything. We unify all of the internals on the new model because in almost every case we can convert from the legacy model to the target without issue.
After the above is done and released then we can start the deprecation process for the legacy inputs to the transpiler passes along with the PassManager config.
