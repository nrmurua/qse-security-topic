Description
Description of sample_dict_cast claims default is False and warns of implications of setting to True:
But definition is :  def data(self, fields=None, sorted_by='energy', name='Sample', reverse=False, sample_dict_cast=True, index=False)
and code:
Steps To Reproduce
https://github.com/dwavesystems/dimod/blob/master/dimod/sampleset.py
Expected Behavior
Based on the warning, I'd expect it to be False by default.
Environment
Additional Context
None
I'm in the sampleset.py file now anyway so I can make changes if you want.
@JoelPasvolsky, by all means - PRs are always welcome ;)
@randomir, so are opinions: default heavy memory usage or break backward compatibility?
I'd say, if someone uses .data() to traverse the sample set, hopes of performance are already lost. So, we might as well default to dict expansion.
Should default to False and SampleView, this was a feature added after there were some memory issues.
Changing the default will also change output type of dependent functions like SampleSet.first(), so need to call the backward incompatibility out when it goes up.
Ok, in the docs just doc the current behaviour. We'll make the change later
I added that to #506, which is approved and waiting to be merged.
