now its getting urgent
I am getting somewhat uncomfortable about the CurveDB issues between python 2 and 3. Maybe we can continue the discussion on the options here.
@ Sam: What are you prepared to go for?
Yes I think it makes sense to go for a curve browser that would be a SoftwareModule.
Regarding the database, I would really make things simple and clear... that means, if we use a relational database, we don't trick the system to allow storage of arbitrary typed parameters, or we allow to save parameters as json, but then, they are not searchable...
I would really do a very selective and progressive migration of curvefinder because almost every part of the code could be greatly improved compared to the current version. If it s fine to only have minimum functionality in the first versions, that would allow to ramp up progressively...
All sounds good. In practice, one commonly filters no more than 1000 curves by parameters. That is usually fast enough with a for-loop. So I would simply stick to the Json storage.
Also, the database would allow to port datalogger, which I believe is very useful in conjunction with pyrpl
Is there any alternative to sqlite, in the sense that it would allow to have two processes to write simultaneously to the database without having to install a MySQL server?
I guess for now, there is no problem with using a config file that stores a list of ids and params, one of which is filename. once this list grows longer than 100, we can worry about replacing the backend by sqlite
a spartanic version is now available under the name curve_viewer
