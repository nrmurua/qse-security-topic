One might be interested to calculate <φ|θ> where φ is a state in computational basis and θ a qureg. For example, such calculation can be done to calculate an overlap of the resulting state θ  of a quantum algorithm with the correct solution φ we know apriori.
Hence I propose to implement a calcInnerProductWithClassicalState(int classical_descriptor, Qureg qureg) that does not need to allocate additional 2^n amplitudes compared to initClassicalState(qureg_classical, 0b11001);calcInnerProduct(qureg_classical, qureg). What do you think?
You might kick yourself :) If I understand right, you're describing fetching a single amplitude (definitionally).
Let our state-vector be:

Then the inner product with computational basis i is...

the i-th amplitude.
Hence you can use the existing getAmp function.
Similarly, for density matrix

the density matrix inner product is

which you can obtain with the existing getDensityAmp function.
Note this isn't a coincidental algebraic result; it is the very definition of our classical state amplitudes:

where j form an orthonormal basis.
