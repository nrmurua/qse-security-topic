Device log:
That's because this new test uses assert in the kernel, which the compiler implements with a detailed error logged and then a call to abort (see visit_Assert in artiq_ir_generator.py). This is inconsistent with CPython where a failed assert raises AssertionError.
I'm not sure if this behavior is useful, maybe assert support should just be dropped from the compiler, or implemented with the AssertionError exception...
Ack, looking into it.
I've implemented asserts via AssertionErrors, as I find them quite useful/natural to have. (Maybe my sense of style for Python is odd; who knows.) #1541, will test on hw later.
