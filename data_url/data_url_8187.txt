Not sure what measure you've tried to implement, but at any rate you're not applying it to valid quantum states, so none of these operators must have a fidelity of 1.  QuTiP uses the generally accepted definition tr(sqrt(sqrt(A) B sqrt(A))) for density matrices A and B, with additional reference material in the docstring of qutip.fidelity.
