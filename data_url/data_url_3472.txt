The QuantumComputer class returns a dict if you call the method run_and_measure, but it returns a 2D numpy array if you manually specify the measurements and call the method run. I wonder if it was simpler to have the same return type for both methods. Thanks.
run means that you've included MEASURE instructions in your program that define a mapping from qubit numbers to ram addresses, so we can return an array. With run_and_measure, no mapping has been specified so the returned thing is a map (dictionary)
Okay, that makes sense. Since the keys are pretty much indices, do you think some semantics would be lost if the return type would be an array?
e.g. if you were running on Aspen-1-2Q-B with qubit indices 14 and 15 the current dictionary return type is keyed by 14 and 15. To stack it into an array you'd either have to use a lot of zeros if you still want the indices to be 14 and 15 or stack them to be indexed by 0 and 1
Here's what the docstring has to say about it
Ah, okay. I missed this part. Thanks for clearing it up.
