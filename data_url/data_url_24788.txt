Currently, measurement windows are provided by the method get_measurement_windows of the PulseTemplate class family. This is somewhat inconsistent to the way pulses are instantiated and leads to code duplication, since this method has to perform much of the tasks Sequencer is designed to do. Thus, Sequencer should compute measurement windows and the method get_measurement_windows should be removed.
Steps:
Current status: I coupled measurements to TablePulseTemplates and FunctionPulseTemplates, in which one can define the measurement windows concerning this leaf node.
In this way, the sequencer may stay unchanged, the waveforms stay untouched so does the according measurement. Only when the sample-function of a waveform is called, the measurement_windows  should also be called, to get the according measurement windows.
All changes currently reside in a separate branch. Should be checked and merged or edited if necessary.
As stated in #132 in measurement windows need identifiers which may differ for the same physical waveform. Therefore the sequencer should collect them seperatly. I'm thinking about storing them in the corresponding instruction block or returning them together with the ImmutableInstructionBlock from Sequencer.build()
The measurement windows are stored in the waveforms for now
