In QPY currently we serialize a unique instance of a Parameter or ParameterVector as we encounter them in the circuit. This leads to both duplicate data in the qpy output and potentially an incomplete representation. As was pointed out in review of #7381 #7381 (comment) we aren't guaranteed to fully serialize a ParameterVector doing things this way. For a larger format revision in the next QPY format revision we should store a global parameter table for each circuit to represent the full set of parameters in the circuit (and adjacent to it). This would be very similar in scope to how custom instructions are handled currently but instead we'd store Parameter and ParameterVectors in it and then store a reference to the table entry (probably by name) for each time the parameter is used in the circuit.
