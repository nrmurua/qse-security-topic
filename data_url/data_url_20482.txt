Hello. As a user of a GNU-Linux system, Fedora (kernel 5.18), i came to read, somehow lately, about SSH-relared projects, yet on this platform. I could notice that section Quick-start was written against a release that is not obsolete but yet old. Might the statements of that section be still valid against an up-to-date release, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 'Jammy Jellyfish' (kernel 5.15) or even Debian 11.4 'bullseye' (kernel 5.10)? As my interest for this project kept on growing, i came to notice several unknowns: I hope i haven't missed any, as you may discover more by your own as well. Here they are:
As prerequisite is assumed | Algorithms present within liboqs were enabled thus supported.
As stated, for that  ntruprime-sntrup761-sha384 listed one of the hybrid algorithm among level L1, L3 and L5 security, is made available. Though unknown are the respective level codes security of supported key exchange methods. Suggestions of syntaxes in this regard, here applied to NTRU-PRIME, as model:
It seems to me that no implementation of digital signing method for sntrup761x25519-sha512@openssh.com has been implemented in any software yet. In this project, digital signing appears to be implemented. THough unknown is the digital signature algorithm ntruprime-sntrup761-sha384 is eligible to be associated to.
At last, noticing the obvious; dead project.
