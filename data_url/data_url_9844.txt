Description
When using dimod to convert a higher order optimization problem to a quadratic formulation, there appear to be extra terms introduced that are not required. In particular, for a cubic term we should need one slack variable but two are introduced (aux1,3 and 1*2).
Steps To Reproduce
Prints out:
Expected Behavior
I would expect there to be a single slack variable used for this conversion.
Environment
Hi @epelofske-LANL,
This is a result of using SPIN variables. For BINARY variables x and y, the product variable p == x*y is an AND relationship, which can be encoded using three variables, x, y, p. However, for spin variables s and t, the product variable q == s*t is an XOR relationship, which needs an additional auxiliary variable.
You can avoid the additional variables by first converting from SPIN to BINARY. However, if you do that, you may see additional interactions created.
Create a spin BQM directly
the resulting BQM has 11 variables and 19 interactions
Convert to BINARY first, then back
the resulting BQM has 10 variables and 36 interactions. So we saved on one variable, but introduced many more interactions.
Hope this helps!
Yes, that does help. Thank you!
