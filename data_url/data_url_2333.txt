Right now it just uses Cliffords which it assumes are available, but how these work depends on the device.  The sampler could do this, but then we are sticking compilers into samplers.  I think we should supply a way to supply the decomposition to the method.  (Another reason we need a good notion of gate sets).
I think it only makes sense for this to produce Cliffords, then do translation to native gate sets.
