Can anyone Tell me
the uses of this  framwork .
what kind of Project I can make with the help of this framework
It allows to program quantum algorithms and run them either on hardware or in a simulation.
I would suggest to have a look at the paper about this framework:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.08091.pdf
And then look into the tutorial and installation guide:
http://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html
Finally, the examples give quite a good overview of what can be done with ProjectQ:
