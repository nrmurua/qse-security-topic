Running nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak (instead of nt.mak, as described in the README.md) fails; many unresolved external symbol OQS_KEM_* errors. liboqs must be correctly linked in this makefile to fix this.
Is this blocking for release?
It's highly desirable. The issue is that the Windows support code from the OpenSSL_1_0_2-stable branch has not been ported to the OQS-... branch. I should be able to address that today; if not, I'll update the README to say the DLL target isn't supported.
PR #60 fixes this. 1.0.2 should be ready for RC3
