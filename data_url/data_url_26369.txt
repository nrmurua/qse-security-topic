The gopt_f77_methods.f90 is a hack to implement a circular dependency between modules. It's needed for the CELL_OPT and MD type of cell optimization. They are both obsolete and we should simply remove them to eliminate that circular dependency.

Upps, I overlook that. Should I close this issue or shall we specialize them and make  #1231 about f77_interface.F only?
Probably specializing them makes sense, this way we can (hopefully) close issues directly with PRs and we get a better overview rather than having subtasks in issues. I wasn't aware that the f77 interface in motion/ is actually more a workaround rather than an API. Thanks!
