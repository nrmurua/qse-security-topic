Followed by readme, I used the commands below:
After that, how can I build the dd_simple target?
Sorry that I'm not familiar with cmake..
Hi,
to get the ddsim_simple executable you have to build the target of the same name (we'll make more explicit in the README.md with the next update).
So your building steps should look similar to the following (except for the paths) with two example starts.
I hope this helps.
Thanks for your reply! However, I got this:
make: *** No rule to make target 'ddsim_simple'.  Stop.
Can you post the full output of cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build and cmake --build build --config Release --target ddsim_simple? And your operating system and CMake version?
(I remove the exact path)
The output of ...target ddsim_simple is on my last comment :)
My operating system is Ubuntu 18.04 and cmake version is 3.16.3. Thanks!
You have to install Boost program_options (package name libboost-program-options-dev) for the target to be available. Can you install this package and try again?
It works now! Thanks for your help! :)
You're welcome :)
