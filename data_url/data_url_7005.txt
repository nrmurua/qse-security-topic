The single-qubit density matrix displays shown on the right-hand side aren't justifying the screen space they use. They're harder to read at a glance than the Bloch displays, but contain less information.
They should be removed. People who want density matrices can put them in manually.
A side benefit, for new users, is that the amplitude display will be visually more distinct from the other default displays.
