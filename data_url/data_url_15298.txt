Trying to run tox -epy310 -- -n test.python.quantum_info gives me:
from qiskit.test.utils import generate_cases
File "/Users/paul/Desktop/GitHub/qiskit-terra/qiskit/init.py", line 27, in 
sys.modules["qiskit._accelerate.stochastic_swap"] = qiskit._accelerate.stochastic_swap
AttributeError: partially initialized module 'qiskit' has no attribute '_accelerate' (most likely due to a circular import)
Try to run tox locally.  Perhaps related to #8743 ?
It should work
NA
This is me again.  Sorry
Your tox environment is probably slightly old after the Rust-ification.  If you add the -r flag to tox, it'll manually trigger an environment rebuild.  If you get problems around "no name in module", you might need to specify the environment variable SETUPTOOLS_ENABLE_FEATURES=legacy-editable while tox is rebuilding the environment (just set it in your own environment - tox will propagate it).
After you've rebuilt the environment, you won't need -r for subsequent runs (until there's more Rust stuff / more entry points).  I think one of the aims of tox 4 is going to be better at is detecting when an environment rebuild is needed, but I don't know if that'll work with compiled extensions or entry points.
Yeah no, this is another error from imports ordering that just does not give any clue that that is the cause.  Found that out when trying to remove circular imports in #8748
