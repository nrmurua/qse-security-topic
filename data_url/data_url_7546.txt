and the question becomes how to change the file documenter.js.
it seems that Documenter.jl has not provided this API.

I'm updating Documenter to latest version and fix make script, let's if this fix this problem. If this doesn't work I think there should be something wrong in upstream.
However, it seems fine for this one:

I think this is not our issue and should be fixed in next Documenter release.
