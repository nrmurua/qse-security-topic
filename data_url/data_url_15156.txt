Running the code snippet below
which yields the following warning:
However, the tutorial it refers to in the warning message contains the same code as the one I am running.
If the HHL class is being deprecated, what is it being replaced with?
Thanks.
See code snippet above

It seems the page has only been updated in the beta textbook, which is the default on the qiskit docs page, not in the old one. In this new one the HHL section has a different link https://learn.qiskit.org/course/ch-applications/solving-linear-systems-of-equations-using-hhl-and-its-qiskit-implementation and this does include the replacement code (so far its the same code just moved out of Terra into a separate repo)
