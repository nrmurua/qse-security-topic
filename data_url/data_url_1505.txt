Routing utilities currently present in cirq contrib expect a networkx graph of device (/target topology) where each node is a cirq.Qid.  NamedTopology stores topology graphs where each node is a number / tuple.
TiltedSquareLattice has a nodes_to_gridqubits method which can provide a mapping from the graph nodes to the corresponding grid qubits.

This can be used to quickly get the graph needed for routing circuits from the topology graph as follows:
A similar convenience method, nodes_to_linequbits, should be added to the LineQubit named topology as well.

Yeah, I thought about this and almost included it in #4628 but omitted it because I figured it would be less useful for people putting stuff on gridqubit-based devices.
It would be
