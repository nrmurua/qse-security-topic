This statement "the analogous probability for for the case of threshold detectors" has word recurrence that needs fixing here: https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gbs.html#gaussian-states-and-threshold-detection
Also, in Notation documentation, I think "(multiset)set" should be either "(multiset) set" or "multiset".
Thanks @amitkumarj441. These typos are fixed in #85
