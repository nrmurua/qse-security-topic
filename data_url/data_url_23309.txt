This driver can't be used to control the B1530a according to the description in doc?
Hello @GitQer , Please specify which doc you are referring to. Also, please have a look at the docstring of the implemented driver here https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/instrument_drivers/Keysight/keysightb1500/KeysightB1530A.py which mentions as warning that "At the moment this driver implements no functionality of the module."
