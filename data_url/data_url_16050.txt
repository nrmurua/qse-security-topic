Following onto #5996 the master version of Qiskit is about 67% slower at swap mapping the Shor circuit from #5996:
when compiling to a 27Q backend.  Example, reproducible timings:
On master: 1    0.071    0.071    9.878    9.878 stochastic_swap.py:271(_mapper)
On stable: 1    0.065    0.065    5.948    5.948 stochastic_swap.py:271(_mapper)
Things should not get slower
Looking at the nightly benchmark runs:

This was casued by: #5486 So I think this is a duplicate of #5965 which is what we're using to track the regressions caused by the api changes for optional registers.
Will close as duplicate than.
