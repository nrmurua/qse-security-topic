I didn't know this was a thing until this comment #929 (review). For many things it's often easier to review documentation that is already executed, rather than executing it locally or looking at myst diffs on GH.
For any PR modifying documentation, a comment is added to the PR that says something like "Preview changes to documentation on RTD here: [link]" with a link.
I think the structure of the link is https://mitiq--PR.org.readthedocs.build/en/PR/ where PR is the PR number, e.g., 929.
Hey @rmlarose, I would like to work on this feature. Could I be assigned?
Sure thing, it's all yours - thanks!
I tried looking at the comment you provided, but couldn't understand the implementation from there. Could you help me out by providing some more resources where I could find similar implementations? @rmlarose
I did not know of any similar implementations, but Akash found the answer in #964 (comment):
Do you know if it's possible to limit the action to only comment on PRs that include documentation changes?
I was going through the GitHub Docs and came across on.<push|pull_request>.paths. We can use this to trigger a workflow and comment on a PR with the RTD link only when a change is made to mitiq/docs.
So that would be my proposed solution.
However, since opening this we have created an action to comment a binder link on every PR. My personal preference would be to:
However, some unitaryfund team members have expressed wanting the binder link on all PRs. So this is blocked on needing an agreed design. I will update you asap, thanks for your interest in helping.
We decided not to add any RTD links after all

Thanks for your interest in helping out though @Abhijnan-Bajpai!
