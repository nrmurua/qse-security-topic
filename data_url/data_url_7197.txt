Issue #23 solved by removing warning altogether. Warning should be placed in a more convenient location.
Also for reference, suggestion from @kdbarajas #23:
Perhaps we should move to a parameter Laser.polarization with const Laser.p = Laser.polarization. Then consider using the format (k = \hat x, \epsilon = \hat z) where the backend takes care of the unit vectors.
This should resolve the QOL issue when running a loop where I build up a Trap with different frequency values on the Laser and receive a long warning list of non-orthogonal vectors upon completion.
