These methods should take an optional shape and use this.  Default would be to assume qubits.
@dabacon
Is this still needed? And if so, what is the function? Is it this one?

@tonybruguier It looks like partial_trace you linked to has worked for qudits since the original commit. I assume @dabacon means partial_trace_of_state_vector_as_mixture, which calls sub_state_vector, which has the following line.

There is a test test_partial_trace_of_state_vector_as_mixture_invalid_input that highlights these.
Note there's a function factor_state_vector in the same file that seems to do roughly the same thing as sub_state_vector (and may work for qudits). I wrote that function, but none of the linalg experts signed off before it was merged (and in fact I'm nervous now that it's incorrect, as I'm definitely not a linalg expert and kind of made it up). It's used in simulation to factor the state vector after measurement.
After some thorough testing, factor_state_vector works correctly, except I found a minor bug in its validation block, where it needs to account for a possible global phase shift. Fix is in #5076.
Everything else there seems to work the same as sub_state_vector (if the phase randomization is removed from the latter), except it also works on qudits (and is about 10x faster, and seems slightly more precise).
So using that should take care of qudits when the states are separable, but partial_trace_of_state_vector_as_mixture also has logic for non-separable states, so that needs to be adapted for qudits for non-separable states in order to close this issue.
(Note, I'm not planning to work on this, just relaying information).
Apparently I lied. :) PR to fix it is linked.
