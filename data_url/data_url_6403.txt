The TryDecompose() unit test fails intermittently on certain devices:
This indicates that TryDecompose() is failing to recognize a state that can be decomposed.
TryDecompose() attempts to test for state separability before decomposing. If the test fails, the internal state representation is left unchanged. TryDecompose() must be able to detect that a state is separable before it can decompose it.
Decompose() works, clearly. TryDecompose() seems to be having numerical accuracy problems, but the failure is conservative against numerical error in the representation of state.
Analyzing, thanks for the issue!
Fixed by #180
Xeon/Core OpenCL implementations seem to be typically accurate to ~2e-8 parts probability, of 1. The issue was addressed by raising tolerance to 1e-7.
