I tried Quirk out on my browser (Chrome 49 on Ubuntu 12.04) and ran into the following issues (auto-included). Any pointers much appreciated!

If you go to this jsfiddle, does the alert say webgl,false,experimental-webgl,true?
The code from the jsfiddle:
The failing line in Quirk:
I think it's because I called getContext on 'webgl' but without the fallback to 'experimental-webgl' like this:
The jsfiddle says webgl,false,experimental-webgl,false. I'm guessing that the issue is that I don't have webgl enabled...
Yes, that might have something to do with it.
I'll add it as one of the 'known issue' detections, and fix the existing detection function not using the fallback.
Thanks for the report.
b396b91 adds the webgl-missing detection and fixes the existing detection not doing the experimental fallback.
