The nvq++ driver ignores arguments it doesn't know how to handle.
Few examples:
If these specific flags will be supported by cudaq-quake, nvq++ should accept them as valid flags and pass them to either cudaq-quake or the underlying host compiler.
A more general solution is to allow passing any flag to the host compiler by adding a --extra-arg flag (like clang-tidy's: https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/) which will  pass its argument to the underlying C++ compiler.
The relevant code:

The variable ARGS is ignored in the rest of the file.
Fixed now. Added a -Wall test.
