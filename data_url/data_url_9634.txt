We discussed in #61 that sampling from a simulation with the three levels involves finding out how to handle any residual populations in the extra level.
I'm okay with taking care of this, unless someone has a strong desire to do so instead.
Thanks, the method is on simresults.py
Just pushed my solution to this. It's not super evident, so feel free to ask me for help in understanding it. Once you approve, we can close this issue.
@sebgrijalva Ok to close?
This is addressed in PR #61 . Thanks, I'm closing this.
