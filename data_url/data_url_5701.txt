Consider the teleportation circuit:
If I have a if_test with just a pass in it for pedagogical reasons then the resulting bit-string from Aer simulator is incorrect.  In the above example that should yield all-ones (after marginalizing) gives
Comment the problem branch out and it gives
Run circuit above, marginalize for 0th element of creg.
A branch that does nothing should not affect output.
I am honestly not sure if this is Terra or Aer.  So please move as necessary.
I suspect that this is caused by the same root as #1665, which was (hopefully) fixed by #1666, which is awaiting release in Aer 0.11.2 shortly.  I tried your example rather superficially with my local version of Aer main (including #1666), just tacking on an
and got
which on a quick skim through the circuit is correct, I think?  Certainly it's different from what Aer 0.11.1 puts out.  If so, hopefully it's the case that #1666 has indeed solved it.
Please reopen this issue if the latest Aer does not simulate the circuit expectedly.
