We are getting the following issue:
https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/actions/runs/3805994485
After a quick look, there is a protection rule for github-pages, which allows deployment only for master, while in this case we have a tag (which is not considered a branch by the settings menu, and the filter does not recognizes it as a branch).
Any idea how to fix this?
Never mind, there is a bug in the github interface, the filtering works.
