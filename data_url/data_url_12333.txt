I tried to open and extract the files using tfq_simulate_ops but it didnt work. Can someone please provide me with more insights.
What are you trying to do that you are encountering this? Install from source ?
Could you please guide us where the error happens?
Hi @VishuKalier2003 ,
I installed tensorflow quantum from scratch based on the newly updated https://github.com/jaeyoo/quantum/blob/master/docs/install.md#4-build-tensorflow-from-source. Please pay attention to the TF build line with the explanations:
Because we are bumping up to TF v2.11.0, your old TF with ABI=0 will give you the error message like tfq_simulate_ops load_library failure.
Please, please rebuild TF and install it in your "NEW" python venv from scratch.
As you can see, ABI is changed from 0 to 1, and std is upgraded to c++17.
