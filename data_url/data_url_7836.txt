Dear all,
I have an issue regarding the Floquet-Markov simulation.
I want to simulate the dynamics of a photon number using the Floquet-Markov simulation.
My quantum system consists only of a harmonic oscillator, and a driving Hamiltonian:
Htot = ww * aw.dag() * aw
H = [Htot, [A * (aw +aw.dag()), cos_drv]]
where ww is eigenfrequency of the harmonic mode, and aw is its annihilation operator.
My simulation code is based on the following website
(section:Floquet-Markov master equation: comparison with other solvers):
https://notebook.community/cgranade/qutip-notebooks/examples/example-floquet-dynamics
What I have basically changed is replacing the Pauli operator to annihilation/creation operator formalism.
However, when comparing with the Lindblad-Master equation based simulation, the outcome is quantitatively quite different.

It seems that the function "floquet_master_equation_rates" might be an issue, but I do not know how to fix this problem.
Any help is appreciated!
Thank you very much!!

I just noticed that it might also be related to #772 and #1653.
Sorry for the slow response on this.  I am not certain if this is an issue with the solver or an issue with the parameters used, I don't have much experience with using this method in practice myself.   In terms of parameters, I feel like your damping is much stronger than your driving term, which, at least from the references  this solver is based on, is outside its regime of validity. Whether this means it then just gives very wrong results or not, I am not sure! Adjusting these parameters (and your fock-space cut-off) in your code does seem to give more  reasonable results.
I will leave this issue open in case someone with more experience with this than me can chime in and confirm if this is an issue or not.
