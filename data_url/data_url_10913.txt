Description
When attempting to use the QBSolv/QPU from python having trouble becuase environmental variables and embedding file not located or created.
To Reproduce
Output:
Expected behavior
With the above piece of code I would expect to get a list of samples with there associated energies.
But it appears I don't have things setup properly. To get there I would expect documentation on setting up the environment to allow the use of qbsolv with the qpu.
Environment:
Additional context
In looking through src/dwsolv.cc it is clear that
would need to be set by someone or something (what is DW?) but other then the obvious ones I'm not sure what WORKSPACE or WSPATH mean exactly.  They seem to have something to do with where the pre-embeddings  are stored but there is no documentation on how those are setup either.
Hi, @schnorea, thank you for reporting, but can you give us more context?
How we can reproduce the behaviour?
updated the report. finger hit return to early
Documentation for QBSolv.sample() says (in the second Note at the top):
The default build of this library doesn’t have the dw library. To use solver=’dw’ this module must be built from source with that library.
Namely, the dw solver is a part of a legacy tool chain that predates the (open-sourced) Ocean SDK.
To make QBSolv sample subproblems on a D-Wave machine, supply a dimod.Sampler-compatible DWaveSampler object (available in dwave.system.samplers, implemented in dwave-system package which is a part of Ocean). If your problem has non-Chimera graph structure (it probably does), you'll also need to wrap DWaveSampler with an EmbeddingComposite.
In short, provide the sampler below as a value of solver parameter:
You might also want to check the QBSolv introductory example that uses a SimulatedAnnealingSampler from the dwave-neal package (also part of Ocean).
