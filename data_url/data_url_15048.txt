dagcircuit.compose supports appending a narrower circuit to the end of a circuit. But the global phases appear to be added unconditionally.

If I understand this code correctly, the lines above are correct only in the case that the number of qubits is the same in both circuits.
Do you have an example where the code gives the wrong results? I'm not sure I understand which circumstances you mean where qubit count could affect the addition of global phases.
I withdraw my objection. I posted that late at night. Considered whether to wait till morning.
A narrow circuit tensored with identities is the same as a wide circuit. For that reason alone what I wrote can't be correct. In fact, mathematically, composing the narrow circuit requires including the identities.
