@iamvamsikrishnad: It seems like the package on test.pypi needs to be updated - when running qsimcirq_test.py from a Docker image, I'm seeing the following error:
(note that import qsim has been replaced with from qsimcirq import qsim in the current version of qsim_simulator.py)
The Dockerfile in question can be seen in PR #20. The tests in that PR pass when the package is built from HEAD.

This might have been because I was running from the qsim directory - the import may have been trying to pull from my local copy, which did not have the .so file compiled.
The PyPI package on the test server may still need an update, but the root cause of this issue was fixed in #23.
I have updated the test package to 0.0.16 version. Can you please check now.
All looks good on my end - closing as resolved.
