Spoke with @mpharrigan about this. It'd be nice to have an implementation of the Quantum Volume algorithm described at https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12926. Note that OpenQASM has the first part of this, creating the model circuit.
If someone could assign this issue to me, I'd greatly appreciate it :)
The referring pull request has been merged. Please reopen this issue if it's not done yet.
Sorry! Only the HOG portion is done.
Yup, I'm working on the next part now :)
I believe this is done now, anyone can feel free to re-open and assign to me if they see something I missed. Thanks!
