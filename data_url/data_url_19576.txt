The package previously known as retworkx is now rustworkx. All references in PyMatching should be updated.
I agree that retworkx should be replaced with rustworkx as a dependency, but the Matching.load_from_retworkx and Matching.to_retworkx methods should be kept for backward compatibility (they can try importing retworkx and use rustworkx if that fails). Then methods Matching.load_from_rustworkx and Matching.to_rustworkx could be added for rustworkx.
