To include Perceval circuits in latex paper, we only have the option to generate svg through svg renderer  (perceval/rendering/canvas/svg_canvas.py) or png through mplot renderer (perceval/rendering/canvas/mplot_canvas.py). The renderer are automatically selected or can be specified with output_format=Format.TEXT|LATEX|HTML option. For circuit, LATEX format is not supported:
in perceval/rendering/circuit/renderer.py:
Describe the solution you'd like
Having a LaTeX renderer would enable integration of higher quality circuits in scientific papers - we can integrate svg inside LaTeX using Inkscape, but it does not give the control of the generated graph for further LaTeX editing.
A solution could be to generate TikZ code that will then be fully editable within latex - for instance changing font size, adding formula, etc...
I will give this one a shot. Thanks!
