The input preprocessor should export built-in settings like the data directory (built-in, can be overwritten in the environment) and configuration flags as pre-defined $VARIABLES.
This could then be a more generic replacement for the @XCTYPE directive:
or allow for more generic input files.
Currently we're not injecting any variables.
Paths relative to the data directory already work. Simply pass ./xc_section/PBE.sec or xc_section/PBE.sec to open_file(). The logic for this resides in discover_file().
As noted in my previous comment, I think this use-case is already covered by discover_file.
the point here is about being able to define paths explicitly according to builtin paths, for people who like to avoid random overrides of @INCLUDEd paths due to different working directories
No comments in the last year. I don't think there is really an audience for this feature.
