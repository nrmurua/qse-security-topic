PR #2414 introduced Qubit(Bit) and Clbit(Bit) classes as a standardized replacement for (Register, int) tuples, including properties register and index to access the corresponding values. These properties are not included in the class docstrings, and so are not surfaced to users through either help(qubit) or through the generated sphinx documentation, and should be added.
Hello! I'm just getting started with Qiskit and looking to make my first contribution. Do you mind if I give this one a shot?
Looks like we just have to add to the docstring for the Bit constructor?
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/circuit/bit.py#L25
Although I don't see Bit in the Sphinx docs: https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit/circuit.html
Do we need to add something for that to be generated?
Hi @willhbang , feel free! The Bit class isn't expected to be visible to users, that's why its omitted from the generated sphinx docs. The properties could be added to the class doc string on Bit (and then inherited by Clbit and Qubit) or added to the child classes directly.
Instructions for building the docs to test can be found here: https://qiskit.org/documentation/contributing_to_qiskit.html#documenting-your-code . Let me know if you have any questions.
I'm having trouble generating the docs locally with tox -edocs (I'm running Python 3.7 on Windows... maybe I'll just switch to Ubuntu if I can't figure it out).
Testing with help() seems to have the expected changes, so for now I'll try opening the PR so I can check the test logs and Sphinx docs from the CI job.
