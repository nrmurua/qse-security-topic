Similar thing - a gui tab should display a list of all CurveDB objects, and display the selected Curve(s) in a graph, along with their params.
This should be done with the possibility to allow graphical fits to the curve in question in the same interface
I would actually advocate for a possibility to open this part of the interface independently from the rest and from the hardware...
i agree that is better. or just polish pyinstruments..
