Create a basic style guide.
Some notes
In tests we should prefer
import cirq
In normal classes we should import from modules (because this aids in mocking?  check this)
from cirq import ops
and not
from cirq.ops import H
exception for type checking for typing
from type import List, Blah
More stuff
if TYPING
Is there more we want here? Closing for now. #627 adds typing stuff.  Reopen for more.
