I am using the function 'mcsolve'. I encounter a problem: when I run it in the jupyter (i.e., run the .ipynb file), everything is fine,
and I get the right result. But when I export this file as an executable file (i.e., .py), and run it in an IDE (I am using Spyder), I get into trouble.
The IDE keeps running, and never stop to give an answer. It looks like it is stuck at somewhere.
The following is my code, could anyone help?
from qutip import *
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
tlist=np.linspace(0,40,4001)
N=2 # number of basis states to consider
psi0=1/(np.sqrt(2))*(basis(2,1)+basis(2,0))
gamma=1/10
omega=0
sigp=destroy(N)
sigm=sigp.dag()
cp=np.sqrt(gamma)*sigp
cm=np.sqrt(gamma)sigm
hopt=-omega/2sigmax()
obs=fock_dm(2,0)
mc=mcsolve(hopt,psi0,tlist,cm,obs,1)
plt.plot(tlist,mc.expect[0])
Hi, sorry for the late reply. It is known that mcsolve have some problem on Windows (and probably also on Mac?) that the code freezes. Did you solve your problem? Your code runs fine on my computer, however. Could you type in your python console qutip.about() and copy the result here? More information will be helpful.
Hi, thanks for the reply! My solution is never use spyder again, just use jupyter... and it works fine for me. :-)
The following is what I get after running qutip.about():
