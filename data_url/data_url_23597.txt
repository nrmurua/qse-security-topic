Parameters roughly speaking work like this:
Shouldn't that be set_latest? Furthermore, _save_val currently does not quite work as expected in cases where a Parameter has no get_cmd, but does have a val_mapping. An example:
Raises a TypeError, because the get calls a lambda: self.raw_value, but the raw_value is None, since _save_val does not update the raw_value if there is a val_mapping. Link to code:

Ideally, I would like
to set p1._latest to {'value': 'one', 'ts': datetime(blah blah), 'raw_value': 1}. Similarly for cases with scaling, offset, and parsers.

PS: This came up in #1218, so although slightly contrived, in can happen in the real world.
