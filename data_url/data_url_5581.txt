When doing calculations using ch gate, the result starting from the state set by set_statevector method may be different from the result without set_statevector.
Below is the result without set_statevector method.
The result is
Below is the result using set_statevector method.
The result is
This result is different from the above result.
I think those above two results should be the same.
I can reproduce the error with a simpler example:
results in
qc.set_statevector([1, 0, 0, 0]) should not affect the result, but it does.
If this is still an issue, please could you re-open the issue on Qiskit Aer?
I confirm it is still an issue, even on the qiskit_aer module that has been separated from qiskit. I think it would be easier to transfer the issue instead, so that everything is intact.
Oh yeah, thanks - I forgot that I could transfer to Aer from here.  A bunch of the issues I was looking through needed to be on repos outside this organisation, which I can't transfer to, and I made a mistake.
