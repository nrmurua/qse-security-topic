The implementation of ISWAP-to-native-ISWAPs currently uses the expression of ISWAP in terms of a pair of CNOTs, then does long-range decomposition on the CNOTs instead. I do not know how to do this decomposition purely in terms of ISWAPs. I have no idea whether the CNOT approach gives an efficient decomposition, but I strongly suspect it doesn't, and this might be worth exploring.
A foothold may be that
emits a diagonal matrix of 1s and -1s, and so should be modelable by a sequence of UCRsâ€”but this ultimately seems to give a circularly dependent decomposition.
Another place where one might be able to pick this up is using the following encoding of CNOT 1 0 to demonstrate that P, H, and ISWAP generate the Clifford group:
and then appeal to God table techniques to produce a decomposition of a long range ISWAP across three qubits.
