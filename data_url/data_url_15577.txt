At the very least, I would like (1) below to be addressed.
BasicAer job results don't have a date attribute. This prevents the user from using BasicAer with Qiskit Experiments, which assumes that such a date attribute exists.
Aer results do have a date attribute, but the type (string) is different from the type of the attribute on an IBMQ job result (datetime).
There may be other inconsistencies, and I think it's worth it to put some effort into making the API consistent, perhaps by moving some attributes up the inheritance hierarchy.
It is highly non-trivial for us to extend or in any way change a public API - if we were to add/remove/change a field, this would invalidate all current implementors of the API which we can't do.  We'd have to add a new version of the API, but that involves a lot of work across a lot of components, and I'm not sure the points here rise to that level of importance; the only true issue sounds like a minor bug in Experiments.
Perhaps I did not clearly describe the issue. The issue is that Job, IBMQJob, and AerJob all have differences that seem arbitrary but cause programming surprise and annoyance. Yes, this is technically not a bug, but it is still an issue in my opinion.
@jakelishman please see @nonhermitian's comments at Qiskit-Extensions/mthree#94. The date attribute is specified in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03452.pdf so apparently Qiskit is not following its own specs.
