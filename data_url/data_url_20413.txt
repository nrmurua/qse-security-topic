The Windows build has a bunch of compiler warnings (see for example https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dstebila/liboqs/build/1.0.11/messages).  These should be fixed.  We should also see if we can configure the AppVeyor build so that it fails on warnings to catch these automatically in the future.
PR #169 fixes all but one warning that I see (the last one is a linker warning due to duplicated definitions of some newhope constants; I'll look more into fixing it).
@christianpaquin There are no more warnings now, and added "Treat warnings as errors". Changes are pushed into your branch "Windows-build-august-2017". I couldn't figure out what is going on with those duplicate symbols in newhope.obj, so for now I just added /IGNORE:4006 (to ignore the linker warning). Can you push it into liboqs/master?
Closed by #169
