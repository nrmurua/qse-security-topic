Right now we limit ParallelGateOperation to single qubit Gates. Any issues to expanding it to multi-qubit gates? We can accept list of lists or validate that len(qubits)%len(gate.num_qubits)==0
I don't think there would be an issue in expanding it other than needing to have a clearly documented convention for how the class will parse the qubit input and feed that into the gates for validation. The NeutralAtomDevice class may need some modification since ParallelGateOperation was created explicitly for the validation methods of that class and the single-qubit gate assumption is probably used implicitly in that code. Unless another Device class comes around that has similar constraints to NeutralAtomDevice but also needs them for multi-qubit gates (something I would be shocked by), I don't think this change would grant any significant utility.
Closing this since there isn't a use case for it
