The error message is shown as below. I did install libsecret on my local machine at the default location, i.e., /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsecret-1.so.
Pushed a fix for this late last night. Please pull latest xacc/xacc image.
I tried and the problem is still there for me. I did use the newer version since
Go ahead and run docker pull xacc/xacc one more time. The nightly CI server did not have the fix I committed last night, and when it ran overnight, it pushed another buggy image. I just pushed the one I had locally, should work now.
OK. I think it's running correctly now.
