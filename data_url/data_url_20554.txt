I am getting following error during certificate chain verification:
error 6 at 1 depth lookup: unable to decode issuer public key
I am unable to verify my certificate chains which are generated with post quantum schemes like dilithium2,dilithium2_aes while I was able to verify with classical schemes like RSA, ECDSA. I am using OQS openssl library to generate my certificate chains.
Following is my verification command.
openssl verify -CAfile CA.pem combined.pem 
CA.pem is the root CA certificate file and combined.pem is a single certificate containing intermediate certificate and server certificate.
After running the above mentioned command, following is my output.

As per output, CA certificate is being verified but not intermediate certificate and server certificate.
My Openssl version: OpenSSL 1.1.1g  21 Apr 2020
Make version: GNU Make 4.3
Kernel version: 5.7.0-kali1-amd64.
This error message is typical for a non-OQS openssl operating on OQS-certs. Are you 110% certain you are running oqs-openssl in the command above and not a standard openssl? Please post the output of running "openssl version".
What do you mean by non-OQS openssl? I cloned this repo and followed all the mentioned steps.
Following is the output of running the command openssl version

This confirms precisely what I mean: You are not running oqs-openssl with the command above. Make sure you set PATH correctly (or explicitly call ./apps/openssl). The output must be like this:
It's working now. Thank You very much!!
