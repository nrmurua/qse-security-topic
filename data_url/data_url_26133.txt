Based on the struggle in #204, need to figure out how an editable installation of toqito should be packaged.
Using pip install -e. did not install all the required packages. As this is a Python package and pip is popular, it would be good to figure this out especially where is pip getting the info from.
One option would be to use dev_requirements.txt created from a working installation via poetry. Then use pip install dev_reqs.
Last comment in the above linked issue talks about using poetry as a better dependency resolver. But if changes are made to pyproject.toml before using poetry lock (in toqito), poetry install, the newer version of pyproject.toml will not be used.

this is probably related to versioning syntax. #218 (comment)
