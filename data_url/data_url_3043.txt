The doc string for the SQISW gate in pyquil.simulation.matrices has some issues:
There is also a typo in the word "conditonal" in the phrase "XX+YY interaction with conditonal phase on |11>" which appears in the doc string for both the FSIM and PHASEDFSIM gates.
Check the source code or the documentation artifacts. The latter is the easiest way of seeing the problems (as the documentation is nicely formatted).
