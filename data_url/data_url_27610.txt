Doesn't matter. There is no MISO. Sorry. Yes. You need capture on second.

That's strange, I see different output voltages on the different modes..
Well either idle low and capture second or idle high and capture first.
More debugging necessary, currently I see 1.5V (which I expect) with capture first and idle low. But there could be other things going on and other voltages come out different from what I expect.
Likely I just saw some start-up glitching and that's why the bits were sometimes misaligned by one bit. Using proper sync addressing everything works fine now with idle low/capture second as on Thermostat-2CH.
