Hii i want try this ex. code, but still error when after adding OpenFermion pkg, so where Hamiltonians  ?


Hi @basernapairs ,  I believe this problem is related to where PyCall is looking for our python packages.  PyCall defaults to a python build that comes in Conda.jl.  Following the docs on PyCall I was able to set up a new environment, install openfermion, point my PyCall build to that envs python, and then successfully import OpenFermion.
I used the following after making a new env with a fresh OpenFermion build.
Then close your julia console. Reopen and try importing OpenFermion.  I was able to see the modules from inside the Julia console so I assume they are usable.
