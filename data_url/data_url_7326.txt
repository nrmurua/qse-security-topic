When working with almost coherent states or with almost Fock states of specific number, it is convenient to have a basis that has not only maximal number cutoff, but also minimal number cutoff. See the offset parameter in http://qutip.org/docs/latest/apidoc/functions.html?highlight=destroy#qutip.operators.destroy
This does not seem to be currently supported here, right?
This would be a good feature to have, but you're right, it's currently not supported. It will be rather straightforward to do the construction part for operators, but I'm not sure if other methods (e.g. the wigner function) will need changes too. I'll look into it.
Alright, I started implementing this, see #290 and qojulia/QuantumOpticsBase.jl#14. As I suspected the basics are quite simple, but updating the phase-space methods is a bit tricky. I'll need more time for that.
Oh, wow, this was fast! Thank you! It seems to be at feature-parity with qutip who also lack phase space methods qutip/qutip#1417
Actually, on reading https://github.com/qojulia/QuantumOptics.jl/blob/master/src/phasespace.jl , maybe I am misunderstanding, but it seems the qfunc should already work even with an offset. But the use of _clenshaw probably needs to be updated? I am still getting accustomed to the code base, hence I can not yet contribute these changes myself.
Thanks for the reference!
Yes, I already updated qfunc, but it's the wigner function or more specifically (as you say) the _clenshaw part that needs to be changed still. Additionally we have the transform functionality in QuantumOpticsBase with which you can map a FockBasis onto a PositionBasis, which also needs to be updated.
This is now available in v0.8.4.
