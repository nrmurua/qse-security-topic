Found in #9869.
Copied (in spirit) from internal Slack discussion:
I'd be surprised if this is the only place using these deprecated properties still, but maybe we've cut more of them out than I thought.  There is an explicit filter to allow this particular warning in QiskitTestCase (a practice I disagree with, with regards to warnings raised by Terra!) - to find all the instances when running on main, one could comment out that filter then find and fix all the resulting test errors.
