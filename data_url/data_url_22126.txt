Using dev branch. Fresh conda environment.
Can't install stock conda numba due to dependency on llvmlite. ARTIQ depends on llvmlite-artiq.
Can't install both llvmlite and llvmlite-artiq at the same time without other bugs appearing (eg dependence on llvmlite.so).

Which bugs exactly? We have separate llvmlite and llvmlite-artiq specifically so that numba and ARTIQ can coexist.
@jbqubit ?
