Currently it only executes code after ">>> " and checks the output with the following line.
We're not consistent enough about the example being code in a particular format in order to do this. I think I would prefer to require that examples follow the >>> convention.
Pycharm has good support for >>>
A quick grep shows we have very little use of Example: that has code after it.  Going to close as I think we don't have enough usage of this.  I believe one can always use >>> after example as a workaround as is done for example in https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/33194ad3a2f4c28c48417876ff7dd1a6732d3e41/cirq/sim/density_matrix_simulator.py
