Problem: default_sweep_output options are dynamically added as the lockbox is initialized. at the beginning, the config file value does not correspond to a valid option, and the option[0] is therefore selected.
I am not sure this is a good standard behaviour, as it will silently change options. For now, I'll remove this line and we can see where this leads us.
for now this fixes the bug. I'll leave this issue open for further discussion though
different bugfix in 91e4846
