The BIPMapping transpiler pass has been in a weird state since it's introduction. It is a standalone transpiler pass that is used for both the layout and routing stage but we never integrated it into transpile because it has an external dependency on cplex which is a proprietary software package that most people don't have access too.. Now that we've added an external plugin interface for transpiler stages (which was added in #8305) we have a better option for how to advertise and use the BipMapping pass. We can create an external package for the pass that contains the code of the transpiler pass and offers a plugin that cleanly integrates into the transpile() function. Basically the workflow for using the bip mapper would change to be pip install qiskit-bip-mapper (or whatever the package name we pick is) and then doing transpile(qc, backend, layout_method="bip_mapping"). This make it easier for users to run and also separates the dependency on cplex into a separate package where we can more cleanly document the extra requirements around installing and/or purchasing a commercial license depending on the size of the circuits.
