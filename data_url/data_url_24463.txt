qtt should provide a set of example measurement data of common measurements. This data can be used as input during development and demonstration, also for code that is not part of qtt.
There is already some example data, but it is not included in the distribution and does not have descriptive names.
Changes to be made:
Rename:
"addition_line_scan" Old name: '17-57-24'
"charge_stability_diagram_anti_crossing" Old name: '2017-01-10/09-45-15'

'charge_stability_diagram_dac_vs_awg' Old name 'misc/P5_y_P5_x.dat'
'rts_signal' Old name '2018-08-31/19-05-18_qtt_save_segments'
Name already good:
'time_rabi_scan.json'
'frequency_rabi_scan.json'
'double_gaussian_dataset.json'
To be removed from repository:
'misc/awg_to_plunger_scan.pickle'
@eendebakpt, I've extracted the renaming from your email.
Closed because this issue is solved in: #750
