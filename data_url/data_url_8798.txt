sh run/startLog.sh Alice Bob
Start Alice and Bob in one process. So the can write to the same file
sh run/startAll.sh Alice Bob
Start simulaqron processes for Alice and Bob
(This way we may not need the backendhandler config either
sh run/startLog.sh Alice Bob
this has become
sh run/startAllLog.sh Alice Bob
This starts both Alice and Bob in one process. This process listens to messages from both Alice and Bob
Both Alice and Bob can still be in their own process.
It won't start any virtualNodes either, since CQC backend don't need it.
So when logging with n nodes, there are only n+1 processes (rather than 3n)
@LeonWubben Is this relevant anymore?
Nope
Actually implemented, but forgot to close
