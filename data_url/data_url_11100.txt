If you call optimal_givens_decomposition and then construct another circuit using the same qubits, the latter circuit can be incorrect. For example, below I create two circuits that should be identical, but the second one is different and incorrect:
This is because optimal_givens_decomposition is mutating the variable mat I think.  Can you confirm this?
You're right, the issue is that mat is being mutated.
