@GiggleLiu To avoid this kind of bug (#125 ) happen again and to keep a frequent update of various new algorithms, I think we can move the examples (maybe just some of them, or just all of them) to QuAlgorithmZoo.jl and keep update that repo with new algorithms and demos in notebooks like QAOA and HHL and etc.
check their repo, it looks nice:
https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq
https://github.com/qojulia
They separated examples (or other instances) to different repo, then you can update and fix them more frequently without worrying about it is not in CI.
Okay, discussed with @GiggleLiu I will move examples to QuAlgorithmZoo.jl
