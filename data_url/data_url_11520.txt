Recursive QAOA is erroring out
This is the code failing -
rqaoa_result_q = rqaoa_qaoa.solve(qubo)
print(rqaoa_result_q)
This is the bottom part of the error -
AquaError: 'Circuit execution failed: ERROR: Failed to load qobj: Invalid parameterized qobj: instruction param position out of range
Run the notebook attached, pay special attention to the cells after the comment -# RecursiveMinimumEigenOptimizer
The code should run and produce the same optimized value was Cplex which is -20.5 (even qaoa is not producing it)

I was able to reproduce this issue with the following script:
Let me take a look.
