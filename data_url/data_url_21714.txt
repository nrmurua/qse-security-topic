After merging #1262

@cjbe please run the unittests and fix it.
This isn't just breaking unit tests, this is also making artiq_run unusable.
Apologies - fixed in #1292.
There are still issues with the hardware unit tests

@cjbe Nope.

And you can run the HW unit tests on your own system by the way, you don't need buildbot for that. Or SSH tunnel to the M-labs Kasli - I believe you have an account?
