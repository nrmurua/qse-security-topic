I'm trying to follow the instructions for MacOS on the installation page , however I get the following error message
The error is much longer, I copied only the first few lines for the sake of brevity. I wasn't able to find any information on this error for cirq elsewhere, so any help would be greatly appreciated.
Hi @a-gupte, it seems that there is some setup required on your end. Can you try to run python3 -m pip install wheel; python3 -m pip install numpy? It is odd that it's trying to build the wheels for it.
Also, I highly recommend trying to create a virtual environment - for example with venv:
This should give you a clean "playground" where you can install dependencies freely, it won't try to install everything to a central location.
