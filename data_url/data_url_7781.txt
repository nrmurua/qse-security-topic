Dear creators of quimb,
Could you please answer the questions below.
Is it possible to perform the following calculation using quimb?
I have a one dimensional chain of spinless fermions, periodic boundary conditions.
I need to find the ground state of the hamiltonian at initial time H(0);
solve the Schrodinger equation (SE) with time-dependent hamiltonian H(t) and obtained initial wave function ; calculate the average value of a local operator and the solution of SE.
Does quimb support infinite DMRG or iTEBD calculations?
Thank you in advance.
