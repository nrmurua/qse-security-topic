BasicAer is outputting the wrong counts for multiple measurements. This was noticed by Fer Grooteman from quantum-inspire.
Output:
BasicAer should have the same output as Aer.
Isn't there some random seeding in simulators?
I don't think this is related to the seeding as the output bitstrings are just wrong as can be seen by the example bitstrings above.
Oops. Yes, 0101 impossible output from circuit.
Could it be this? I think this loop assumes that each qubit is only measured once. I'm not quite convinced yet though.

I think its possible, but I don't know enough about how the simulator works. What do you think @chriseclectic?
As @georgesbarron said it looks like a bug in the measure sampling optimization if the same qubit is measured more than once. I can put in a fix
