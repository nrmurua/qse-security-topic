I've been trying to install Tensorflow Quantum as outlined by Tensorflow documentation, here: [https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/hello_many_worlds]
Unfortunately, pip states it's trying to find the required version and it's been 6 hours since I executed the code and still not fully installed. I even changed my runtime to TPU. Things were bit good but same story happened again. I even specified Tensorflow Quantum version "pip install tensorflow-quantum==0.6.1" while installing using 'pip' command in another attempt. Unfortunately no luck! Can anyone explain how this issue can be resolved?
What version of pip are you using? I just tested with pip 22.2 and it installed about as quickly as expected (<1 min). #696 seems to indicate this might be an issue with pip.
At first I used the build-In version of pip that was pre-installed within Google Collab but later I had updated it after I received an error. That said, something didn't matched with the existing component's version and as a result, pip was unable to resolve it. But after seeing installed libraries list, I saw it Tensorflow-quantum was installed. But, to solve that version issue pip showed I needed to have root user permission.
Yes, I also saw that conflict, but it doesn't seem to have an effect on execution. I just ran the intro tutorial colab with no problems (even with the conflict). That being said, this is probably something worth looking into for the team.
Any updates on this or should it be closed?
I don't think Google Fixed it yet! Since there's conflict even if you install using the latest version of "pip". I think we should let have this open so that Google can identify the problem and solve it in the next version : )
