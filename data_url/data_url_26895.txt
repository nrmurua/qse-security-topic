Currently all our Python scripts are tested by calling them with --selftest. Unfortunately, virtually no script actually implements a proper self test. Still this test is useful as it verifies that syntax and imports work across different versions of Python.
I'd propose that in the future we require all scripts to support -h instead. Furthermore, scripts that match *_unittest.py are called again without any arguments.
We also get this kind of smoketest when running the build itself, don't we?
While supporting -h/--help would be nice, I don't get what we gain from sourcing the Python scripts as a test.
wrt naming, I would prefer to just name them test_*.py or *_test.py, following for example the pytest naming convention (but also the Python unittest seems to recommend this as a name).
Sure *_test.py is fine too. This way it stays close to the script it's testing.
Just for completeness: The original goal of the Python dashboard test was to ensure that our build scripts work across different versions of Python.
The proper way is to use something like check-ast from https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
