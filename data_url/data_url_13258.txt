Once #1354 is merged, it will be nice to add some timing benchmarks to our repository. This is one of the more common uses of asv.
If there are recommendations as to core components of our library that we should ensure are fast, or would just be good to get an understanding of, please add them here.

I think mitiq.pec.sample_circuits() is usually quite slow and maybe could be improved.
The full mitiq.pec.execute_with_pec() is quite slow too, but most of its slowness is intrinsic to the technique and so not easy to improve.
I don't have in mind other parts of Mitiq in which speed is critical.
With the removal of ASV in #1960, this is now irrelevant.
