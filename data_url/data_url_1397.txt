Description of the issue
Currently we cannot run the build_api_docs.py and build the API docs for GridInteractionLayer or XebResultDict.
How to reproduce the issue
Removing the private_map entry in build_api_docs.py above and then running the build script gives:
Cirq version
The docs for these symbols seem to generate fine with a newer versions of tensorflow-docs (I tried 3a6a7a3322de8620f0031ae3a0a4b62e40d1d7f2).
