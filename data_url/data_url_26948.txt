quantum should be able to be configured with encryption/decryption of packets disabled, at run time. This would mean that any traffic destined for the node in question would be in the clear and any data sent from the node in question would be in the clear.
This would not affect the TLS integrations with the backend, and would be solely for the incoming and outgoing workers to bypass encryption/decryption.
This unfortunately can not be done on a per node basis as it would allow for potential exploits in the pipeline code.
However there could be the option to turn on and off crypto on the network level. This is going to be a different issue.
