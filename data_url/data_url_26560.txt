Hi,
the source file src/grid/cpu/grid_collocate_dgemm.c contains several OMP pragmas of the form #pragma omp simd linear([list]) simdlen(X). In some instances the list in the linear clause contains pointers which are marked const. The first occurence is in line 221.
According to the OMP standard v5.0 section 2.19.4.6 "the linear clause  declares one or more list items to be private [...]". However Section 2.19.3 states in the restrictions for privatized variables "A variable that is privatized must not have a const-qualified type [...]".
Therefore, the code in grid_collocate_dgemm.c clearly violates the OMP standard.
This does not seem to matter for the gcc compiler, which simply accepts it, but more strict and standard compliant compilers abort with an error message at this point. Since these pointers seem to be local to the loops anyways, I don't see a reason why they need to be marked const.

it seems to break even openmp 4.5. They give no reasons for that though. Fixing this is straightforward.
Fixed via #1913.
