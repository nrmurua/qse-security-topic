It seems that somewhere between 4bbeda1 and 4594d24 our CUDA Pascal test started failing. Unfortunately, the reports with all the stacktraces got too large for the dashboard to handle. Nevertheless, I managed to fish our some logs from the cloud storage bucket:
Last good report, for 4bbeda1 (got preempted).
First failure report for 4594d24.
That being said, I actually observed the problem already on the 2019-11-28 while working on #652. So, my guess is that the recent update of Nvidia's Docker image surfaced a dormant bug in SIRIUS.
In any case, the error message says:
@mtaillefumier, could you have a look?
Would it be possible for you to deactivate SIRIUS and retest the full thing. I suspect that it is coming from the container itself.
Apparently, this was indeed a mistake on Nvidia's side: NVIDIA/nvidia-docker#1143. They committed a fix and pushed a new docker image today. Now our tests started working again, too.
