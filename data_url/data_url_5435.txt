After successfully configuring the Makefiles. The compiler complains
This is a clang flag - what version of clang are you running? My system reports v8.0.1:
Just to confirm, is this error happening when running make from the top-level qflex/ directory?
As discussed offline, this can be avoided by either using the index variable (if it's actually needed) or iterating only over the values (dims) of index_dim. Since we should be avoiding unused variables in any case, we should submit this fix - @alexandrupaler, would you be able to send a PR for this?
make clean-all should remove everything, including all the Makefiles. Hence I'm surprised you can even run make after make clean-all.
@s-mandra: #249 addressed this issue by rewriting the for loop.
