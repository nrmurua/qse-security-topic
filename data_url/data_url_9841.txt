Hi, I've written a script for a TSP model, and weirdly all the energies for the samples are 0. Could you kindly assist with this?
my code is in my repo :
https://github.com/ACE07-Sev/CQM-TSP
If you could kindly assist me in resolving this I'd be immensely grateful. (it's a bit urgent hence I would be immensely grateful if you could help me solve this as soon as possible. Thank you so much for the support)
As before, I'd recommend reaching out to our Leap community.
