Hello,
last week we talked about the possibility of creating an algorithm such that
def create_circuit(state):
# Some code
return circuit
circuit has to be made such that, when applied to 0, it returns the original state.
This operation is exponentially costly, but it can be done
The example where we have found that is in QISkit UnivariateDistribution.build(). Univariate distribution is here https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/master/qiskit/aqua/components/uncertainty_models/univariate_distribution.py
Thanks!
