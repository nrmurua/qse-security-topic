The current implementation of sample_measure in MPS creates a copy of the MPS, and invokes apply_measure. This is fine when the number of shots is small, but increases linearly with the number of shots. It is more efficient to implement something similar to what the statevector does. There the performance for a large number of shots is similar to the performance for a single shot.
