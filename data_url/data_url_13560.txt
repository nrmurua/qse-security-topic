Richardson extrapolation is equivalent to:
This method is well known to be unstable when the number of measured points is large. This problem
can be related to the so-called Runge's phenomenon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon)
There are two ways of avoiding the Runge's phenomenon:
The first way is to choose a particular set of x values (the noise scale factors) known as Chebyshev nodes.
Alternatively, there exists an algorithm to interpolate a polynomial using fake nodes which seems interesting [1]. This method has also a Python implementation https://github.com/pog87/FakeNodes.
In Mitiq this could be achieved by adding a new Factory class (e.g. RungeFactory), which would be almost equal to RichardsonFactory, but where one of the two mentioned procedures is used to evaluate the zero-noise limit.

Hey @andreamari can I take this?
Thanks @elmandouh for the quick contribution!
