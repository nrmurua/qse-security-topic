Hi all,
I like minorminer but prefer C++, I see that you provide a header library for it with a few examples,
My question is, if I use the C++ version of minorminer, do I get (almost) the same functionality as the python version, or is it like second-class to the latter?
Thanks.
The Python version is a wrapper over the C++ version, so their features are at near-parity.  There are a few differences
Awesome, thanks!
