If I pass in a non-unitary circuit to cirq.final_wavefunction I get an error message with an incorrect suggestion to fix my code.  cirq.sample_wavefunction doesn't exist (did it ever?).  It should probably suggest cirq.final_density_matrix if the circuit contains channel or mixture operations.
@cduck @vtomole can you please assign it to me.
Thanks @vtomole
@vtomole can you please suggest what needs to be done here?
