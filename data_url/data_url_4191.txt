I want to implement  QFT gate on my own rather than using the provided QFT, but when I put the QFT and inversed QFT sequentially, I can't get the original input.
Is there any problem in my code?
QFT:
Inverse_QFT:
Test:
I can see that you are trying to run the circuit backward, in the inverse_qft function
theta =  2*cmath.pi/math.pow(2,i-k+1)
should be replaced with
theta =  -2*cmath.pi/math.pow(2,i-k+1)
So you can get an inverse of phase-shift gate.
Closing this old issue since no activity happened since then. Feel free to re-open if required.
