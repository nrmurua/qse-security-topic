Is there a way to test if a default connection is available in .dwrc before calling dwave_micro_client.Connection()?  If not, this is a feature request.
As of v0.2.2 calling dwave_micro_client.Connection() without a .dwrc for me results in,
Absolutely valid feature request. We're already doing something along those lines with the auth refactor that's in progress. :)
As of v0.3.0 (Mar 8), configuration via .dwrc is deprecated in favor of dwave.conf.
Introduction to the new config system is available in the docs. Detailed docs on how to use it are under dwave.cloud.client.Client.from_config.
There are now several ways, or layers, on which you can define the default solver: via config file - under solver section and under defaults section, via env var, and during call to from_config via kwargs.
Lastly, feature-based solver selection (i.e. not name/id-based) is also available in v0.4.3+. It's not yet visible on RTD, but it's documented in docstring.
You can, for example, get the first QPU-based solver with at least 1000 qubits (but no upper bound) like this:
