Dear CP2K developers,
When performing CDFT with Hirshfeld constraint I am getting the following error: "Program received signal SIGSEGV: Segmentation fault - invalid memory reference." This appears to be an issue reported previously (#560), however I am encountering it again in CP2K 7.1. This error occurs on both my local machine and on a cluster.
I have found this error to be difficult to reproduce, being sensitive to the system and to the atoms included in &ATOM_GROUP. For certain combinations of atoms CP2K runs successfully while with other combinations it crashes. Becke constraint runs in all cases, so this is isolated to Hirshfeld.
I have attached two example input and output files, one with an atom combination that runs while another which fails. I have confirmed that Hirshfeld runs successfully for the input files included in the CP2K CDFT tutorial.
Regards,
Chris

I fixed an indexing error in the CDFT Hirshfeld code. Hope this fixes the problems.
Thanks for the quick bug fix, this has indeed solved the problem.
