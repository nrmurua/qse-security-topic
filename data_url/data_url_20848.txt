Hello Prof Stebila,
We are about to start some work to bring Dillithium and Falcon to liboqs/openssl this summer to do some testing. Do you happen to know if Falcon will make it to PQClean soon so we avoid duplicating work?
Thanks
Hi Panos, it is definitely our plan to get all of the Round 2 algorithms including Falcon and Dilithium into PQClean over the next couple of months, and use the PQClean implementation to add them to liboqs.  As far as I know we haven't assigned Falcon or Dilithium to any one of our developers yet, so if you wanted to have a go at adding one or both of them to PQClean, you'd be welcome to do so, just post a comment here so we know someone's working on it.
My student will start in June, so we will update this Issue accordingly.
I've heard some rumours that the Falcon team might be working on a PQClean integration in the future. Might make sense to coordinate with them to avoid work duplication.

Thanks Matthias, we appreciate it. I didn't know. We were focusing on integrating Dillithium to liboqs first.
Falcon was next, so that is good to know.  I will ask the Falcon team.
I have begun adding Falcon, see PR #210. I am currently navigating the intricacies of MSVC (e.g. it does not support the C99 keyword "restrict").
Thanks @pornin
