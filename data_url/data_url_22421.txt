I have this experiment here,
I did the following,
-open experiment
-change experiment name from DDS0_Start to DDS0_Start2
-GUI crashes
There's some sort of traceback on the command prompt but it's hard to capture before it closes.
This sequence also crashes the GUI,
-open experiment
-close experiment
-change experiment name from DDS0_Start to DDS0_Start2
-GUI crashes
The master is running fine in the meantime. This doesn't happen to me on the virtual machine.
If you run the GUI in a cmd window, not with start artiq_gui, the traceback should stay. We do need tracebacks in most cases to debug something.
How did you change the name? Did you also run a repository re-scan?
I changed the name in the python script then scanned the repository through
the GUI.

Sorry, I should have specified that it's the scanning of the repository
that triggers the crash. I've been having the artiq_gui open in a cmd
window but it closed before I could see the traceback.

cmd windows should not close when the application terminates. How exactly did you start the GUI?
I had a .cmd file that starts the gui.
Something like,
I guess I should have just done it manually for the traceback. Maybe I cmd
/k at the end would help.

Yes. The effect of that .cmd could be achieved much easier with just a shortcut.
@r-srinivas On an unrelated note, you should probably call dds.init once in the startup kernel and not in every experiment.
@r-srinivas I cannot reproduce the problem so please post your traceback.
So just to clarify, this is the sequence of events.
-double click on DDS0_Start in GUI to open experiment panel
-change name of experiment to DDS0_Start2 in Spyder
-right click on experiment explorer and click Scan repository HEAD
-GUI Closes with the following traceback
Are you sure opening the experiment is necessary? This should not touch any models.
Is your experiment at the root of the repository or in a subfolder? Can you post the full contents of your repository?
It's in a subfolder. For the file it's in repository/dds/dds0_start.py Yes, if I don't open the experiment then scanning the repository just updates the file name without crasing the gui.
Reproduced. The actual conditions are:
This is also independent of Windows/Linux.
Probably the reason why I couldn't reproduce it on the windows machine was because the experiment wasn't in a subfolder. I didn't think that would have been an issue.
Qt trees are very complicated.
