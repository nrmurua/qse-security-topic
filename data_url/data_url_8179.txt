Describe the bug
When plotting the Bloch sphere with qutip and matplotlib >=3.3.0 the sphere appears deformed in z-direction.
This is a result of a change in matplotlib Axes3D: https://matplotlib.org/3.3.0/users/whats_new.html#d-axes-improvements
To Reproduce
Work around
Environment
QuTiP Version:      4.5.2
Numpy Version:      1.19.2
Scipy Version:      1.5.2
Cython Version:     0.29.21
Matplotlib Version: 3.3.2
Python Version:     3.7.9
Number of CPUs:     6
BLAS Info:          INTEL MKL
OPENMP Installed:   False
INTEL MKL Ext:      True
Platform Info:      Linux (x86_64)
This is an issue with matplotlib rather than QuTiP. A possible workaround is downgrading to version 3.2.2.
The underlying reason is that matplotlib made some changes in the Axes3D module.
