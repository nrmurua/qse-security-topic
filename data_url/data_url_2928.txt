One of the aspects of the discussion in #281 is on whether we should even specify a basis at all when asking for the matrix, as opposed to getting an object which we can then later turn into various bases and access in a convenient way (e.g. "what is the coefficient for control=1 target=1 to control=1 target=1").
I think the conclusion here is "no". The basis of the matrix is specified by the qubit order given to the method.
