Currently pickle fails on some of these. Further investigation why is required. Suspected reason: WeakRefs and lambda functions in Waveform and Expression.
Maybe we can use __getnewargs_ex__ generally for serialization.
#693 solved most cases. There are no other known problems and a general pickle support is too much work.
