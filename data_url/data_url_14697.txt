I opened an issue at https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/q/14865/1859 and an user suggested I ask here.
Below, my problem:
for a given QuantumCircuit object, you can computed its Choi-matrix via the corresponding Choi object, for example:
My problem is, that code gives the Choi-matrix describing the whole system, but I'm interested to one subsystem, say the one associate to q1.
What can I do?
I would like to do something like
