This epic tracks the implementation of redispatching workflows.
The UX actually involves two distinct actions:
In general, when the client changes a lattice input, the entire computational graph needs to be rebuilt with the new inputs. This should be performed client-side because the workflow function needs to be deserialized.
Determining which intermediate results from the previous dispatch can be reused is harder because the redispatched compute graph need not have the same structure as before.
You can try out the UX in this branch.
