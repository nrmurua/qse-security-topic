(Not sure if this is the way to report an issue in the OpenQASM3 paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14722 Feel free to close or move)
In page 20 of the paper OpenQASM 3: A broader and deeper quantum assembly language says:
As an example, consider an inverse quantum Fourier transform circuit as written in OpenQASM 2
<code>
In the code that follows, in line 14, it says:
if (c[0] == 1) p(-Ï€/2) q[1];
This is not valid OpenQASM2. The same happens in lines 18, 19, and 23-25.
That created some confusion in the readers, like in https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/17901/if-statement-in-openqasm2-0-on-ibm-quantum-experience-error
Why is that not valid OpenQASM2? Seems more like an error in Qiskit's OpenQASM2 parser.
The if statement conditionally executes a quantum operation based on the value of  a  classical  register.   This allows  measurement  outcomes  to  determine  future  quantum operations.  We choose to have one decision register for simplicity.  This register is interpreted as  an  integer,  using  the  bit  at  index  zero  as  the  low  order  bit.   The  quantum  operation executes only if the register has the given integer value.
I see. Seems like the paper should reference 4 separate cregs to conform to OpenQASM2 syntax, then.
That was 4 years ago. We're all smarter in hindsight since then :)
Oh, wait, I see. You mean the current OpenQASM 3 paper, @blakejohnson
