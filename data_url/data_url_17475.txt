Currently the layout is a pass in the passmanager, e.g. pm.append(DenseLayout(coupling)).  However, the coupling map is not a pass:
TypeError: 'CouplingMap' object is not iterable
This means that the passmanager is not self-contained; You have to call the swap mapper with the coupling_map separately.
The swap mapper takes both coupling_map and initial_layout as kwargs.  Either they should both be input separately or both contained as passes in the PM.
