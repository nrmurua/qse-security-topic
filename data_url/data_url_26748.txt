I am currently struggling to build the sdbg version of CP2K using gfortran 8.3.0. I get the following errors:
I saw that there was quite some activity in dbcsr's develop branch wrt. tensors, so I tried building with cp2k/dbcsr@0046876 but I get the same result.
Interestingly, the dashboard currently does not show any build failures. Any idea what the problem could be here?
This error looks like a compiler bug to me. Either use a different version of gfortran or maybe compilation without -Werror=uninitialized works.
Yes, without -Werror=uninitialized compilation is successful. I guess it will work with gfortran 9.2 because this is what the sdbg CI runners use.
unfortunately this is something we've also seen on our systems on gcc 8.3+ in different places of the code
Please stop closing valid/unresolved issues. Several people in our group have to modify the generated .sdbg arch file to make it build.
I'm sorry. It appeared to me the matter was settled.
Our debug arch files only work with the current toolchain setup, because they are optimized for catching bugs.
So, I'd suggest we add a note to INSTALL.md and close this issue again.
I reduce the test case for the issue we see in CP2K with gcc from our toolchain and submitted it first here as a comment:
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=77504
But it got its own issue now:
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=96312
It seems it is not just a false positive but rather an actual bug in the gcc frontend.
Resolved via #1017
