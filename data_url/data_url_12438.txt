Since Saturday April 29, when trying to install tensorflow-quantum in Google Colab using:
!pip3 install -U tensorflow-quantum
I get the following error:
Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow-quantum (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow-quantum
Note: Up until Thursday April 27, this worked without a problem.
Edit: This problem is not limited to Colab, but the same error occurs on my local machine. Pip is of version 23.X, so this should not be the cause.
It seems that Colab updated it's Python Version to 3.10.X, which is not supported by TensorFlow Quantum currently.
Downgrading to Python 3.8 and configuring pip to use this Version. Solved the issue.
I did not consider this locally on my machine, but it should be due to the same reason.
The issues was already discussed in #744.
