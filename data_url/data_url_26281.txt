Create a feature state_props/is_separable.py that is able to determine whether or not a given state represented as a density matrix is separable or entangled.
In general, this problem is NP-hard. However, there are a number of entanglement detection tests that act as more effective heuristics that can be run on the state in question first before getting to computing the NP-hard problem. As the problem is NP-hard, it will become intractable for certain quantum states, but in practice, should be relatively effective at determining the property of the state.
Hey @vprusso, I have something to contribute to this issue, will open the PR later today. In the meantime, would you have any additional information?
Hi @meandmytram
That's great to hear! Thank you for your interest and contribution to toqito!
In the meantime, would you have any additional information?
Yes, I can provide an initial attempt at capturing some of these separability criteria. Note that it is still incomplete.
These tests and checks are heavily derived and influenced by the QETLAB function IsSeparable.m that runs through the same barrage of tests to check separability.
If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to reach out and let me know!
As a follow-up, some of the corresponding test cases that would be useful I'll include here as well. Again, these are incomplete, but I think it would be useful to provide these.
Closing from #96
Thanks again, @meandmytram !
