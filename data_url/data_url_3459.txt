Not sure if this is the right place to track this, as this may simply be a firewall issue on the QMI side.
I am trying to make a call to the remote QVM endpoint on my QMI in the Rigetti cloud from an AWS EC2 instance. The latter is configured to have ports 5000 and 5555 fully open, and I confirmed this by binding quick http.server instances on both ports, and testing them via curl from outside the AWS network.
Yet, when invoking the QVMConnection function with my QMI endpoint the connection times out. So I also tested if I can get a curl connection from my QMI Linux instance to my AWS, but strangely this results in:
[forest@4509-qmi ~]$ curl http://3.87.204.91:5000
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
Now this leads me to suspect that this is not a QVMConnection issue at all, but rather a network configuration issue - maybe iptables firewall rules?
So my apologizes for posting this here. Just not sure where else to put it.
Hm!
To be clear, are you trying to access the QMI-hosted QVM outside of the QMI host? If so, I don't think that is mode of operation that we support. Generally, we expect that you will prototype with a local QVM instance (via downloading the SDK) and then upload your code to the QMI where it can run on the QPU (and the QMI-hosted QVM).
Thanks for the prompt reply!
I figured this was probably the case, just wasn't sure, for now we can certainly work with that.
Please feel free to close this issue.
