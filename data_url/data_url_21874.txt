Please can you clarify the timing of the update cycles for the servo a bit in the docs? Am I right in thinking that:
Side note: would it make more sense to rename set_config to set_enable since that's all it does atm?
Ack. A couple comments:
I wouldn't want to do that because it's likely to need reverting. As soon as e.g. (2) is implemented we'd have to change it again.
ack. If you think we're likely to add more config settings in the future then I agree the current naming is correct.
We can add a feature that gives you synchronization on-the-fly by supporting emission of an RTIO input event when a cycle starts. The other way to synchronize is to calculate the cycle restart from the known enable timestamp and the cycle time.
Personally, I don't think this is needed (@cjbe). Spelling this out a little more in the docs is fine IMHO.
