As the title suggests I would like to be able to get the Hirshfeld or Mulliken charges using the general get results interface provided in src/start/libcp2k.F.
As far as I can tell implementing something that would enable one to be able to use the following call get_result_r1(env, '[HIRSHFELD-CHARGE]', natoms, charges, ierr) would be rather straight forward using the methods provided in src/common/cp_result_methods.F.
Looks like a good plan. Feel free to submit a pull request.
