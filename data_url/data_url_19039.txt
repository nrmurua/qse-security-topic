Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The qiskit interface is an independent interface that need not exist within the core c3-toolset. The development can be decoupled and would benefit from existing independently of the core codebase. This would also reduce the dependencies for c3-toolset
Describe the solution you'd like
A separate c3-qiskit repository that acts as a plugin to the c3-toolset, with possible backend support for various hardware control stacks as well.
To-Do/Status
Probably part of a larger restructure and rewrite drive and not within the scope of current development. Work on enhancing qiskit integration with c3-toolset eg support for the full physics simulator to continue in this core repo.
