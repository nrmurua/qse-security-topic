The circuit methods QuantumCircuit.to_instruction and .to_gate, via their converters circuit_to_instruction and circuit_to_gate, fail any bit is not in exactly one register.
There are many possibilities for the exact error, depending on how many registers are defined and what is in them, but here's one example:
The instruction should be created with 1 qubit and 1 clbit in this case.
