In #7437 we began the process of moving the features in qiskit.test.mock to qiskit.providers.fake_provider, by making them accessible at the new name.  We can't issue deprecation warnings in Terra 0.20, but between 0.20 and 0.21 we should ensure that all our internal uses point to the new names, and then implement the deprecation warning.
This is on hold until after Terra 0.20 has released.
@jakelishman Can I work on this one?
Yes, please!
To do
@jakelishman I am starting to look at this issue. Should we move the files inside qiskit.test.mock to qiskit.providers.fake_provider (and add the imports in qiskit.test.mock.__init__.py like the "inverse" of what is done here) as part of the PR to address this issue?
I probably shouldn't redirect the codes in the release notes right, should I?
Yeah, the import structure you mentioned is exactly right.  You can also add the deprecation warnings inside qiskit.test.mock as well.  We should leave that possible path in place for quite a long time, because the fake backends are already commonly used, and we want to give people lots of time to respond.
For the release notes: yeah, no need to change any of those references.  If there are any old .. jupyter-execute:: blocks that use qiskit.test.mock in the release notes, you can just swap those to .. code-block:: python instead - it's ok if super old code in release notes doesn't execute any more.
