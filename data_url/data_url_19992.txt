Hi All,
We have been working on NTRU prime due to its interesting properties that make it an alternative choice to Kyber, despite its lack of NIST support.
It would be worth pointing out that
And the removal of NTRU prime breaks a popular SSH library which relies on liboqs-python for interop with OpenSSH:

A PR was sent for your consideration as well: #1328
OpenSSH at least plans to add support for Kyber "fairly soon": https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32360533#32366614
@xvzcf agreed. However, it's likely that open source developers and companies could ignore NIST recommendations and ship with NTRU* for a long time.

Please see #1328 (comment) on the topic of NTRUprime. Please also note that
Supporting things that are outdated costs time not available to other things that still are moving forward, particularly considering that old code/releases are not going away and can still be utilized (just without active support).

These statements seem conflicting to me.
I can assure you, NTRU Prime is not outdated.
I'll take a closer look at the PR now ...

Excellent -- such statement of support was missing until now.

Thanks!
I wanted to update the thread with a pointer to the message from the NTRU Prime team on the CFRG thread where an I-D is being discussed: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/bkIRllgoqNIpureewvCjDH2FIag/
@romen, Thanks for the additional statement of support documented in the link above. #1328 good to merge for me -- if @bbbrumley wants to take another look, please do.
Yea the PR looks good üöÄ Thanks for the dialogue here, and on the PR thread üôè
Closed via #1328
