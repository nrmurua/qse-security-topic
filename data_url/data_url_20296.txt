When building on ARM (#460), if --disable-sig-picnic is removed from scripts/arm-cross-compile.sh, the build fails.
Compilation of src/sig/picnic/external/picnic_iml.c fails on lines 427 and 539 with "undefined reference to rpl_malloc"
Delaying fixing this until the integrating of upcomming round 2 code.
Have you had a chance to try the new Picnic code on ARM?
I just tried the master build on a raspberry pi (armv7l) and all picnic tests passed.
As discussed on the call yesterday, let's postpone the investigation of this after v0.2.
What's the status of this?
I need to look into this. There are new updates on Picnic that might solve this (I opened issue #588).
Cross compilation to Raspberry Pi using the CMake toolchain in #618 works fine, and the resulting binaries run fine on a Raspberry Pi. Closing issue.
