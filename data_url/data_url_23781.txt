When loading an experiment file, that was not written to the end, i.e. by aborting a measurement, the missing values from the original intended sizes are just filled with nan's.
I think it would be nice if those nan's weren't there after loading the file, but I cant figure out how I could change that behavior.
Or if there was an easy way to drop nan values. data.dropna() like in pandas, that takes care of all the arrays in the dataset.
you mean you want the array size changed? Yes, we can do that once we have dynamic sizing. If you have a ragged array though it's still going to need NaN in the shorter rows.
BTW, we're going to change the meaning of assigning an issue - you assign yourself when you actually start working on something, don't assign other people to an issue. If you're using the assignment to get my attention, the right way to do that is just to put "cc @alexcjohnson " at the end of the original issue description.
