Frozen dataclasses do not allow class attributes to be modified.
However, sometimes in the code we need to override that behaviour.
For example, the Device dataclass is frozen:
but __post_init__ modifies an attribute:
Following this discussion of Stack Overflow, there could be an argument for changing the way this is done.
The first consideration is that it might be preferable to never modify an attribute in a frozen class, and instead replace the object with a new instance.
The second consideration is that, when necessary, modifying an attribute of a frozen class should be done with object.__setattr__ instead of self.__dict__  (for technical reasons, see link above).
@darcangelomauro You seem to have your hands full right now, do you want me to take this one?
