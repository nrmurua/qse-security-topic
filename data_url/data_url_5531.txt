The qiskit Estimator produces incorrect results. I ran simulations with Estimator in qiskit primitive, and qiskit_aer Estimator with approximation=True. These two match, but qiskit_aer with approximation=False provides incorrect results. This can be fixed by turning 'abelian_grouping=False' in qiskit_aer Estimator which when ran with abelian_grouping=False, starts giving results that agree with Estimator in qiskit and qiskit_aer with approximation=True.
The expected behavior is that all the qiskit_aer Estimator results match with Estimator results using qiskit Estimator.
Something goes wrong in constructing observable estimators from the communicating Pauli groups. People who wrote that piece of code should be consulted.
I ran with Aer 0.13.2 and got
I think the issue for AerEstimator with default options is now fixed, but is it acceptable difference to the QiskitEstimator result?
And 2nd and 4th results of this test are varied every time (1st and 3rd returns always the same) should all the results be the same?
