Hi all,
I'm experiencing conflicts between latest cirq release (v0.10.0) and the cirq requirements in Openfermion (v0.9).
How long would it take for this to be updated?
I pushed a new version to pypi 1.0.1 which works with v0.10.0 cirq.   OpenFermion (v0.9) certainly had issues which the 1.0.1 cut works out.
