Currently Aqua uses wrapper.compile() in Terra. This function is a bit restrictive as is, because you can only choose to skip_transpiler or go through the default transpiler flow.
We will update this function to take a PassManager argument (Issue #1083 in Terra).
When that is done, can we also update the compile of Aqua to expose this? The skip_transpiler will then just be identical to passing an empty pass manager: pass_manager=PassManager().
@ajavadia  can those passes be initialized by a string name? or anything can be represented in the JSON? I think in the UI we need to have a way to let users configure what passes they would like to use.
I guess this is similar to the issue of the setting of backend #153
@manoelmarques @woodsp-ibm
yes we dont want to do this a string.
From the perspective of easily integrating our library with minimal dependencies, it would be great if the user could define the pass manager and pass it to setup_quantum_backend

resolved by #212
