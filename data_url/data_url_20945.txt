Running new testnet qrl 0.2.0 on a virtual machine (VirtualBox).  Node appeared synced with testnet.
Called Public API GetOTS with very large page_count parameter 1073741823.
My entire VM became unresponsive, had to close it down.  Seems like large memory usage was to blame.  Perhaps a large page_count can result in a runaway process and checking for reasonable parameters is appropriate here?
Description:	Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
Release:	18.04
