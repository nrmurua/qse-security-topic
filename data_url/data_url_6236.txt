According to the spec "Qiskit Backend Specifications for OpenQASM and OpenPulse Experiments", all backends are required to have a coupling_map in their backend.configuration().  The Aer backends do not.
How do you specify an all-to-all coupling map for arbitrary number of qubits as per spec?
Well, I believe that we upper bound the number of qubits based on the local memory.  So given that we call this number n_qubits it would be [[i,j] for i in range(n_qubits) for j in range(n_qubits) if i!=j]
