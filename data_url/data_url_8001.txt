Recent changes in correlation_2op_2t() modified the type of return value.
Previously, if tlist = None the correlation function returned a 1D array for the values at taulist.
Now it returns a 2D array instead with shape (1, n).
For backwards compatability should we return a 1D array?
If not, we should at least change the description of the function
A 1D array with shape (200,).
No response
Should we have it fails if tlist is None?
This function explicitly says it's 2 time correlation.
Just changing the docstring to something like "If tlist is None, tlist=[0] is assumed and the corresponding correlation matrix returned." should be enough, I think.
The implementation in QuTiP 4 returned this 1D array, which confused me. Changing the behavior broke one tutorial notebook, but a clear docstring should help users to see what the problem is.
Documentation updated in #2021.
