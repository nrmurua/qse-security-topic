Before raising an issue here I've asked Stack Overflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53929599/cannot-import-aer-from-qiskit-0-7
In Python interpreter, typing from qiskit import Aer raises an ImportError.
-Install Python 3
-Set up a new virtual environment: python -m venv C:\myenv
-activate this environment and pip install qiskit
-run python interpreter
-from qiskit import Aer
It also appears that doing the same on Ubuntu doesn't cause any problems
Expected that it would import
Hi @aleksey-uvarov, can you check if the qiskit-aer package was actually installed by the qiskit metapackage. If you run pip list you should see
Yes, pip list does show these three guys.
Maybe I missed something important, attaching the error message in full.

I guess next is to check it was actually installed in the right place: there should be a folder
qenv\lib\site-packages\qiskit\providers\aer which contains the contents of the qiskit-aer package
Uh-huh! No such folder.
I pasted this folder from the repository. The problem persists. Should I also reboot or launch some re-checking script?
The best thing for now would be to clone this git repo and follow the instructions to build and install from source.
You need to build as just pasting the python module contents wont include the necessary compiled C++ code for the actual simulator backends.
Okay, thanks. I think I'll just stick with the functioning Linux installation for now, though.
I also have the same problem. After I installed qiskit via pip, I can see it from pip list. However, no such a folder: qenv\lib\site-packages\qiskit\providers\aer. Is there a workaround except installing everything from source - I found it creates more problem there.
I think it is related to the platform: I am a power9 user: link, link. But I am still looking for a solution...
