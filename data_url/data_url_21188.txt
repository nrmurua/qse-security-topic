Presently flashing ARTIQ for kasli-soc relies on tools that are not part of artiq_flash or in ARTIQ master. This feature request is a place to discuss adding support for kasli-soc to artiq_flash.
The aim is to make day to day operation of kasli-soc as simple as kasli. This streamlines the currently toolchain which is (trivially) buggy and is not dedicated to kasli-soc (it supports multiple Zynq targets). It is an improvement of the crude outline I've got on the wiki.  Proposed modifications to artiq_flash follow.
Initial comment from m-labs is here. artiq_flash supported the complex flashing of Sayma so why not kasli-soc too? :)
