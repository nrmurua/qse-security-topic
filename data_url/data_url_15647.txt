At the moment PauliEvolutionGate takes a time independent Hamiltonian and returns its evolution in the form of some product formula. However, general system Hamiltonians are time-dependent, so it would be nice to be able to do something along the lines:
Below are some references for the different approaches to simulate the evolution of time-dependent Hamiltonians.
Product formula approach:
QDrift:
Linear Combination of Unitaries
Variational methods (many references, not listed)
Any updates on this?
The PauliEvolutionGate only supports static Hamiltonians. Time-dependent Hamiltonians are covered in the TrotterQRTE class, which implements a full Trotterized time evolution, see
