The release note added in #10300 contains incorrect circuit identities, and I think the actual equivalences might be wrong too (but I would have to brush up on my understanding of global_phase to be sure).  Specifically, the release note should say $X=-iYZ$, $Y=-iZX$, and $Z=-iXY$, but these are specified incorrectly (without the minus sign).

Oh damn, you're right - I had the relationship backwards in my head, and it wasn't caught by testing because the test (and what I did locally too) only uses Operator(gate) == Operator(circuit), which deliberately throws away the global phase.
edit: Operator(x) == Operator(y) doesn't throw away the global phase, but it's definitely confusing me what's going on here, because we very explicitly test all the standard definitions for correct global phase, and Operator(XGate()) == Operator(definition) is saying that it's all ok.
Ah no, panic over: the equivalences are actually correct, and so is the test that verifies them, it's just the release note that's wrong about what's implemented.  I'd just confused myself both then and here:
does not correspond to X @ Y, it corresponds to Y @ X - the state is on the right lol.  I'll just go hand back my PhD.
I just screwed up the release note: I put in the relations into Qiskit correctly as $X = iZY$ etc, but then wrote the incorrect $X = iYZ$ in the note.
