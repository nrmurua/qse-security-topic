Given a quantum state, write a function that determines whether it possesses a symmetric extension.
Naively, one can just call the symmetric_extension_hierachy function on the given quantum state to determine if it possesses on, but there are some small special cases that can be analytically determined (https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3530).
The functionality for this should be created in state_props/has_symmetric_extension.py with corresponding unit tests found in tests/test_state_props/test_has_symmetric_extension.py. The docs should also be updated in /docs/states.rst under "Properties of Quantum States" with toqito.state_props.has_symmetric_extension.py
