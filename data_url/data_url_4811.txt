The TensorFlow backend is currently lacking the new backend.reset(cutoff_dim=new_value) functionality. Consequently
currently fails. (Gaussian and Fock backends are OK.)
The fix should be committed into the tf_complications branch.
I added this functionality in 0e4acd6.
@smite can you add some new relevant tests for the expected new behaviour? I don't feel that the previously failing tests in test_utils were capturing this directly
I added test_eng_reset() in test_toolchain.py in 1e54f02. It tests changing engine/backend parameters during reset.
