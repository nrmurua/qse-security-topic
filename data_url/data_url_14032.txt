It may be useful (jupyter notebooks?) to support passing a code snippet (as a string? pointer?) to the QGL2 compiler, rather than requiring the code be in a file. See if we can readily support this.
Note that python importer treats files differently, so this may be problematic.
Also note that basic_sequences/AllXY.py shows how a single file can contain both QGL2 and code to run QGL2. Doing so does produce QGL2 compiler warnings (about imports), which could be cleaned up.
