Trying to get a phaser baseband board to work for the first time
It has been flashed using a Vivado jtag as described in https://github.com/quartiq/phaser
Currently getting ValueError: DUC+oscillator phase/amplitude test failed during phaser.init()
This is quartiq/phaser#5
Try load.tcl-ing the phaser bitstream again.
If that doesn't help please post on quartiq/phaser#5
