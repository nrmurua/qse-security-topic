Description
If the time limit is passed as numpy.int64, the cloud client fails with an error message that is difficult to track:
To Reproduce
Call the HSS solver with something like time_limit=np.int64(10).  In a real situation, this might happen inadvertently when, for example, using pandas to read a list of time limits from a CSV file.
Expected behavior
I would expect either a more direct error message about the type error with the time limit value (which appears to be the intent of the type check in the source code), or a conversion to int:

Fixed in dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client#536, released in cloud-client 0.10.3, shipped with Ocean 6.0.0.
