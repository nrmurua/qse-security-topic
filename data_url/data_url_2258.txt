This is not true. In some cases reshape returns a copy. This can result in undefined data going into the result, because the workspace buffer is never initialized.
The safe way to reshape and get an error if it's not a mutable view is to make an identical view view = buffer[...] and then set its shape view.shape = shape.
The code needs to be fixed to work in the case where reshape would fail, and a test needs to be added to trigger this case. I ran into this as part of #2137 .

But any permutation of the all-plus initial state should be the all-plus state.
