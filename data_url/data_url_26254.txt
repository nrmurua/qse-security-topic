Task: Implement the NPA hierarchy for extended nonlocal games.
The NPA hierarchy is used as a bounding technique to approximate upper bounds on the quantum value of a nonlocal game. Extended nonlocal games are a superset of nonlocal games, and an analogous concept (referred to as the "extended NPA hierarchy") exists to upper bound the quantum value of any extended nonlocal game.
More information on nonlocal games and extended nonlocal games can be found in the respective toqito tutorials here and here. More information about the extended NPA hierarchy can be found in chapter 5 or this thesis.
Presently, toqito implements the NPA hierarchy for nonlocal games. Adapting this feature for extended nonlocal games would most likely require building on top of the functionality found in helper/npa_hierarchy.py.
More information on the NPA hierarchy and the manner in which this idea is encoded into toqito can be found in the lecture here on the NPA hierarchy by John Watrous.
