The idea here is to align the CI as much as possible, so that logic is not being reused across workflows or repos.

Defining the new and improved versioning and release process with @wjcunningham7 and @AlejandroEsquivel
@wjcunningham7 I did some semantic versioning investigation based on the post release use case you described and I think we can support it.
does this work?
Yes!
excellent I'll get on implementing this
@wjcunningham7 you might also be interested in the tool I used to test the versioning scheme https://gist.github.com/rverst/1f0b97da3cbeb7d93f4986df6e8e5695
@wjcunningham7 @AlejandroEsquivel I've implemented the logic we discussed. It's in these 5 PRs. It will be easiest if they're merged in the order they were opened.
