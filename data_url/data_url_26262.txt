In this page, the link to the contributing guide leads to a "page not found" error. It directs the link to CONTRIBUTING instead of CONTRIBUTING.md which is why the error persists.
Hi @paniash,
Thank you kindly for catching that issue. I have since updated and fixed it. Nice catch, and thank you for your input!
