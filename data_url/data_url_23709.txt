When using the IVVI driver, if you repeatedly get a communication error it should raise that exception.
However, because of the line https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/instrument_drivers/QuTech/IVVI.py#L291 , the actual error is not raised. Instead it will give a very nondescript  File "d:\githubrepos\qcodes\qcodes\instrument_drivers\QuTech\IVVI.py", line 291, in _get_dacs raise('IVVI Communication error') TypeError: ('exceptions must derive from BaseException', 'getting IVVI_dac16')
Easy to fix by raising the original exception instead of a custom one, I think this both solves the bug and would be the intended behaviour.
@AdriaanRol yes, indeed that is just not valid python code :D
This was fixed by #541
