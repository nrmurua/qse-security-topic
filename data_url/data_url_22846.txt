In core_quantum_analysis.py line 624 it is written If numerical diagonalization is run, then we return the numerically diagonalized ...
however, line 695 it seems that it is always f1s that is returned. Irrespective of numerical diagonlization, f1 always contains the 1st order perturbation theory of the 4th order term in the cosine.
Thanks, Zaki, just fixed
