A Jupyter notebook is already available in:
https://github.ibm.com/IBMQuantum/qiskit-ignis-internal/pull/83
I think these should go into the Qiskit-tutorial/community/foo and im not sure if this one is for terra or Ignis given that the Clifford group will end up in terra.
My vote would be Qiskit-tutorial/community/terra/
I agree with community/terra as the best home for this.
I will merge it into examples for now and later we will move it.
