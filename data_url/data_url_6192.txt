This was working for me, but not for @nonhermitian. Our versions seemed identical, so not sure what the issue is. If others can try this and report the result with version number that'd be great.
I think the issue here is that the memory checks are happening before the qubit truncation pass. Currently all circuit optimiztion passes happen at a single step just before execution (but after all the memory checks for automatic configuration of paralellization). We need to change how these passes are implemented so that some, such as this truncation, can be applied before the memory checks.
