Coverage is fixed on new PRs forked from master after #643. The problem was that reports were not being submitted to codecov on master. As a fix I changed test.yml to run on push to master.
This means that the checks in test.yml - style/format, docs, and test on ubuntu - are now being run on push to master, in addition to test on macos / windows. This doesn't change the runtime really but does change the amount of resources.
I'm fine with this behavior, but this issue is to let everyone know and change the strategy if desired. (I needed to push to master to test the fix, hence why I'm opening this now after already merging.)

Note: We might want to run test.yml on push to the release branch as well, depending on the current / future release process.
No reservations about this at the Mitiq meeting, so closing and keeping the current behavior in CI.
