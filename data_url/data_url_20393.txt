New issue based on comment by @Steppenwolfe65 on PR #209:
SP800-185 3.2 states if S=N=0 cSHAKE output should be SHAKE. That would require adding a branch to the code that toggles the domain code from cSHAKE(0x04) to SHAKE(0x1F), all so you can test an invalid input.. does that make sense to you? I guess the point is, just because NIST does it, doesn't mean it is correct.
Fixed by #244
