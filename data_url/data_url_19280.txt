It seems like the AdiabaticEvolution model replaces things on the initial Hamiltonian, making repeated adiabatic evolutions without re-defining this initial Hamiltonian fail.
This should reproduce the issue:
You will notice how the h_x has changed.
This is not the case with dense=True Hamiltonians.
Why does this happen? Should this be fixed, or just properly documented?
I tried to reproduce your error, but in my case it works properly (I mean, the states are not modified after the Adiabatic Evolution).
Before executing the evolution (using the exp solver), a warning appears:
Thus the dense form of the symbolic hamiltonian is calculated anyway.
Shall we close this issue?
Shall we close this issue?
I think this is expected if using qibojit backend and it doesn't occur in case of numpy backend. @stavros11 and @andrea-pasquale what you think about this?
