Customizing the Instruction Set Architecture is not an officially documented ability, but it's an important feature for power-users who want more control over compilation and which qubits or gates are used.
In pyquil2, it was possible to create a custom instruction set architecture like this:
In pyquil3, this becomes a bit harder:
I don't have a proposed solution here. Sticking with 1 set of key names would be a welcome improvement.
Common use-cases are reducing the ISA to a specific set of qubits and edges or a subset of gates.
