I realize this is not really how the method was intended to use, but it felt natural as I was writing it.

that reshape operation is incorrect. In general you have to promote the wavefunction to a density matrix with np.kron, then do the partial trace, then apply a "nearest kronecker product" factorization to get a wavefunction as the final form. Then this will give you a unique traced wf representation (mod global phase) IFF the circuit is completely unitary.
edit: the traced outcome is not necessarily pure i.e. doing this operation on a pure state will result in a pure state (mixed state) if the input is separable (entangled). So either doing this operation promotes a state vector to a density matrix, or the output type (wf vs. dm) is ambiguous...
This would be a nice feature, but if we add support for this it should not be called just "partial trace" which is a well defined mathematical operation (what is described is a composition of outer product and partial trace).
