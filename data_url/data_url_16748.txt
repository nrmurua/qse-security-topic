The U2Gate and U3Gate of qiskit.extensions raise error of 'Insufficient number of ancillary qubits' if the number of control qubits exceed 2. Besides, there is no provision to provide ancilla qubits in the gate definitions.
Adding an extra parameter for ancillary qubits to the definitions of 'U2Gate' and 'U3Gate' or its base class 'Gate' might help.
I'm not able to reproduce this from 0.13.0.dev0+a4120d7 on python 3.5 :
I couldn't reproduce this with the same terra version, 0.13.0.dev0+e5adc70, but python 3.7.3. It's a little surprising the error you mention would show up for this code snippet. Can you provide a stack trace?

Thanks @kdk and @ewinston . Looks like the error I obtained was a result of missing Aqua installation. The error got resolved once I installed Aqua. I think I will close this issue now.
