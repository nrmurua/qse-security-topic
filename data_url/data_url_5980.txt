Maybe the README file is outdated?
Are you on linux? There are only builds available for linux: https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-aer-gpu/#files. If you're on linux then you can run pip verbose mode and it will tell you why it doesn't use the binaries, for example your pip version is too old and doesn't recognize manylinux2010, your distro is too old and isn't compatible with manylinux2010, non-x86_64 machine, etc.
I was on a MacOS and I did not read the README carefully enough. Probably the issue should be renamed to "Emphasis that qiskit-aer-gpu is only available on x86_64 linux."
