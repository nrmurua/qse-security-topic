Need to implement the following:
@qdev-dk/qcodes   should  there  be the  .run()  in the following snippet ?
See #263  for more info qc.Measure (not yet implemented).
For Loop we already have .then(*actions) so for symmetry I'd propose .first(*actions).
I'll comment on Measure over in #263
Yep, I think that syntax sounds good.
