Contents of cell objects in a kernel function's closures are not accessed during compilation.
The variable num_int is recognized as an integer within do_delay_mu just as in do_print.
do_print executes as expected, but a unification error is raised by do_delay_mu:
It seems in compiling do_delay_mu, the contents of the cell objects in do_delay_mu.__closures__ are not accessed, leaving instead the cell object.
My own sleuthing has led me here. It seems when updating host_environment, the cell objects themselves instead of their contents (via cells[index].cell_contents) are stored as the dictionary values.
