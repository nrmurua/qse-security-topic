The warning is showing up on the bottom, even on a 2-qubit problem with no chains.Please use this code:
import dimod
import dwave.inspector
from dwave.system import DWaveSampler, EmbeddingComposite
Q = {(0, 0): 1, (1, 1): 1, (0, 1): -2}
bqm = dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel.from_qubo(Q)
sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler())
sampleset = sampler.sample(bqm, num_reads=1000)
dwave.inspector.show(bqm, sampleset, sampler)
There is a related bug where the relative strengths are calculated in QUBO-space but they should always be calculated in Ising
