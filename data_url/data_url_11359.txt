Before raising this issue, I have already checked that I am:
The RQAOA Workflow is missing some form of error catching in the case where a QAOA run is incomplete/crashes midway.
Link to file
Line 385
If an error occurred during one of the QAOA runs and the error is caught, but the run is incomplete. The RQAOA should be terminated and whatever information that was obtained should be available in the final workflow object in the result attribute.
