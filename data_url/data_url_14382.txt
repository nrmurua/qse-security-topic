As noted in #8595 and elsewhere, the transpiler currently mishandles approximation_degree=0.0 as approximation_degree=None (which is approximation_degree=1.0). Following the definition of approximation_degree here:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/367ed4e34a3d662ef8ed8f2b91e8823bba1b8ca8/qiskit/compiler/transpiler.py#L178
approximation_degree=0.0 should maximally approximate (however that is defined by the relevant pass). Currently, I think there's a bug in handling approximation_degree IIRC in the TwoQubitBasisComposer (by this point, basis_fidelity)
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/dbc81a8dcdae9e9294b9058babf5883258daaa5d/qiskit/quantum_info/synthesis/two_qubit_decompose.py#L1087
that causes this, but this would need to be confirmed first.
expected_fidelities gives a deviation in the case of approximation_degree=0.0, it gives a exp_fidelity=1 instead of 0 (with basis_fidelity=1). Why is basis_fidelity=1 when approximation_degree=0.0?

The reason that basis_fidelity=1 could be that in class  TwoQubitBasisDecomposer: basis_fidelity is default 1.
