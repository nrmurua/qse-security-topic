To reproduce:
cirq/test.py:16: error: Unexpected keyword argument "b" for "B"

Do we want to remove json_serializable_dataclass decorator?  It doesn't look like ti is used anywhere.
It's used once in experiments/cross_entropy_benchmarking.py but that shouldn't prevent us from removing it.
I would not object to removing it, if the drawbacks exceed the marginal benefit
this annotation should be deprecated: #4460
use the dataclass helper function in a regular ol' method instead
Resolved by #5208.
