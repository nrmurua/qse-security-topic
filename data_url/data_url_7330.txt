Hi there !
I have a small issue and I don't know if it's my fault (I am new to Julia) or if it's a bug in the current implementation of the Wigner function. Here is what I have:
When I run (note the size difference between xvec and yvec):
And try to plot it using:
I have an error. However, if I do:
The command runs, but I obtain a shorter xaxis instead of a shorter yaxis. It obviously comes from a non transposed W array, but my question is: should I always do it myself ? Or is it a bug in the wigner function ?
Thanks in advance :)
Ivan.
Btw: your QuantumOptics.jl is awesome, pleasant to use !
Hi Ivan,
This is something that has always puzzled me a bit about PyPlot. Somehow, the dimensions are swapped in countour plots. To get what you want, you can just transpose the Wigner function, i.e.
should give you the right x and y axis. This has nothing to do with QuantumOptics.jl though. Good to know you find the package useful!
