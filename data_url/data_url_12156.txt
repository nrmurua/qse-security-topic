in the tutorial " terra/terra_parallel_tools.ipynb" the line:
from qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis import two_qubit_kak
return the error: ImportError: cannot import name ‘two_qubit_kak’ from ‘qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis’
Remove the line and adapt the tutorial.
I am also suffering from this problem on IBMQ Experience notebook.
Qiskit version: 0.8.2
Operating system: OSX
Yes, that is being updated soon
Oh, I didn't see this I already pushed a fix for it in: #774
closing with #774
