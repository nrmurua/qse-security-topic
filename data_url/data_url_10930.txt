when I try to run the example(about the four-color-map problem),I got a trouble follows :
./demoStates.sh:line35: ../../src/qbsolv: Cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
My use.qubo's format follows like:
c
c  this qubo was created by adj2qubo.py for 4 color uninary encoding
c
p  qubo  0  204 204 742
c AK
0 0 -1
1 1 -1
2 2 -1
3 3 -1
c HI
4 4 -1
5 5 -1
6 6 -1
7 7 -1
and so on
what can I do to solve the problem?
