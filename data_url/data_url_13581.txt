There is a nice section in the docs that explains the purpose of the Mitiq library here: https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/guide-overview.html
Especially for folks not from a quantum research/theory background it might be nice to include a bit of this at the top of the README for the repo.
I think a sentence or two at the top of the readme here: https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq#mitiq would be all that is needed. I would suggest something covering when you need error mitigation and how mitiq solves it (with links into docs for more info).
Having right at the top will make it easy for folks to understand why they might want to use the library, and to learn more about the approach from the get go.
