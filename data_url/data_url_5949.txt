I suggest to reorganize https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/test/terra/backends/qasm_simulator/qasm_noncliffords.py, such that it is more similar to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/test/terra/backends/qasm_simulator/qasm_snapshot.py.
The idea is actually to remove the files qasm_noncliffords.py and https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/test/terra/reference/ref_non_clifford.py. Their content will be moved to existing test files. Then add to these files a mechanism of supported backends, similar to how it's done in qasm_snapshot.py. A test that is not suitable for the stabilizer simulator will not contain this backend in its list of supported backends.
The benefits of this approach:
Working on it now
Done
