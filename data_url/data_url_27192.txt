A plot subtitle is added to the circuit_metrics dictionary, then is treated like a circuit group in metrics.py. This key should be ignored when collecting metrics, or the subtitle should be passed in a different way.
I have a fix for this
PR #427
In the file _common/metrics.py, there are multiple references to "subtitle" as a key to circuit_metrics. This does not seem like it should have been done because it uses that dictionary for multiple purposes. This is the core issue. The change in #427 to this file is done as a workaround to allow the metrics aggregation to work.
