@maffoo says sets of qubits have to be measured at the same time as each other always.
There are several possible constraints on measurements in xmon, such as the need to separate them by multiple microseconds.
Hey @maffoo, how's this going?
Pinging @Strilanc too.
Looks like @mafoo is back, so i'll ping him again :)
This is de-facto obsolete now. Related: #2141
