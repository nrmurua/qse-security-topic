I set QPU parameter answer_mode=histogram and submit a problem with several ground states, I expected to see the result returned in a histogram with ~4 occurrences buckets, similar to what results through SAPI:

The resultant samples have repetitions (e.g. 3rd and 4th) but occurrences are always 1:
@randomir don't spend time on this for now, I think I've isolated the problem to downstream from the SAPI interface. I'll verify and if yes, I'll open a Jira ticket instead
@JoelPasvolsky yup, that sounds about right. No post-processing of occurrences is done by our client.
@randomir, I talked to Marshall and he thought it likely a client-side problem after all and suggested I try submitting with the old SAPI client. He's right, it works with the old client:
The difference between the old SAPI client and Cloud Client is that the former submits only the problem's active qubits:
But Cloud Client submits all active qubits but with zeros for non-problem qubits:
