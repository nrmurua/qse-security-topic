TTL numbers are permuted within banks.
Huh? With the new front panels, the indicated order should be correct (if unintuitive).
Then I guess I have an old front panel - its numbering is usual.
Wouldn't it be better to change the code than introduce a counter-intuitive numbering on the front panel?
It's also the electrical signal ordering. But yes, the current state is not ideal, especially as that makes it easy to miss that the panel is in fact zero-indexed as IO1 is top left (a favourite gotcha for new users here). [Still on the way back to Oxford, I'd look up the current revision to confirm if I could.]
@klickverbot All the DIO boards we have in Oxford are from rev 1.1.
The current release (rev1.3) has channels numbered as:
0 1
2 3
4 5
6 7
Which matches other boards like Sampler.
So, I think that @sbourdeauducq is correct. However, fixing this will break the code for the v1.1 boards (which is fine, since we can fix that in our device db generation tooling).
This was fixed in newest release.
