Sampler produces incorrect result when running multiple ccts. When converting Amplitude Estimator FAE to primitives the problem was noticed. FAE runs different non-parameterized ccts in an interative loop.
The sample code shows it. You can change num_ccts to 3 or 4. At present it just uses 2 which still shows the problem. It prints the values it expects in a loop using a new Sampler for each. Then it runs a loop using the ccts with the same Sampler. This produces incorrect result. Like the ref values, if a new Sampler is used inside the loop then, it works. We need to be able to use same sampler instance as provided to the algorithm though. (Sampler is seeded for reproducibility)
For me produces
Should give the correct result

Thank you for the report. It occurs because quantum circuits with different parameters may have the same id. Here is more simple example to show circuit id collision. It means that id is not sufficient distinguish circuits.
The following example should have different id values between cct=0 and cct=1.
