Add tests for controlled-u1 gate for qasm simulator (statevector), statevector simulator, unitary simulator.
Like other tests in the qasm simulator these should test for execution in the standard basis gates (which now includes cu1 directly), the waltz basis gates (u1, u2, u3, cx), and the minimal basis gate set (cx, u3).
