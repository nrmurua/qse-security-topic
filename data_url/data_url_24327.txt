The command line works to export to a GDS file. However, when the button is pressed, NOTHING happens.
@grace-harper-ibm and @dwang429 determined when the button stopped working: commit 71807ea.
The button should work.
This is part of the change to qlibrary directory name. Originally more than needed, was changed. Another line needs to be reverted back.
