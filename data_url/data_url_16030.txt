This
fails with RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object
The error occurs in this method
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/0c8bb3dbf8d688590431ca79a83ba8aede84ed20/qiskit/opflow/list_ops/summed_op.py#L174-L187
In this case, one can see that pauli_sum is == to self, so the last line calls the method again with the same (implicit) argument.

I just found this issue (sorry for late).
This bug can be splited into two parts.
