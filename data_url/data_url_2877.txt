Sorry I don't have a smaller reproduction, but here it is:
Running this gives
This prevents the output state from being used as the initial state of another simulation (the simulator complains about the initial state not being normalized).
Running the example above with the measurement gate omitted gives a norm of 0.99999243, which is good enough to pass the test.
This example actually no longer fails with the change made in #406 , but I think something might still be up ...
What do you think is up?  We should close if we can't get a new repo.
Nothing other than that this happened again with some fairly complex code in OpenFermion-Cirq, but is still very hard to reproduce. Let's close for now.
