The timing side-channel test from #881 flags this as a potential timing leak. It was fixed upstream last June.

Thanks for this information. SIKE is not part of the automated PQClean-upstream import mechanism, right? Might this be a candidate for further automated direct-upstream importing (as discussed in #880)?

SIKE updates are handled by @christianpaquin I believe.
Thanks for the info. SIKE is up-to-date (in sync with latest commit), but it looks like this code snippet has not been updated. Weird; I'll look into it.
Adding to this, we should pull the most recent SIKE code to get microsoft/PQCrypto-SIDH@c59a5e1 as well.
Waiting for tag on SIKE upstream to capture latest commits.
SIKE just tagged v3.4; I'll integrate the diff and the missing code in sike.c.
