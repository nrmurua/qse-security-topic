The Variational Quantum Deflation algorithm has an attribute self._callback which is never used in vqd.solve().
Inspired by the code for the VQE algorithm, the callback should be called in the energy_evaluation() call.
It also seems interesting that the callback also informs the user of the current step (VQD runs k steps of VQE).
Currently, the test test_callback checks the equality of empty lists
The change would consist in adding the following lines during the call of the energy_evaluation(). These lines were taken from the VQE algorithm.
