Generic implementation bug, not about environment
Note that in qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.l_bfgs_b, we have the following defaults:
This is problematic since if maxfun is less than maxiter, the optimization will always get terminated by maxfun, since maxfun is always larger than maxiter (as calling from scipy library). Typically, one would get something like, depend on your option setting,
Here, nit = 211 << nfev = 12768. Therefore I would think it is proper to have those two defaults swapped. It has been a while for me that I have to swap them manually each time.
The issue is about default values.
I suggest we set qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.l_bfgs_b to
No response
We could also switch to the defaults that SciPy has, which is 15'000 for both maxfun and maxiter: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b.html#scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b

That would be wonderful. 15,000 seems to be a good number.
