We don't have tests for all the great stuff we have in qiskit.tools.
We need to address this ASAP :)
Probably the entire package needs a relocation/restructuring into the SDK, but let's discuss this in another thread.
Currently, this is a coverage information of the files in qiskit/tools:
Shall we open individual issues for fermion (@antoniomezzacapo), qcvv (@chriseclectic), visualization, optimization(@antoniomezzacapo ), andqi (@chriseclectic)?
I just noticed that matplotlib on MacOS is hell, so the numbers for visualization are off. The numbers for visualization are corrected now.
Individual issues created. The file location structure is been discussed in #268
