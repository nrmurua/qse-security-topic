I made some errors when trying to build qvm. After fixing the errors, the build still failed. It looks like deleting system-index.txt in the top-level directory (and also the same filename in both ~/ and in ~/quicklist/local-projects/) solved the error. It would be helpful to include this info in the build instructions.
I suspect make cleanall should do the trick, and that is in the build instructions. Did you try that @jlapeyre?
Yes, I tried it. It did not remove these files.
