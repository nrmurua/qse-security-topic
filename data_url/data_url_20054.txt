Not sure what changed -- no changes to the Kyber Intel code in a few months, as far as I can tell.
I re-ran locally on a machine with AVX2 and wasn't able to reproduce -- the tests all passed.  I've triggered the job to re-run on Github Actions, we'll see if it recurs.
I was able to reproduce it, but it only occurs after a few runs. The reason seems to be because the AVX2 version of Kyber uses both an AVX2 version and a non-AVX2 version for rejection sampling (rej_uniform). The non-AVX2 version is only used if more samples are needed.
A suppression rule currently only handles the AVX2 version, but not the non-AVX2 version of rej_uniform. This would need to be added.
