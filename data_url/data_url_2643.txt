When a circuit contains RotXGates, cirq.contrib.qcircuit.qcircuit_diagram.circuit_to_latex_using_qcircuit converts those to target qubit symbol \targ in the LaTeX output instead of \gate{\text{X}}.
Example:
Produces following LaTeX:
Which renders as:

This is intentional. The X gate is the NOT gate, so we draw it as a NOT gate.
(We'd do it in text diagrams too, if it weren't so common for supposedly fixed-width fonts to make 'âŠ•' too wide and skew the diagram.)
Is there a reason you specifically want it to draw as an X?
I see. I was thinking in terms of parameterized rotations, and wanted to generate a diagram for something like this:
In LaTeX this looks like this:

It threw me off that the X Gate renders differently depending on the value of half_turns, in this scenario I would prefer having the X symbol everywhere for clarity.
I see...
You can work around the issue by creating a custom gate MyX that inherits RotXGate but also cirq.contrib.qcircuit.QCircuitDiagrammable. Then use MyX instead of cirq.X.
I think that the current behavior is the one we want, at least for now, and there is a workaround you can use, so I will close this issue as 'working as intended'.
Thanks for the workaround!
