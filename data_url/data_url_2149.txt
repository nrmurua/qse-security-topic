This is referring to the build erroed we've been seeing in docs?
from the readthedocs logs it seems to be failing when installing contrib requirements. It fails while installing tensorflow with an out-of-memory error
@Dstrain did you run into this while pushing documentation for 0.8.0?
I think this was fixed long ago. The readthedocs dashboard shows nothing but success https://readthedocs.org/projects/cirq/builds/ and the 0.8.0 docs are built and served as "stable"
