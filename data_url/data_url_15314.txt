A quantum circuit with a gate conditioned on a single bit value of a classical register cannot be converted to a QASM string.

The error message could be better here, but QuantumCircuit.qasm produces OpenQASM 2, and there's no way to represent single-bit conditions in OpenQASM 2.  This should work with the OpenQASM 3.0 exporter (in qiskit.qasm3), though OQ 3 support is still under active development, and isn't fully complete yet.
I see. Thanks! @jakelishman
No worries!  I've just pushed #8701 that should improve the error message to better explain what's going on in this case.
