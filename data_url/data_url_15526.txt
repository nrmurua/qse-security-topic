The qiskit run_circuits utility is using a hard-coded sleep when it waits to check the job status here https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/utils/run_circuits.py#L219.
The issue has to do with using a hard-coded value when there is a configured value that can be used instead.
The code should instead use qjob_config["wait"] which comes from the QuantumInstance constructor and which can be made available to the code in run_circuits.
