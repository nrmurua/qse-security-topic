Couldn't figure this out
Well, a couple hours later, I added this line to engine:
And the type errors went away. I then removed the line, and the type errors stayed gone.
Quite frustrating. Worth knowing.
It just switched back to failing.
This is... literally impossible to debug. I delete some files, run mypy, it reports failures, I make a commit as a checkpoint, run a local check, run mypy again, and the failures are gone!
Doing nothing but run mypy can affect whether mypy reports failures.
Okay, I've figured out the weird stateful thing. It's because I was accidentally copying .mypycache along with the source files when preparing the test environment. That's fixed now. Should go quicker.
When I run the exact same command as the one invoked by python, I get no results instead of some results. Maybe there's some kind of environment variable ruining everything...?
I managed to make a small repro and report it to mypy: python/mypy#5015
