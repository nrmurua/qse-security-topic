With Summit there is now a large POWER 9 machine. A dashboard test for this architecture would have helped e.g. with #338. Unfortunately, Oak Ridge's security policy does not allow for an automated test. Hence, we'll probably have to look elsewhere for a suitable machine.
No progress in over two years and with ARM the next architecture is already on our doorsteps.
