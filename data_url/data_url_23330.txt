Running this snippet of code:
at some point i interrupt by keyboard (stop button in jupyter notebook).
Looking at the resulting data, i'd expect that data up to some point has been inserted into the DB.
I find that in some fraction of the time (around 50%), the last inserted data is inserted twice. i.e., the data is corrupted in that case.
when i load the data from the DB:
Output:
This seems to happen when the interrupt happens inside the insertion (rather than say during sleep):

The direct reason is that
doesn't get called, so the results stay in the Measurement object's cache, which gets flushed once more as the context manager exits.
We have some ideas to solve this, but as a very quick-n-dirty fix that would potentially cause data loss (but prevent data duplication), you could execute self._results = [] in the except part of flush_data_to_database. Or copy the results, clear the cache and then try to write the copied results.
