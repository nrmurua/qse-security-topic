I think we should go by the following strategy:
There is no general way to make the translation, since it's arbitrary what in the old scheme corresponds to experiments.
Did some experimentation in a notebook just put it here for reference
Need to figure out
Should it be possible to insert an array as multiple rows using the context manager api
It currently happens by default (for sufficiently simple cases). It ain't documented, but see e.g. here: https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/ae619137fc6819af175f3197aed858d605975645/qcodes/tests/dataset/test_measurement_context_manager.py#L349
(It makes sense considering the four lines that precede the quoted line)
@WilliamHPNielsen Yes but that inserts it as a blob right?
@jenshnielsen  No, it should unravel. Now (aa013f5) I changed the API to not worry about types and try to unravel always.
