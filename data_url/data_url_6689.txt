This is already open as a issue. I'd like to use the correct mathematical characters (if possible). We've checked in a change that uses direct HTML Unicode encoding. Try it, and comment on the issue if it now works for you. If we can't get it to work, I won't close the issue until it renders correctly for everyone (I can always go back to ASCII if I have to ;). FYI it works fine for me in all browsers... so it looks like a straight font issue.

It works for me, thanks. For reference, I'm using Chrome 46 on Windows 10.
