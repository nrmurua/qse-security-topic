Dear all,
I use Intel OneAPI 2021.5 to compile cp2k 2023.2, and I have one trouble on installing EPLA-2022.11.001 which shows an error in opening the compiled module file.  Check INCLUDE paths.   [MKL_SERVICE].

Here is the config.log file from build-cpu folder. Thank you for help.
I'm not an expert on compiling cp2k, but in your config (line 520) you get the message
configure:8162: WARNING: Your processor and OS supports ABM instructions but not your compiler, can you try another compiler?
It looks like you're using GCC version 8.4.0 which is quite old. Maybe try with the toolchain flag --with-gcc=install and see if that helps?
@Anyborr Our HPC GPU node runs cuda-10.1 and it cannot support gcc higher than 8. Besides, the OS is CentOS 7.
Alternatively, you may try to compile CP2K without ELPA support by setting --with-elpa=no. If your HPC center has ELPA installed, use --with-elpa=system or --with-elpa=/your/path/to/elpa instead.
If you actually need ELPA, you may check whether there is a way to install ELPA using a center provided service (Spack?). In general, I am also not sure about the compatibility of your ELPA version with the latest CP2K release and your available compilers. For more information on the compiler support of CP2K, check here. The oldest compiler we test with ELPA (see here), is GCC9.3 on GPU (CUDA 12, ELPA 2023), so it might be that our build system does not support your platform anymore. From your config file, I cannot tell what the issue is. Maybe, you can ask the ELPA developers as it seems to be ELPA-related. If you build ELPA with the toolchain, check this file for more information on the build process.
