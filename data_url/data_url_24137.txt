On trying to render a design, the metal-GUI does not draw the design, but updates the other things
Traceback (most recent call last):

Pull the qiskit-metal master branch
Setup metal as described in the README_developers.md using the conda method in a new environment
Try to draw any design on the gui. For example, run tutorials/Appendix A Full design flow examples/Example full chip design.ipynb
Look at metal-GUI to see the design missing
The GUI should show the design
This can be traced back to the clear_axis function in  qiskit-metal/qiskit_metal/renderers/renderer_mpl/mpl_toolbox.py
To correct this, the clear_axis method can just call axis.clear() as it did earlier
I tried your fix but still getting the error:
AttributeError: can't set attribute
Plotting error: can't set attribute [utility_functions.log_error_easy]
Do we comment all other commands except for:
axis.clear()
@HossamTohamy : The changed have been on the main branch. You can pull from that. Otherwise, yes, you have to comment all commands except axis.clear()
