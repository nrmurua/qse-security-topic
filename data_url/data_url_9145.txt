In Hafnian evaluation function, including _calc_hafnian and _calc_loop_hafnian,  there is a weird factor multiplication.
However, when glynn method is invoked, keps_deges has value in {-1, 1} and will never be zero. So this code block makes no sense.
Could you make a PR removing that line, to see if the tests pass?
