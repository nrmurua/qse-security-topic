Plot of second_point_pt of PointPT does not reproduce same behavior (linear voltage decline) as saved in ipynb-file, instead shows constant value. In particular,
outputs plot of constant voltage. (Adding third datapoint restores expected behavior)
Thanks for the report! Looks like a regression somewhen after 0.6. second_point_pt is wrongly translated into a ConstantWaveform. The error is in TableWaveform._validate_input.
Error was introduced in 8345423
I guess this requires a 0.7.1 release.
