Support for the AD7194BCPZ slow ADC on Sayma. Used by mezzanines for e.g. RF power monitoring.
Closing this, since we've provisionally agreed to scrap this ADC in v2.0 (although, we may add I2C ADCs to the afe mezzanines, but that should probably included as part of the support issue for those AFE cards)
