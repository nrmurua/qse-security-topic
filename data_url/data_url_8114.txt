This code creates a pulse (i.e.: sinusoid that decays over a particular period of time as determined by the pulse width). I'm trying to find the relationship between the different parameters of the pulse equation and the frequency of the graph. I basically loop over different values of a given parameter to create multiple graphs and use lmfit to get their frequency. I did this for Delta and it worked fine, now I want to do it for omega. Initially, omega and omega0 are both 5e9 (on resonance), but now I'm scanning over a small range within 10MHz of resonance. The problem is that the graph is behaving very strangely, as well as the fit, and I can't explain this. I just don't understand why this worked for Delta but not omega (red is fit, orange is graph).


w =  gub/h #omega
w0 = 5e9  # omega0 is the rotating frame frequency
for x in range(5040000000,5090000000,5000000):
Looking quickly, the sampling seems too low for the frequency.
You measure each ~3e-8, but the frequency is ~5e9.
You will probably get better result with times=np.linspace(0, 0.00001, 30000).
Unfortunately that didn't make a big difference. I just don't understand why the fit is so off from the graph itself. Is there anything I'm doing wrong with the part of the code that does the fitting?
@atmalik123 The formatting of your code in this issue isn't great, so it's a big hard to see what is going on. If you believe this is a bug in QuTiP, could you perhaps shorten your example code to something smaller that shows the issue more directly?
P.S. Even if this is not a bug in QuTiP, finding a shorter piece of code that doesn't behave as you expect is likely a good way to debug the issue.

This actually was the issue. Turns out scanning over 1GHz range was too much, so I needed to sample more. I reduced to scanning over 1KHz and I could properly plot without increasing the number of sampled points. Thanks so much for your help
@atmalik123 Great! Glad @Ericgig's suggestion worked and thank you for reporting back.
