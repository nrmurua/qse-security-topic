Combining Urukul with and without SUServo in the same configuration result in compiler error when trying to use both.
Every part of the code works fine without errors.

To work around this, you can make a subclass of CPLD (empty body) that is used in the device db for the suservo Urukuls. This is what we do in Oxford internally.
Of course, we should implement a workaround like that upstream as well (including integration with the JSON machinery which we are not using yet).
