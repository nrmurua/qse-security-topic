Right now the routing passes all set the final_layout property in the property_set of the PassManager it's running in. This would be useful to expose to users that call transpile() so they know the layout the transpiler has set. We already preserve the circuit metadata for each transpiler pass explicitly for cases like this where we want to add attributes from the transpiler on the output circuit. We should start doing this for the final_layout property.
This might also be a good time to move the existing initial layout property we set as a private attribute on the output circuit to the circuit metadata as well.
One other note here is that for qpy by default we json serialize the metadata so just inserting a Layout object to circuit.metadata is probably not the best approach because it'll break qpy serialization for transpiled circuits. Either we should add a custom json serializer and deserializer to qpy (and maybe make that configurable) or convert the layout to something that can be serialized by default.
