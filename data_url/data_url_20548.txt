I want to enable sphincssha256128fsimple and sphincssha256128ssimple schemes. So, I changed enable command from false to true in generate.yml file and executed python3 oqs-template/generate.py and make generate_crypto_objectsÂ  commands.
All the steps are successful but output is as follows:
Unknown algorithm sphincssha256128ssimple
Unknown algorithm sphincssha256128fsimple
Please be specific as to where you get this output: Which command generates this?
Edit/Add: When doing this for fun in oqs-provider as it has nicer output facilities, all tests pass and the output is clear:
sorry for not mentioning the command. This is the command that I used:
apps/openssl req -x509 -new -newkey <SIG> -keyout <SIG>_CA.key -out <SIG>_CA.crt -nodes -subj "/CN=oqstest CA" -days 365 -config apps/openssl.cnf
Here's what happens when I do this:
Please run (and show the output of) apps/openssl version, apps/openssl speed test and ldd apps/openssl to ensure you run the right code (and are not using a wrong shared crypto lib).
Following is the output:

Did you install the newly built oqs-openssl in /usr/local/lib?
Edit/add: Should the answer be "No" as I presume, please use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to solve your problem (and close this issue).
I changed the path using following command:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
Now, I am getting following error:

Do you understand what LD_LIBRARY_PATH does and how it can be used in your setup?
No. Please guide me.
Please check for various instructions on the internet on how to use the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to override where Linux looks for shared libraries.  Comment #424 (comment) above gives one example, but there are many ways to do it.
Closing since this isn't an OQS issue.
