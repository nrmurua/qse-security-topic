We'd like to add QIR alongside QASM 2 and 3 for interoperability with other packages, hardware, and for QEC compatibility. Having QIR will help with integrating with OQC and I believe there should be some discussion on how qBraid can be as interoperable and building some interoperability with QASM which is more gate based as well as Qiskit etc. We already support qiskit, cirq, pytket, qasm 2 and 3 with kak decomposition (though scaling for gate decompositions should be another issue).

Seems like best initial integration would be to use qwop to convert QIR $\rightarrow$ Cirq / OpenQASM 2 via export_block()
Will need to look more into conversions to QIR because doesn't seem like qwop supports that just yet
Boxed layer 1 (language-specific conversion) represents proposed integration with qBraid-SDK transpiler, coinciding with architecture.png
Implementation underway in separate qbraid-qir package repo. To later be integrated as plugin.
In progress: cirq -> QIR
Future: OpenQASM3 -> QIR
Coming soon: https://docs.qbraid.com/projects/qir
