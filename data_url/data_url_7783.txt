It looks like autoray is required but it isn't mentioned in the docs (https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.0/installation.html) or in setup.py. Would be good to add it as a dependency.
Thanks for raising this Paul! I've hopefully fixed this in ec57b6c.
Eventually I'd like to get quimb and autoray on conda-forge so that everything can be satisified from one place.
