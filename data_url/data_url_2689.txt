Need to be able to specify the operators to be measured over the wire, and then get back expectation values.
This should be merged with #942
As I understood it (perhaps incorrectly), the issues are a little bit different. This issue sounds to me to be about changing the way the simulator works so that one can get expectation values directly instead of needing to average over many runs. Whereas issue #942 is about functionality for specifying the circuits needed to perform the measurements.
If I understand correctly, this issue is actually about potentially modifying the Quantum Engine interface to allow more than just taking a Circuit and returning bitstrings.
or even just the Cirq simulator.
True, currently the two interfaces are identical and I think the plan is for them to remain so.
Yes the interfaces are the same but the way you would get an expectation value from the simulator, versus from the device are very different. You need to sample the device whereas from the simulator you can exactly contract the expectation value from the wavefunction.
WaveFunctionSimulatorState should have a way to pass in the PauliSumLike that you want to calculate the expectation of.
@95-martin-orion can this be closed? or merged into some of the other open issues?
Yeah, I'd say this was resolved as part of #3492.
