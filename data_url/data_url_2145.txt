I want to modify exponent of given gates to substitute old sympy.Symbol to new one. But it is not allowed because the gate.exponent as no setter. Is it intended design or may I add it?
Hmm. I found out _with_exponent() but it is private. So I decided using the full statmenet:
but am afraid of _global_phase. Does cirq.decompose() guarantee that the generated gates have no _global_phase?
Closing because gates (and many types in Cirq other than Circuit) are intended to be immutable.
If your goal is to substitute one symbol for another, you should use cirq.resolve_parameters to create a new gate.  This will work in general, even if the exponent is an expression involving that symbol.  cirq.resolve_parameters also works on Operation and Circuit.
Thanks. I checked it works perfectly :)
