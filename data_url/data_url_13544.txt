This is related to optimized PEC executors which collect equal circuits for improving efficiency (see  #412  and  #457).
In order to simulate the execution of n circuits with a single call of the executor,
we should scale the number of shots proportionally: shots ---> n * default_shots  to simulate the same estimation error of
n independent calls.
Detect if the argument shots is present in the executor signature.
In this case collect equal circuits and scale the shot argument as required: shots ---> n * default_shots 
If the argument shots is not detected, assume zero statistical noise (e.g. exact density matrix simulation).
For example, this could be the new signature for execute_with_pec based on the previous ideas:
Also important to consider a maximum number of shots which is relevant for some hardware.
Removing this from milestone of v.0.5. I guess it would be relevant to the milestone of v.0.6.
