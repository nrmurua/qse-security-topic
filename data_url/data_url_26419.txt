I recently made the mistake of calling the PBE0 functional in the following way:
This certainly gave wrong results and it was not trivial to spot the error in the input. I was thinking some warning can be printed if a keyword and a section are used together. I wanted to do this but I am not sure if the warning should be printed when parsing the input or right before the calculation of the functional starts.
I think it makes sense to test the presence of other functional sections while expanding the keyword. In general, crashes or warnings should be emitted as early as possible.
