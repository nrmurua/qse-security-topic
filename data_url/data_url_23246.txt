Would make a lot of sense for fine tuning the gains of control loops....
how do you imagine it to make it user-friendly? in fact, i usually do the fine tuning with a loop, to search the setting that provides a minimum error signal rms (or another measure). clicking up and down by hand on the pid setting is imho slower than typing pid.p *= 1.1 into a console repeatedly.
what is practical is to have keyboard shortcuts, like ''+" and "-" to tune the gains.
I have made a +/- button on the left /right of the lineEdit.
Pressing upArrow/DownArrow works as well
Also, for gains or equivalent quantitites, the button is set to "log_increment" --> the buttons look like "*"/"/".
working well i guess..
