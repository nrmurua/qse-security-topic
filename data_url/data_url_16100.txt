Quantum circuits and pulse schedules can be sent to backends using qiskit.execute which allows default_qubit_los and default_meas_los as arguments. These arguments allows pulse users to set the LOs of drive and measure channels and are only understood when schedules are run but ignored when quantum circuits are sent.
The expected enhancement is to allow execute to allow the user to set the qubit and readout frequencies when sending circuits to the backend and not just schedules.
