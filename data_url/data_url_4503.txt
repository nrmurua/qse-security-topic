I am currently working in a field theory project where we must compute the energy of a ~20 qubit hamiltonian. The problem is that the statevector is 20-qubit long, but the hamiltonian takes the same memory as a 40-qubit state, which does not fit in any RAM. I have observed that cirq and openfermion are capable to deal with this kind of hamiltonians by letting the matrix be sparse.  This in fact can be done by qibo obtaining the expectation value of a sparse matrix as
or equivalently
Now, the problem is to configure a callback for the energy from a sparse matrix as our hamiltonian, for example
Is it possible? When I run a similar code my error is
 TypeError: Matrix of invalid type <class 'scipy.sparse.csc.csc_matrix'> given during Hamiltonian initialization
