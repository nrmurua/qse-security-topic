Python 3.5 on Debian Stretch x86 machine.  Trying just to install from pip, but it always fails at building the pyqryptonight wheel, and of course fails to install pyqryptonight after that.  Other wheels build fine.
Dang.  It's not you, it's me.  Old cpu.
$cpuid | grep -i aes
AES instruction                         = false
Same issue but running an Intel J3355 Processor (2.5 GHz, Dual-Core) with AES-NI enabled.
Confirmed AES instruction = true
