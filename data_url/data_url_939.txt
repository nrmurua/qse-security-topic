Description of the issue
If possible, it'd be really helpful to provide a devcontainer specification that would allow spinning up a container for Cirq in VS Code or GitHub Codespaces. In this case, that would likely consist of a post-create script that calls pip install -r requirements.txt; pip install -e . for each subpackage, I believe?
Is this a VSCode specific concept? I would imagine most vscode users would create the devcontainer.json file themselves. Unless this is a general concept that can be used across different IDEs, we should probably not add it as part of the repository.
