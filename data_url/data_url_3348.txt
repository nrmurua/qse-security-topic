Method Wavefunction.from_bit_packed_string is the bottleneck for wavefunction simulation performance at and over about 20Q. An example profile of a small 25Q circuit saw 160 seconds of the total 210 seconds spent in this method.
On investigation, the decoding can be done directly using a numpy constructor, and almost completely elides the time spent in this method.
The code:
can be replaced with the equivalent:
None.
Awesome!
