The following code now raises an error from C++ layer:
Here's the full output:
Partially, the problem is that 3-qubit QubitUnitary does not have proper decomposition. Still, it is also possible to support (non-trainable) QubitUnitary in Lightning as we anyway support it in the forward path (by obtaining the matrix and apply it using e.g. applyMultiQubitOp defined in the LM kernel).
Thus I think we need to decide whether we want to support those operations in adjoint-diff path in Lightning or raise a proper error in the Python layer.
