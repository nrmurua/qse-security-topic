It would be nice if the Options class had a method to iterate over the entire set of options and return an iterator of all the fields and current values in the object. Right now the only way to do this is something like options.__dict__.items() which isn't a great user interface. So adding a dedicate method that returns an iterator of everything would be useful so we can replace all the places where users are using the __dict__.items() pattern (this will still be supported, but having a dedicated method will look cleaner if nothing else).
We definitely need to do this, because Options.__dict__ is a fake-out anyway - it's not even an instance dict but a faked property to maintain compatibility with qiskit-experiments when the Options class changed about a year ago.
