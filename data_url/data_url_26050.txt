Right now we're performing updates to the qBraid SDK so frequently that people who have the environment installed often run into issues with deprecated API routes. Since we're too early on to account for all backward compatibility, we instead should have a version check. There should be an API route that returns the latest qBraid SDK version. This will be called from within the qBraid SDK, and checked against the installed version. If there is a mismatch, the user will be warned, and/or prompted to install the latest version.
