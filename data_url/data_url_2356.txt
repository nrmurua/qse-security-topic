On my Pixel's Chrome formulae show up duplicated:

This is not only on mobile.
The formulas are defined twice; in Latex and in a gif. For example
We should remove the .gif and define the formulas in Latex
Also in https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/simulation.html under Monte Carlo simulations of noise
I think this is leftover from before we added latex support.
