Would be safer to make expectation functions set the input float to zero before computation, I can't think of a case where this is a problem and it would prevent some subtle bugs
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
Seems resolved after the switch to open-source QSim expectations and the zero-setting here
