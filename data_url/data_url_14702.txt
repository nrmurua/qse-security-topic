The transpiler needs, as expected, to replace DAG nodes in several parts of the workflow. However, a pattern repeats:
At the same time, it's error prune because there is global phase and parameter handling all around. On top, there are some circuit/dag conversions that can probably be avoid.
Examples of this code/logic duplication (maybe there are more):

I have a small attempt for that in #5227 but ended up being harder than expected. If somebody wants to have a deep dive here, please go ahead.
