Hello,
I'm using the following system and versions:
and I get this error repeatedly when using the steadystate function.
The does not raise every time I use the function and it has a different number at the end everytime it is shown.
Hi,
There are many methods for the steadystate solver, some are faster, some are less stable. I would suggest trying other method until your find a good one for your problem.
Available method are:
'direct', 'eigen', 'iterative-gmres', 'iterative-lgmres', 'iterative-bicgstab', 'svd', 'power', 'power-gmres', 'power-lgmres', 'power-bicgstab'. 'direct' and 'power' can use mkl as a solver, all can use scipy.
You can also try to change some options such as the tolerance and max iteration number.
The options for each solver are different depending on the solver and not all are documented.
I list them here if you want to go deeper:
For scipy:
For mkl:
Lastly, most steadystate's method have a logger if you activate debug in setting:
I have just installed qutip using the master branch. When running the tests script test_steadystate.py, I receive a similar violation as above.
Is this a known bug with windows, or is there a fix?
The steadystate tests pass in our Windows GitHub Actions test runs now, so I'm closing this under the assumption that it was fixed between 2020 and now. Very happy for a new bug to filed if it still persists in 4.6.3 or 4.7.
