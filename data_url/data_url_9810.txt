Application
It would be good for users to be able to decide which type of copy they want to use for the bqm.
Proposed Solution
To implement the __copy__ method on the BQM object as defined in https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/copy.html. We may also want to add a deep=False optional parameter to the BinaryQuadraticModel.copy method.
Additional Context
The current implementation of  BinaryQuadraticModel.copy uses python's copy.deepcopy. See #324, #326.
Potentially useful for dwavesystems/dwave-hybrid#75.
Do you propose deep=False? What are the downstream implications of a shallow copy (other than speed)?
