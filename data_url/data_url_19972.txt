https://openquantumsafe.org/liboqs/algorithms/ should be updated. Stuff I've noticed:
Just chiming in regarding BIK -- the Round-4 spec does include the FO transform, but I think the team doesn't claim CCA security because of a missing formal proof.
Just to confirm, In section 4.1.3 in the BIKE spec it says
Key reuse or adapting BIKE to asynchronous protocols (e.g. email) require to secure long term static keys. Those usage models are possible but no longer provides forward secrecy and require IND-CCA security. Note that they are not compliant with BIKEâ€™s current specification.
https://bikesuite.org/files/v5.0/BIKE_Spec.2022.10.10.1.pdf
So there's no CCA-secure secure implementation. It indeed does still use the FO (section 4.3.4, "Why keep the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation?") but the names of the parameters are now just "BIKE1-Level1" and "BIKE1-Level3" according to the spec.
What about streamlining https://openquantumsafe.org/liboqs/algorithms/ to only list the algorithm families (still present -- ie, removing Picnic et.al.) with pointers to their respective .MD files in github (e.g., https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/docs/algorithms/kem/bike.md for BIKE)? That way the alg list on the "static" website is "automatically" up-to-date with the latest liboqs code.
