When installing the toolchain on a skylake system but setting --target-cpu=haswell, then openblas still is built with native target incl avx512.
This is because in toolchain/scripts/stage2/install_openblas.sh there is no TARGET flag in the make call, unless --target-cpu=generic. Since haswell is given as an example in ./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh --help it is probably confusing for users.
The obvious fix is to add the TARGET=HASWELL variable to the make call. But this requires manual intervention.
@bjoe2k4 Thanks for pointing this out. Unfortunately, the target labels of OpenBLAS do not match the gcc compiler arch flags very well. The fix #2522 should at least make --target-cpu=haswell work as expected.
