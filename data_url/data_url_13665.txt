Not sure if there is a particular reason we want to define them in the repo, but I'd bet that the Pauli matrices are somewhere in Cirq, and it's probably better to not duplicate code unnecessarily.
Agreed. Are the matrices used anywhere? I'd say either delete matrices.py if not or move the definitions to utils.py if so. (Alternatively, use definitions from Cirq, e.g. cirq.ops.X._unitary_() or something similar.)
