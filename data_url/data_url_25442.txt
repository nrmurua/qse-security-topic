Note: these are "live" functional tests so no mocking required, also they are not expected to run in the tests workflow of the plugin, furthermore they should not use pytest in any manner as they will be invoked using python

@AlejandroEsquivel Does point no 2 in the AC mean that we run terraform init and provision the required resources that are declared in a main.tf file for example?
@Emmanuel289 yes, good point for ec2 as it does it's own provisioning we only really need point 3 which is the functional tests that will be run for ec2
