Sub problems may be coming from a minimization or maximization context, make sure they are aligned consistently to minimize before calling solver callback.
qbsolv always maximises internally, with a sign variable carried around to track whether the solution needs to be flipped. Maybe should be reviewed. dwsolv.cc line 205. Is this the same for Python?
