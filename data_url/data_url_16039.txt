These two functions have existed for some time but never called by the transpiler -  invoking them is manual at this point. They are in qiskit/transpiler/synthesis.
We should make them available to be called, but prior to that we need the block collection enhancement to filter CNOT-only or CNOT+phase-only gates (i.e. #5775).
