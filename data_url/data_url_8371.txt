Simulating the stochastic master equation, I got confused since dW_factors are used to
compute the measured value, e.g. _smesolve_single_trajectory in stochastic.py,
but not in the update of density matrix, e.g. _rhs_rho_euler_maruyama in stochastic.py.
If it is not a bug, how shall I set the value?
Shall I understand as a fixed quantity as in this tutorial,
or is it a free parameter?
Thanks in advance!
dW_factors only affect measurement and nothing else. You should leave them at the default value. As I understand it, it is mostly there if you want to use another method than provided ones (homodyne, heterodyne or photocurrent) and manually provide d1,d2 and rhs.
