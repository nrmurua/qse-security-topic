Add tests for the following functions in rb_utils:

Since count_gates and gates_per_clifford receive circuit qobj, there are two options to test the functions.
(1) add pickled circuit qobj.
(2) manually construct simple circuit consisting of basis gates and assemble it inside the test.
I prefer (2).
And I also think those functions should not receive qobjs because qobj is the data format for transfer layer, not for analysis. It is reasonable to take QuantumCircuit object instead of qobj. In addition, basis gate key and counts should be explicitly bound in the output of those functions, ie Dict[str, float] with key of basis gate name instead of List[float]. Currently analysis flow implicitly assume common basis gates, but once we get multiple set of basis gates, eg ion trap, it is difficult to map count values to specific basis gate. This could be a separate issue.
@ShellyGarion we need to update below notebooks according to API change in #360
