As of 575be2a, experiments using numpy arrays in the core device, that are passed via attribute from the host, nolonger compile.
Any experiment accessing a numpy array attribute on the core does not compile. The exact error changes through the git history and also depends on the array dimensions. However, as of 575be2a, compilation fails for 1D and 2D arrays.
The following code demonstrates the issue
Numpy arrays passed as attributes from the host should be handeled by the compiler.
The error message when run with 575be2a is
The error message changes several times. On the current master (as of 1c645d8) the error for 1D and 2D arrays is:
We (obviously) observe the same on 90017da and it breaks a number of our experiments (our fault for running on beta). Is there a path towards solving this issue? I'm afraid I don't qualify here...
Looking into it. Arrays should just be directly emitted instead of synthesising AST literals (which is where this comes from).
(575be2a etc. weren't supposed to work in the first place, but the last commit in that merge should â€“ and does, except for this, which, at a glance, is related to polymorphic ints.)
This is now fixed in master. It is, however, quite likely that there are still some regressions left concerning NumPy array support, as the in-tree tests are very limited. Previously, this wasn't much of an issue, since arrays were implemented as a thin veneer on top of lists in the compiler (which are pervasively used, and thus well-tested). The coming version, however, will provide proper multi-dimensional array support (including matrix operations, etc.), so the innards are now completely different. I don't have a ndarray-heavy code base to test this against myself (our experiments have been running master all along), so any further regression reports will be much appreciated.
