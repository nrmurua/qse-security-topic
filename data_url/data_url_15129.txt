Qiskit supports the CSdgGate, but raises error when creating a circuit from a qasm file that includes a csdg gate. Issue may exist for other gates as well, but so far this is the only one I've identified.
Program should print out new circuit without error

No response
The bug here is actually in the OpenQASM 2 output rather than the input - Qiskit should have emitted a file that includes a definition for csdg, because it's not defined in the standard-library qelib1.inc file. The parser is correctly complaining that the OpenQASM input doesn't define that gate.
Ok, gotcha. I did some more testing and the same problem seems to occur for 4 other (a total of 5) gates:
Let's break this one in 4 other issues!
rzx seems to work, I think:
Did we need separate issues for all of these?  They're all the exact same thing - the OQ2 exporter considers them "predefined" gates, but they're not.  The solution is just to delete one corresponding line each from QuantumCircuit.qasm.<locals>.existing_gate_names.
For completeness, the full list of those that won't work right because of the reason I just gave is "ccz", "cs" and "csdg".  "rzx" will reimport in the expected manner; it won't be mapped to RZXGate fully because it's not in (Terra's mutated) qelib1.inc, but it will get pulled back in semi-correctly, up to the failures of Terra to handle parametrised gates properly during export.
