That permutes qubits. There's cirq.interop.QuirkQubitPermutationGate which does what I want but a) it's not part of the main set of cirq ops and b) it requires an "identifier" and "name" which are superfluous
There's also cirq.contrib.acquaintance.LinearPermutationGate.
It seemed easy enough to pull it out from quirk - raised #3298. Let me know if this meets your needs @mpharrigan.
Regarding the acquaintance - I don't understand yet why we need a SWAP gate in the constructor - but it feels like that with a bit of work we could make maybe this lightweight QubitPermutationGate the parent of the acquaintenance hierarchy? @bryano?
The swap_gate attribute is so that the gates can be used in the fermionic context (i.e. with swap_gate=ofc.FSWAP).
