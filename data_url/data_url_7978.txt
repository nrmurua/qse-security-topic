I am encountering a TypeError whenever I run any code for the second time. The behaviour is as expected when I run the code for the first time. I am encountering this error only on Linux. It is working fine on my Windows laptop.

This is quite odd because running this code again should do almost nothing. How are you running the code again? Are you running it in a Jupyter notebook and are you using something that reloads modules? E.g. %autoreload?
Could you try shortening the code that you run twice? Is just running import qutip twice sufficient?
Could you also provide the full traceback and not just the last two lines?
I am using spyder. When I run the code once by pressing F5 button, then I get expected behaviour. But when I press F5 again, then I get error. If I modify the code and press F5, same error. If I restart spyder, then again I do not get any error on the first run, but the error repeats on subsequent runs.
Yes, just running import qutip also gives the same error.
I guess you are asking for the full error message and not just the last two lines. Here it is for import qutip for two subsequent runs.-

If you are using Spyder and its User Module Reloader (UMR), could you try finding the preference Set UMR excluded (not reloaded) modules and add qutip to the list of modules to exclude?
Hi. Thanks, but I am now getting a new error.
If the code is-
`from qutip import *
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print(Qobj())`
Then there is no error whatsoever.
If the code is-
`from qutip import *
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print(Qobj())
print(Qobj([[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]]))`
Then it gives expected result if I run it first thing after launching spyder. But if I have already run any qutip code and then try to run this code, then I get the following error-
File "/home/premkr/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/scipy/sparse/base.py", line 283, in bool

Yay, I'm glad that helped.
I'm going to close this issue since it doesn't appear to be a bug in QuTiP, but happy to reopen it if that proves wrong & happy to keep helping with debugging here for a bit.
Reloading modules in Python often results in strange behaviour. Perhaps also adding numpy and scipy to the modules not to reload will help?
I did try using importlib.reload(qutip) but I couldn't replicate your issue that way,
Thanks. I added numpy, scipy and matplotlib to the modules not to be reloaded, and the issue seems to have resolved.
By the way, I am using an old version of spyder on my device. Could that be the cause of this issue? I do not have the admin control over the device, so if that is likely a cause, I will ask the admin to update spyder.
I don't know Spyder well, but it is not unlikely that a newer version includes some improvements to reloading. If might be nice to have a newer version of your development environment regardless?
Glad everything is working for you now!
