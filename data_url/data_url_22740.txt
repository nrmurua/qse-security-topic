It worked on the KC705 during the tests we did in the lab 2 weeks ago. It was broken before the Quantity removal and machine units refactoring.
The test output-to-inout (with a wire and two rtios) works but the inout-to-same-inout (same rtio) fails.
At least it did here:

Changing unrelated parts of the gateware makes it work. Looks like the typical ISE/Spartan-6 bug.
I think the real issue was the constraints. It did not seem to apply the 8ns constraint in the rtio domain at all. Worked around now in 959ba99
