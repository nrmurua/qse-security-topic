The QuantumCircuit.{q,c}regs attributes can be set, but doing so will not update the corresponding QuantumCircuit.{qu,cl}bits list, leaving the the circuit in an inconsistent state. (All bits in each register attached to a circuit should also be included in that circuit).  This was likely introduced as part of #4766 .
Either these attributes should be make ~read-only (an @property without a corresponding setter) or should be make to correspondingly update QuantumCircuit.{qu,cl}bits. (Some effort was put into the latter when #6621 uncovered a failing test, and is currently WIP at #7008 ).
