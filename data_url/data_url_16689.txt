Let's deprecate the pulse_lib path and move everything to library instead.
This 1) matches the circuit style (circuits.library and pulse.library) and 2) looks nice, and less redundant by using the namespacing (pulse.pulse_lib vs pulse.library)
If a user imports from pulse.pulse_lib, the code should still work, but a DeprecationWarning should be printed, explaining that pulse.pulse_lib should be replaced by pulse.library.
@lcapelluto : I would like to take this has my "good first issue", I want to do qiskit community contributions. Could somebody assign it to me please?
In this issues, its more of an aesthetic issue.  What you are saying is instead of name the module name,  pulse_lib it should be named as library, so when one imports pulse_lib &/ library it points to the same.
@lcapelluto  : I have fixed it in my local. On assigning to me,  I can push the code.
Thank you @hykavitha, I have assigned to you ðŸ˜„.
for Deprecated warnings, what class to use? @taalexander : you know?
@taalexander  : I have renamed the module pulse_lib to library, Also, ran make test when removed
pulse_lib import at pulse/init.py, so I can rename the pulse_lib imported statements to be library qiskit/pulse/init.py
make test is pretty good with pulse_lib imported or that part commented out in this file.
but make lint is showing re-imported, what should I do?

We use DeprecationWarning

You would need to update the __init__ file to not import all from pulse_lib.
