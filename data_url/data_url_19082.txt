Automatically determining a suitable column width for the "iter" column in print_table (#64) requires knowledge of iter_stop. While we're at it, it's probably a good idea to make as many parameters of optimize_pulses as possible available to any info_hook routine. This would include the propagator, chi_constructor, mu, and sigma callables, and iter_start/iter_stop. A possible use case of this additional information would be the implementation of a dynamic progress bar in an info_hook.
