Hi @Strilanc: I would like to implement this. pauliString -> tableau seems pretty straightforward (Pauli group acts on itself via conjugation). What are you imagining for tableau -> pauliString
For tableau to PauliString you first verify that the tableau's columns are all of the form X_k = +- X_k and Z_k -> +- Z_k. If not, fail saying it's not a Pauli product tableau. Then use the column signs to determine the Paulis applied to each qubit, e.g. if only X is flipped then it was a Z but if both X and Z were flipped it's a Y.
