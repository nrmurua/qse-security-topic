Hi,
to be able to use XTB from within ORCA, the 5.0.2 manual states on page 483:
Only the file bin/xtb is used by ORCA. The user should copy this file into the directory where the other ORCA executables are located and rename it as otool_xtb.
Please use the 6.4.0 version (or any later version) of xtb; older versions are not fully compatible with ORCA anymore; for example, it may not be possible to invoke the solvation model!
Would it be possible to include this in the qchem.orca package?
Thank you very much
Philipp
