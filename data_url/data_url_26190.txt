In docs/articles.bib and docs/books.bib, use authorYearAbbreviatedTitle or authorYearFirstLetterofTitle for BibTeX key style. Also, change the respective BibTeX keys in docstrings.
If @purva-thakre is okay with this, I think based on the work you've already done, we can close this out. I think the bibkeys you have here are much more descriptive and also align with the style from mitiq (which I like). Plus, the style already seems to be consistent across all of the references. Not sure if the Google Scholar style is any better.
If okay with you, I opt to close, but let me know if you disagree.

@vprusso Fine by me! I thought maybe you found it easier to use the data provided by Google Scholar due to the consistent key style. Arxiv's Export BibTeX Citation keys are all over the place.
I think so long as it's consistent, it's all good for me! I'll go ahead and close this out. Thanks for the input!
