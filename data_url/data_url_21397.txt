When scheduling multiple events to the far future + jumping back, a core.reset() does not seem to clear future FIFO events
In our system, we have a TTLOut, that shall go low ~5 minutes after it has been set to high. If it gets set to high again during that timeout, the 5 minute timer shall begin from the beginning again.
Our implementation looks similar to this:
However running this kernel multiple times ends up in exhausting lanes of the FIFO, even though we expect core.reset() to clear FIFO.
The scheduled events (ttl0.off()) clearly do not get wiped and are even getting executed in the future nonetheless.
When this happens, the dashboard shows
artiq.coredevice.comm_kernel: sequence error(s) reported during kernel execution
and corelog shows
ERROR:firmware.runtime.rtio_mgt:RTIO sequence error involving channel 0x0005:unknown
Here is a minimalistic example experiment, that triggers this issue
core.reset() should wipe all FIFO events
Future events on FIFO are not cleared by core.reset()
Is the issue present on ARTIQ-7?
Future events on FIFO are not cleared by core.reset()
That possibly has been fixed with a533f2a - please check newer firmware version before sending a bug report for beta...

Thank you. Going to test recent firmware later that day and report back. You are absolutely right, I should have tested it with the recent beta build. Stay tuned!
After flashing a recent gateware, compiled against todays commit 115415d, the issue seems to have vanished.
Thank you the feedback. I close this report now.
