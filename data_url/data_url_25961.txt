Right now, we have a function

which we use to reverse the qubit ordering of a Cirq circuit. However, this inherently changes all the qubits to type cirq.LineQubit.
Instead, we would like to split this into two separate functions. The original, which simply converts a cirq  circuit to use line qubits. And a second, new function, which reverses the qubit ordering while preserving the original qubit types.
