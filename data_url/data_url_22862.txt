When I use the [precompiled executable for windows “pyrpl-windows.exe”],I cam connect my pitaya but when I reached the interface for selecting the hostname, I couldn't locate my designated hostname, causing the system to abruptly exit。

Hi @llzy665  , this happened to me, have you found any solution?, also it doesn't recognize my redpitaya and I've made sure (several times) that I'm connected on the same lan, in fact I can go to the default rp-XXXX.local page but for some reason I'm not able to get it recognized by pyrpl
I also met this problem with my new PC. Even when I designed the IP address, it still crashed.  I can run the .exe in my other laptop(13xxx Intel CPU) and my VM.
My new PC uses the 14600K CPU, I am not sure if this is a problem.
