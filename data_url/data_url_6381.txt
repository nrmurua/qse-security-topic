QEngineOCL::TryDecompose() fails to decompose a permutation properly, on my Windows development environment. I do not have more details about why, yet. I hope to support the public method, (even though there are no internal references to it, I think,) so I will diagnose and fix this before the next release.
Testing across a breadth of platforms, even the QEngineCPU variants of TryDecompose() now sometimes fail, on certain platforms. Hence, this is likely an intrinsic problem with the logic of TryDecompose(), (which was honestly always a non-physical "hack," though it served us for quite some time). The point is, the problem is not OpenCL concurrency, so it's likely in the conceptual approach of TryDecompose() itself. I'm backing out this method, for now, as well as the logic duplicated in TrySeparate(), though TrySeparate() has been temporarily refactored under its original signature.
