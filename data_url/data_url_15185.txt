The calibration builders allow users to obtain scaled Rzx pulses from CNOT gates built from echoed-cross-resonance (ECR) gates. Pulse scaling can also be done directly from ECR gates, i.e. a positive CR tone, an X gate, and then a negative CR tone. This functionality needs to be added to the rzx_builder.py file in the transpiler.
