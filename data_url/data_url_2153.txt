I'm on cirq 0.6.0.dev0 and numpy 1.16.2.
The same test failed on the Travis Windows build for an unrelated PR:
https://travis-ci.com/quantumlib/Cirq/jobs/263688729
I've discovered that the numpy version (which was installed using the Debian package manager) doesn't pass the numpy test suite numpy.test('full'), with some tests related to linear algebra failing. That seems likely to be the culprit here. But that doesn't explain why the test failed on the Windows build.
The output from the failing Windows build is
Closing this as we now mark this as failing on windows.  This looks to be downstream problem with installing numpy as per kevin's comment.
FWIW, this test is now also failing on Ubuntu https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/3063/checks?check_run_id=792203725
Opened #3103
