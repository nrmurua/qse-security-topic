I noticed libtweedledum.so isn't present in the rpm:
However, it is present in the barebones tarball. Despite this, an identical error appears anyway; setting export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/rigetti/forest-sdk_2.12.1-linux-barebones "fixed" it.
Thanks for reporting this @refi64. Just a heads-up: I've moved this issue from the qvm repository -> quilc, since this is a quilc packaging bug.
It looks like libtweedledum.so is missing from the rpm spec file, and hence is not included in the rpm build.
@refi64 what os distro and version are you running? I'd like to make sure I test the fix against the same version you are running, if possible.
Fixed #475. Find the new packages at https://qcs.rigetti.com/sdk-downloads.
