Known bug from my PR #2650
When passing a circuit through the basic scheduler (qiskit.scheduler.schedule), the resulting Schedule will always measure qubit results into the MemorySlot which matches the qubit index.
For example:
will measure qubit 0 into MemorySlot(0) rather than MemorySlot(3) -- it will use the default Acquire from the cmd_def which is probably something like Acquire([0, 1], [MemSlot(0), MemSlot(1)]). The correct behaviour is to use the classical reg from the instruction and then modify the AcquireInstruction from the Schedule returned by the cmd_def. It's unclear what we should do with the other qubits that are measured within the same meas_map group, if the user doesn't specify those other qubits to be measured.
We need a follow up PR to handle this more carefully. The solution likely needs to update the helper function: qiskit.scheduler.methods.basic.translate_gates_to_pulse_defs.get_measure_schedule
see above
Another thing: The measure schedule returned by the backend will have pulses on all MeasureChannels for qubits being measured. The user circuit may only be measuring a subset of those qubits. We would like to remove any pulses from MeasureChannels which are being played on qubits that the user did not want to schedule.
Summary:
Given a default measure Schedule (from backend.defaults().build_cmd_def().get('measure', <qubits>), make the following modifications before adding to the final Schedule:
