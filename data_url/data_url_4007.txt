Some applications require a kernel to be controlled by some qubits. OpenQL should be able to generate controlled version of kernels.
3165d0d provides initial support of controlled kernel generation. test_controlled_kernel tests and shows usage.
@lriesebos give it a try.
Toffoli gates can now be decomposed. This can be done by setting the decompose_toffoli to yes as:
Did not tested the controlled kernel due to custom gates (we had an off-line discussion about that).
Did tried the Toffoli decomposition now, and your decomposition differs from the one found in Nielsen & Chuang (page 182). We could add this as an other decomposition.
Nielsen & Chaung version of toffoli decomposition is also now available which can be enabled by setting the following option ql.set_option('decompose_toffoli', 'NC').
