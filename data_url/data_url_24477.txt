Recent PR: microsoft/Qcodes#1633 changes the version name to something like 0.4.0+30.g160bfbc45. This is not working with the QTT setup.py installer because the StrictVersion function cannot handle these type of versions.
How to resolve?
@peendebak
We could change it to LooseVersion in distutils.version?
Fixed by #597  (suggested on qcodes slack)
Fixed by #606.
