It has been brought up if the current inference models in the model Factories can be informed of bounded results, e.g., an expectation value bounded between [X_min,X_max]. Since this feature is orthogonal to fitting model, I wonder if it would possible to add a bounded method for all relevant factories, or if the simple fitting we use for inference cannot be informed of this.
It's very easy to include bounds as arguments to extrapolate functions and clip the result. What do you think @andreamari?
I think there are different ways of adding information about bounds:
Personally, I would vote for option (3) and (4). The reason is that, instead of increasing too much the customization of Mitiq factories, at some point it becomes more practical to directly let the user define custom fit model and pass this object to a generic  factory. Option (2) is not so bad.  I would avoid option (1).
Cursory response: Agree on essentially all points. I agree (2) is easiest implementation-wise, but I also agree full generality is best. I'll have a look into links in (3) and (4) and respond more deeply. One other thing to take into consideration with this discussion is incorporating test data.
Closing this as option 4 (Bayesian fit) was implemented in #471.
