Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
The density matrix simulator does not inherit from cirq.sim.simulator.SimulatesExpectationValues.
Describe the solution you'd like
I would like to be able to use this interface with the density matrix simulator:
The reason we want to use this interface is to support expectation value simulations for noisy circuits that do not support materializing the density matrix explicitly.
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
[optional] Additional context (e.g. screenshots)
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
I fully support adding this feature. In the meantime, let me recommend using qsimcirq - it supports noisy circuit simulation and the simulate_expectation_values interface, and is considerably faster and more memory-efficient than the built-in density matrix simulator. Note however that its results are stochastic, meaning that you'll need to run multiple repetitions to get accurate expectation values.
