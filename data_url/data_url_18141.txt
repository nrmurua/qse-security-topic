As _openquantumcompiler.dag2json has been reintroduced  by commit 77ffd96 it is not compatible with JSONBackend as it expects to get as argument a list of basis gates, not a comma separated string.
A possible solution is to substitute
https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py/blob/07b2485cb0c05d3649de83ece9be1c50c3aff979/qiskit/_openquantumcompiler.py#L36
by
    return DagUnroller(dag_circuit, JsonBackend(basis_gates.split(",")).execute()
Thanks for the catch @r3versi!
For reference, the fix was included in 0.4.15 as well.
