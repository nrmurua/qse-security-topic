The QIR functions for adjoint of T and S (named <prefix>__tdg and <prefix>__sdg) are not correct for QIR base profile. In the base profile those names are spelled <prefix>__t__adj and <prefix>__s__adj, resp.
Lowering to base profile needs to be updated.
May also need to look at @__quantum__rt__array_slice and @__quantum__qis__x__ctl when converting to base profile.
Marking as fixed. Thanks, Alex.
