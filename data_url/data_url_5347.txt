For some reason wheels are not uploaded to PyPi due to an error, see the error (and log) here: https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/runs/2477011891?check_suite_focus=true#step:4:46
Hi @antalszava. I'm wondering if there is still an error with deploying the wheels... Should this issue be closed?
Hey @maliasadi
We have infra in place for this to upload to test PyPI, but not the real PyPI. I think we can move that functionality over after the current release cycle, as we need things to be a little manual for the current cycle.
