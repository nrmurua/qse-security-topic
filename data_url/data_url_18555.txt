Hey folks, a question from a quilc user - what is port 6000 used for/why is it exposed? It's referenced in the Readme but nowhere else I can find.
09/16/2021
quilc’s server mode existed before rpcq came around, and communication was originally done via json over http. there was a transition period where launching it in server mode would take input on both ports, then a period where the http functionality was present but disabled by default, and now it seems to just be gone entirely — but no one updated the README or Dockerfile to remove the mention of port 6000 (edited)
