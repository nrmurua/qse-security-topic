Dear CP2K developers,
I wonder is that possible to add the Methfessel-Paxton smearing to CP2K as an alternative for the Fermi-Dirac method?
As best as I know, in the Methfessel-Paxton method, the integration (electron free energy) is less sensitive to the electron temperature. This is very important in metallic system. However, in the Fermi-Dirac method, the electron entropy is enormous when using FERMI_DIRAC method with a few hundred Kelvins for electron temperature.
Best Wishes,
Geng
