I found an instance where putting two kets in fidelity function gives nonphysical result while inputting corresponding density matrices gives the right result:

Currently, I have no idea what's going wrong, but my observation is that this starts to happen when Hilbert space is getting large (for this simulation, I use ket vector in a Hilbert space of 12 two-level systems). I can send you the data with e-mail.
Could you send me the code?
I also experienced problems with fidelity. Consider the following MWE:
The problem is clearly in the fact that you compute the fidelity of ket states by converting them into density matrices and using the general formula:

This is fine in general, but can be very inefficient for large states, and is less numerically stable.
An easy solution is to just compute the fidelity as the inner product when both states are kets.
Moreover, the general formula might also be improvable: consider the following example (which uses the variables defined in the previous snippet):
Here, I'm proceeding similarly to what qutip currently does, by converting to dms and then applying the general formula. However, I compute the general fidelity by summing the singular values of $\sqrt\rho \sqrt\sigma$, instead of summing the square roots of the eigenvalues of $\sqrt\sigma \rho \sqrt\sigma$. Mathematically, this is equivalent, and in this particular case does at least give a physical fidelity. It does however require to compute the square root of both matrices (though it saved one matrix product), so I honestly don't know whether it would work better/be more efficient in general.
Ya Qutip needs to fix the issue, the formula suggested by @lucainnocenti is better.
