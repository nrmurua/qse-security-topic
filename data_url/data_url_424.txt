Here is a test case input.zip
./staq   -S   -m   -O1   -d fullycon   -M swap   -l eager   -f qasm   input.qasm
Something like this will appear in the output:
CX q[0],q[0];
The OpenQASM spec is let loose on that syntax, but I think that should be deemed an outright syntax error.
Fixed. The issue was with "self-edges" from a qubit to itself in the fully connected map. Thanks for letting us know!
