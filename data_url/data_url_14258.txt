Often I want to provide a link to an API ref in a question. Even if I know what module its in the seeming lack of any apparent organization on the main page here https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/terra.html means I end up scanning the list up and down trying to find it. At least I know by now the opflow and algorithms are at the end! - earlier I was trying to locate primitives... Even sort alphabetically would help if I know the module, for new users maybe a better organization could be things sorted categorically and perhaps alphabetically under that?
