The CRAY_XC50-gfortran_gpu.psmp test log on the CP2K dashboard reports contradicting cudatoolkit/ NVCC versions.
In the section ARCHITECTURE FILE, CUDA 8:
In the section toolversions, CUDA 9:
Thanks for reporting it. It is clearly an outdated comment, the code is using CUDA 9.
I have fixed it (it will be updated in the next run).
The lines reported unter ARCHITECTURE FILE are from the arch file used and are comments  (compare the distributed arch files in arch/) which are ignored afaik. The modules are usually loaded by  a wrapper or batch script which runs the regtest.
Thank you!
