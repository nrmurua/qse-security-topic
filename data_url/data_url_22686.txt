With #112 resolved I'm trying to flash the LED on the Penning lab's KC705. Using flterm and test mode I can toggle the led. However, several other things are broken.
I can compile and load the following idle experiment. But only see LED flashing for the first 2 seconds after core device has booted runtime.
Using the following ddb.pyon and program file.
ddb.pyon
OK. Both errors are resolved by changing LED to channel 18. This is required due to a change 9 days ago in soc/targets/artiq_kc705.py
