This is using a staging IQX backend which is only available to me.
If the backend is not reporting some information then maybe a more helpful error?

Closing as this looks like expected behavior in the current model (currently, plot_gate_map and friends require qubit locations to be available in Qiskit for a given backend family). #10080 proposes moving this description to be provided by the backend.
That's not actually 100% true plot_gate_map will fall back to an algorithmic layout based on rustworkx.spring_layout if there is no hard coded layout available. This is being changed in #10208 to use graphviz instead for better layouts at larger scale. I actually want to move to remove the hard-coded layouts following #10208 and then if/when #10080 is implemented the backend can specify an alternative default layout.
