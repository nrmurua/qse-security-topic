MPS ApplyGate* methods are reasonably fast. However different approaches / optimizations done around micro-benchmarking have not been carried out in great length. This would be a great beginner project to setup something like google-benchmark around the ApplyGate*** methods for the MPS simulator and then tweak the code for best possible performance.
