Currently, sequence drawing always has a curve for amplitude and another for detuning, in spite of the fact that detuning is sometimes not used and thus could be omitted.
On the other hand, jumps in phase could be something that would be useful to track, especially considering that it is also affected by channel modulation.
The idea here is to enable the drawing function to assess which quantities and adapt accordingly. It will require a bit of refactoring because the drawing function is currently built around the fact that the number of subplots per channel is fixed, which will no longer be the case.
