average over sine slightly non-zero.. Reason: very likely timing problem in red_pitaya_iq_fgen.v:
the inversion signals don't arrive at the right moment..
The sine is perfect. The problem comes from the multiplier stage, which performs rounding in a biased way due to complement-2 representation: negative numbers are rounded towards minus infinity, positive ones also towards minus infinity.
Thus we (in)correctly find that after multiplication, the output sine averages to -0.5 counts.
Solution:
OK great! I was expecting the reason was something like that... How heavy would be a determinisc rounding?
3 possibilities:
I propose to go for option 3 once I have some time (1-2 months from now). If there is a pressing reason, we could implement option 1 rapidly.
resolved in develop. Very simple rounding implemented (still asymmetric for 0.5 but this value occurs maybe once in 2**10). Almost no extra resources needed for this. Should there still be a limitation from the carrier peak in the future, we can improve the rounding further, but this fix allows to refine the spectrum analyzer a lot further.
