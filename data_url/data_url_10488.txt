Description
Most TSP problems I try fail to produce a minimal route. The parameters and working range of solvable problems should be outlined.
To Reproduce
The following alternative weights to the 5-node problem, EdgeView([(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]), all fail:
Expected behavior
More info on range of problem inputs, how to set lagrange, etc

Additional context
@vgoliber
Choosing a value for a Lagrange parameter is a topic that is relevant for all of our algorithm tools (not just TSP).  I think it would be more appropriate to provide higher level guidance and/or references on this subject as a whole rather than guidance specific to each algorithm.
Agree, @vgoliber, you mentioned having references and some guidance. Please add that here for that general update. Thanks!
