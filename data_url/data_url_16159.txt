Although a custom gradient function can be passed to an AQGD optimizer, this custom gradient function is ignored. The optimizer always uses a hard-coded parameter shift implementation which is only compatible with Pauli-Rotations and does neither include the product nor the chain rule.
The AQGD optimizer can be updated such that it uses either the gradient framework to evaluate the gradients or a given gradient function.
This should take care of the issue as raised a while back in Aqua /qiskit-community/qiskit-aqua#588 (I'll close that issue there off)
