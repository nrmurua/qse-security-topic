Creating a circuit that results in an RXX gate after being transpiled with a basis set of rx, ry, and rxx and then converting with QASM3 and running on an Aer simulator results in the following error:
Having the basis gate set, the QASM3 conversion, and the aer simulator are all required to reproduce the bug in this manner.
Run the following:
The circuit should  be able to run without error.

Yeah that's because the RXX gate gets reloaded as Gate and not as RXXGate. That may be because RXXGate is not explicitly listed in the Qiskit standard gates in the exporter and the importer. It would be good if we could automatically populate these using the qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates.
You can prevent this by re-transpiling before the execution, but that of course takes additional time. Alternatively, you could use qpy to store the circuit, e.g.
