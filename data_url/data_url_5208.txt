Let broken.quil be
Compiling this with quilc works fine:
Command: cat ~/Scratch/broken.qasm | quilc -P --safe-include-directory "benchmarking/ibm_qx_mapping/examples/"
But running on the QVM errors:
Command: cat ~/Scratch/broken.qasm | quilc -P --safe-include-directory "benchmarking/ibm_qx_mapping/examples/" | qvm
The issue is that the declared memory is named c, so when the DEFCIRCUIT for QASM_cu3 is being parsed, it thinks the argument lists aren't formal parameters (i.e., c) but rather references to memory (i.e., c[0]).
Minimal test case:
File: bork.quil:
Run this with:
cat bork.quil | qvm
To be clear, this is a CL-QUIL bug, but we will track it here.
