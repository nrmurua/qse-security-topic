Is there any guidance how to address a real QPU via the forest cloud framework under rel. 2.0? Checking the documentation here [ http://docs.rigetti.com/en/latest/qvm.html?highlight=QPU ] there is some broken link. The function get_device of the QVM currently returns a null response. Is it already possible to request a trial account to a public accessible QPU and pyquil 2.0?
We need to
