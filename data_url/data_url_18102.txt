Circuit addition involving the inverse of circuit/composite gate does not work.
circuit_drawer(circs["PROTOZOAN"])

circuit_drawer(circs["YEAST"])

circuit_drawer(inverse_circs["YEAST"])

circuit_drawer(circs["PROTOZOAN"] + inverse_circs["YEAST"])

Addition/appending circuits.
Dunno.
@rraymondhp I can't reproduce this issue from circuit pictures. Can you paste the code to generate those circuits? I think they were generated with the initialize command.
@ajavadia  It's a python notebook that I cannot paste here. I will send you the file by a different channel, but here is part of the code. It uses initialize() and initialize().inverse() functions.
@rraymondhp thanks. I found the issue. I will put in a fix.
