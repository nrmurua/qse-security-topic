Hi!
When I follow the getting started documentation at https://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/start.html, I am unable to run the the example program. I keep getting "QUILCError: invalid endpoint". I have started both qym- S and quilc -S on my local machine. I also tried starting with quilc -R on my local (as per a previous discussion thread I found) but then got the following error:
ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='127.0.0.1', port=6000): Max retries exceeded with url: /quilc (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x105add588>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 61] Connection refused',))
Would really appreciate any help!
@mridunanda what versions of QVM and quilc are you running? quilc --version and qvm --version. Also, can you post the full error messages?
I am getting: 1.6.0 [9fa6bbc] (qvm) and 1.6.0 [a01dc15] (quilc).
Also another update is that after reinstalling everything (in the exact same manner on my linux VM), quilc/qvm seem to work (not getting this error). So I'm not sure what's the difference with my local and my VM...
Hm! pyQuil is confused about where your quilc server is.
So, to be clear, going forward you should only start the quilc server with quilc -R (the alternate method quilc -S is deprecated, and will be removed). That will, by default cause the server to listen on the address tcp://*:5555.
You should then also start the QVM with qvm -S, which will accept connections on the address http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Please follow the above instructions, run your program, and report back if you see any errors.
Any update on the status of this issue?
As there is no update, closing this issue as resolved. Feel free to open a new issue if this arises again.
