Randomised testing has detected a reliable reproducer for transpiler failures in the commutative cancellation pass, showing TranspilerError("internal error").  I imagine it's related to the instruction-level condition, but I don't know entirely.
I bisected the failure to #8184.  The line triggering the error is in CommutativeCancellation, though, which wasn't directly touched: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/f37dcf9d9c879867140b3072483a3dbd36cb5c1f/qiskit/transpiler/passes/optimization/commutative_cancellation.py#L132-L143
This gives a transpiler error:
This is a regression - the same reproducer succeeds before #8184, so some logic might have got a little tangled.

Sorry for breaking this, submitted a fix.
No worries, it's not a problem - that's why we have the randomised testing!
