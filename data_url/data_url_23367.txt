When introducing new users to QCoDeS, I usually direct them to the qcodes.github.io documentation. However, I have noticed that people often have quite some remaining questions, and what I usually end up doing is performing a few measurements with them, explaining everything along the way.
I browsed through the documentation, and what I feel is missing most is a clear tutorial that explains exactly what a beginning user needs to know to perform his/her first measurement. There is docs/examples/Tutorial.ipynb, which does this to some extent, but it's located at the end of the documentation, and I believe it can use some improvements.
I was therefore thinking of rewriting the Tutorial. I think the target audience should be people who have freshly installed QCoDeS, and want to connect their instruments and perform their first measurement.  I've listed my ideas for improving the Tutorial below, please comment if you want things added, or disagree with anything:
Additionally, I think a restructuring of the documentation would help. I propose the following changes:
I've also noticed a lot of overlap between the User guide (rst) and the examples (ipynb). I'm not sure what the best approach is here, as the user guide can be quite dry, especially without examples. Any thoughts?
