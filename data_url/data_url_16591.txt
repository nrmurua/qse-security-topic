should use jupyter-execute
I'm a bit on the fence on changing to only use jupyter-execute because this means the circuit will only show up in the online docs and not when browsing the code directly. Should we have an example with both, as a compromise?
The point is that the circuit itself gets a bit of extra validation in doing so, whereas a normal code block can get out of date without notice.  This is over a year old, so I do not think any one really cares too much, so feel free to close.
