A useful feature when designing quantum circuits is the ability to analyze the scaling of different types of gates as the circuit size grows.
A way to access the number of Toffoli gates (three-qubit), CNOT gates (two-qubit) and single qubit gates queued in a given circuit would be a welcome addition to Qibo.
Additionally, maybe latter down the line, an automated way to know the real depth of the circuit would also be useful. By real depth I refer to depth accounting for simultaneous application of gates in the real device. That is, applying Hadamard gates to a quantum register would incur only 1 depth.
I believe this issue was already addressed in #77.
