For NISQ circuits, the reduced precision isn't particularly relevant but the speed gains are.
The simulators currently use np.complex64 but there are other places where the default is still np.complex128.
The places where it needs to be changed are circuit.unitary and circuit.final_state_vector.
As discussed in Cirq-cync, can someone please assign me here as I don't have permissions?
@diabhiue I've assigned you.
@diabhiue Do your new changes actually improve the performance?
@vtomole, I tried running ./check/asv_run for performance tests(post changes). Initially, it asked for system info (for initial set up) which was chosen by default, but it failed while running. Below is the error message. How can I resolve this?



Adding @tanujkhattar as per git blame
I also noticed that there were some test failures before making any changes. Below are those failed tests. Are these expected?



Hey @diabhiue, I'm just seeing your ping. I'm also going to be out of office for the next 2 weeks.
Anyway, it seems like the second error is due to #4660 and the first one is due to cirq's sub-packages are not installed before the benchmarks are executed. Since the benchmarks only need cirq-google, you will need to tell asv where it is. I was able to run the benchmarks after making this change: 024f6fb on my local asv.conf.json.
Thanks!
Doing this for the methods on circuit seems to break a ton of tests (600+) likely because a lot of our default precisions are 1e-7 or 1e-8.
The method final_state_vector will need to be updated to default to np.complex64.
@dabacon Given #5636, did we decide that this is not worth doing due to the frequency of the flakes? If so, then I think the only thing left is to monitor the CI for the next few days to confirm that the roll back fixed everything and then close this.
Yes we decided to keep the different precision on the Circuit class.  Closing.
