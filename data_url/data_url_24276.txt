Mostly here as a reminder issue. Can discuss offline next week.
We keep getting more inquiries, which makes me think we should probably put some notes on the main site and the docs maybe to direct folks for inquiries for collaboration etc.
Agreed.  I added this as an agenda item to the meeting.  It should be a quick discussion.
Branch after-docs-live contains this implementation.
