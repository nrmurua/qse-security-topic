Implement a trusted node QKD network simulation with at least 1 trusted node.
Hi stephan! Do you have any reference articles?
Hello, I think this one should be good:
Title: Quantum Key Distribution: A Networking Perspective

Hi Stephan! Could you please assign this task for me?
I am interested in this issue and would like to give it a try if its still open @stephendiadamo
@Nizdew are you still working on this? Maybe @s-aldaihan can work on it if not, or maybe @s-aldaihan you can try your own version, since there isn't just one implementation.
@stephendiadamo Yes, I am currently submitting it.
@stephendiadamo just created a pull request.
Hi @stephendiadamo ,
Is the the pr closed? If not,I can work on it.
@Nizdew, What type of implementation did you implement, if you have already done, I can try different implementation.
@s-aldaihan and @PriyanshuPansari This challenge is still open. You can make your submissions.
Note that this requires the use of QuNetSim and requires at least 3 nodes. The middle node has to relay the key. A good solution would use a general protocol for any node that isn't the sender or receiver.
