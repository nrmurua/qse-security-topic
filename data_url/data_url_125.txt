I think it'll be good to rename docs/sphinx/examples/cpp/cuquantum_backends.cpp to ghz_state_large.cpp or some other descriptive name.  There is a fair bit of confusion between cQuantum and CUDA Quantum in general population, so in my opinion, it seems best to avoid such names in the examples folder.
