There is a need to be able to reconstruct a QuantumCircuit (or list of QuantumCircuits) from a compiled Qobj. This is to be able to inspect the circuit after it has been compiled. We need a wrapper method for this.
Currently this is doable by this long nested call:
@ajavadia I'm assuming here you mean construct a QuantumCircuit object from a Qobj but not using the qasm embedded in the header right? Since that's not guaranteed to be there.
@mtreinish Yes, you are right. But I wouldn't mind creating this function in the easy way now (using compiled_circuit_qasm), then refining it later to not rely on that. All Qobjs we currently create have this field right?
The function should probably go in the wrapper, similar to load_qasm_string.
