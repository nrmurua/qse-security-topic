I found a bug in latex_circuit_drawer when conditional gate is drawn with reversebits option.
Index of registers is not correctly handled in latex_circuit_drawer when bit order is reversed.
The results:
I've done a lot of digging on this (it took much more than I was expecting) it looks like the fundamental issue here is that the mask generated by the json unroller for conditionals doesn't know things are reversed So the mask it writes assumes the regular order. So when we go to use that mask in the latex drawer (where the traceback here is and around L900) for figuring out the cbits to mark for writing out the latex it gets mixed up and out of order.
As for fixing it I'm thinking we'll either have to transform the bitmask generated by the json unroller to match the reversed bit order in the latex generator after it's called, or add an option to the json unroller to reverse the bitmasks when they're generated.
