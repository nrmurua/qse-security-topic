The current docs organization is not ideal based on user surveys, and the dev team has gotten good feedback on what could help the make the documentation more usable. Additions to the docs are minimal in this issue (wanting to leave additional content to further issues), and we focus here on the general flow and organization of the documentation.
A possible high-level TOC could look something like this:
RFC for this here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13un5TZPknSOhmOBkrL2rsofjGfdp2jDnd-DywLpGFPc/edit?usp=sharing
@rmlarose added some feedback on the RFC
Also added some comments, thanks everyone!
The RFC has been accepted. Any documentation changes in https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/projects/6 should be made according to this design. For example, #758 should appear in Section 4 ("What happens when I use this technique?") of the CDR docs.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
Closed by #1021 #1004 #1031.
