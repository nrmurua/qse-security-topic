For example, running sampling on qbsolv/tests/qubos/bqp100_1.qubo, we get embedded BQM with coupling strengths from [-200, 200] range and biases from [-4, 8]. Both out of allowed range for a particular QPU solver.
The error message on server side is also confusing: it says out-of-range values are discarded and after that they are scaled.
