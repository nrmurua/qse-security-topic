As found by @Zoufalc, if the operator is an expectation value is non-hermitian, evaluating it with PauliExpectation yields different results (namely the conjugated result) than all other expectation converters.
PauliExpectation gives the same result as the others.
I assume that we need to remove an adjoint() call somewhere in PauliExpectation.
