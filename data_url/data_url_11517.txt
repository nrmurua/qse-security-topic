Hi,
I am relatively new to qiskit implementations and have two questions.
First off, I am confused how qiskit implements the VQE minimum eigensolver. In the documentation it appears to be instantiated as an abstract class without the actual implementation to be found.
The second question is how one would be able to adjust the shot count of the expectation calculation. I am trying to run VQE on an IBM device and want to configure the best shot count to minimize error.
Thank you very much for the help!
Hi @jason-jk-kang,
the VQE documentation is actually here: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.aqua.algorithms.VQE.html?highlight=vqe#qiskit.aqua.algorithms.VQE.
You found the MinimumEigensolver documentation, which is not the same as the VQE. Since there are several algorithms that can find the minimum eigenvalue of a system (VQE, QPE, classical solvers like ones from NumPy) we have an abstract base class for all these algorithms. The idea is that you can easily exchange the algorithm implementation for a given problem: for example it is really easy to compare different quantum and classical algorithms!
You can adjust the number of shots in the QuantumInstance. For example, in pseudo-code,
Hi @Cryoris, to reopen what i'm interested in is the compute_minimum_eigenvalue, which in VQE is implemented as
This is why I was looking at the documentation for the classes which VQE inherits from. I see that the implementation is in the self._run function call, but what is the super().compute_minimum_eigenvalue for? Thank you for any guidance!
It set's the properties self.operator and self.aux_operators, as you can see here:

Since all minimum eigensolvers do this, this was bundled in the base class.
As this has been answered I am closing this.
Do note that there is an Qiskit Slack workspace where there channels where questions can be asked etc., and searched for anything related or if its been asked for before etc - the link to join, if you are not part of that workspace a link to join can be found at the bottom of the main qiskit.org page as icons in the STAY CONNECTED section of the footer there.
