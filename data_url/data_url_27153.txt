Dear maintainers,
would it be possible to make ORCA 4.2.1 available again next to the current version 5.0.1? Right now I've an unfinished project that was carried out in ORCA 4.2.1 until now. Given the substantial changes regarding default choices regarding DFT grids and SCF parameters I probably can't/shouldn't mix results of both versions.
It appears that ORCA 4 was available previously. Can it be made available again as something like orca4?
Thanks & with best regards,
Johannes
Dear Johannes,
ORCA 4.2.1 is in fact the default version in the 21.05 stable version of the overlay. I would recommend using the release-21.05 branch of this overlay together with the nixos-21.05 channel for your project.
The general idea is to rather pin a certain version of the overlay/nixpkgs if you want to use the same version of a program for a project. Here is an example of how to make several releases available in parallel: https://github.com/markuskowa/NixOS-QChem/blob/master/examples/pkgs-set.nix
Thanks for the quick answer.
