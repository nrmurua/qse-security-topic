If ct.get_result(dispatch_id, wait=True) takes long enough, eventually a RecursionError will be raised.
Any workflow that takes long enough will trigger this error.
get_result should not be interrupted by the RecursionError
@Prasy12 can you add this one as well?
(Low P)
It's curious why the retry logic for get_result() involves any recursion.

@cjao I think it's urllib3 that has recursive logic inside (the .urlopen() method returns a call to itself)
