Problem:
When running on hardware Cirq supports two uses of classical data.  The first is in the supplying of classical information to a circuit as a parameter.  The second is as the measurement outcomes recorded in the measurement dictionary.   This is not sufficient for future needs (see Feedforward #3232 and Flow Control #3234).  Further the output of running a Cirq circuit, measurement dictionaries, is overly restrictive and more general measurement results (IQ points, for example) should be supported.  Cirq also lacks the ability to specify classical data which can be loaded by a user, used during running of a circuit, and read out at the end of the circuit.  This feature is to add the ability to support classical data.
Rough requirements:
Should this be added to the 2021 roadmap given that it's the precondition for the above 3 linked issues?
After further consideration, I don't think these concerns are relevant to Cirq outside of the built-in simulators:
Cirq constructs only really matter during translation from and to the Cirq format; any handling of measurement results during circuit execution is the sole responsibility of the device / simulator.
@95-martin-orion is this before or after 1.0?
This is functionally complete as of #4781.
