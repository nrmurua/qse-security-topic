When running a transpile() using the translation_method='synthesis' kwarg the output circuit contains gates outside the basis set. In my specific example it's swap gates instead of cx gates.
which outputs:
(the exact numbers will differ a bit each run, but the swap gates should not be in the output)
The output circuit contains only gates in the basis set, in the case of that example script it is:
['id', 'u1', 'u2', 'u3', 'cx']
Find the source of the missing translation and fix it.
Is this the same issue as #5203 (comment) ?
I think it probably is (I had forgotten about that issue), I'll run a ten test to confirm though
I'd want to suggest changing the reproducible example to:
More contained in size and so, easier to debug.
Closing as this is a duplicate of #5203
