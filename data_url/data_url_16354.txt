I am doing a problem where parameters would be assigned very frequently, and the performance is not quite satisfactory. After profiling I found that subs (from sympy) counts for 1.84s out of 2.09s in QuantumCircuit._bind_parameter during my profiled session. It even takes more time than the simulation itself (0.13s), which is not acceptable.
In most cases (where the expression is a single variable), there could be some shortcuts that moves away from the costly symbolic operations.
Probably fixed via #6270 . Please reopen if the problem is still there.
