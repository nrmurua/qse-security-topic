Periodically we're seeing the TestRandomClifford tests fail in CI. For example:
https://dev.azure.com/qiskit-ci/qiskit-terra/_build/results?buildId=11465&view=logs&j=fad9ef03-8420-5838-ffca-3d1ed444ccc0&t=d9e59364-d4fc-590a-5492-b5319aadd598&l=4274
I think this is due np.linalg.inv sometimes failing because of limited compute power on CI instance. You could fix by removing the larger qubit tests for random Clifford in the @combine(num_qubits=[]) list.
Im also getting some fails regularly in my local computer. I will try to capture when that happens.
Confirmed that is not related to the CI limited power.
Since test.python.quantum_info.operators.test_random.TestRandomClifford.test_valid is not deterministic, I will move this test out to the random suite. In the meanwhile, maybe I can find a problematic seed.
Found a failing seed! Moving this issue to #4194
