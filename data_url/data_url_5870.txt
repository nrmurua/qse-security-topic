The snapshot and save statevector functionality of the extended stabilizer simulator returns an unnormalized statevector.
The returned norm is not 1
Even though this is an approximate method and involves norm sampling, it should still return a normalized state.
I don't really understand the norm sampling function used to compute the statevector for the simulator, but maybe there is something that can be done to fix this there (Any ideas @gadial?)
@chriseclectic When running the above snippet, it looks like there is no function AerSimulator(). Could you clarify?
Given that we're already computing the overlaps with all 2^n computational basis states when computing the 'statevector' output I can't see any reason to not use this information to compute the norm of the state and then normalize it.
This would require a trivial change to the Runner::statevector method in ch_runner.hpp. I don't think this method is used anywhere else in the code so it shouldn't be a problem. Currently this method takes a parameter AER::RngEngine &rng which would not be needed if we remove the norm estimation so we can also get rid of that. I expect changing the parameters to remove this will require some changes elsewhere as well.
