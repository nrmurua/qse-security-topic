I'm looking at lines 345-347 (function _stim_append_random_gate_channel) of _cirq_to_stim.py. If the cirq.DensePauliString gate has a trivial index (i.e. identity) for one of the qubits, we get an error TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
I suggest changing line 346 to
pauli_targets = [target_p[p](t) for t, p in zip(t, g.sub_gate.pauli_mask) if p]
@dkafri could you give a cirq circuit that actually fails to convert so I have something to test against?
