Gate Decomposition relationships are confusing (#930) and needs to be organized (#3242). The following diagram, generated via Visualizing Gate Relationships Colab, describes (best-effort) the current decompose relationships between gates.

One of the primary use cases of cirq.decompose protocol is to define composite gates like QuantumFourierTransformGate, SwapNetworkGate etc.  Such composite gates / operations fit better under the category of useful CircuitOperations rather than fundamental basic gates.
This issue is to discuss whether we can replace these gates with CircuitOperations and how should this be done?

I wholeheartedly support this change. CircuitOperation provides a reliable structure for defining composite gates, and once #4336 is submitted it will have a much lower serialization overhead than existing composite gates. In addition, redefining these operations as CircuitOperations may allow us to refine the list of Operation subtypes, which would help with issues like #2536 (CircuitOperations become easier to identify if anything that isn't a GateOperation is a CircuitOperation).
IMO, the correct way to implement this is to convert existing composite gates to implementations of CircuitOperation: for example, a SwapNetworkGate might take a swap-ordering for a set of qubits in its constructor to generate a frozen circuit that performs that swap, then pass that circuit to the CircuitOperation super constructor.
#4309 would be affected too. I have no strong opinion on the proposal but will follow whatever is decided. Just adding the note for context.
Discussion on Cirq Sync:
Playing devil's advocate here, but for common patterns like QFT, it may be that some devices have specific implementations of those things optimized for those devices. If we convert them to generic subcircuits, then we lose the ability to allow these optimizations. We can hack them back in with tags or something, but that seems like a design flaw.
As discussed in
https://tinyurl.com/cirq-organize-decompose-rfc#heading=h.jaeoqsjs6i9x, CircuitOperations should not be used to replace composite gates.
The drawbacks of each of the two possible ways for using circuit operations to replace composite gates are as follows:
Bad because itâ€™s hard to determine whether a given circuit operation represents a QFT / Boolean hamiltonian gate etc.
Comes with too much unnecessary baggage from circuit operation (eg: replace, repeat etc.)
cc @95-martin-orion I'm closing this now.
