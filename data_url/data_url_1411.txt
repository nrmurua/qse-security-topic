Description of the issue
See: #4936 (comment)
Cirq version
master version
Looks like sympy v1.10 (released Mar 6) is triggering this failure. #5059 pins us to the old version, but we should look into updating the sympy type hints to allow us to advance.
Okay. To avoid us creating another issue related to this, we can leave this open until the sympy type hints have been updated.
what do we need to do to fix this?
We will update our Sympy version to 1.10 and fix the Mypy errors it throws. There are plenty of them .
Is there a way to configure mypy to ignore these errors and fix them gradually. Like how we do for numpy types and the mypy-next.ini test.
We really don't want to be stuck on an old version of sympy indefinitely (which can actual implications for users!) to satisfy a CI check no one has any intention of urgently fixing, since it doesn't affect users
Like how we do for numpy types and the mypy-next.ini test.
Ah, yes. That sounds good to close this.
Oh, hmmm.... I was working on fixing all these type errors actually rather than ignoring them.  Haha.
you can open an after-1.0 issue to track that for sure
