Trying to dumps the QASM3 version of this circuit

try dumping the above circuit
It should work

Thanks for finding this - I'm keen to get a load of these bad assumptions squashed.  The immediate fix we can apply is to verify that all parameters we attempt to emit are angle-like (which we can do with a type check), and if they're not, to not include them as run-time OpenQASM gate parameters.
Our (approximate) intent in the future is to move the OpenQASM (2 and 3) export story to be along the lines of specify the target output gates (via some sort of mechanism using transpile that isn't quite decided yet), and then export to OpenQASM.  The reason being that the OpenQASM exporters don't generally have enough context to know how you really want most things handled, while we already have transpile that's fully designed to convert circuits into different forms.  Their current form involves some convoluted code in places to try and get around these restrictions, which is difficult to maintain, and leads to a somewhat confusing user experience.
The blockers for that are currently:
