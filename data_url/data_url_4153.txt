Selecting the basis of a measurement plays a key role in measurement based quantum computation, which is an important branch of quantum computation (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0301052) . Maybe recently I will have chance to learn and implement this feature. Following are two of my concerns,
I want to know your opinions on putting this feature into ProjectQ. @damiansteiger @thomashaener
I think it should be straight-forward to implement, e.g., MeasureX as an additional gate and register a default decomposition rule which does the basis change.
I don't see much benefit in adding this now since it would always be decomposed anyway but if it makes things easier for you / others, I'd be happy to accept a PR adding this.
