Part of the #2678 Epic. Repeated below:
Change: The name of CmdDef class
Proposal: QasmToSchedDef
Rationale: The class currently describes all QuantumCircuit Instruction implementations for certain qubits for a given backend as Schedules. A Schedule does contain Instructions which contain Commands, but Commands are not fundamentally what we are gaining from this class, since Schedules each contain multiple Commands, are particular for Channels, and have specific timing. The new name avoids conflating Schedules and Commands.
CmdDef is currently the name due to the fixed interface at the transport layer. With Issue #2680, we can decouple this constraint.
CmdDef will be replaced by backend defaults instead
