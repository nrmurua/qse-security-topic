Compute the "completely bounded trace norm" (CBnorm) of a quantum channel.
The definition of the CBnorm can be found in Section 3.3.2 of John Watrous's textbook.
A reference implementation in QETLAB can be found here.
The functionality for this should be created in channel_metrics/completely_bounded_trace_norm.py with corresponding unit tests found in tests/test_channel_metrics/test_completely_bounded_trace_norm.py. Be sure to also update the docs in /docs/channels.rst under "Metrics of Quantum Channels".
