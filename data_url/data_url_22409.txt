I tried setting one of my ttl channels, ttl1, to be an input. If I try to pulse or turn it on in an experiment, I don't get a signal but the experiment still runs. It could be useful to get a warning if you're trying to turn on a ttl input.
What should the electrical state be after calling output() on a TTL line? 1 or 0?
