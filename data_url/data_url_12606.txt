My local format check does not catch any problems, though the CI fails #72 .  It seems the "Install Format tools" section of the lint-and-format job installs clang-format-3.8, which is not available through standard apt-get.  Is there a way to keep required dev tool versions and CI versions in sync?
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
This has gone stale. We currently use clang-format6 which should let people standardize to that. Closing for now can re-open if things come up.
