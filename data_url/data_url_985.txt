Description of the issue
I've seen a few pytest failures on windows in cirq-google serialization tests:
I've seen this happen both in 3.7 tests and in 3.9 tests. Seems to be intermittent.
I've also seen this error, but at the time chalked it up to Github Actions runner instability. Seeing that it's still coming up - and that it's in the infinite recursion test - suggests I should revisit my code here.
It does say right in the test it's doing something sketchy :-)
#4315 for context on what this test is about. The deserialization half of this test is fine - it will try to locate the recursively-defined operation in the constants map, fail, and error out.
The serialization half intentionally forces a RecursionError, but it's the safer variety: Python notices that the a method was called with the exact same arguments and system state and it fails after a single recursive call. It doesn't seem like this could cause a crash unless the Windows runners (a) disabled this recursion safeguard in their Python config, and (b) encountered a hardware issue (OOM, maybe worse?) before the "too many recursive calls" error triggered.
Given all of that, I feel pretty safe labeling this particular bit of malicious code as de-fanged üòù Good to keep an eye on this, but at the moment it seems like only a minor nuisance.
