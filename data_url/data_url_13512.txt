There is an assert statement to check that the operation is a cirq.GateOperation, which a cirq.ControlledOperation is not. I don't think the function should fail because there may be operations which are not gate operations. The better behavior is to only try to simplify GateOperations, i.e., skip ControlledOperations and other not gate operations.
Example:
raises
