The keyscan test (invoked when running make tests) fails for the OQS algs.
@dstebila, @xvzcf, can you repro this?
I created PR #48 to run make tests in CI, and it is also failing the keyscan test.
Perhaps we should move the make tests instruction after the make install in the script.
I've deleted my earlier comments as I was wrong about the cause of the failures. It is not a path issue as I thought earlier, and I will provide further updates as I make progress.
Check this after #53
Superseded by #89
