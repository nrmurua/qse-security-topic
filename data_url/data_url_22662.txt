I've been rebuilding all of ARTIQ's dependencies on our new, (more) automated build infrastructure, based on Appveyor and Travis CI servers.
As a part of this, I've changed the way channels are used: packages deemed 'stable' are put in the main branch, and only the automatically built migen and artiq packages are put in the dev branch. So please add the main channel as well.
Instructions somewhere probably need to be updated; I will look into it.

OK. I can install using the main branch. But main is built for an ARTIQ
revision that predates several of the recent API changes. For example, the
main build still wants ddb.pyon.
And it looks like there are two copies of artiq in the main build: 1599 and
np_1420.

I mean you need both:

This is the same general idea as Ubuntu main repository (stable stuff) and ppa's (automatic builds, possibly unstable).
