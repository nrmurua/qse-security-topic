The type-serialization behavior added in #4693 made an implicit assumption that Cirq objects use object.__class__.__name__ for the "cirq_type" field of their JSON representation, optionally prepended with a namespace. This is consistent with existing Cirq types, but until that PR it was merely a convention; now that code depends on it, we ought to enforce it.
More specifically, this issue recommends moving assignment of the cirq_type JSON field from the _json_dict_ magic method of serializable classes into the cirq.to_json protocol. As discussed in the linked issue, this will provide consistent behavior and reduce code redundancy.

A change that could get us most of the way there is modifying the behavior of obj_to_dict_helper
