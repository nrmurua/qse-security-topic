When building on a mac, I receive the following warnings:
Could you try adding a #pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wpessimizing-move" line to the top of the pauli_string.test.cc file and check if it still gives warnings?
@newmanmg ^
Pulling the latest version, this no longer appears to be an issue.
