Since a while, GCC 6.5 dashboard test is failing with the tensors based test.

I know that @pseewald knows already about the problem. Putting here to keep track of the issue.
It seems a compile bug dealing new Fortran features...
I wanted to bring this issue back up because it keeps failing our gcc 6 test.
AFAIK, this is actually a bug in GCC. So, do we know of any acceptable workaround or should we just drop support for GCC 6?
Would that also include GCC 5?
Btw, for everything below gcc 10 there's a memleak in tensors.

No, GCC 5 seems to work fine.

While memleaks are not great, one can usually live with them.
This issue crashes most of the MP2, GW, and HFX-RI tests, which is a sizable chuck of our functionality.
