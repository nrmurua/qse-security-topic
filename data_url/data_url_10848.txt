Description
Running python -c unittest, it seems there is an issue with attribute assignment of limit_denominator().
This method is part of the fractions module:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/fractions.html#module-fractions
Questions:
Is limit_denominator() required?
Is this a namespace issue?
I'm investigating and will add more details over the weekend.
