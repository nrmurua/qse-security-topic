When drawing a circuit containing a gate such as qcircuit.u3(theta, eta-pi/2, pi/2, q[0]), the second variable is displayed as in latex $\eta-1.5707$ instead of $\eta-\pi/2$.
Plot a circuit containing qcircuit.u3(theta, eta-pi/2, pi/2, q[0]).
The second variable should be displayed as in latex $\eta-\pi/2$.
It seems like a #3666 needs to get deeper. What to have a look @sumitpuri?
Sure @1ucian0 I see it has become #4013 now. Let me try it out.
@pedrorrivero Can you paste the code and your result.
Excuse my late response @sumitpuri, I missed the notification.

This is the same as #4170.
Fixed via #4807
