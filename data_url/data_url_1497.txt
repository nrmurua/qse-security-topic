Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
The default _FilesystemSaver uses sensible hardcoded path prefixes for storing the runtime config / shared runtime config / executables etc.

The sensible defaults take the responsibility of providing explicit names to each file away from the user and are a very useful component. However, there's no easy way to load the results stored by the default file saver.
Describe the solution you'd like
Ideally, it should be possible to identify the results of the default file saver by only providing a run_id and base_data_dir but currently, one needs to provide explicit values for all three -- runtime_configuration_path, shared_runtime_info_path,  executable_result_paths.
The request is to provide an easy way to load the results stored by the default saver by providing only run_id and base_data_dir
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
