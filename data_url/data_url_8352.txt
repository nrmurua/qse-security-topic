Originally reported in #944. Tests seem to be failing for MacOS. We get errors like
The build is pretty much always failing, but sometimes passes.
I think we only get the errors when tests are run, the functions work fine otherwise. I think someone tried pytest and still got same errors. So kind of a nasty one to investigate, but there might be an easy fix if we can work out what to do.
I believe @nathanshammah has done some quite thorough investigation and could probably add to this.
I report local tests failing on my MacOS 10.13.6 by running qutip.testing.run().
Tests fail for python 3.7 and 3.6 environments, if QuTiP 4.4. is installed in develop mode (openmp = True).
Tests fail also for QuTiP 4.3.1 installed with conda.
Broken test for python 3.6 with: (1) QuTiP 4.4-dev,  with openmp =True and (2) conda install qutip, QuTiP 4.3.1:

I think I pinned down the issue for local tests on Mac 10.13.6 (High Sierra) with Python 3.7 with the current qutip 4.4 dev version to the line
in test_metrics.py.
Even just running average_gate_fidelity(rand_super()) in a Jupyter Notebook can kill the kernel.
It seems that average_gate_fidelity(super_matrix) does not like odd dimensions in super_matrix.
So, now tests fail for Qobj subtraction, when running nose.run(defaultTest="qutip.tests", argv=['nosetests', '-v']) but they run just fine when running nose.run(defaultTest="qutip.tests.test_qobj", argv=['nosetests', '-v']).
Note that before, for the metrics, the error was occuring even if only  nose.run(defaultTest="qutip.tests.test_metrics", argv=['nosetests', '-v']) was run.
It might be something ill allocated due to the order of how tests are run.
I also wonder if there is an issue with pycache. Also, in my folder there are both py36.pyc and py37.pyc files. Here there is a discussion that might be related (?)
pytest-dev/pytest#200 (comment)
Deleting the pycache and running nosetests gives the following warning messages

Running nosetests in a conda environment in Python 3.6 on a Mac High Sierra 10.13.6 gives
and kils the tests.
If I understand correctly it refers to line 300 in test_metrics, which has a new hellinger metric test by @wrzadkow . Could it be that using  "for _ in range(10):" is a problem?

The following observations:
make me think that the issue may be caused by \otimes that I used in the docstring explanations. Don't have a Mac to reproduce and check whether removing this will help, though.
My guess is that something will need to be changed in metrics.average_gate_fidelity to resolve this issue
While the tests now pass for Mac on Travis CI, this is the error messages I get locally on Mac,
this on the 4.4.0 release version.
On the dev version,
and with nosetests
This somehow got fixed before 4.4.0.
