The command k.gate(*args) now always expects target qubit to be a list (of integers). I understand that this was done to keep the input arguments consistent independent of what gate is being performed.
This is however, inconsistent with the individual operations k.measure(q0) and specific gates k.hadamard(q0).
I think it should be cleaner to always have the same call signature independent on what kind of gate is being called. It is then a different question how a simultaneous operation on multiple single qubits should be specified to avoid confusing use of arguments.
