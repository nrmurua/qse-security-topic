I can fix but I don't know what this link is expected to do because I am not the owner of this tutorial I thinking contacting the actual owner of this tutorial and asking him/her to fix this can fix this problem .
Thank You
@SooluThomas @nonhermitian  Can you guys do that ?  If you can give me a right link I can also fix this .
