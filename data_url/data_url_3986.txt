This is particularly useful if one wants to assert what version is being used.
This is now possible with get_version() API
@imranashraf , what does it is now possible mean? Is this in a recent release version? If so, this is not working as intended as it returns the python version installed on the system.
Tested and working in version 0.5.1!
