Initializing Sampler() from qiskit_aer.primitives returns: BaseSampler.init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'circuits'
from qiskit_aer.primitives import Sampler as Sampler
sampler = Sampler(backend_options={"method": "statevector"},
run_options={"shots": 100, "seed": 42})
Should work according to https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/stubs/qiskit_aer.primitives.Sampler.html

Update to the latest Aer - you most likely have an older version installed - pip install -U qiskit-aer
Upgrading to Aer does not solve the problem for me ...
I have all the qiskit modules updated to the latest.
When I make an instance of the Sampler, I always get the error about bad keyword 'circuits'
I have isolated it to these lines in sampler.py:
If I simply comment out the circuits and parameters arguments to init, everything works fine
It appears that it is calling the init method of the BaseSampler class in the qiskit.primitives package parallel to qiskit_ibm_runtime  instead of calling the one in the qiskit/primitives folder that is parallel to the sampler.py file itself.
The one in the higher level qiskit does not accept these arguments, while the one that is in the qiskit subfolder does.
Perhaps the import needs to be changed.
Note: this is a SERIOUS problem as we have code for users that now no longer will run if the upgrade past 0.43.1 qiskit
The original poster was using Aer primitives. It seems you are using runtime primitives, and judging from things a pretty old version of qiskit ibm runtime given you highlight lines that have not been like that there in quite a few versions.. You should update qiskit-ibm-runtime (and qiskit as well) to the latest versions.
Ah, I see ... I did have the 0.8.0 version, but after an upgrade I have now 0.12.2.
And it works now.
Hmmm ... I guess users need to be alerted to this.
In any case, thank you.  Should this Issue be closed?
This issue was already closed last month by the original author when upgrading Aer solved the problem for them.
