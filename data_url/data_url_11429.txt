Drawing should default to graphviz module when available otherwise fall back on networkx.
Investigated this a bit.  At the current release level networkx is not playing nice with graphviz.  Even if both modules work fine on their own they don't play nicely together.  I observe the same behavior as described in this stackoverflow track:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35279733/what-could-cause-networkx-pygraphviz-to-work-fine-alone-but-not-together
Running the pygraphviz test also gives me a seg fault, which apparently is a know issue with Python 3.5 and 3.4:
pygraphviz/pygraphviz#84
This is on an up-to-date Ubuntu/Linux system.
Can now draw with graphviz and for the first time also create a dot file. Ran into some more issues that I will document and test before creating a pull request. I.e. will create a Windows 10 testbed in addition to my Linux one.
Pulled the latest repo to retrace these steps. The networkx rendering works, but I get the following error message:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/quax/projects/quantum-fog/graphs/BayesNet.py", line 158, in 
bnet.write_dot(path1)
File "/home/quax/projects/quantum-fog/graphs/Graph.py", line 258, in write_dot
nx.write_dot(self.get_nx_graph(), path)
AttributeError: module 'networkx' has no attribute 'write_dot'
The networkx write_dot issue seems to be related to this: nipy/nipype#1350
While related to this feature request the networkx issue is a separate bug.  Hence opened a new issue for this.
Got graphviz to work nicely with QFog in Jupyter.  Trick was to use anaconda and install graphviz via pipe rather than conda install.

Since this now works in Jupyter where is matters the most. I will close this issue.
