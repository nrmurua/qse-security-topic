Sorry to come back to this, but the convention to start counting modules from 1 (instead of 0) is utterly confusing, so i will modify it to start counting from 0:
the only thing that will be kept is calling analog inputs and outputs as they are written onto the board, i.e. in1 - out2 stay the way they are
That works for me
