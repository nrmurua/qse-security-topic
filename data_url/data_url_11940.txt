Part of #1420
It looks like this tutorial is the same as this other one, but they come form different files. Having duplicated content on different files makes maintenance harder, so we should decide which one we want to delete. Another option could be directly remove the "Sample algorithms in qiskit" section
@y4izus Would you like me to provide a summary and see if there are more? I have done that before and it shouldn't take too long.
Hey @InfamousPlatypus , sorry for the delay on the answer. I stopped working on that project, so I think @javabster , @HuangJunye or @Eric-Arellano can follow up with this issue :)
The algorithms tutorials were tutorials around using the algorithms as supplied in Qiskit. This https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/algorithms/09_IQPE.html seems to have been included at some point but for me would be more relevant as textbook and/or community content.
Hi! As @woodsp-ibm mentioned in his comment, we consider that this material would be more relevant as textbook and/or community content. It does not use any of the algorithms supplied in qiskit-algorithms, but rather shows how to build the algorithm from scratch. For this reason, it has not been migrated to the new qiskit-algorithms tutorials section, and given the current context, I believe this issue can be closed.
