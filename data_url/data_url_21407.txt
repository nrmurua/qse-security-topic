Cannot remove idle kernel with coremgmt.
No idle kernel is being run, standard warning about absence of idle kernel is emitted once to the UART and logs
The cryptic error message is emitted for an infinite number of times.
I think the major reason for such behavior is that the config doesn't actually removes the key, rather it just rewrites it with empty data.
