Pyquil 4.2 brings support for python 3.12. It seems as though to accommodate continued support for numpy and scipy, the dependencies have become conditional on the python version.
It may not be obvious that this affects downstream packages in a somewhat complicated way.
For example, the following dependency specification is valid:
but this one is not:
Poetry "explains":
Similarly,
yields the error,
The only way I could resolve the error was to remove the numpy dependency specification entirely.
These issues were propagated up from numpy and scipy. It looks like recent releases fixed these constraints, so I'll loosen them in pyQuil's spec as well.
