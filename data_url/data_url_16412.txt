This isssue was posted in qiskit-aer which is a wrong place for it. Creating a new issue at qiskit-terra (which is relevant to it) and creating a pull request for a solution
Can I work on this?
Certainly, assigning to you.
Hey, I just looked through the problem. Can someone specify more precisely what the problem. I am new to this and help would be much appreciated, thanks!
@taalexander , @siddharthdangwal  Hey can you help me out, in specifying the error. Is it because the value for shots is entered as a string and an error message should be displayed for that?
@coder-mtv, I would start by trying the example @siddharthdangwal posted above and seeing where the error is raised. I think a proper error should be added somewhere around here https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/995ac92376cfa632b124e171023c779bd2f3119b/qiskit/compiler/assemble.py#L216.
Hey @taalexander , I have fixed the issue, I believe. I will upload it shortly. If there is still an error, could you please reassign it to me?
I will be uploading the fix around 10 hours later. It would be great, if you could merge by the 14th itself!
Hello, @coder-mtv it seems like @siddharthdangwal had made a PR #4880 and we missed this.
Hey @taalexander , so is the issue fixed, or can I still do it? I didn't get the message properly
I'm sorry @coder-mtv, it seems like there is already a solution that is mostly done. I don't think it would be a good use of time to continue on this, I am sorry for causing you to waste your time. Would you like me to to help find another good issue to work on?
You could also help review #4880 and compare it with your solution.
@taalexander but I encountered the error that was referred to in this issue, so is it fixed yet actually?
@taalexander Is there any way, I could do this issue, as I'm applying for the advocates program and a contribution would help!
@coder-mtv the fix is here #4880. If it is not updated by @siddharthdangwal in about a weeks time, I will reassign.
Thanks! @taalexander
Hi! Is this problem still open?
@siddharthdangwal got unresponsive. Do you want to work on this @coder-mtv ?
Feel free to continue the code in #4880. If you do, make sure you respect the original authorship as co-author. Otherwise, you can restart a new PR.
If @coder-mtv is not responding in the coming week. Is @tgag17 interested?
I will work on it @taalexander
Hey, is this issue still open? Can I work on it?

@taalexander I think I have solved this issue.
