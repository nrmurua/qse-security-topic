The test is failing in the master branch with the following error:
The failure is intermittent. It seems related with running all the test suite. When running isolated, it seems not to be failing.
The test should pass regardless of other tests.
It will be temporally marked as an expected failure but we should dig into what happens.
It finally failed for me locally in the tests. However, I ran the test 1000 times by itself and could not reproduce it
opening again as still failing
closed with #1314
