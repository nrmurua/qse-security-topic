Hi all,
I am including some issues about errors.
First of all: measurements error
As far as we know, some others simulation packages include measurement errors in two differnt ways. One way is to apply a channel before applying the gate. The other way is to perform a measurement and then flip the result with certain probability. This probability does not have to be the same for 0-> 1 and 1-> 0, so it allows non-symmetric errors. Is it possible to implement this kind of errors?
Second: thermal relaxation errors
These errors are designed to simulate the interaction between the qubit and the environment. It is inherited from NMR: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxation_%28NMR%29, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04485.pdf . It can be understood as "how the qubit loses its quantum behaviour", however I am not an expert of this file. Take a look at that and tell me if this makes sense to you.
