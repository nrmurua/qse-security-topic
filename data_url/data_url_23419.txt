The docstring for instrument.base.add_function() is very unclear.
In particular the Args are unclear and the Returns is unclear.
Args could be improved by adding call_cmd as an explicit (required) argument and explaining what it does.
It is not clear when the return of this function is ever used.
The docs of instrument.function.function are much clearer and seem to refer to the same thing. Exactly how this works/gets called is very opaque at the moment.
Similar things can be said about instrument.base.add_parameter() however I have not looked into that with as much detail.
Suggestions for improvement.
