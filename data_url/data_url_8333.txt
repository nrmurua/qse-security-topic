I installed qutip version 4.3.1 via pip3.
I cannot reproduce the error as I am on darwin.
It might be something about _linux_hardware_info.
Thanks for the clue, it was helpfull.
The source of problem is localization of lscpu util, which used by _linux_hardware_info() function.
The function expects 'Socket(s)', 'Core(s) per socket', etc in lscpu output, but in my system it actually 'Потоков на ядро', 'Сокетов', etc.
I think, maybe better less system dependent ways to calculate cpu count, for example, we could use multiprocessing module and it's cpu_count function. Or len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))for computers with dynamic cpu management (see this for details).
Or show exception/error, if we try to use lscpu and LANG is not english (or we couldn't found mentioned above 'Socket(s)').
Ideas?
Fixed in #1758.
