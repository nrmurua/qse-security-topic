If I encode a bitvector into a number of qubits using Alice and send them to Bob, and Bob measures the qubits then Bob gets the same bitvector as Alice. But I am encountering a strange bug when I try and forward through a proxy node Eve.
When I send the qubits from Alice to Eve, then from Eve to Bob, Bob's measurements seem to be undefined. Not really sure what is going on here but I would like to help debug this. Though I'm not really sure where to start, since there could be a number of things happening.
I have tried using the the stabilizer and qutip backends and got the same result.
Below is the Eve proxy code:
Hi @aThorp96! Could you also share your code for Alice and Bob?
There's a little bit more going on with them, but here is alice.py and bob.py. Any functions not local to the file will be in the bb84 library I wrote. Particularly of interest would be the measure_standard and encode_standard functions.
Just tried to recreate the issue using the following code and the code behaved as expected so I'm no longer confident the bug lies in the simulaqron codebase...
Alice
Bob
Eve
@AckslD Sorry for any trouble. I didn't realize qubits persisted between connections, and I think I needed to flush them. I believe this can be marked as closed.
No problem @aThorp96 :)
