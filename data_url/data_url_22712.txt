Currently the new compiler misses many features at edges, often subtle. This issue is intended to track them to ensure none are forgotten.
Interleaving, classes and syscalls are by far the highest priority as users cannot do anything with the new compiler until this is done.
We don't need to keep compatibility with artiq.language.core.int64. Removing it is good.
Merged.
