Eventually, add something like Travis CL.
Blocked by #3 obviously.
This was added in PR #48, but it won't be available for use until the repo is public.
Until then, developers should manually run those tests for each new PR.
We'll need to extend this to cover Python tests as well, as more Python code is added to support the Cirq integration.
Moved to post-release fixes. This is the first thing that needs to be resolved after release, as it provides the automated testing to ensure all subsequent changes are valid.
