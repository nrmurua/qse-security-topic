scqubits fails in python 3.5 (which we officially support at the moment), as variable annotations are not supported (they only became a thing in 3.6). For example in constants.py we have:
we could either enforce that we require version >3.6, or rewrite these.
Thoughts?
3.6+  specific code used in scqubits is not limited to annotations, but also includes usage of __set_name__. Going forward, we are supporting Python versions >=3.6. This is now correctly reflected in the updated documentation. (We may reconsider refactoring if there is significant demand from the user base for Python 3.5 support.)
