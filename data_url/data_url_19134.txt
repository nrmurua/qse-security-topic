We need a Python implementation of QDYN's make_ensemble_targets: Take a list of objectives that all use the same Hamiltonian, and a list of Hamiltonians, and return a new list of objectives that duplicates the original objective once for each new Hamiltonian.
Having this routine available will make it easier to close #11
