The reshape_samples function in tdmprogram.py currently works by popping elements from the all_samples dictionary argument, and then inserting them into a new dictionary which is then returned. This causes the input all_samples dictionary to be empty after having reshaped the samples (which might be confusing for the user, since this is nowhere stated).
This is not really an optimal way of handling things, and should probably be fixed. There are two alternatives:
Create a copy of all_samples at the start. This is a simple solution, but has the downside that a copy needs to be made of a potentially very large dictionary. (Could this become an issue? Memory-wise?)
Avoid returning anything and just update the old all_samples directly.
