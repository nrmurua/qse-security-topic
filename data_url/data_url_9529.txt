When calling the _run_solver() method in Simulation (line 880 in Simulation.py), a fix was introduced for using the mesolve() method from QuTiP, in which a Liouvillian object was created before calling the solver.
In the meantime, the creation of the Hamiltonian and initial state was updated in QuTiP, so the "fix" should be updated with the recommended creation.
@Varda-star  This is one of the improvements on the module for you :)
I jump on it!

What are these updates precisely?
Don't create the qutip.liouvillian() object in line 880, instead call the mesolve() method directly with the Hamiltonian and collapse operators.
Copied that
I open a PR about it.
