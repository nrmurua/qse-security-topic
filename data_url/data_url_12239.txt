I submitted the job. Then the job is on queue, with its jobID shown. Since this takes some time especially when the queue position is high, I need to close my computer (internet connection also lost). When I open my computer again, I can no longer get access to that job again.
The status changes from JobStatus.QUEUED: 'job is queued'to JobStatus.ERROR: 'job incurred error'. How can I keep the job on the queue? or how can obtain the execution result since I have the jobID?
After some testings and with the help of this program, I confirmed that the job will continue to run and I can also retrieve the execution result from the program.
However, if there is a disconnection when the job is on queue, in the original terminal where you run the python program, it will get stuck at JobStatus.ERROR: 'job incurred error'forever after the i get connected to the internet again. So I cannot do any saving/postprocessing of data. Is there any good solution to this?
You can still retrieve the jobs which have been queued after you close your python session. To do this you would just create an instance of your backend and call mybackend.jobs(). This will return a list of job instances from which you can retrieve your results. The jobs function can be supplied several options you can use to filter what jobs you get back,

@ewinston answer should fix this. Closing the issue and if you have problems please reopen
