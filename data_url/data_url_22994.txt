I have added some transparency on the second trace in branch spectrum_analyzer, but I believe the trace becomes more and more opaque when the oscillations are denser, so maybe its better to use a checkbox
Indeed, the transparency only works if not too many points cluster on top of each other. So I removed it and we should put a radiobutton about which curve to plot on top..
