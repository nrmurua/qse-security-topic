How can I abort an active measurement? I tried
But then when trying to start a new measurement I get
RuntimeError('Already executing a measurement')
As a side note: what would be a good place to gather answers to questions such as this one? I can place it either in qcodes/docs/objects.md or in qcodes/docs/examples/Qcodes example.ipynb

How about qcodes/docs/FAQ.md with a hyperlink in readme.md so that it can be easily browsed to in the github page?
qc.halt_bg() should do it (it's in loops.py if you want to check it out)
Your question makes it clear though that this still could go wrong in various ways... like if the loop locked up, the fallback is to terminate it just as you did, in which case it will leave the DataManager thinking a loop is still running. Lets leave this issue open until I get to that, make DataManager a little more robust.
Also, per a suggestion from @dbwz8 I'm intending to take out the enqueue option from Loop.run() so I'll use this issue as a reminder to do that too. The behavior I'm going to implement is that you basically always enqueue: if there's already a loop running, print "Waiting for another loop to finish..." and block until it does finish. If that's not what you the user had in mind, you'll see that and can hit ctrl-c.

The method qc.halt_bg() was added to the FAQ.
