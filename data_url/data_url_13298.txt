We currently assume that observables are generic and so expectation values can be complex.
This has some pros and cons.
Pros:
Cons:
Two alternative solutions are proposed below.
The user can still decompose any non hermitian observable A as a linear combination of two Hermitian observables (A1, A2), such that: A = A1+ i A2 .
So the restriction to Hermitian observables is not strong as it seems.
This issue had no activity for 4 months, and will be closed in 2 weeks unless there is new activity. Cheers!
From local testing, it looks like we'll have to make a decision here in order to upgrade to the latest (1.23.3) version of numpy (#1486). I'm in support of using complex expectation values only if they are a valuable tool for users. I've personally never seen them in use, and I don't think we have any examples of using complex expectation values in our docs.
@unitaryfund/engineering WDYT?
For Hermitian observables, I believe expectation values are strictly theoretically real-valued, by the way. Is there even a need for non-Hermitian operator expectation values? I'm not sure that would make sense, in the context of quantum theory.
I found this review comment thread from last year on this issue: #1001 (comment).
