The BasicAer qasm simulator has 'unitary' in its bases gates, but does not have an implementation for arbitrary unitaries leading to an exception for any circuit that contains them.
Raises
BasicAerError: 'qasm_simulator encountered unrecognized operation "unitary"'
Circuit executes
I will put in a PR to add an implementation of arbitrary unitaries to the BasicAer simulators.
