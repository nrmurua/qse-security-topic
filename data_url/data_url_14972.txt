Right now it is possible to run the circuit without measurements on real hardware, and the empty dictionary is returned for counts. In order not to waste resources, I suggest checking whether the quantum circuit contains measurements before running it on a real device. I think this should be done inww$\rightarrow$ utils $\rightarrow$ run_circuits.py:
Instead you could add a MeasureAll() or MeasureActive()?
Thanks for your interest, and the request.
In general, optimisations surrounding the actual execution of a circuit are the responsibility of a backend, not Terra.  Many backends have side-effects / other observable behaviour in the results object that may be desired, even if there are no measurement outcomes.  The obvious case of that is simulators of course, but for example it could also be the case that a pulse-level circuits has no obvious "measure" instructions but still invokes data collection.
The particular code you're talking about is just a part of QuantumInstance, which was deprecated in Terra 0.24 and so we're not accepting new features for it.
