"XX" and Pauli("XX") as an argument on SparsePauliOp has different results for qiskit_aer.primitives, while qiskit.primitives results are correct.
Output:
They should all be the same number, but qiskit_aer.primitives output are inconsistent.
The fluctuation is due to sampling errors in the measurement. In other words, it is not approximation=True.
approximation is not run_option, so
is correct. However, this does not support non-Hermitian operator. Actually, whether Estimator supports non-Hermitian operator is implementation-dependent.
I specified both in the run_options as recommended in the migration guide: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/ff4dc0becb84af7b38ea3b7590fc285796b7566b/docs/migration_guides/opflow_migration.rst?plain=1#L1265.
Actually, whether Estimator supports non-Hermitian operator is implementation-dependent.
I replaced the 0.2j with 0.2, and the result still doesn't match with qiskit.primitives
Upon retrying several times, I did get different number each time. So it seems that it is not doing exact computation according to 
I confirmed that estimator2 = e2(approximation=True, run_options={"shots": None}) does indeed give the correct answer, as long as the observables are Hermitian.
Oh... It's a typo. Thank you for finding.
