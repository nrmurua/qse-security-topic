cirq-unstable has failed to update since #3167. The packages are failing to upload to pypi, and from the build log it looks like pypi can't handle something in the new README.rst:
HTTPError: 400 Bad Request from https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
The description failed to render in the default format of reStructuredText. See https://pypi.org/help/#description-content-type for more information.
Fixed by #3176.
