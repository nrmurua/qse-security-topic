We currently treat RZs as taking a very short (but nonzero) amount of time in the addresser to avoid some nasty logic involving occupied-interval objects of duration 0. This caused a nasty floating point bug to appear that we resolved by moving away from floats, but really this underlying logic should be fixed as well.
