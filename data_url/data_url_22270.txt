(I'm running 2.0 on linux.)
I don't understand how the function rtio_log is supposed to work.  I'm trying to use it following the example in the manual (slightly modified):
I don't see the value of i anywhere in the vcd file.  Where does it go?  In any case, perhaps some more thorough documentation is in order.
Please post the problematic VCD file plus the raw dump (artiq_coreanalyzer -d raw_dump -v vcd).
The following was generated with artiq_coreanalyzer -d rtio_test -w rtio_test.vcd:

@whitequark the problem is the 1d special character used for separating messages is not emitted or handled correctly by the logging system, and no log message ever gets terminated.
Is 1.x affected?
I see the same behavior in 1.2.
@whitequark any update?
@sbourdeauducq I thought you were looking at the RTIO bug?
I asked you to characterize the gateware problem, if it really is one. You said that it dropped characters, but the gateware has no notion of character.
Yes, that seemed odd to me too. I'll look at it again shortly.
@sbourdeauducq This is not a gateware bug. It's actually a bug in _extract_log_chars. I will fix it shortly.
