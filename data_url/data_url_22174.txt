The existing DDS pulse rate test is only supposed to test the performance of emission speed. Since we use soft-FP, many realistic use scenarios will have soft-FP latency dominate emission latency. To optimize them, we need a benchmark as a guide.
@r-srinivas I remember you ran into speed problems with sideband cooling. Could you give us the relevant part of your code?
(duplicate: #660)
The current DDS test was written to measure the speed of the C routines. This is why there is no sweep or other computations.
