The data is exported to netCDF where values that are dicts are either skipped or converted to str

Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS on WSL2

Tagging @jenshnielsen. What would you recommend as a best solution here - drop the nested data or convert it to str? We currently convert the snapshot to str as well so to be consistent this may be the best way to go.
@guenp Yes similar to the snapshot I think we should serialize the extra metadata to json. netcdf4 is very limited in the types allowed in the attributes dict
@jenshnielsen That would be great, thanks! I've implemented a quick-and-dirty fix for this such that I was able to upload my data but a more sustainable solution would be great :) The main request I have is that we add some functionality to load the data from netCDF file as well and deserialize the data back to a nested dictionary.
Another issue I ran into is that the serialized nested dicts are very verbose and take up multiple pages when using the repr functionality in a jupyter notebook. I posted a question on this in the xarray gitter: https://gitter.im/pydata/xarray
Hi @guenp looking more closely at this I am a bit confused as to how you produced this dataset.
If I do the following
on some dataset I will get an unsupported type error from sqlite
So I would not expect it to be possible to produce a dataset with nested metadata. I guess I must be overlooking something?
@jenshnielsen Ah, I think you're right. This dataset was produced with Nanotune using json.dumps: , see nanotune/tests/data_savers.py#L33.
So the problem is that when qcodes exports the dataset to xarray, the whole DataSet._metadata dict is nested under the "extra_metadata" key in .attrs rather than storing them by key/value pair.
Here's a minimal example to reproduce:
this raises the above error:
@guenp Thanks, that we can write a test for and fix :)
