Similar to as was added for the transpiler's PassManager in #2782, qiskit.execute should log progress and runtimes. Possible logging locations: total transpile time, parameter binding, qobj assembly, scheduling (post-#3792), backend job submission.
I'd like to give this one a go :)
Hi @kdk I've started working on this, so far I have added runtime logs for transpile, assemble and schedule. I'm a bit unsure about what other logs would be appropriate (as I'm still not super experienced with the codebase). Could you please provide a bit more guidance on this, maybe an example or 2? Thanks in advance :)
What you have is great. The other place I would add timing is around job submission (the line backend.run(qobj, **run_config) in execute.py).
Closing as #3922 has merged.
