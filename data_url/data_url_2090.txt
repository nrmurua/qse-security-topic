By default policy of asyncio, it creates its event loop only if it is called by the main thread. When this cirq.PauliSumCollector() is called by another thread, it doesnt create its event loop and raises RuntimeError.
So I suggest adding new event loop explicitly inside Collector (here)
From what I'm gathering this is the calling threads' responsibility to bind an event_loop. Cirq is a library - I don't think it should create new event loops. How are you calling cirq.PauliSumCollector?
