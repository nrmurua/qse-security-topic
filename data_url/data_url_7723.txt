Hi quimb team,
I'm having trouble with the 'TensorNetwork.unitize' while working with complex matrices; it seems to be working fine for the real ones but I'm trying to do some optimizations with complex entrees. Any quick idea on what the issue might be?
Thanks!

Hi @yuxuanzhang1995, could you maybe provide minimal example? There are some issues with the stability of autodiff gradients through some of the unitize method + backend combinations. Complex matrices potentially sets these off as well.
