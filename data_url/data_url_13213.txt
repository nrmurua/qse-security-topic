For example, when I search for PEC, the first (!) result is our docs, but from version 0.11.1.

It would be great if search engines only indexed stable releases. Maybe a case can be made for latest as well, but definitely not older versions. Thankfully this issue seems to be solved in readthedocs/readthedocs.org#2430, and the solution is to use a robots.txt file along with sphinx's html_extra_path config var which gets set in docs/source/conf.py.
An example robots.txt we may want to copy can be found here: https://github.com/astropy/astropy/blob/main/docs/robots.txt
Seems like a good idea! This a PR, in astropy, that did what @natestemen suggested: astropy/astropy@5399150
A robots.txt file has been added in #1543, and I will check back on this in a few weeks to see if search engines have updated their indices.
The version in RTD that shows up is still an older one. I searched for mitiq and if I go to the docs link, I don't directly go to the latest or stable version but to v0.3

Edit : The 404 error page also pops up when I try to switch from the version above to the latest or stable version. But I can click on the link and can navigate to what's current.

Yeah, it can take quite a long time for search engines to refresh their cache. There are ways to ask them to do a refresh, but you first have to prove you own the webpage which can be kind of a pain. IMO it's not worth our time as it stands, unless someone is interested.
My recent tests indicate this is now resolved.
