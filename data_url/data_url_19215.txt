In PR #1095 we are adding GPI2 as single qubit native gate to have more optimized decompositions.
This should also be a first step toward a general unroller where single qubit native gates can be specified by the user. For this purpose the NativeType class in qibo.transpiler.abstract is inadequate and we should rethink the selection of native gates both for single and multi qubit gates.
@stavros11 @renato @BrunoLiegiBastonLiegi when can we discuss about the best solution?
