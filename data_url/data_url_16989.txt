When trying to render a circuit with output='mpl', if it contains any operations conditioned on the state of a classical register, it fails:
The following error is thrown:
It does work, however, with output='text', output='latex' and output='latex_source'.
Same thing happens when using circuit_drawer(qc, output='mpl') instead.
Circuit figure should be rendered in 'mpl' format.
Thanks for opening an issue. This issue was actually already caught and fixed on the day we pushed the 0.9.0 release (it barely missed the deadline). The fix was here: #3032 it's been backported to stable/0.9 (see: #3049 ) for inclusion in a bugfix release per the stable branch policy: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#stable-branch-policy Or it will be included in the next minor version release 0.10.0 which will likely also happen relatively soon. I'll ask and see if people are opposed to pushing a bugfix release to get this fix out prior to the 0.10 release.
In the meantime I'm going to close this issue as it's already been fixed. Please feel free to reopen it if I'm missing something or there is more to discuss.
Thanks for the quick response @mtreinish ! I did not see the fix in the list of closed issues, apologies.
Actually looking at the PR it looks an issue about it was never opened. It was quick typo fix and we didn't bother to open an issue about it because it was a 1 line fix. I think we assumed we would have pushed a 0.9.1 that included it well before now.
