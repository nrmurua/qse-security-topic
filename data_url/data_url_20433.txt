Building with --enable-ntru fails on my macOS.  More specifically, the liboqs build completes, but then trying to run ./test_kex fails with the following error:
Can you change the build process so it statically links in libntruencrypt.a at compile time rather than dynamically linking in libntruencrypt.dylib at runtime?
I believe we should instead include the NTRU code in the project (see #116)
