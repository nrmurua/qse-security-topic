Hi!
Thank you all for the great work. ProjectQ is one of my favourite quantum computing frameworks and I am happy that I can use it once again to run experiments on the IBM Q Experience.
However, I have detected a (very) minor bug in the example "ibm.py". Line 56
token = getpass.getpass(prompt='IBM device > ')
should be
device = getpass.getpass(prompt='IBM device > ')
Best,
Elías
