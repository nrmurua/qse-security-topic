A similar error also in matrix representation of U2.

It should be -e^{i\lambda} instead of e^{-i\lambda}.
Hello, this one looks perfect for me as a first try.
@nonhermitian, do you think you could assign it to me?
Go for it!
Thanks @nonhermitian !
I have a question: can I fix the two issues mentioned here (for U3 and U2) or do we have to open a new issue for U2?
It may look like a stupid a question, but it is my first time I am contributing to a project.
I think you can fix both in one go. Just make sure to mention that in the follow up PR. Thanks again!
Hi all. @nonhermitian and @FranckChevallier,

It should be U2(0, \pi) = H, instead of U2(\pi, 0) = H. Am I right?

Yeah, that looks right.
Oops sorry @DavitKhach and @TharrmashasthaPV  I've just pulled a request before noting your comments.
How to fix it? Should we create a new issue?

You could push another PR for this issue with the above correction made.
And do I need to push it with the previous fixes inside? Or can I consider that the previous fixes will be already included?

The PR needs to have your previous corrections too.
Thanks @TharrmashasthaPV !
So I've tried, hopefully it ill be good :-)
@FranckChevallier I noticed that in the first commit there is the following line:
U3(\theta, \phi, \lambda) = RZ(\phi+3\pi) RX(\frac{\pi}{2}) RZ(\theta + \pi) RX(\frac{\pi}{2}) RZ(\lambda)
Isn't this more preferable:
U3(\theta, \phi, \lambda) = RZ(\phi + \pi/2) RX(\theta) RZ(\lambda - \pi/2)
Because it is a shorter decomposition?
Hi @DavitKhach,
To be honest you know better than me about it.
But you are challenging my capabilities with git :-)
I don't think committing a new version of the U3.py will be very clean. I guess I have to cancel my previous commits and PR to redo it properly.
Any idea of how to to do it? I have found some rebase command line, but I am not sure about it.
Hi @FranckChevallier,
Sorry, I don't have much experience with PRs. Maybe it will be better to ask someone from IBM or someone who did PRs in Qiskit.
Thanks David.
Hi @1ucian0, do you know how could I cancel my previous commits and PR to redo it properly?
@FranckChevallier sorry for the delay. There is no need to "cancel your previous PRs". You just can modify it in a following commit. In the master code, the history will be squashed, so no worries.
Sorry for the delay in the answer. Your message slipped through the cracks.
Thanks @1ucian0 !
I am sorry to ask stupid question but since I've forked the project and commit my changes, other people have made some changes on the files I've worked on.
So I've merged my local master with the upstream/master.
Now I see three options, but I don't know which one is the best:
So between 1 and 2, do you have any advise? Or maybe another option.
Sorry to waste your time on such a simple issue...
Ping me on Slack and can try to solve it together!
@FranckChevallier I don't see a merge conflict on the PR, so I think it should be enough to just make the change on your fork on the same branch that serves as the source for PR #4165 - that should automatically update the pull request.
Hi @1ucian0 , @aditya-giri ,
Thanks for your support.
The u2.py and u3.py have been moved to a new folder in the master branch: qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/
So I gonna update the files in this new folder from my previous branch, commit and do the PR.
Is that ok for you?
@1ucian0 to contact you on slack it looks like I need to receive a invitation to join the team.

It's in the README: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra#contribution-guidelines
@FranckChevallier can you also correct the U3 matrix definition, similar to what you did for U2?
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/u3.py#L47?
@aditya-giri do you mind doing this in a following PR?
it looks like Franck has made the changes already :)
on a side note, I'm not able to tag him anymore - any idea why?
Sorry @aditya-giri
I didn't notice it was the changes you wanted to do.
BTW I pushed the changes but now I don't know if any other action is required on my side.
No problem @FranckChevallier, as long as someone fixes it ðŸ˜ƒ
Changes look good to me!
