An example of this is:
Here, since post_process takes in a list of node outputs which also contain non executable electron nodes such as of :parameter: type, it fails because it will look for the function name of a and find its occurrence in :parameter: and then use the output of that for post processing.
This can be avoided if we use an OrderedDictionary to store the nodes and their outputs and then pass it to post_process.
Apparently python dictionaries are now ordered in insertion order from Python 3.7+ onwards. So, we can use normal dictionaries instead of OrderedDict.
