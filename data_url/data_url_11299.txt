Hello, I tried to use the function jordan_wigner_interaction_op from openfermion.transforms and kept running into an ImportError so I added the function to the __init__.py file in the openfermion.transforms subdirectory. I'm not sure if this was just an issue for me, or is this something to edit?
You should use jordan_wigner instead, which checks the type of the input operator and uses jordan_wigner_interaction_op as a helper function.
Ah I see. Thanks for the quick response!
