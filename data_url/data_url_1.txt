I'm thinking of creating a list of "quantum open hardware" projects, also those not necessarily involving software and going beyond quantum computing, i.e., not "experimental quantum computing". Would adding projects that are also listed in the "experimental quantum computing section" look messy?
I'd like it to have some nested features, such as subsections like "blueprints for processors", "data acquisition", '"remotely controlled labs". But then this would be at odds with the current structure based on programming languages. Do you think it makes any sense to implement such subsections here? Some projects may be more general than quantum, or borderline with photonics and other research areas.
I'd like to have some contextual information around them, possibly, like short summaries, but see that this would be not very homogeneous with the current structure of this repo (which works great as it is). Maybe the best way to proceed is for me to create a personal repository and possibly copy paste here relevant projects in the format that suits the current "experimental quantum computing" section, or possibly adding a 'quantum open hardware' for those that do not fit there. This is more an issue for discussion than else, and can be closed as needed.
Hey @nathanshammah! Great initiative and I think it would be great to have a list like that! However, I think that it might be best to keep it separate (similar to how @desireevl's learning resources are separate from this software list). We would then just cross-reference each other such that people have an easier time finding what they're looking for! How does that sound?
