If passing a callable to a Parameterized schedule with signature arguments f(b, a) where the arguments are not ordered alphabetically, calling parameterize_schedule(b_inst,a_inst) will result in f(a_inst,b_inst)` being called.
The current implementation of ParameterizedSchedule has always been considered temporary as the aim has always been to incorporate parameters like a QuantumCircuit, however, these were not ready at the time of development. Regardless we should still correct this bug for the time being while #3384 is being developed.
Add this to test.python.pulse.test_schedule

@nkanazawa1989 do you think you could have a look and see if this is trivial or requires a bit more work?
I found the reason and I'll fix.
