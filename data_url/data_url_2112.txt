The signature of compute_amplitudes_sweep and compute_amplitudes requires bitstrings to be a list of int's. Because of the semantics in python3 of not allowing leading zeros for int's (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36386346/syntaxerror-invalid-token) this can be confusing.
For eg: if I want to measure a bitstring 0010, I need to provide 10 as input to the bitstring which is confusing to the user.
I propose to change the type of bitstrings to Sequence[str].
I think the way to do this in python is to use the binary prefix: 0b0010 or 0B0010.  I'm going to change this to adding binary as example usage.
For eg: if I want to measure a bitstring 0010, I need to provide 10 as input to the bitstring which is confusing to the user.
Not at all. To measure bitstring 0010, you need to provide 2 as input which you may choose to write as 0b0010 or 0b10 or 0x2 or 2 or even 0o2 (no longer fashionable).
