A qasm file with a gate declaration using a previously defined gate multiple times can lead to the qasm file being incorrectly parsed.
The following code fails with an error:
The error:
qiskit.qasm.exceptions.QasmError: "Duplicate declaration for gate 'g1' at line 4, file .\nPrevious occurrence at line 3, file "
The qasm output from the first circuit should be parsed into the same circuit without error.
This is the output from qc1.qasm()
