Under the ops.clifford_gate, there is a data structure PauliTransform, which is just a named tuple
The reason I suggest deprecation is
The benefit of keeping PauliTransform is it is much more light-weighted than DensePauliString.  But I think the benefits is marginal.
Agreed, should deprecate because obsoleted by DensePauliString and not widely used.
@ybc1991 can we close this ?
@MichaelBroughton  I think this still exists.  This is one to deprecate before 0.15?
