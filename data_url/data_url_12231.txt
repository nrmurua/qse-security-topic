I would like the folder community / algorithm to be like a list of the textbook algorithms using qiskit.
I think we need a readme.ipynb that gives an overview and is linked to from the main index.ipynb rather than the folder that it currently goes to.
We have a really good start but letâ€™s just think about how they go together and how you learn qiskit though textbook algorithms.
landing from the main file
3.4 Textbook Quantum Algorithms with Qiskit
Learn Qiskit from the textbook quantum algorithms, like Shor, Grover, and Deutsch-Jozsa.
@rraymondhp can you think about this and use this issue to make a plan.
I will make a plan soon. Please wait.
