I initialize a noise model from a fake backend. I run the estimator with a simple circuit and observable. The ideal expectation value is 1.0. approximation=True gives 0.981. approximation=False gives 0.916.
Should be a better approximation.
Here's another example. approximation=True gives 0.822. approximation=False gives 0.515.
This is not a bug. This approximation method ignores measurement errors. It should be explicitly written in the documentation.
(I have an idea for a method to take in the error, but it takes time.)
