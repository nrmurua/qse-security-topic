Currently, when the user tries to render components into Ansys, the Ansys renderer checks for the chip designation in each component's options dictionary. If it is not found, an error message pops up but does not specify this as its underlying cause.

Render a component that doesn't have a chip: chip designation key-value pair in its options dictionary.
All components should have a chip designation for the time being, and any errors should be clearly specified as described above. The long term solution, which depends on the layer stack, will be a separate issue.
Add a detailed error message to the logger.
