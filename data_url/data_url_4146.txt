Hi, I wanted to contribute to your project and I've designed a logo for your project. if you need anything change please let me know.

Best Regard. Mirza Zulfan
Thanks a lot for taking the time to design a logo! We will discuss and give feedback asap.
Thanks a lot for the effort, these are nice logos. We will add the logo discussion to a meeting regarding a new website (but it might take some time for that to happen). We will post updates
Thanks for the response. If the team has decided, let me know. I will send all files and tell me what color you like. Happy to help open source project. üëç
Best Regard.
Dear @mirzazulfan ,
Thanks a lot for your logo submissions. We had a meeting with the other maintainers of ProjectQ yesterday and we decided that we'd like to use your logo suggestions.
Would it be possible for you to send us the raw files (PSD or else) so that we can export them into the various format as required?
We particularly like the violet gradient (bottom left) for the short logo version and the white on black version for the large logo that we'll probably use for the main website.
If possible could we also have a large version with a similar colour scheme as the bottom left one?
Best regards,
Damien
