I had cirq/contrib/acquaintance/permutation_test/test_linear_permutation_gate_equality fail. When rerunning the test, it suddenly passed.  Maybe some RNG problem in the parametrization? Below is the raised error message:
This has been fixed in #1331
Not the same test though?
Oh oops.  Reopened!
Yeah I see what is wrong.  LinearPermutationGate canonicalizes the permutation, but the test can generate equal permutations.
#1338
