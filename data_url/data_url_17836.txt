Currently we have:
The latter should just be removed. The first will have a pass_manager option.
Also see #978 about other simplifications to these function signatures.
I almost agree but letâ€™s keep it a top-level function.  How much is skipped translation used.
Ok I'm going to self-assign and work with @nonhermitian on the implementation and it answers his #1032
in the transpiler.compile  you pass it circuits it returns compiled circuits
wrapper.comple
Basically, there is no qobj in the transpiler.
@ajavadia  I see this issue has been closed but I don't see that compile in _compiler.py has as 'pass_manager' parameter, is this still to come?
The latter should just be removed. The first will have a pass_manager option.
@ss2165 yes that will replace the skip_transpiler, and if you want to skip the transpiler you just pass in an empty pass manager.
now there are a few follow up issues we are working on to make this all make sense (#1144, #1145, #1146, #1163).
