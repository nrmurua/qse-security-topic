This mallocs two REAL lists (for the real and imaginary components) and populates them with amplitudes of the statevector in the given index range (startInd to startInd+numAmps).
In distributed mode, this involves a reduction.
Example use:
Alternatively, forcing the user to alloc (so that they may pass arrays) is ok too
and the density matrix getDensityAmps of course
