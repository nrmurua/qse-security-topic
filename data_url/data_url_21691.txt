voltage_to_mu()  isn't recognised as an attribute of the zotino. See my code below for outputting a ramp wave on the Zotino.
I expected this to output a ramp wave on the zotino, going from 0 to 10V in 0.1V steps. When I manually convert the voltages to machine units, it runs as expected.
When I try to run this it gives the following error.
AttributeError: 'Zotino' object has no attribute 'voltage_to_mu'
Having looked in the source code, I don't think the voltage_to_mu() is imported into the Zotino source file from the AD9910 file. Could this be why it isn't working?
I'm running ARTIQ v5.6852.c2b4f0cf.beta on Windows 10
voltage_to_mu is not a method of the Zotino class.
See https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-beta/core_drivers_reference.html#artiq.coredevice.ad53xx.voltage_to_mu
Use:
No AD9910 here.
What's the logic behind not having voltage_to_mu as a method of the zotino?
That would restrict it to only that usage. Might be ok though.
What about making it a method of AD53xx, like the DDS frequency_to_ftw?
Importing directly from ARTIQ like this breaks the device database abstraction.
