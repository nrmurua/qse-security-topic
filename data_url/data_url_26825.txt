In the toolchain, when MKL is available and its ScaLAPACK is found, Netlib ScaLAPACK is not disabled and still gets installed. The script scripts/install_mkl.sh writes with_scalapack="__DONTUSE__" into build/setup_mkl but as far as I can tell, that does not do anything. Perhaps this is needed as an update to install/toolchain.conf instead?
Fixed via #1537.
