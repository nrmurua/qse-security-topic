A followup optimization takes the set of operations the point optimizer said to insert into the circuit, and optimizes just that one little block before inserting it. Undecided if it should then run over the whole circuit.
The rough order I have in mind is MergeInteractions -> MergeRotations -> (EjectZ, EjectXY) -> DropNegligible.
An alternative to doing it locally like this is to have a meta-optimization pass that repeatedly runs a sequence of optimizations on the whole circuit until nothing changes.
