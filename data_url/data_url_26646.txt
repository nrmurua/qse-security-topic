I tried to install elpa to my workstation with following command:
./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh --math-mode=mkl --mpi-mode=intelmpi --with-cmake=install --with-libxsmm=install --with-mkl=system --with-fftw=install --with-reflapack=no --with-scalapack=no --with-sirius=no --with-cosma=no --with-plumed --with-gsl=install --with-hdf5=install --with-superlu=install --with-libvori=no -j 4
and it failed with an error assosiated with ./build/elpa-2020.05.001/remove_xcompiler.
The make.log of elpa says:

Why dose it access nonexistent file/directory? And how to avoid it?
Please note that I did some trick to avoid a certain error which mentioned issue #1329 .
And also note that even editing 'remove_xcompiler' may not make sence since it will regenerate when installing, please.
I think the symlink trick did not work because the scripts are not ready.
Since this is still problem #1329, let's continue the discussion there.
