SUServo simulation (artiq/gateware/tests/suservo/test_servo.py) fails because async is a reserved keyword since python 3.7
Run test (artiq/gateware/tests/suservo/test_servo.py).
If you change async to anything else (e.g. async2) at these places the issue goes away:
Test runs.
Do you want to propose a change (submit a PR) renaming the clock domain? Should just be a case of find/replace.
Sure, I didn't do that because I wasn't sure what the proper name would be. For my use case I just renamed it to async2 but it won't fly in official repo. ;)
I just learned that single trailing underscore is used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keyword. Would that be okay?
Sure. We're doing that elsewhere as well (pow_ in suservo).
@pmldrmota The tests fail with your proposed change (I don't know when the problem was introduced...)
Probably the commit cea0a15 just now (changing the command from 0xe to 0x0e + DEFAULT_PROFILE)?

9eee0e5 updated the profile check in test (to 0x15). This fail should be gone now after applying your proposed changes.
