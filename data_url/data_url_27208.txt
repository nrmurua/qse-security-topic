The transpiler in Qiskit may output circuits with different depths after the transpilation pass. To get the best performance out of the transpiler it is recommended to transpile a circuit multiple times and pick the shortest circuit (for example in cx count)
Implemented and merged in this Pull Request
Note: This implementation still needs to be tested on real Hardware.
