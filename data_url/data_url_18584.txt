Given the ISA (which is reconstructed from a Aspen-4-5Q-E pyquil Device)
compilation of the program
produces
Note the two MEASUREs on 15 and the general misplace of those measures (MEASURE q can appear mid-program if none of the later instructions use q -- here that is not respected).
A foothold may be: compiler-hook is cavalier about mutating the input program.
For completeness' sake:
For fun you should also inspect the original program (after having run the compilation):
Fake news. The compiler just really likes qubit 15.
