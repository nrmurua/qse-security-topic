Using the CSwapGate and CCXGate in a subcircuit and converting it to qasm leads to an incorrect qasm file, where a unitary is never defined. Note that this happens only with optimization level 3 and not with others.
Run the following script:
Output qasm:
Read the qasm:
output:
The QASM exporter should create the definition for unitary139839047598864 as well.
This is similar to another issue (#7772) but in that case the problem was with CSwap and DCX, thus the error might be due to the interaction between the CSwap and other CX gates.
This is likely because UnitaryGate has some pretty questionable special handling to turn itself into OQ 2, including statefully producing a custom definition (the only gate in the circuit library to do so).  Probably this false definition is getting copied into an object that it should be in, or some other confusion like this, but neither the OQ 2 exporter nor UnitaryGate behave well and predictably, so it's pretty hard to know.
