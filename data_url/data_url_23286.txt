Hi All,
The AMI430_3D driver is not aware of changes to the individual axes when snapshotting, leading to inconsistent snapshots where the field recorded in the individual axis instruments in not the same as the field recorded in the 3D instrument.
The two values should be:
The cache in the AMI430_3D instrument means that the field_2 value still reads (0, 0, 0):
Use DelegateParameter's in the AMI430_3D driver such that the cache is kept up to date.
Ping @jenshnielsen and @sohailc (you originally wrote the driver right?)
Thansk @spauka That sounds like the correct solution to me. Would you have time to do a fix?
