We only use it in consistent_qasm.py and consistent_qasm_test.py and it causes warnings like #1885. Could we do without it?
I believe its optional already.  If Qiskit isn't installed, those tests don't run.
Ah okay. I've renamed the issue.
Qiskit 0.6 is in our dev requirements. Ply 3.4 is in our contrib requirements.
Related: see #1885 for details of the conflict in the versions of the ply package.
So many requirement.txts
Indeed :-)
