As the number of users on arm64-backed linux/macos grows, we need to start building arm64 wheels for our binary packages.
Unfortunately, CircleCI currently does not support custom docker images (e.g. manylinux2014_aarch64) on ARM hosts. Not even with on-prem runners configuration.
One option would be to use cibuildwheel, but that would require a significant change to our CircleCI flow. Some examples use a VM to emulate arm64 machine, but on CircleCI we would probably be able to use the new arm resource class running ubuntu.
