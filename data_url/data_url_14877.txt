If there is a comment as the last line of the OpenQasm 2, the from_qasm_str fails with the next error:
This was working in previous versions of Qiskit (can't confirm which version introduced the error).
The OpenQasm is valid, so it should convert it to OpenQasm 2.0.
No response
This will have been introduced by #9784 and consequently released in Terra 0.24 (so the version before the most recent one).  Thanks for the report - looks like the new parser has a slight bug where it doesn't chomp whitespace after skipping a comment correctly, though it's a fun edge case!
