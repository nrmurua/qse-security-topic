From version 0.3.4 to current 0.4.0 there have been some changes in the CMakeFiles. Even if I have muparserx installed in my system, the function add_muparserx_lib from cmake/compiler_utils.cmake will uncompress and get the source code from the git repo.
Only commeting uncompress_muparsersx_lib() and get_muparserx_source_code() I am able to use the locally installed library.
Maybe this is not annoying for regular users installing with pip, but when trying to generate a package for a distro is inconvenient since I want to avoid copying extra files (yes, all the .git folder get copied later if python setup.py install is executed).
Finding local library and not cloning a git repo (also related to #597)
Improve add_muparserx_lib function
