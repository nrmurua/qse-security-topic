Description
I use pysmt version 0.7.5. penaltymodel complains.
To Reproduce
Upgrade to pysmt > 0.7.0.
Expected behavior
I want penaltymodel to live happily with pysmt 0.7.5.
Environment:
Additional context
This came up while trying to troubleshoot a test for dwavebinarycsp, in which the stitch() call produced the error:
pysmt.exceptions.NoSolverAvailableError: No Solver is available
After a comprehensive package update, now the dwavebinarycsp test produces the error:
pkg_resources.VersionConflict: (PySMT 0.7.5 (/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages), Requirement.parse('pysmt==0.7.0'))
Hi @tsphillips ,
@randomir has made a PR to help address this issue, see pysmt/pysmt#517 but it will not be available until the next pysmt deploy.
We recommend using penaltymodel-mip unless you are using 32bit python and/or python3.4
As of version 1.0.0 we use SciPy rather than PySMIT so this is no longer relevant.
