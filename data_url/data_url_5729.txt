Currently, if I have something like job = sampler.run([qc] * 50, parameters), the only circuit I have here is transpiled 50 times despite it is the same circuit. If I re-use a sampler instance, the circuits I pass are also transpiled once again.
I suggest to introduce a cache of transpiled circuits at the primitive level. So, if the same circuit is re-used, then it is not transpiled, but a transpiled version of the circuit is passed down to a backed.
Here is a snippet:
And in sampler.py on the lines https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/main/qiskit_aer/primitives/sampler.py#L117-L119 the circuit is transpiled many times.
@ikkoham will resolve this issue. (I was not able to set him as an assignee to this issue.)
