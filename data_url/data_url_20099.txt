The original motivation for these (allowing easy swapping of which algorithm is used in the OQS-OpenSSL integration) is no longer needed since we have all algorithms now available in OQS-OpenSSL.
Some people use this to create a minimal build with just one algorithm (combined with the MINIMAL_BUILD flag).  While it's possible to do that with the existing CMake flags, it woudl require manually setting many of them to off.  So we should create a better set of flags for this.
So we should create a better set of flags for this.
Please check #1044 for a proposal for this (basically, passing a semicolon-delimited list of algorithms to enable -- all others will automatically be disabled).
Closed with #1044
