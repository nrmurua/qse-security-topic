Is there a reason this is a run time import?

Only because it's a bit of hack (qft shouldn't have to manage it's own parameter table). Looking now though, this could be avoided if we set inverted.data = [] instead of inverted._data = []. I'll take care of that.

Never mind, inverted.data = [] fails with AttributeError: can't set attribute. Maybe because BlueprintCircuit overrides the data property but not also the setter?

super()._invalidate()
self._data = []
should work I think, the blueprint circuit resets the parameter table upon _invalidate. (Then also the _invalidate method of QFT can be removed).
Actually, on a second look, the inverse method should probably be added to the BlueprintCircuit to do this inversion. Then inverse would return a BlueprintCircuit instead of a QuantumCircuit. But we can do this after the release, this is not crucial for the functionality.
