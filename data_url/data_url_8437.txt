I am trying to calculate the expectation value of Mx. It is the order parameter of a hamiltonian, and I want to calculate the phase transition of it later on. I used commend expect(Mx, H.groundstate() while I have input a hamiltonian.
Here is the code and I have error as the following:
H.groundstate()
Out[193]:

You should really read the documentation.  It will address all the issues you have posted.
I have read over the documentation, and I did not see why  H.groundstate() is not a  quantum objects or eseries... Could you direct me to the right place?
http://qutip.org/docs/latest/apidoc/classes.html?highlight=groundstate#qutip.Qobj.groundstate
I have read that, but as what the output from H.groundstate(), it is showing it's a quantum object. So I don't understand why the error occurs
There are two return values, as indicated.  Ground state energy and ground state itself.
Thank you so much. I want extract only the ground state eigenvector part which is the just one of the return values. I did not find a way to do that, what will you recommend doing? Thanks a lot!
H.groundstate()[1]
