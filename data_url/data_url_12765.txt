Contribution guide lists the types of things one could contribute, but doesn't go into details on the moving pieces that go into doing each of those things. It makes sense to add a bit more guidance on this:
@tcNickolas
I have a few suggestions based on my experience contributing  for whoever works on this Issue.
Tutorial vs Kata
I felt that the difference between a tutorial and a normal Kata should be present in the contributions guide. While writing a tutorial an author needs to take into account the prior information or content the reader has consumed as well as the fact the reader may be novice and hence certain explanations and tasks must be geared towards him even if they seem blindly obvious to the author.
Writing Workbooks
The references solutions are go-to sources for strategy/algorithms and code while writing Workbooks. However authors must also realize that they are free to contribute their own solutions as well. Sometimes, they may come up with a new solution which  can be included if its simpler/more concise/more readable or employs a markedly different strategy than the reference solution. This is subjective to a large extent but not entirely infrequent.
