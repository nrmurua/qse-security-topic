The depreciated methods of using gate specific functions are still working for rx, ry, rz
<kernel_name>.rz(<qubit_no>,<angle>)
However, the generic method, is compiling to a qasm with the angle value of 0 (w/o duration specified)
<kernel_name>.gate("rz",[<qubit no>], angle=<angle>)
@prince-ph0en1x the angle is the last argument and duration = 0 uses default value of duration. So you can add rotations by:
