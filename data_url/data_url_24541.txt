Looks easily adaptable. Some features are missing, but this probably is not a roadblocker. A lot of sympy's features is not used anyways. I propose defining a set of operations that is supported on any system so one can be sure that a pulse works independent of the used backend while still using sophisticated features if porability is no concern.
A problem could be the implementation of vector valued expressions. This is already hacky in sympy. If I see this correctly symengine only allows matricies there is symarray.
Will using symengine actually be faster?
