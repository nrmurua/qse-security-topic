It is undocumented, and unexpected, for initial_states to be required to be given in Ising/SPIN type only - independently of the BQM's type.
If undefined/None, random initial states are generated in Ising space, but initial states given are not converted to Ising. Since they are given via an array, their type is unknown, but automatic conversion can be done if they are given as a SampleSet (see #53).
