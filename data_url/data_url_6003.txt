Since switching to conan for the build system the simulator can no longer be built with GPU support on CUDA 10.1.
This is an issue with JSON library and is documented here: nlohmann/json#1773
We should be able to build with CUDA 10.1
We need to update the Conan script to use an older version of the JSON library.
