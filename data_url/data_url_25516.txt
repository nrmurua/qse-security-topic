Since covalent purge command deletes all covalent related configurations and databases, it must provide a prompt to the user to confirm the changes intended to be made by executing the command.
Secondly, similar to git covalent purge can be altered to expose a soft and hard mode where the database is only purged during the latter i.e.
covalent purge soft (removes only the configuration, leaves db intact)
covalent purge hard (remove the database)
Hard purging can potentially be further refined by backing up the database instead of complete deletion i.e.
covalent purge hard --backup (will create a db backup instead of a complete removal)
