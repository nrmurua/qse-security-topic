What versions of MISOC and MIGEN should I be using for the ARTIQ 2.3 build from source?
Some while back I was using tag/0.3 for both, but that no longer works. With those versions, I get the error:
Tried various version of MIGEN and was unable to get rid of this error.
I am building on a clean Ubuntu 16.04 VM so no install history. For reference, these are the package versions I am using in my install script:
If you install the artiq-dev package this will be handled automatically.
Alternatively, you can look at the artiq-dev conda build script to see what packages it installs.
raise ValueError("Cannot extract CSR name from code, need to specify.")
This looks like you're running Python 3.6, which is not supported. See #652.
Swapping to a python 3.5 environment works. Also switched to migen 0.4 to match artiq-dev. Unfortunately, it just gets me back to my original install problem before I inadvertently switched to 3.6 with an error trying to build libunwind. That's a separate issue. If I can't figure it out (will check on versions in artiq-dev), I will open another issue.
@cbje: I had not known that that package exists. I like it. It pretty much eliminates my whole install script (but would still like to get that working). Took a bit to work out how to use it (i.e. needing to separately clone artiq, where to point the path for llvm, and issue #537) but it got through to the Vivado step. I could not find a manual page for this, which would be useful as part of the install from source pages.
Thx all!
