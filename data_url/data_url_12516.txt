Python: 3.8
TFQ: 0.4.0
I was trying to see what kind of speed up I would get from using tfq.differentiators.Adjoint. The docstring example runs fine, but when I add more parameters to the circuit, I get the following error message
Code to reproduce:
I am having some trouble trying to debug this. Any suggestions?
I reproduced this error with this code in colab.  I find that if I replace ['alpha', 'beta'] with tf.constant(['alpha', 'beta']), the error goes away.  As you say, I also find the original code snippet in the Adjoint Diff docstring still works.  We should get to the bottom of this, but for now making sure all op inputs are tensors seems to fix it
This was actually an undocumented backwards breaking change in regular TensorFlow ( I spoke with an engineer about this when we first upgraded from 2.1.0 to 2.3.1.). Normally it would be fine to pass a python list of strings in, but since the change we should recommend/encourage users to pass in constant tensors. You can see in here when we did the upgrade that we also needed this change internally as well: https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/pull/340/files .
Let's convert this issue into: Differentiator docstrings do not convert to tensor for symbol_values and then we can PR a fix for everyone.
Changing to tf.constant did the trick. Thanks.
