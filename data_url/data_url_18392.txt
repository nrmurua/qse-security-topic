It takes nil to be a FORMAL whose name is nil. I think this would be a common error and should be eliminated.
I'm not sure I see why nil would be passed in in error. It does not seem to have any documented meaning.
I do not think it's great to rule out the symbol name "nil".
I suppose you could have a special rule that if you want that, you have to use :nil (nil in keyword package).
