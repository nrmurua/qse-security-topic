Hi,
We're currently working with @sebgrijalva on noise models related to
We're also adding a possibility to simulate a laser sequence several times and average the results, since noise parameters are different at each run, to better simulate experiments in the lab. You may also change several noise parameters, be it the Doppler shift standard deviation, false-positive (negative) probabilities, etc.
Solved with #197 and #199 .
