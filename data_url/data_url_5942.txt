"pip install qiskit" stops with error when it tries to install qiskit-aer.
I get an error message in the command window
The issue you're facing is that you are not running a 64bit version of python. There are no Aer binaries published on pypi for win32, only amd64: https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-aer/#files There are issues trying to get aer to build on win32, there is an open PR for adding support here: #925 but until that is merged and included in a release you will have issues trying to run with a 32bit version of Python.
In the meantime you can workaround this by just installing a 64bit version of python and using that.
Installed conda and python x64. Works like a charm here.
I think this one can be closed.
Lets leave it open until #925 and #950 merge which will add support for win32 and then start publish win32 binaries. This is actually fairly common issue that people hit, so it'll be good to both document the current win32 issues and track when they're fixed.
