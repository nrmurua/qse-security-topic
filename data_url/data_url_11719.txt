Can you please upload a sample code of Toffoli gate optimization?
Aqua has relative phase Toffoli gate implementation as a form of optimization (though the gates formerly implemented and used by Aqua here are being moved to Terra).  You can read more here about this gate here On the advantages of using relative phase Toffolis with an application to multiple control Toffoli optimization.
You can look here for a sample of their usage https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/0d12ea285f44bf34de734380e5ea88156e4068a0/qiskit/aqua/circuits/gates/multi_control_toffoli_gate.py#L32
