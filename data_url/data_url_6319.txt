Whoops! Today is the day travis-ci.org closes down all builds. However, aside from a brief interruption in service today, for our own failure to migrate sooner, I think we can likely just migrate today. I'll do so tonight.
I'm disabling the unit tests on CI, as we completely exceeded the credit balance. When the billing period cycles, we'll move onto build-only CI, for the time being.
The credits never refresh, for the free plan. We have migrated to a GitHub Action, and I'm testing LGTM.
