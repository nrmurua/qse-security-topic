Currently the qiskit.visualization directory contains pulse and pulse_v2 subdirectories. pulse is the legacy pulse drawer and was superseded by pulse_v2 a couple of years ago. Since pulse is no longer needed, it makes sense to remove the current pulse files and change pulse_v2 to pulse. The open question is how to do this. The pulse directory has 3 modules, none of which have gone through the full user deprecation process. These 3 modules and their functions and classes will need to be deprecated.
The next step would be to move these 3 modules to a stub directory, like pulse_legacy and leave pointers to them in the pulse/__init__ module. Then all the files in pulse_v2 can be moved to pulse, leaving appropriate stubs in pulse_v2 for deprecating things so that imports such as from visualization.qiskit.pulse_v2 import draw will still work through the deprecation process.
Main open questions are which functions and classes in pulse_v2 will need to be deprecated/stubbed to handle users calling these functions directly rather than through documented paths.
The old pulse module had mostly had its deprecation started in #5581, but it was missing some parts until the recent #9146.  Terra 0.23 will effectively start the clock properly, then we can look to move to the next stage of removal in 0.25, which will also let us begin the renaming of pulse_v2.
