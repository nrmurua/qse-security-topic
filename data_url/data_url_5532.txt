target.qargs of AerSimulator based on FakeVigo contains None.
output
qargs should consist of only tuples.
I'm not sure it's the issue of AerSimulator or FakeVigo.
Aer copies target from the backend given by from_backend and does not edit properties of target
As for BackendV1 based backends, Aer create target by using convert_to_target from the configurations and properties of input backend.
Thanks. I made an issue for Qiskit Qiskit/qiskit#11322
