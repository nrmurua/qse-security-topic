As pointed out by @theRoughCode in #44, the np.testing.array_equal pattern should be preferred over the assertEqual pattern in the unit testing code. The reason for this preference is that the former provides more helpful testing data from failed instances in comparison with the latter. This task will involve finding instances of assertEqual and altering those to np.testing.array_equal where appropriate.
Another thing to consider when fixing this is that this line might not be testing what was intended:
what would end up here is:
Instead, what we want might be something like this:
However, I tried this but the "less than or equal to" check failed because res was slightly greater than expected:
@vprusso Should we be truncating the values to a certain decimal place and then performing this check or is this not supposed to happen?
