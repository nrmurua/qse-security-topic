When using a slurm executor, the generated slurm-dispatchId.sh file always includes lines for conda although one has specified conda_env=None.
Have a look at the code of slurm.py:
lines 395 and 396:
This is where the slurm-.sh script is created. Then I looked at the 'slurm_conda' string in line 337-346:
It seems that the conda lines are generated independent of 'conda_env_str' having the value "". I think that if 'conda_env_str = ""' the conda lines should not be generated.
When conda_env=None or conda_env="" no lines related to conda environment should be generated in the slurm-dispatchid.sh scripts.
No response
@JackSleuters: Could you try it with pip install --pre covalent-slurm-plugin to install the v0.16.0 pre-release? It's likely that my PR here AgnostiqHQ/covalent-slurm-plugin#61 fixed the issue, which was merged after the 0.12.1 release. If you still get the error, let me know and I can debug.
Tagging @wjcunningham7: if this does fix the issue, it's probably worth minting a new "regular" release to avoid confusion.
@JackSleuters: I haven't seen that error before. Could you try pip install aiohttp==3.8.1 and see if you still get a build error?
@santoshkumarradha: Looks like this can be closed.
Thanks for this update @arosen93  ! üôè , closing for now as the --pre install seems to be a different issue. The develop does seem to have conda check.
