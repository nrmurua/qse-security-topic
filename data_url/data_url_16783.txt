When computing gradients of a circuit, the cost is proportional to the number of parameterized gates in the circuit. The current implementation of RXXGate(theta) uses the parameter theta in three gates in its definition, however we can reduce this to one.
This other implementation changes the global phase of the RXX, but: the existing implementation also contains a global phase.
Therefore we could change the 3-parameter up-to-global-phase implementation to a 1-parameter up-to-global-phase implementation.
Comparison of the two implementations:
The current implementation has a global phase of exp(iθ/2) while the proposed one has one of exp(-iθ/2).
I verified in Mathematica and new def looks correct. I would make one additional change:
Then the final matrix would be correct including phase if the Rz matrix was used (ignoring Rz unrolling to U1 with incorrect phase which will be fixed eventually)
Agreed, also it makes the circuit diagram more intuitive seeing Rz instead of U1. I'll open a PR.
In the same PR you could also change the def of the RZZ gate to use Rz instead of U1 for the same reason. it should be:
Closed by #3913.
