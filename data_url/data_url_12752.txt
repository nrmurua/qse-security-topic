Now that we have switched to using @Test attribute (#478), we are not using _Test suffix in operation names to identify tests any longer. We should be able to remove that suffix from all Q# tests.
Each test is defined in Tests.qs file of the corresponding kata/tutorial, and mentioned in the %kata cells of the Jupyter notebook frontend of the kata and the matching workbook, if it exists, so the changes should modify these files simultaneously.
