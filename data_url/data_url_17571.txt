The introduced copy method did not update the circuit name of the copy.
Here is the script
The res_qc and res_qc2 are the same since the get_statevector method retrieves results by circuit name.
The copied circuit should have a new name.
Based on the constructor to create a new name.
If it is okay, I can issue an PR to fix it. Thanks.
Hmm... This bring the issue of the meaning of copy. What would you think about something like qc2 = qc.copy(name='aNewName')?
@chunfuchen also you can just retrieve result by index (of your execution list):
Maybe I misunderstand the intention to have the copy method but I think the above script would be used if users want to save the line to create the same circuit and then add more gates on top of that.
I always used qc2 = qc + QuantumCircuit() to create another circuit with the same registers and gates but with different name.
@ajavadia yes, your suggestion works.
I can still use my old way to get a circuit whose registers and gates are identical to the other one.
The copy method was based on the request in #1688, and so was simply meant to be a deep copy of the circuit which suggests the name should be maintained. I think an approach such as the one @1ucian0 suggested could be beneficial though.
Is there a use case for coping with a new name? CC @nonhermitian, as the #1688 submitter. Otherwise, we can close this as wont fix
I personally use the copy for creating circuits with and without measurements. I do not think that I have ever used the curcuit name as an index.
In that case, I would go with the optional parameter with the name, defaulting in the same name as source circuit. Agreed?
I think it is good to have that. @1ucian0
