Trying to convert a circuit with a control flow operation in it to an instruction using qiskit.converters.circuit_to_instruction fails while processing the control flow condition. It is treating it like a c_if legacy style condition even for control flow ops and this causes it to fail with a NotImplementedError because the function is trying to call c_if.
We either should have a descriptive error saying we can't nest control flow operations in an instruction or update the .condition handling in circuit_to_instruction to understand a control flow operation.
No response
This needs to be an error in practice; there's no way to communicate the creg / variable requirements of an Instruction's inner definition up to the main circuit, so allowing arbitrary control-flow within a semi-opaque instruction wouldn't work.
Totally agree that the error message should be way better.
Really, circuit_to_instruction shouldn't even allow c_if in it - in practice, that hasn't ever worked fully correctly when registers are involved.
