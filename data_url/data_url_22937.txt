Hi,
I want to use the lockbox module to do a PDH locking. I would like to ask some simple questions about the lockbox software widget since I haven't found much documentation yet.
Update:
I have performed some successful lockings yesterday. It turns out to be some wrong PID coefficients. Also, I have figured out the first question. Sorry that I ignored the status bar.
However, I’m still curious about the second question. Does the program fit the signal with expected function?
P.S. Thank you for your amazing software and hardware design, saving us lots of efforts.

Hi,
I am also having trouble getting a PDH lock to work. I can see the carrier and sidebands on the scope widget, but I don't understand how to get the lockbox widget to work. I've tried with both the PDHinterferomter and the FabryPerot presets. I would expect at some point to have an error signal with three zero-crossings corresponding to the derivative of the carrier and two sidebands. Has anyone successfully done a PDH lock and do you have any pointers? I have gone though the documentation and the YouTube video.
Thanks.
