There's some very strange behavior happening whenever random_circuit with conditional=True is called, as it will add several measure gates to the circuit after all the operations are done.
You can replicate the issue with the following code snippet:
Your output should look somewhat like this:

A circuit that looks like this:

When you set conditional=True, #10401 made it so that you're guaranteed to have measurements right before the conditional (so there's a chance that the conditional can actually be entered).  Given that, I think the behaviour you're seeing is intended - the measurements aren't actually at the end, they all come before a conditional.
Oh that makes more sense. I was very confused about the new behavior. Thank you for explaining it.
