Quake code in which a kernel is called by another kernel can't be translated to OpenQASM.
This is due to two reasons:
Compile the following code using nvq++ kernel.ccp:
The result is the following MLIR code:
When the file is translated using cudaq-translate --convert-to=openqasm kernel.qke, the output is:
The MLIR code should be successfully translated to:
Or to an equivalent OpenQASM code.

@orclassiq Do you care if the function is inlined?

I think it would be more beneficial if the function isn't inlined. Converting function calls preserves higher-level constructs within the algorithm and the intent of the algorithm designer.
