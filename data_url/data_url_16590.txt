âœ… PR #4614 Seems to be stalled which has also stalled this issue. I am not sure if this was ever implemented in any of the other PRs.
Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
Closing for the same reason as #4417 - this is somewhat stale now, and we don't even use jupyter-execute any more.  We've softly been moving in favour of hardcoding output and not having the doctest validation (though that is under consideration in #7661), because of the on-going problems with jupyter-execute that eventually caused us to abandon it.
That's not to say we don't want to improve our docs, just that in the current set-up, this particular page doesn't need updating in the manner suggested.
