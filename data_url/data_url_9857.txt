Description
If integers have an upper_bound of 1, an error is raised, but the error message says 1 is actually allowed.
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
Either change the message to "larger equal than 2" or "larger than 1". Alternatively, upper bound of 1 can directly return a binary variable.
Fixed by 9fba14a which I accidentally pushed directly to main ðŸ˜³
