the groveler is used twice. that means more compilation noise from the C compiler. Just do it once (or eliminate it?).
At least the constant MAP_FAILED is not present in the SB-POSIX package, so in principle it doesn't seem like eliminating the grovelling step entirely is feasible. However, it should be possible to fuse src/grovel-shared-memory.lisp with src/grovel-system-constants.lisp.
Constants like O_CREAT, etc. are surely provided by the compiler (i.e., sb-posix:o-creat) and could be defined using read-time conditionals like (defconstant $o-creat #+sbcl sb-posix:o-creat ...)
