In the run() method of the Simulation() class there's an inconsistent type annotation for the options passed to the QuTiP solver (see line). It says that the type should be a qutip.solver.Options object, but the code looks like it's treated as a dictionary, with the key-value pairs being splatted into the Options object when it's generated a few lines later.
No matter how I try, I cannot seem to get it to accept a QuTiP Options object, but things are fine with a regular dict.
Hi @dehond , you're right... It expects the arguments to Options, not an Options instance.
Thanks for bringing this up, it should be very simple to fix. Would you like to do it or should we go ahead and do it ourselves?
Hi @HGSilveri, I'd be happy to file a pull request!
Awesome, @dehond, the issue is yours!
