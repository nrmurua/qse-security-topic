Add a pershot snapshot that only records select entries of a statevector rather than the entire statevector. This can be useful for debugging and verifying computations on large numbers of qubits.
In Qiskit the snapshot should be specified by a list of vector positions as either integers or bitstrings, in qobj we can pass the params as a list of integers. The output should be a complex numpy array of those vector amplitudes
eg input -> idx = [i0, i1, ...], output -> np.array([statevec[idx[0]], statevec[idx[1]], ...])
