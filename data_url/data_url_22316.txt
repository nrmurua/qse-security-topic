On artiq 1.1, linux
Trying to call self.mutate_dataset() from within a subcomponent that derives from HasEnvironment fails with the following exception:
File "artiq/language/environment.py", line 303, in mutate_dataset
ValueError:  Dataset manager is not present.
I've stepped through with pdb and there seems to be an additional call to mutate_datatset() on the subcomponent object after the first call has correctly propagated up to the parent experiment. Somehow the subcomponent object has no parent in that final call and you get the "Dataset manager not present" exception.  I just don't see where the additional call is coming from or why self.__parent would ever be None
The experiment I'm running is
FWIW, if I either call self.subcomponent.mutate() inside the analyze method or pass the DatasetManager object directly to the subcomponent constructor everything works fine.
