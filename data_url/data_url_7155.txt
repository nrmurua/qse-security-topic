Is it possible to adapt this simulator to support more than 22 qbits?
The main problem with more than 22 qbits is the limitation of WebGL in supporting double floating point operations, or bitwise operations, so we can address larger textures. WebGL 2 might help, but it will take a while for it to have strong support.
