schedule_circuit fails to produce a Schedule when providing a (based on my understanding) valid QuantumCircuit including measurement.
I should be able to make a Schedule using schedule_circ with a QuantumCircuit that has a measurement operation. The backend (here, Armonk) has support for measurement operations.
Though perhaps I'm doing something wrong in the setup here, if that's the case I'd be interested in what I'm doing wrong.
I think assert_has fails because for some reason the set of qubits for the 'measure' instruction is (0,0) instead of just 0.  https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/stable/0.11/qiskit/pulse/instruction_schedule_map.py#L111
My best guess would be that this should involve a loop over the result of _to_tuple(qubits) instead? But that doesn't explain why this only happens when you include the qc.measure(q,c) line.
At a quick glance, your meas map is structured incorrectly. It should be meas_map = [[0]] as there is only a single qubit and its always measured on its own ðŸ˜„. After changing this the code above works.
Feel free to reopen if this does not fix your issue.
