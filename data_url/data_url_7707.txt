In the case where Tr(A) is known exactly, for example 1 for density operators, the approx_spectral methods could improve their accuracy by scaling each estimate using vector |phi> by that samples estimate of the identity (i.e. standard trace). The errors in each estimate are correlated and cancel  to an extent.
