When building on master with kex_code_mcbits enabled, the static library libmcbits.a appears to be empty. To be precise, the object files inside the static library contain no references to the functions declared in kex_code_mcbits.h.
Build steps:
Suspicious or irregular output from build:
config.log
Trying to compile a C source file against liboqs fails, as the liboqs static library wasn't created. Moreover, libmcbits appears to be empty.
As you can see in the last section, nm produces no output on the mcbits object files. Whereas for a different algorithm e.g. new_hope:
After disabling all algorithms except kex-code-mcbits and rerunning make clean and make, liboqs was created. However, compiling against libmcbits produces this error:
McBits no longer in library.
