Running the delay noise pass (or fake backend) on a non-scheduled circuit with a delay gate will apply delay noise assuming the delay duration is in dt units, even if it is defined in other units.
The follow example illustrates this descrepency

The blue and orange curves should look the same in the above plot.
The RelaxationNoisePass should check the units of the the gate when accessing its duration. This also means the dt parameter of the pass init function could be made optional and would then raise an exception if it was not provided and a dt unit duration gate is attempted to run.
