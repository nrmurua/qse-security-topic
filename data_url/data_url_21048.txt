QRL miner seems to have been mining an alternative chain. Found
many solutions for blocks that the main chain had already mined earlier.
Miner skips recent blocks received from other nodes as beyond lead limit. Full log attached
@cyyber I think you might want to have a look at this.
NB versions of relevant other packages:
Normally this message means that the node has received a block with an index that is too high for the current blockchain. It could be a problem or not.
We need to analyse the log files.
the problem from a mining perspective is that the miner seems to be unable to catch up with the main chain (if the chain in blockexplorer actually is the main chain).
Yes, I understood that and it is why I am giving priority to this issue. We will write back soon.
Thanks a lot for your support / feedback
@baudje This is an expected behavior.
From the log its clear, your node was downloading block #19592
and at that same time, all the synced nodes, were mining around block number #23223. We have a filter, that a node will not accept any future block which is beyond the range of current chain height + 125
so your node height was 19591+125 = 19716
So your node will reject all blocks above the block number 19716
Moreover, it doesn't mean as it will keep downloading blocks, it will not sync above that. Looking to the log, your node successfully synced.
