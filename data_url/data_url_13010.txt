Hi,
It appears that the open source license meta data is missing from pypi. This is causing some package managers to fail when checking for the license.
Thanks
Thanks for pointing this out. This will be fixed in the next update coming shortly.
Can you confirm that this is fixed in the 1.0.2 release?
