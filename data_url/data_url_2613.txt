It won't work as well as on linux, but it should be possible to make the tests pass.
I'm using WSL on Windows, and would recommend anyone using this on Windows to do so. I followed the Linux directions and once git and python were installed everything worked smoothly. (I'm new to Python, so sorting out py2/py3 and pip and mkvirtualenvwrapper took some time, but I imagine most users will be familiar with Python ecosystem already).
Actually I don't know what else there is to do here. At least on Windows the documentation is fine. @balopat should this be closed?
There are instructions on how to install with mac and windows here:

I am closing this.  If people have specific issues on installing on these platforms, they can open a new bug about the problem(s) they encountered.
