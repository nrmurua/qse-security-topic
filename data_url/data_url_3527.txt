@kylegulshen was doing something like:
which sortof works. However, when iterating over ro which is a MemoryReference, python will happily iterate forever since __getitem__ is defined but __len__ isn't. Probably should harden this
+1 on this use. @notmgsk It looks like the fix in #819 will cause the right IndexError to be thrown. Will it also allow one to loop over MemoryReferences?
@willzeng yeah, it doesn't change current behaviour. You can still iterate, but an error is thrown where appropriate.
