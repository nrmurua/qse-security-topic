Please be as descriptive as possible, including what is expected, why is this feature needed, what is the objective, etc.
To drag, drop and resize the components on the board using a button on the toolbar. It is expected to enhance the usability of the GUI. The objective will remain to simplify adding of the components. A starred line could be added around the component which could flip and resize the component.
--> Easier to change the design
--> No more filling out the sizes manually
Please add touch support also so that I can use my pen to place components wherever I want them to be in the space.
