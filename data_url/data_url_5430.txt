Hi I have run the following code in Jupyter Notebook:
import numpy as np
import qflexcirq
import qflex
options = {
   'circuit_filename': 'sycamore_53_6_0.txt',
    'ordering_filename': 'sycamore_53.txt',
    'grid_filename': 'sycamore_53_grid.txt',
    'final_state': "10001111001110000101000001011011001111010100000100000"
}
print(qflex.simulate(options))

Hi @deaxlf,
Since the two states in question only differ in the first six bits, I suspect what happened here is that qFlex overrode your initial bits with the terminal cut values in the ordering file:

To get the state you're looking for, you'll need to set these cut values to match the first six bits of your intended final state:
Why this behaves this way: in many simulations, the last few qubits (the so-called "final region") can be iterated over to generate multiple amplitudes at once, with a negligible increase in cost. If you change the cut values to (0, 1), qFlex will generate amplitudes for all possible values of the first six bits
@95-martin-orion It works! Thank you!
