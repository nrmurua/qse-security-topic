BasicAerJob automatically chooses ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor depend on sys.platform.

This default behavior is good.
But, on my linux environment, I cannot use ProcessPoolExecutor(to say precisely multiprocessing).
So I want the option to choose ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor.
All platforms will use threadpool soon.
Hi @nonhermitian !
Thank you for your response.
This problem will be solved soon!
I'm closing this as since the last release, 0.17.0, basicaer doesn't use an async future anymore and executes jobs synchronously. So a user who wants to run the job async will have to do this themselves (and therefore choose how they want to do that). But, please feel free to reopen this if there is more to discuss or do here.
