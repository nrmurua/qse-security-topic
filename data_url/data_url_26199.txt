This feature would allow the user to generate a set of d-dimensional mutually unbiased bases. Note that this procedure only works when the dimension "d" is prime (otherwise, it is unknown how to generate such a set in general).
In order to generate such a set, we will require a helper function to determine if a given integer is a prime power:
Putting the above together, we can write our function:
While most of the above does the heavy lifting, we still require unit tests and proper documentation.
