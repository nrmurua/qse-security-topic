From #407
Now that we're on LLVM 3.8 we can use the LLVM linker, and rip out a whole bunch of cruft at the same time as making it all faster.
That will also:
Doesn't have the C API yet. However we can write one and submit it upstream, I know upstream will welcome it.
LLD is production-ready since LLVM 7.0. https://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-announce/2018-September/000080.html
This is definitely an interesting direction (shipping linker plugins for LTO is a bit of a headache otherwise), but, with sample size 1, doesn't currently seem to be critical for speed: #1380
Done on all platforms since RISC-V.
