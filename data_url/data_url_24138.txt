It appears that size_x should be ‘9mm’ in the two notebooks.  The notebook in tut directory needs to be run and saved.

and
the cell has to be updated here.

Hi, I would like to work on this issue.
Is this the intended change ?

@Arch0125 , yes.  Please do follow the rest of the work needed to confirm nothing else has been affected.
Yes I will start working on it.
The cell link (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metal/blob/main/tutorials/2%20From%20components%2[…]chip%20design/2.21%20Design%20a%204%20qubit%20full%20chip.ipynb) is throwing server error 500 maybe because the qiskit-metal/blob directory is non-existent

This should be similar to the notebook in the doc/tut path.  The idea is that all the tutorial notebooks are in
/tutorial directory have been run so the users can see the expected output.  Significant tutorials are in the doc/tut directories.  The idea is to confirm the tutorial notebook in /tutorial directory matches the notebook in /docs/tut.  If they are off, they need to be updated to similar.
The notebooks in /tutorial  represent the complete set of tutorials.  The notebooks in /tutorial directory are typically not execute.
Okay I got the idea. Thanks!
I will finalise the changes today itself
