Hello,
We are two french student working on a project implementing a Raspberry pi 4 and a Red Pitaya (used as a simple acquisition card).
We are currently sturggling on this installation of pyrpl on our raspberry. We keep getting error about a wrong version of either python, pyqt5 and/or pyqtgraph.
Could you maybe help us find the right combination of version of theses software in order to make it work ?
Also, we'll later use the module PyMoDaq to interface this aquisition, and it needs python 3.7 or more.
Thank a lot for your help.
Have a nice day.
Hi,
First of all, for python 3, I recommend to use the branch python3-only. It will soon be merged into master but it is not done yet I think.
