The README page mentions the slack channel https://qiskit.slack.com, but does not provide an actual invitation link to join. This turns out to be a hard gem to find on the internet, as invitation links eventually expire. All of the following blog posts contain expired Slack invitation links:

Hi @tbabej!
qiskit.org should always have a valid invitation link.
I think we might want to link to the front-page in future articles, instead of just putting a link in there.
Thanks for reporting!
Thanks for pointing that out @atilag !
However, the link on the qiskit.org is inactive too, unfortunately.
Confirmed. I created Qiskit/qiskit.org#56 for updating the web. This issue for updating the documentation.
The link to the invitation without expiration is:
https://join.slack.com/t/qiskit/shared_invite/enQtNDc2NjUzMjE4Mzc0LTMwZmE0YTM4ZThiNGJmODkzN2Y2NTNlMDIwYWNjYzA2ZmM1YTRlZGQ3OGM0NjcwMjZkZGE0MTA4MGQ1ZTVmYzk
Qiskit/qiskit.org#57 has been merged. Closing this issue.
Thanks @tbabej and @1ucian0 !
Re-opeining, so the link in the README file of the repo is also updated.
fixed in pending PR: 509312d

Seems like the link is dead again :(
Do we have an active link to join the channel?
This one should be always updated

Hi, the links I've found are expired as well, would you provide a valid one?
@1ucian0 slack link is dead again

Thanks @1ucian0 its working
Hi, do you guys have a valid invitation link?
Hi, the link seems to be dead again (on all platforms). Can this be fixed? Thanks!
This is fixed. See this link: https://ibm.co/joinqiskitslack
Thanks. It is working now!
None of these links are working anymore :(
Can we please get an updated link? The invite link in the Qiskit event email that just went out also has a dead invite.
Is https://ibm.co/joinqiskitslack working again?  I believe @lerongil just refreshed its sign-up limit a few days ago.
(There's an unfortunate limit from Slack itself that causes the link to die after some number of registrations have occurred through it, and we have to generate a new invitation.)
Perfect thanks it's working now, i'm in!
Is there a new invitation link here that I can use? They all seem to have expired again.
@lerongil can you help me?
In the Qiskit Advocate 2022 form they provide a link to have an slack but is dead. Can somebody help a bit on this?
The links should have been refreshed again.  We're still unfortunately limited by Slack, which deactivates a link once 100 people have used it to sign up.  Please keep commenting here if the links die again, and we'll get them refreshed.
This one should be always updated https://ibm.co/joinqiskitslack
This link worked for me. Thank you!!
Hi.! The link is down. Could it please be refreshed? Thanks! @jakelishman @lerongil
This one should be always updated
https://ibm.co/joinqiskitslack

Hi, can you refresh the link once again? @jakelishman @lerongil
Thanks
Can you please refresh the link once again again?
Many thanks.
Sorry for the delay - should be updated again now.
For future reference, we have switched the link, please use https://qisk.it/join-slack in the future.

Not working @HuangJunye
@Shurtu-gal: I've just updated it, thanks.  It could take up to a couple of hours to propagate - let us know if it doesn't work after that.
Yeah, it's working now. Thanks.
