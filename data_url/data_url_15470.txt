In the current specification of SamplerResult and EstimatorResult there is no unified way of retrieving the the total number of experiments that are comprised within one result object. It would be great to add a property result.num_experiments that would retrieve it.
Additionally, when one of these objects is instantiated, no checks are performed to verify that the number of experiments is consistent across all data fields. This should be performed as well.
