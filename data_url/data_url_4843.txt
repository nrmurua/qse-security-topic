Separate the current tutorial into two files.
Increase the accessibility to both beginners and experienced developers.
difficulty: not much
for the real financial data, you can use this package as data fetcher if you like: https://github.com/refraction-ray/xalpha. My concern is: the two notebooks, and the first one with qaoa tutorials will have too much overlap and replicated code (ie. the users may read several tutorials with very similar topics and implementations), what is the motivation behind such a tutorial splitting?
I personally think the portfolio is a more popular keyword (searched more than QUBO) and it is now buried in the QUBO part. In the list of tutorials, there is no "portfolio". Even if someone knows that the portfolio optimization is in this page it is still difficult to find the correct part.
I agree there might be too much QAOA if I follow this proposal. Maybe I could set the name as "solving portfolio optimization with QAOA" and then only introduce the general case of QUBO and portfolio optimization.
Agreed. Just change the title is better: Solving portfolio optimization as QUBO problem with QAOA
Finished
