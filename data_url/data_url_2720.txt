There are an increasing number of
isinstance(op, GateOperation) and isinstance(op.gate, GateClass)
which could be replaced by a nice helper.
One problem with this is that mypy looks for isinstance(op, GateOperation) to allow things like op.gate afterwards.  Kind of annoying looking to see if I can find a workaround.
op_gate_of_type can help here, we should likely make a pass at using it.
#1567 and related fix this.
