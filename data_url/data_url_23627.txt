When using plot_by_id a non-descriptive error is raised when identical setpoints are provided. Although it is stupid to try to plot something as a function of [1, 1, 1] and [0, 0, 0], we should handle that stupidity properly. And a single point in 2D space ought to work.
plot_by_id gives a warning that the data are not visualisable, but no exception is raised (or what? Should this be an exception?). Or maybe fall back to a scatter plot with all points on top of each other?
The following non-descript traceback:
Line plots with identical setpoints should probably behave the same way as whatever way we decide 2D plots to behave. Currently a line plot with identical setpoints just makes an empty plot with no warning or error.
