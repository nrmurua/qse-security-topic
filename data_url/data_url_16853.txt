The new ibmq_armonk device only supports meas_levels=[1,2]. An optional validation error should be raised if a user tries to submit a meas_level=1 job. This is related to #3606.
Hi @taalexander , I would like to have a look at this.
Should I (just) add a validation error to this, similar to #3606?
I see that #3606 also includes a test, but I don't know if that's necessary for this?
Thank you @eembees! I think you have the right idea @eembees. A test would be nice to verify this is working you could just use an empty schedule pulse.Schedule() and add it to test.python.compiler.test_assembler.
I implemented a basic fix, but I have some clarifying questions I want to have cleared up pre-PR:
@taalexander tagging you so you will see it.
Thanks again for your patience, and welcome to our Terra community! ðŸŽ‰
