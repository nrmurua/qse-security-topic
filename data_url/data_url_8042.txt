The function orbital is not tested and there seems to have an error in the spherical harmonics computation.
Adding a test and fixing any error, possibly using scipy.special.sph_harm, would be helpful.
Hello Eric,
I could have a look at it and add a test with the scipy.special.sph_harm .
Could you explain in more detail what errors you got?
Hi Anto,
Could you please leave the issue for a GSoC candidate.
There are no error raised but looking are the equations, something looks wrong. For example:
For positive m: SPlm[1], but the equivalent term for negative values: SPlm[abs(m)].
So when adding the tests, I expect that some fixes will be needed.
OK, i will leave this issue for the GSoC.
I guess it is my turn then :)
I looked at the orbital function and compared it  to the scipy implementation of sph_harm and the results don't seem to agree. There is one detail I need for clarification: The orbital function uses ketstates as input. Which component of the ket state should refer to which configuration of m?
For example, if I pass basis(3,0) as argument is the corresponding setting l = 1, m = -1 or l = 1, m = 0 or l = 1, m = 1?
I am not sure what the desired assignment  is. For me it makes sense to start with the smallest m (in the example m=-1).
Thank you for taking this issue.
The contribution to the phase is np.exp(1.0j * 1 * phi), ignoring the m and it's not documented. So I guess all ket are m = 1...
Since it's wrong and not documented, you are free to choose which ever way you prefer. But please update the docstring so that is is clear.
