The download of ELPA in the toolchain fails, at least on my Ubuntu 18.04.2. The reason is certificate verification:
As per the error message, adding --no-check-certificate helps. Could that be added to the toolchain at least as an option, given that checksums are calculated anyway?
Transport security is not the same as data integrity, therefore rather not.
You can replace the url in install_elpa.sh with our mirror as part of your #428.
Fix via 2c11076.
