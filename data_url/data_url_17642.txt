If users upgrade qiskit 0.6.* to 0.7 by pip install -U qiskit, some mandatory files in the qiskit directory (site-packages/qiskit) will be removed while upgrading. It causes unintentional errors like #1582. Such users cannot use qiskit without any workaround.
The main cause is pip install -U qiskit. It installs modules as follows.
The file list of site-packages/qiskit when upgrading 0.6 to 0.7 is as follows.
The file list of site-packages/qiskit when clean installing 0.7 is as follow.
There are missing files such as __init__.py when upgrading 0.6 to 0.7. The reason is as follows.
I recommend to write a document how to upgrade from qiskit==0.6.* to qiskit==0.7. This behavior of upgrading qiskit is unpredictable for users.
Users need to reinstall qiskit-terra to deal with this issue. Workarounds are as follows.

Note that reinstalling only qiskit does not work because some files in qiskit-terra are still missing.
Thanks @t-imamichi  for reporting - it seems indeed that in some case the order of uninstalling and installing qiskit-terra is not correct, rippling in the issue you are experiencing. Indeed, some documentation would help (maybe at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit, as it already has a 0.6 to 0.7 stub) - in the meantime, let's leave the issue open during these holiday-ish days in case anyone experiences the same.
Hi @t-imamichi, thank you for pointing this out and also helping with documentation in
https://github.com/t-imamichi/qiskit-utility/wiki/Unofficial-installation-guide-of-qiskit.
Could you please make a PR for documentation that includes this info? Probably in the global Qiskit repository would be the best (and linking to it in Terra). Because your notes are related to pip install qiskit, and also contains some information about aqua.
Thanks.
Perhaps we can modify the qiskit metapackage to make it work and update it to 0.7.1. I've open an issue there #27.
@ajavadia Yes. I try to merge my documentation into the global one and make a PR.
@delapuente Good news! I hope 0.7.1 resolves this issue.
This is being tracked in the meta repo: #27
I had the same issue while installing qiskit, "init.py" was missing with several other. I used the workaround and it fixed the issue.  Thanks for sharing it.
