It appears that the qvm on QCS has a bug when I run a parameterized circuit with no of parameters more than the no of qubits. I do not encounter this issue with my local qvm.
For example, the following code returns an error msg: 'QVMError: The index 2 of memory "ro" is supposed to be within the interval [0, 2)."
If I reduce the no of parameters to 2, the following code runs without issue on QCS.
Hello! There is no relationship between the number of qubits and the amount of memory. This was (of all things) a weird processing bug. It should be fixed in the next release. I'll keep this ticket open until you see it fixed.
Thanks for taking time to report it!
Thanks for the quick reply. Looking forward to the next release :)
A quick question: do you know whether I will encounter this bug if I run the code on the quantum device but not the simulator?
You will not. This is a bug in the simulator.
The bug is fixed. Thanks a lot!
