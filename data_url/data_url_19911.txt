A few more potentially non-constant-time divisions have been identified in Kyber:
pq-crystals/kyber@272125f
In order to resolve this, I think we'd need to do the following two things:
Does that seem right, @SWilson4 and @praveksharma ?
@baentsch What additional commit needs to be cherry-picked over to the dev-092 branch?

See #1647 (comment). Looks like my thinking was wrong, not a commit missing. Go ahead with 0.9.2 and we'll decide separately whether or not it warrants an oqsprovider release (right now I tend to think it doesn't: The question basically is whether we provide oqsprovider executables containing 0.9.2 (via CI&release) or whether we let people build them themselves (i.e., not do an oqsprovider release for this).

Thanks Michael. Okay, no cherry-picking the HQC commit over to 0.9.2.

Are we providing executables based on 0.9.0?  Because this is a security release, I would want to discourage people from using 0.9.0, so would replace anything we're providing based on 0.9.0.

Seems right to me. What would you like me (and/or @praveksharma) to take on? I'm happy to help with any stage of the release process but don't want to duplicate anything you might already have in the pipeline.

I haven't started on any of these, so if you want to do either/both, please go ahead.
