The notebook says:
You can either call print() on the circuit, or call the draw() method on the object. This will render a ASCII art version of the circuit diagram. [snip] There are two alternative output renderers for the quantum circuit. One uses matplotlib, and the other uses LaTeX, which leverages the qcircuit package. These can be specified by using mpl and latex values for the output kwarg on the draw() method. [snip] 'text'(the default) returns a TextDrawer object...
However, the call to circuit.draw() with no parameters actually draws a matplotlib figure. It seems that at some point, the default was changed from text to mpl. The notebook should be updated to reflect this.
The default is still text unless otherwise set in the qiskit configrc file. It is set to mpl by defult using this file on the IQX
Ah, okay. In that case, a note should probably be added just above or below the circuit.draw() call to make this less confusing.
(The Qiskit Notebooks in the IBM Q Experience likewise seem to be set to output mpl without having to change anything, hence why I thought it was the default.)
I agree that this is confusing, but it is likely something to address in the Qiskit docs (it seems not to be there) and link to it there.
Closing as the main Qiskit docs is the place to do this.  Will make an issue there.
