Should load the data

Hey @pyquest1 , a clarification question:
Hi Astafan8
Not sure why you are saying this is legacy?
Saving was done using
What would load it since qcodes is what saved it?
@pyquest1 Note where you are importing  import_dat_file from (qcodes.dataset.legacy_import import)
As indicated from the location this is imported from it is indended to load legacy data (written with the qcodes loop as in these
examples https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/index.html#legacy-examples).
Please see here for instance of how to load a dataset from the
https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/DataSet/Performing-measurements-using-qcodes-parameters-and-dataset.html#Reloading-datasets for how to load data written as in your example.
Note that the file that you are storing data in is a sqlite database and not an hdf5 file. I strongly recommend that you give it an extension that reflects this (so .db rather than .hdf5)
Hi Jens,
Sorry, I didn't notice the legacy issue. I have read the documentation but it is long.  As a result I have just started searching for what I need in the documentation or just directly reading the github files.
I thought qcodes supported hdf5 for containing the "database"?  I could swear I read that in the documentation but now cannot find it...
The reloaded dataset example is nearly useless to me.  Why/how would I know beforehand what the captured_run_id is for an experiment that occurred months ago?
Thanks again for your help.
The legacy dataset supports hdf5 that is probably what you have seen. There are various ways to load data according to the sample name and the experiment that you have storred it under. It should all be in the documentation. Could you give an example of how you would like to be able to load data? You will need to load it according to some identifier. QCoDeS stores a the run_id, an experiment name, a samle name and the date all can be used to load the data
It seems like this is mostly a question about how to use the qcodes dataset and not a bug. Please ping if there is an actual bug to have this reopened
