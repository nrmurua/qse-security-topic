The short answer is a combination of backwards compatibility and (probably) inability to agree on the preferred one at the point of time it was introduced. Going back in time, the first version of the Qobj (~ 0.6) concept included as_dict, and if memory serves, shortly after some other constructs that preferred to_foo instead where introduced - and when the models were generalised, we went with providing both for compatibility.
It would be nice indeed to settle on one and deprecate the other - I don't really have a strong preference over the name as long as we are consistent (might be worth doing a round of similar purpose methods and use them as a decision point).
I agree lets choose one. I prefer to_dict as well.  @ajavadia what about you.
Yes to_dict() is fine, and it seems it has already superseded as_dict() for the most part.
ok cool lets deprecate the as_dict
