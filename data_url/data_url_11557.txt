In optimization/algorithms/grover_optimizer.py lines 214-221:
when rotation_count is 0, no measurement operation is applied to the a_operator. This causes an error to be produced saying "No counts for experiment" when using the QASM simulator.
Use GroverOptimizer with the QASM simulator on any QUBO.
It will select a 0 rotation_count during the first iteration, and the error saying "No counts for experiment"  will appear.
It worked locally by:  when  measurement=True, and rotation_count is 0, create a new circuit, compose with the a_operator , and then apply measure_all.
See issue #1279, which ends up covering the issue described here,  and #1312 which addresses that and will fix this too.
Ok thanks. I didn't see that one already open.
