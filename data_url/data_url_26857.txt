Tests are usually run between the build and installation steps. If CP2K_DATA is set to point to the final location after installation but installation is not done already, regtests may fail to find referenced files and/or load files from the current installation dir.
So, where and when should we set $CP2K_DATA_DIR?
I guess either in our Makefile when running make test (assuming the do_regtest does not clean the environment) or in the do_regtest script itself
Yes, do_regtest seems like a good place.
