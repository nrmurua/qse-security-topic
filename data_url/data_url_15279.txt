See title.
It should work.
If I replace ZGate().power(0.1) with RZGate(0.1) no error is raised.
Here is a simpler reproduction:
Oh, this is a pretty major bug, thanks for the report. I'm not sure how the UnitarySynthesis plugin ever works with a Target if it needs to resynthesise a 1q gate, because there's this assumption you've found that it'll always be able to look up a 2q decomposer.
It looks like a bug in the unitary synthesis pass caused by running it with only a single 1q gate and a target. I'll propose a fix in a
sec (I've got it locally)
