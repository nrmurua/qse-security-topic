If the optimizer is built thus AQGD(maxiter=60, eta=3) it fails as follow
Given eta states it is of type float the expectation is that I should be able to give an integer such as the above and not have to explicitly make it a float
I should be able to supply a value of 3 rather than have to supply 3.
Change the tests below to check if the the type is already a list and if not then wrap it as a list. This will then not be dependent on the float versus int. Though the above failure is shown for eta all the parameters that are dealt with similarly should be fixed similarly.
