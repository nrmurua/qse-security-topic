Data should be measured and saved with full precision
Data is truncated to 6 decimal places (at least in gnuplot formatter)
You get angry when a time measurement does a staircase thing.

Yes, the default gnuplot formatter is "%g" which has 6 digits. I am not sure thats the best.
You should be able to work around this by creating a GnuPlotFormatter and passing
a different number_format to it such as .10g to get 10 digits after the dot. I am not sure what the default should be be but I suspect we should change it.

@MerlinSmiles sorry to hear that. This is indeed embarrassingly bad.
It happens here: https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/data/gnuplot_format.py#L70 .
And I guess the fact that by default it rounds six digits was either not known by the original writer or casually not-documented.
Yes, I saw that it was happening there, but kind of get unhappy with such a feature :(
I don't think we disagree about that @MerlinSmiles
I would never doubt on that, just reporting to get attention to it :)
I guess noone knew until yesterday :D
Indeed, #783 fixed this issue.
