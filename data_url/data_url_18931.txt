In the Types and Casting >  Register concatenation and slicing, could be interesting add extra examples showing the possibility to concatenate two alias, and how we can work the a negative range to get the last elements too.
qubit[10] two;
// new code to add
let begin_three = two[0:2];
// example using negative ranges to take the last 3 elements
let last_three = two[-4:-1];
// example how concatenate two alias in another one
let both = begin_three || last_three;
