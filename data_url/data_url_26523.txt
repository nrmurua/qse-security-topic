On our local machines, I compile CP2K without SIRIUS because I don't need it. The toolchain installs SPLA by default independently of SIRIUS. Unfortunately, the compiler does not find the module file of SPLA in this case. I have not tested whether that also happens with GPU support. The PR #2086 fixes this behavior without GPUs.
This issue seems to have been fixed via #2086.
