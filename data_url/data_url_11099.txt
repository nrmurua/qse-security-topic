the following lines of code  (v1.3.0 release branch) implementing SymbolicOperator.isclose are doing something strange when comparing two operators:
This behavior means that operators x and y whose terms have large coefficients will satisfy x == y even when x - y > 0. Here is a minimal reproducing example
you can tweak num_terms_before_ineq smaller and the output will correctly reflect that x and y are not equal within the desired tolerance.
Otherwise if this is the intended behavior (i.e. this comparison is meant to be equality within a relative tolerance w/r to magnitude of the coefficient vectors for x and y), the docstring for SymbolicOperator.isclose should be updated accordingly.
