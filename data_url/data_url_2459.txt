I would expect the above code to produce a number of about 0.1.  Instead it does 1 - 0.1.
I should also add that the the simulator performs as expected for Amplitude damping
What version of Cirq are you running this on? That BitFlipChannel  program channel works correctly on 0.6.0.dev0 (I got 0.0922) and 0.5.0 (I got 0.0976).
0.5.0.dev20190416130350
@dabacon fixed this in #1545 (which was before the release of 0.5)
