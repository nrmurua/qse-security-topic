Thanks for a really great project! It has helped me a lot in understanding and replicating certain algorithmic results. The underlying implementation of states and operators appears very efficient, but I'm having an extremely hard time understanding it. As a matter of fact, I don't understand it. Is there some publication somewhere on the principles of this implementation? Or would it be possible to produce such detailed documentation? That would be awesome!
The tensor operations are quite well described on wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate but if you were referring to the tensor API then you may found more info on numpy.org since the Tensor class in this project is a wrapper for the ndarray of numpy.
