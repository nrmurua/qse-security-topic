Qobj is being deprecated so it's probably not worth fixing. But if I assemble() a circuit with an Aer backend, then call its backend.run(), the job would fail with
because assemble inserts parameter_binds into circuits.config.
I can still run a qobj with Aer.
I'm having the same issue.
Run the transpiled circuit directly instead of using QObj. It worked for me.
