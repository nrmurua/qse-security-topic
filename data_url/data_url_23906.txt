We need some better way to represent zero time "events" such as control-flow. Using simply zero time is not enough because by the time we get to creating the instruction stream we have simultaneous events for which the instruction ordering may be ambiguous.  E.g. is a WAIT part of a repeat loop so does the LOAD_REAPEAT go before or after the WAIT?
