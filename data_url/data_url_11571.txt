The U1/U2/U3 circuit methods are being deprecated to in favor of the more commonly known U and Phase gates. See  Qiskit/qiskit#5083 for more information and the gates that are being deprecated and their replacements - includes controlled versions of aforementioned gates too.
Wherever the above u1/2/3 gates and controlled versions thereof are used in circuits built out in Aqua they should be replaced.
