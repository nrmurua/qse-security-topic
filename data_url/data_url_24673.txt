The new create_program should get an optional argument that enforces certain templates to be translated into a waveform. For this we need this method.
Problems:
build_waveform requires a pulse template that is fully determined by the parameters. The currently useless WhileLoopPulseTemplate depends on conditions for sequencing.
Solution:
Raise an error if build_waveform of such PulseTemplates is called.
This was stupid. Just neet to take to_waveform from _program
