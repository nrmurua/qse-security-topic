apologies in advance if I am opening this in the wrong place.
From Aqua's repo readme, second link in Machine Learning Further examples section is gone.
Last time I saw that, it looked something like this.
but I think after this the notebook is now here under a slight different file name.
So my question is: should we link to the finance folder, or to the notebook directly?
Hi, the former tutorials are being refactored and migrated into the documentation such that the original tutorials, that had not be migrated yet, are in legacy folder. Some of the sub-categories have been dropped during the migration too. So that the tutorial you refer to can be seen here https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/finance/index.html as one of the finance set.
