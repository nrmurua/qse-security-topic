I am running on a 4 GPU system (gorby).
The mgpu backend should offload to an additional GPU once the memory threshold for the first GPU is reached. However this is not what I observe. See code snippet below and the error raised.
n_qubits = 30 works fine on a single gpu but  n_qubits = 31 throws up the error above.
NA
NA
Not a regression
NA
I believe this has been fixed.
I tested this on Gorby (after changing cudaq.set_qpu('cuquantum_mgpu') to cudaq.set_target('nvidia-mgpu') due to changes since this issue was originally written), and it successfully ran to completion, so I'm closing the issue.
