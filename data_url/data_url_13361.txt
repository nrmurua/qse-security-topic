As part of the documentation reorganization, the users guide is being refurbished. See https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/projects/6, #908 and RFC.
For techniques, the accepted proposal plans to have many short .myst files. The proposed table of contents with this regard in the RFC is as follows:
Do we want to keep the titles as questions as they are now?
If so, especially 5. could be shortened and modified
Currently in the #1004 draft for PEC, the files are called guide/guide-pec-1.myst etc. I have two proposals:
We already have a reference section for the whole documentation. At the cost of making the last file a bit less self-consistent, but in order to avoid unnecessary duplication, I propose to simply use the current formalism to refer to the bibliography, i.e. :cite:Title  etc. So file 5 contains a discussion but the articles are properly linked in the bibliography only, at https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zz_bibliography.html.
The current proposal is to use these names for titles:
The proposal for the names of the files is
Example: guide/pec-5-theory.myst.
Please comment here if you have objections, or just like the comment if you agree @qryan @andreamari @crazy4pi314 @Misty-W @purva-thakre @L-P-B  (and all involved in rewriting the docs).
For the second file names I would propose:
guide/[technique-acronym]-2-use-case.myst
to avoid confusion with the other examples of the docs.
The rest LGTM
The question-style titles are fine for me.
To make the last one "Who thought of this? Why does it work? And whoâ€™s using it?" shorter we could use:
