PR #311 raised the problem that apparently not all IDs are consistently updated/maintained along with their implementations/code. This issue to track/ensure all algorithms have OIDs/NIDs in line with their code bases (R2/R3). This issue should be resolved before a new oqs-openssl/liboqs release if it is not done within PR #311.
