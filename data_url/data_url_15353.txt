The documentation in BaseEstimator says that when calling an instance four arguments are supplied. The third and fourth are parameters and parameter values.
But the implementation and the example are different. They take only three arguments. Parameter values are passed, but not parameters. Instead, in the call method, the parameters are retrieved from the circuit.
The above is in the file for BaseEstimator, but the doc string and example contained therein refer to Estimator. It appears online in the API reference section.

Documented interface should agree with implementation.
