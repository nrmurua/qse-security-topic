For some PulseTemplates the automatic registration happens to early as it triggers serialization for some containers (PulseStorage).
The easy fix for classes that do not need their superclasses attributes in their __init__ is to put the superclass initialization at the end. Is there a better way?
Maybe some kind of __init__ decorator?
