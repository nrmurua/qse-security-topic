If the qiskit circuit has complex Instruction, tensorcircuit can not convert the circuit into tc Circuit.
A quick fix to the above problem is to use the decompose function. The following code works
However, the decomposition is "shallow", and does not work for general cases.
The following code doesn't work
qiskit-terra: 0.22.3
qiskit-nature: 0.4.4
tensorcircuit: 0.6.0
