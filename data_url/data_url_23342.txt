The current schema vaildation file qcodes_schma.json includes the validation of the station configurator object, but does not include it into the required list:
This somehow prevents the config for the StationConfigurator to be loaded.
here the default file as configured is not loaded.
When adding the SC to the required list the default file is being loaded successfully.
@Dominik-Vogel is this still relevant?
Yes and no. Yes in the sense that the behaviour has not changed and no in the sense that we are going to merge the station configurator into core.
This has low urgency but we should keep it in mind. Especially when it comes to handling qcodes modules with config entries.
