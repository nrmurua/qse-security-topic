The manual currently uses a Google Custom Search. Unfortunately, this gives us only limited control over which pages get indexed. Out of the 19925 listed pages google chooses to indexes only 4348. This isn't really surprising given how little traffic the site receives. And with every release we are adding 2218 more pages. Hence, we should at some point move to a client-side search engine like Lunr.js.
Just to mention some corollary of this

Yeah, it's bad. Unfortunately, I won't have the bandwidth for it (this year).
So, contributions are always welcome ;-)
Can we just add site:manual.cp2k.org onto the search string?
That's essentially what we are already doing with the custom search box.
The problem is that Google does not index, ie. crawl, all our pages because we have too many.
Maybe Algolia DocSearch is worth a try? https://docsearch.algolia.com/
Free for open-source projects, just read the checklist and apply to the program.
It will crawl once a week
Great find! I've just appliedðŸ¤ž
Good news: We're getting sponsored by Algolia DocSearch :-)
Bad news: Their crawler expects semantic HTML while our manual pages are build with nested tables... which was the style at the time.
So, I think we first need a new manual generator. While we're at it we could switch to Sphinx with Markdown.
The new Sphinx-based manual has a builtin search. While it's not perfect, I think it's good enough. One could probably tweak it a bit more via the Sphinx Config.
So, if nobody objects, I will close our Algolia account again.
Just would suggest to test the quality of search results before you cancel the account; it can make a real difference for users of the documentation
