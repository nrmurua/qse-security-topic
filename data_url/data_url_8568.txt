I was helping someone with an install on windows 7 yesterday.
We were testing using a notebook, and it worked fine except the version_table. The first error was resolved by installing ipython parallel. Still after that it was failing with something like key 'ncpus' missing. Sorry for not supplying exact errors. I could ask the user to post them if necessary.
@nonhermitian is #421 likely to resolve this? Even if say they don't have win32com or comtypes installed?
The parallel issue was resolved earlier. See the ipynbtools import of ipyparallel. ncps should not be an issue as it has always has fallen back on the multiprocessing count

Well, yesterday when helping said user, I installed a fresh Anaconda 32bit for winodws + mingw + libpython. Then I installed the latest github release of qutip. And still I got these issues.
I could try to reproduce on a clean win7 virtual machine I have here?
I see the issue. I did not upload all my fixes for that issue. Just the change supporting jupyter. Will upload tonight. Sorry, too many repos to keep track of.

Good news. All makes sense now
npus should be fixed with Pull #421 .
This is fixed.
