I followed the instruction in github to import types of ansatz from openfermioncirq.varional , but it reports the fault:
_ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openfermion.ops.givens_rotations'
I tried to check the ops package, and it turns out that givens_rotations has been removed.
How can I deal with this? Or are there other ways to import ansatz?
Hey, @ChrisW918 . This is an OpenFermion issue. I'm going to close it because it's a duplicate of quantumlib/OpenFermion#732.
