Adding the possibility to build liboqs for s390x. The platform will be the only big-endian architecture in liboqs (AFAIK), which can also be a useful test for the crypto code.
The build can be similar to the ppc64le build. TravisCI allows free s390x builds for OSS projects: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/multi-cpu-architectures/#partner-queue-solution
