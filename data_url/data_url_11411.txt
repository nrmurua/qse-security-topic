I will just note that this isn't a requirement of acceptance of the review, and more an easy improvement I noticed.
In the setup.py file it is possible to specify an entry_point, that is adding an executable to the path which points to a function through the console_scripts entry point. This article describes everything in more detail and the setuptools documentation also includes a description of using this functionality.
This allows for using runzfs instead of python -m pyzfs.exec.runzfs and removes the need to update the PYTHON_PATH environment variable. An example of the changes required while keeping backwards compatibility are in #2. There are additional updates to the documentation which would be required if you see this change as helpful.
Fixed by #2
