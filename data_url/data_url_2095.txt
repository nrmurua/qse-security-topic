I was playing around compiling the circuits used in cirq.contrib.quantum_volume and with 100 random restarts and seed np.random.RandomState(52) I consistently get this routing (starting from a 6 qubit circuit):

The eagle eyed viewer may notice some spurious qubits
.... And the extra qubits (here: 5,1 and 5,2) don't show up in initial_mapping
Ok, so the first swap on (5,1), (5,2) is very useless but I've done some checking with cirq.wavefunction_partial_trace_as_mixture and the input and output circuits produce the same wavefunction after you account for the final permutation and drop (5,1) and (6,1)
(5,1) seems to be used for transit purposes only, but this does seem to reduce the depth by 1 moment
