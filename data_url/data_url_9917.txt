Environment
Try upgrading your setuptools? I have seen this before and that was the fix - I don't actually know why. If it fixes it for you as well I'll look into the cause.
Thanks, that did it.  Was previously on setuptools 40.8.0, and upgrading went to 57.0.0.
Because PEP-517/518 support was added in setuptools 42.0.0.
It's actually setuptools 46.4.0, specifically it's trying to import the package to get the __version__. We could support older versions of setuptools by moving __version__ back to dimod.package_info and not having any other imports in that submodule.
For the record, 46.4.0 was released May 2020.
Edit: proposed fix doesn't work either.
Ah, looks like you already had that in dwavesystems/dwave-greedy#16
That's correct.
We need setuptools>=42.0.0 for build system from pyproject.toml to work (PEP-517/518). I.e. for build/cythonization requirements to be installed before build. In this bucket, I'll also put pip>=10.0, which is the first version to support pyproject.toml (a concern only when building from sdist or source).
And we need setuptools>=46.4.0 for setup.cfg's attr: support.
FWIW, I invested (too much) time in figuring out all these edges, and dwave-greedy is the proto package I've been testing on (same for orbification). Standardized CI will be easy to propagate across Ocean packages via orbs, but standardizing the build/package config/details (and keeping them in sync) will be a pain.
