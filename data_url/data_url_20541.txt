When enabling algorithms, compilation errors occur when too many are enabled. The wiki page states:
However the number of variants appears to be much less than 64. Is the maximum number of variants inclusive of the non-pqc algorithms that ship with openssl? If so I think it would be useful to mention that, and perhaps mention how many pqc variants can be enabled separately.
Yes, the maximum number includes all the non-PQC algorithm that ship with OpenSSL.  I think based on 
Confirmed. 9 PK algs is a hardcoded limitation in OpenSSL1 that I changed with a PR in OpenSSL3. Hence this limitation does not exist with the oqsprovider.
Okay, I've added a line to the wiki explaining this.
Thank you!
