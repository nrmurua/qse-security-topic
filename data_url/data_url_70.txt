test/NVQPP/qir_test_cond_for_loop-4.cpp and test/NVQPP/qir_test_cond_for_loop-5.cpp are not passing because the quake-add-metadata pass is not adding the qubitMeasurementFeedback attribute.
These tests work correctly on Quantinuum's emulator, so this is just a local emulator issue that occurs when the user is running with --emulate.
The test are currently marked as XFAIL, but after fixing this issue, the tests should no longer fail.
Execute the steps at the top of test/NVQPP/qir_test_cond_for_loop-4.cpp and test/NVQPP/qir_test_cond_for_loop-5.cpp.
The unit test should pass.
Not a regression
No response
The long-term plan is that we won't need the QuakeAddMetadataPass. That is - we should be able to update the simulator to not depend on the qubitMeasurementFeedback attribute and instead make "on the fly" decisions about path splitting with respect to the state vector.
Also note that this is somewhat related to #749.
Related, and containing @schweitzpgi's write op of the algorithm for detection we talked about: #309
