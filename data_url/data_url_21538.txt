During init() the sif_sync bit of the Phaser DAC is set and not cleared. This blocks further sync until manually cleared.
The Phaser.init() method sets the sif_sync bit. This is required to apply the written NCO values. Unless the bit is cleared, any changes to the NCO frequency can not be applied.

Currently, this bit is set when applying the DAC memory map (as defined in artiq.coredevice.dac34h84). This is not a suitable interface for syncing the NCO from user code.
The bit should be cleared during Phaser.init(). Once the bit is cleared, the NCO frequency can be written using the set_nco_frequency method.
A reasonable approach would be to provide a sync_nco method that applies written NCO changes. This would also avoid the need for manually accessing the DAC registers to update the NCO frequency. Currently this has to be done as shown below:
The bit is not cleared during Phaser.init(). This blocks further syncing of NCO frequency changes, until the bit has been manually cleared.
From the datasheet I understood sif_sync as one-shot rising edge sensitive. If that's correct, there is no point in clearing it since you have to do two writes for each sync anyway and this issue is invalid.
It doesn't need to be cleared.
