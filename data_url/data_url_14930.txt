A circuit where a QFT is appended to a circuit and then exported to QASM, cannot be reimported because it produces an invalid qasm (with a recursive definition of the gate_QFT, not described anywhere).
Run this python script:
Produces this output and error:
The error happens only when importing the qasm file, whereas I believe the mistake is done by the exporter,
This is the genrated QASM:
I would have expected the QASM exporter to generate a valid qasm, ready to be reimported.
This recursive definition of the gate_QFT is quite puzzling for me, looking forward to your feedback. I checked and with the compose API this problem des not happen: i.e. qc.compose(QFT(2, do_swaps=False), [1,0], inplace=True) produces a valid qasm file with gate gate_QFT q0,q1 { h q1; cp(pi/2) q1,q0; h q0; }.
This one is a duplicate of #10162, which was fixed in #10286 and should have gone out in 0.24.2 - let me know if the newest version of Terra doesn't have this fix.
