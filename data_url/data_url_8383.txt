Is reaction coordinator master equation is restricted to tls
hi!  no it works for any system hamiltonian in principle.
Howevere the function in qutip it only works for the drude-lorentz spectral density, and for only a single bath.   Its easy to generalize for many baths, but scales pretty badly.   We have found combining it with the enr_states stuff improves the efficiency a bit for many baths, but we need to add some examples showing this.
