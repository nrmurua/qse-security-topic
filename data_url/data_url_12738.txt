In #640, task 2.2 of the BoundedKnapsack kata couldn't be migrated to Jupyter Notebook. Both %kata and %check_kata threw exceptions when running with the generic function used in that task:

We've seen the "Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'original')" error in the past, but at that point it mostly indicated a version mismatch of IQ# used to build the notebook in the past and in the present.
This seems to be a different issue; I observed it both when running IQ# 0.18.2106148911 and 0.17.2105144881, and it doesn't happen on the other cells in this notebook until I execute this cell. After I execute it, all other cells start giving the same error.
I will remove this cell for now to complete #640, but in the long run we'll definitely need some type-parameterized tasks, so we'll need to investigate.
We will be migrating the Katas to the new QDK that will use a different infrastructure (see https://devblogs.microsoft.com/qsharp/introducing-the-azure-quantum-development-kit-preview/ for the announcement), so we won't continue to improve the existing infrastructure of Q# notebooks magics. Closing this issue as "won't fix".
