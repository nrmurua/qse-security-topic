I have read about optimisation technics, when we have really big numbers of gates. I've read about 3D visualisation that leads to us e common steps which we should follow to make minimum number of gates or really the specific ones (Clifford ones).
I would like to bring your attention to add the extension to the application, that will be able to represent data in such way.
I know that was already described there:
