Hi,
It seems that the CMake build system for QUICK fails to build correctly on the Perlmutter computer at NERSC. This is due to the use of the outdated find_package(CUDA) option being in used. This variable used to populate correctly the CUDA_CUBLAS_LIBRARY variable, however the path to the library in the HPC toolkit of nvidia seems to different, instead of being in: /path/to/cuda/lib64/libcublas it is in /path/to/math_libs/lib64/libcublas.so same for cusolver.
The temporary workaround was to pass the full path import_library(cublas "/opt/nvidia/hpc_sdk/Linux_x86_64/22.7/math_libs/lib64/libcublas.so") in the QUICKCudaConfig.cmake file. This is using cmake 3.22.0 if this helps at all.
