When using BinaryQuadraticModel.to_serializable() the parameter bias_dtype affects the result even when use_bytes is False. This is unexpected, because the description of bias_dtype is:
For example, the following code (Option A) fails, and the stored JSON file does not match the original object.
Option B works.
This behaviour is, at least, unexpected and doesn't match the documentation.
DimodEncoder, doesn't take any arguments and therefore stores numpy.float32 by default without a warning that the data as changed.
