Describe the bug
While calling rand_herm and keeping 'pos_def = True' with density > 0.5, the eigenvalues are coming out to be negative. (For density < 0.5, all works well.)
To Reproduce
Please provide a minimal working example. For instance:
The terminal output is
Expected behavior
The eigenvalues must be non-negative.

Additional context
I separately tried the function '_rand_herm_dense', and it works perfectly fine. I was not able to spot the negative values show up when I keep density > 0.5

Thank you for reporting.
This should be already fixed in the master branch.
You can use master, we keep it stable enough that it can be used at any time, or wait for the next release.
Thanks @gaurav-iiser for the bug report and @Ericgig for the fix.
