When using SetFrequency/ShiftFrequency the phase of the channel does not accumulate when shifting from f_1 to f_2 for a period n*dt, and then back to f_1. This is a known issue with the backend and will be corrected on the backends shortly. This issue is to track and will be closed when the backend is fixed.
Starting on resonance with the qubit perform a Ramsey experiment and shift the frequency during the delay duration, the signal should oscillate proportional to the delay but it will not.
The phase should accumulate on the channel proportional to its frame.
Thanks for the issue report!
