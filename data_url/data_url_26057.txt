Just thought it would be nice... azure has one.
We ended up implementing the AWS Braket quantum job cost estimator in the new API to verify the user has sufficient qBraid credits before sending the quantum job. I think this functionality will be useful to users both using the SDK, and when making circuits using Braket in Lab with qBraid quantum jobs enabled. So I think instead of ironing this into the SDK, we create separate routes for cost estimators in the API.
I'll leave this open for now, because there will still be some minor piece of functionality needed on the SDK side to facilitate
