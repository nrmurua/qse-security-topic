When attempting to compile and run an experiment on ARTIQ 8 Beta, the compilation fails with the worker exception Exception: ld.lld invocation failed.
I've been hesitating to submit this issue as I'm still on the fence about whether or not this is a local configuration issue, but I've run out of avenues to try to diagnose what's going on. I have also gone back and attempted to replicate this problem using conda. If I install a conda environment and set it up with the same hardware, this behavior does not occur, and the object file for the experiment is compiled and runs on the core.
Experiment object file is compiled, assembled, and loaded onto the core for running by the scheduler.
worker returns an exception and quits out before finishing compilation.
I was giving this another shot after a thought this afternoon. Sadly I didn't get it working, but I did get another more verbose error that might help? Nothing has changed appreciably between the state of the system reported above and this output:
Exception: ld.lld invocation failed: PLEASE submit a bug report to https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/ and include the crash backtrace.
Did you do that?
