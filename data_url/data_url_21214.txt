Exception messages containing substrings looking like format string messages (e.g. {foo}) lead to internal error when marshalled between host and core device.
leads to
This isn't easy to work around, as the exception message might not come directly from user code (perhaps even another language where {â€¦} isn't related to string interpolation, as was the case with Julia in the application here).
This is probably a regression introduced during the recent exception message rework, though I haven't actually tested older versions.
Hacky patch when tracking down where this came from:
The python_exn_type(nested_exceptions[-1][1].format(*nested_exceptions[0][2])) looks potentially dodgy as well (mixing of -1 and 0 outer indices).
Can confirm this for release-7 branch
