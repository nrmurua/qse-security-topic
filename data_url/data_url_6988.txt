It's probably about time that I do some kind of "use floats if possible, else fallback to bytes" logic. It will require touching all of the shaders and somehow abstracting them a little bit.
Lots of progress on this one. All of the necessary groundwork is done, I just need to add autodetection-and-fallback logic.
This is working now. There are some wrong results for large circuits, but that's a separate bug.
