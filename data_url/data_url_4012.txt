I want to do rotation operations in my qasm. e.g.
rz q0,-3.141593
How do I write this in OpenQL?
k.gate("rz",0,-3.141593)
flags an error (as I don't have a decomposition in my .json), while
k.rz(0,-3.141593)
gets decomposed to
rz q0-3.141593
The comma delimiter between qubit and angle is missing.
I think, Lines 472, 431, 390 in OpenQL/blob/develop/ql/gate.h is the issue.
Also, can the json gate decomposition arguments support floating point values of the angles, if I want to define some custom command based on sequence of arbitrary rotation gates.
Fixed in 3f36504. You can use arbitrary rotations as:
tested ok.
