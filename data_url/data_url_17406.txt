for a fairly large circuit, latex drawer outputs an empty box.
I'm having a hard time parsing the qasm in your example can you maybe paste it as a standalone file (or code snippet with the white space) so I can test that locally. However looking at your script I think you might just have a typo in there. qasm = new_circ.qasm() will overwrite that big qasm string with the qasm from whatever new_circ is (since I don't have the full script I don't know). If it's an empty circuit that would explain the empty output.
@mtreinish Code snippet updated. The original was a typo on my part.
Interesting, so I ran this with latex_source output and it does generate output. But when I rendered it with pdflatex manually it's on 2 pages not 1: test.pdf so this is a bug in either our latex settings that's causing it to wrap on 2 pages or in our pdf->png conversion stage (including the png trimming) that's not getting the output. Either way this gives us a starting point to start fixing this.
