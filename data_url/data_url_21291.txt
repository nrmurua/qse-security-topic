As discussed in #1299, the handling of assignment statements in the escape/value liveness analysis seems broken.
Before #1299, the compiler would crash on assigning values from globals, e.g.
Even after #1299, the implementation still seems dodgy, or at least overly conservative â€“ on rebinding names, shortening the lifetime probably ought to be allowed.
We should have a thorough look at how assignments are handled sometime soon.
