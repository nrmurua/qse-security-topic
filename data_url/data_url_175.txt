It seems like cudaq-quake fails to translate calls to cudaq::compute_action to quake, when the action operand contains a for loop. The following code example demonstrates this:
Actually having quantum logic in the code is not needed, the following also fails:
Running the command cudaq-quake --emit-llvm-file a.cpp fails with the following error:
error: 'quake.compute_action' op operand #0 must be Proxy for a C++ callable instance in cc, but got 'i64'
When inspecting the quake code, it seems like the quake.compute_action doesn't access the correct argument, but instead if accesses the result of the addition from the loop step.
The command should succeed and an appropriate quake file should be created
Not a regression
