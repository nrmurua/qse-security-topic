After some discussion spawned from #135 and the tutorials as a whole, it seems that having an easy, ideally single-shot way of checking if the tutorials are working against a new version of qiskit (or other dependencies in general) would facilitate keeping them in sync.
As a simple approach, a command that can be executed locally by a tutorial repository maintainer and clearly outputs which ones are working and which ones are not seems a good compromise. We can make use of the Python test framework for paving the way towards having a more integrated system in the future if needed.
This has been solved thanks to @diego-plan9
