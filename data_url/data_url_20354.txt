The NIST PQC FAQ mentions that the following third-party libraries are officially supported:
NTL Version 10.5.0 (http://www.shoup.net/ntl/download.html), GMP Version 6.1.2 (https://gmplib.org), the Keccak code package (https://github.com/gvanas/KeccakCodePackage), and OpenSSL Version 1.10f (https://www.openssl.org/source)
Some submissions also include other third-party libraries that have been approved by NIST.
I am currently holding off on integrating a submission that uses NTL, OpenSSL as well as gf2x.
Our build process downloads and builds the Keccak code package directly because it is not readily available in Linux/macOS package managers (apt, brew).  But OpenSSL is readily in package managers available so we require it to be installed externally and then build against that.  I'd take the same approach with NTL and GMP.
