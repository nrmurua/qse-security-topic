Currently the backend monitor shows single_qubit and cnot errors in the heatmap.

Given that readout errors are much higher than single_qubit errors, I propose to show the readout errors of qubits instead.
Agreed
Actually no sure about this. Usually only measure once, but have many 1q gates. Should probably have way to display all. Will think about this.
We should not show the measurement  over the single qubit errors.  If we want to show both we can split the circles in two
I think that varying the qubit size might be a good visual for the readout error.
I think varying the qubit size could work well.
I still think readout error is more dominant though. With typical single-qubit gate fidelities of 0.995 - 0.999, you need between 10-50 of them on 1 qubit to get as bad as a readout fidelity of 95%.
Yes. You are correct. But I think we can capture them all in one plot, so we should be good.
this is done
