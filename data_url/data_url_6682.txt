With the major release of a new portable version of LIQUi|〉 (see the REAMDE.md file), I would like to ask the community for a little help. The only reason that we haven’t announced on OSX is that I’m still waiting for a machine to arrive that I can test on. If anyone is willing to take the Linux instructions (in the GettingStarted.md file) and to document what they need to do differently for OSX, I would greatly appreciate it. Theoretically, the provided /linux directory in the tree should already be (mostly) compatible. The main thing you would need to figure out is how to install mono, fsharp and monodevelop (all of which are documented at the same sites that the Linux instructions reference). In the event that the compiled .DLL and .EXE files refuse to cooperate, details of any roadblocks would also help in finishing the porting effort. Thanks in advance.

Thanks Viraj! I've updated the main branch. We're now officially available on OSX!
