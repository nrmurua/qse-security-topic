I think it would be better to add some option to plot_histogram to show all possible states. It becomes easy to visualize.
Current:

Expected:

Idea:
As the number of qubits is known to us we can add dummy strings before plotting.
What do you think of it?
This looks like a nice enhancement (and may be made easier by #5205 ) though this is likely only practical at a small number of classical bits, so we would likely want to skip this behavior (or maybe set a number_to_keep) above a certain result size.
