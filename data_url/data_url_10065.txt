Application
Right now Response.from_samples uses samples verbatim, even if they are identical (same values, same energies) -- although each Sample constructed has num_occurrences field.
Proposed Solution
It would be useful to provide an option to combine identical samples, only summing up the number of occurrences.
Alternatives Considered
Aggregate/unique-ify in user code, prior Response construction. Implementation on dimod side will probably be more efficient and overall convenient for users.
I remember the counter-case, sometimes the order of samples matters, and always aggregating them would eliminate that. I think an intermediate solution would be to add a aggregate_samples() method (or something better named) that can be called by the user or the sampler author, but in general we would not always keep them aggregated.
Adding a helper method sounds good. I would still like to have an option in from_samples to aggregate them on demand (not by default).
Yet another approach would be to aggregate automatically but for the samplers for which order matters, add the order into the .info field.
So [[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 0]] would become [[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0]] with .info['order'] = [0, 1, 2, 0]
