Right now we have one giant module qiskit.tools.visualization._circuit_visualization which contains both the public methods and the implementations for 2 different backends (mpl and latex). As part of the circuit visualization cleanup we should create a separate module for each backend qiskit.tools.visualization._latex and qiskit.tools.visualization._matplotlib. This is how we set up the text/ascii backend already. After this happens we'll just have the public interfaces (mainly circuit_drawer() and it's helper functions) living in qiskit.tools.visualization._circuit_visualization.
I think this is a dup of #612
I think it's more of a task that could be part of #612. #612 is pretty broad in scope this is a pretty small incremental improvement to the organization of the circuit visualization that will also be completed with #1111
I think we should close #612 as the title implies more but the comments are more aligned to this one.
