In pulse the command FrameChange changes the phase of a pulse channel. A more appropriate name would be either SetPhase or ShiftPhase. SetPhase would be more appropriate if the command sets the phase to a new value while ShiftPhase is more appropriate if the command adds a phase to the current value.
@taalexander and @lcapelluto opinions on the name?
Splitting this out into SetPhase and ShiftPhase makes sense to me.
Yup. I like both.
This can be part of #3750 since there will be renaming/deprecating happening there
This will be closed by #3750, closing as now a duplicate.
