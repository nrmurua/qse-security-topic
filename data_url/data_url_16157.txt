classical_function creates wrong circuits for some cases. I confirmed at least two cases.
Case 1)
Case 2)
Case 1)
The control bit of the CNOT gate should be the most bottom bit.
As written in the documentation, following Qiskitâ€™s little-endian bit ordering convention, the left-most bit (x1) is the most significant bit and the right-most bit (x3) is the least significant bit.
The following code is an example for the correct bit ordering.
Case 2)
The circuit does not represent x1 or x2 or x3. For example, when (x1, x2, x3) = (001), $q_3$ of the circuit does not become 1.
Case 1 is not a bug.
Indeed, Qiskit's follows little-endian bit ordering convention but this happens within a register, i.e., there will be a difference of between declaring two 1 qubit registers and a register of 2 qubits.  Hence, if you had declared a the function as
then you would get x as a register of three bits following the little-endian bit ordering.
Case 2 will be fixed by #5830
