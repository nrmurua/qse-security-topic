Timing units dt, ns, µs, ms, s are meant to be reserved types. However, the pi/2 gate is typically denoted s (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/docs/iqx/operations-glossary#s-gate).
Perhaps the timing types should be capitalized or use sec to avoid this confusion?
Does this lead to any ambiguities in the grammar? It means an awkward lexer token (seconds or s gate) but if the s for seconds only follows a number then there shouldn't be any confusion.
On a related note, I'd advocate for a us ascii synonym for µs.
It can be worked around in the grammar: https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm/blob/a3132a4fd9a96383a94410449f9511235822b51a/source/grammar/qasm3.g4#L482, so I don't think there's any ambiguity. But it still could lead to confusing code.
I agree w/ us (that's what's in the antlr grammar PR currently)
+1 for @stevenheidel proposal. The s gate is also not built-in and just part of the standard gate library which must be defined and included.
Please create a separate issue or PR to support both us and μs.
