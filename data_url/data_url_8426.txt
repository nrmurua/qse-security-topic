I am using Anaconda on windows 10 and installed qutip from conda-forge package, I don't  have VS-15 on my system, Is it possible that that I could run qutip with VS-15 runtime liberaries instead of complete installation of visual studio. If it is possible please guide me.
Hi, if you look at the conda instructions for VS, you will find some alternatives
https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-windows.html
There is a VS community edition which might be smaller.
Alternatively, on Windows 10, you can install a Linux subsystem (supported officially by Windows) and then I am hoping that you don't need to deal with a complete VS installation. Please find the instructions to get a native Linux subsystem in Windows 10 below:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
Let me know if you need any help or encounter issues.
Thanks for suggesting Linux subsystem, but it is not good enough to run simulations, it is slower for even day to day file manipulations, so from your comment and documentation you shared I come to conclusion that there is no alternative of VS to run Qutip in windows 10.
I have asked some of the team if they can check into this too. That's why I reopened.
I installed using  conda-forge channel and installation worked without any problems, but when i run following jupyter notebook from example code on documentation: (http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/examples/control-grape-cnot.ipynb)
it gives following error


This code works fine, without any problems on my machine.
Ok, that's good news. Thanks for trying. Hopefully you can do what you want with the pulseoptim functions?
I guess the grape-cnot notebook must use some runtime compile components. If you want to use those, then you will need the VS-15 compiler.

Dear Bilal I am quite new to use python and qutip.... some how i am not able installed qutip from conda-forge package on window 10..... can you please let us know the step wise installation. (waseem)
I installed visual studio 2015 from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/ , after that I simply followed instructions of qutip documentation.
