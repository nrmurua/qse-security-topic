If more classical bits are declared than the number of qubits measured, the simulators and the QPUs return results in different formats.
In particular, the QPU results contain the unused classical bits with random integer numbers.
The simulator returns only the bits that are used in the measurement.

@andyliphys Thanks for the report. That's a good one, and I don't think I've seen it before. I'll take a closer look and see if this is a bug and can be fixed.
This is important to consider for v4: QVM and QPU should return results that are consistent in shape
This has been fixed in v4, with the appropriate amount of nuance.
