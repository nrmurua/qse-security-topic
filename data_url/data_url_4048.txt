This relates to issue #66 and aims to Introduce a "qasm_loader" Module which Provide a tool for Checking the Syntax and Semantic Validity of the QASM files which is Crucial for ensuring Compatibility with the QX Simulator and Automating Tests of the Compiler output.
The same Module will be Partially Reused to solve Issue #66 .
The QASM Loader is Added in Commit bc18fc3
This issue will be Closed after Automating QASM Code Check.
A Python Interface for the QASM Loader is added in Commit 448402d
The new Python Class Allows Quick Testing of the Syntax/Semantic Validity of the QASM Output of the Compiler:
The load Method returns 0 when there is no Errors else an Error Code and an Explanatory Message of the Error and at it Location (Line Number).
