It flew under the radar for quite a while, but it's recently been pointed out to us that the parameters for SPHINCS+ had been updated back in september.
There's a PR in PQClean that will hopefully be merged soon (PQClean/PQClean#377).  Once that's merged, it'll have to be updated here.
We're planning to do a 0.5.0 release today, so I would bump this to a future release.
Does SPHINCS+ Round 3 have algorithm/KAT changes? If so it would cause a bump to 0.6.
Yep, signature sizes are different.
It's been merged into PQClean, so work can start on a liboqs PR.
