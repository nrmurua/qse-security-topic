Sometimes when find_embedding is called on inputs that are borderline un-embeddable, the following message is printed:
failed during initialization. embeddings may be invalid.
Consider raising an exception instead, so the code calling the function knows something is amiss. Otherwise, consider validating the returned embedding so that it is guaranteed to be valid.
