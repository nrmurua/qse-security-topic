Given QuantumCircuits "bottom" and "top",
if "bottom" contains ancillas AND if performing bottom.tensor(top, inplace=True)
then the modified "bottom" QuantumCircuit will have the ancilla entries doubled (with same name, so they are not visible in draw) in bottom.ancillas
This does NOT happen if inplace=False
Only the relevant ancillas should stay.
a related question:
QuantumCircuit.qubits shows all qubits, including ancilla. Is that by design?
@learn2flask I have reproduced the error, but I disagree that it does not happen for inplace=False. For that case, I use the following code:
Note that when inplace=False, the function returns a new circuit instead of modifying c. Therefore, although c seems fine (because it is not modified), the result is still wrong.
The cause of this issue is that when a new circuit is constructed within tensor, the __init__ method calls add_register, which fails to examine the existence of AncillaQubit before adding. I have fixed it in #7450.
