I attempted building liboqs 0.7.2~rc1-1 on Debian unstable as part of Debian packaging effort. Test test_non_executable_stack is failing on Debian mips64el, mipsel and hppa architectures (full matrix here). Failures look like this:
This is indeed a new test.
Is it possible that the compiler flag "-Wa,--noexecstack" is not properly honored on those platforms? I don't have any of those at my disposal to test. If you could confirm this, would you want to set --ignore=tests/test_binary.py when invoking pytest? Alternatively, can you propose "carve-out" statements that we could add to skip that test on those specific platforms?
It seems that these architectures ignore CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS as it is only -Wa,--noexecstack which does not make to cc call (all options set via add_compile_options() appear on cc command line call).
Ignoring this test case is surely an option if this cannot be fixed.
Is there are a reason that -Wa,--noexecstack is only set when including assembler code? Shouldn't this be enabled globally?
Shouldn't this be enabled globally?
Sounds sensible to me. @dstebila : Can you recall a reason?

I have some vague recollection of some weirdness involving this, but nothing definite.  Seems reasonable to try.
Now I know why it the linker options is missing. I'll iterate on possible solutions in #1294.
I confirm that 9ee96d8 fixes the issue.
