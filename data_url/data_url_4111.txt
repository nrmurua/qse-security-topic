@imranashraf , I'm playing around a bit with openQL but it is quite hard to find what all the features are and how they work. I'm now trying this out by using an interactive terminal (ipython) and testing what all the functions do. Normally calling e.g., k.clifford? would give me a docstring, however no docstrings at all are specified.
This is problematic because looking at the source code will only show me that it links to a certain binary and does not show me anything on how a function is supposed to behave.
Another problem with this is that it is hard to find all the features are there or how I am supposed to interact with objects.
