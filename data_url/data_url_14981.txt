This forms a lot of the work needed for actual use of the initial classical-expression design document.
Depends on #10223 and #10224.
In addition to the DAGCircuit methods that are explicitly called out above, I substitute_node_with_block and substitute_node both technically need updating with support for Expr values.  However, I think in practice that these operations do not make sense in the same way with control flow, and since we need to rework how the DAGCircuit data structure works with control flow anyway, I don't think they will actually need touching.
edit: in having done this, I think it's actually simple enough and meaningful to define the behaviour for substitute_node_with_dag and substitute_node, and likely will be useful for PRs in the vein of #9580.
As of right now, the PRs:
