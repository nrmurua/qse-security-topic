On Mac OS machine, transpile() hung up in parallel_map when it runs with multiple circuits and custom pass manager.
Note: No problem in the single circuit case transpile(qc, backend=backend, pass_manager=pm) or when specifying the same preset pass manager via optimization_level transpile([qc, qc], backend=backend, optimizaton_level=0).
Are you importing matplotlib anywhere when this happens?  That is a known mpl issue.
I got the following warnings prior to the hang when I tried to replicate this from master with python 3.5 on osx 10.14.
This looks like it could be related to: #3808
I think this is a bit different.  It seems that choose_layout_condition can simply not be pickled.  The other is the mpl issue that is to be resolved in v3.3
callables and parallelization not always play well together. Let me have a look...
The problem with the pickled callable from @kdk in #3925 (comment) is because Python 3.5 (do we still support it?) In Python 3.7 the hanging up from @itoko is reproducible.
hold on.. sometimes in python 3.7 I'm also getting the unpickleble issue...
