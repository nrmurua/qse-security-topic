#4023 found an issue that QuantumCircuit.measure_all creates a ClassicalRegister called measure, which is a reserved keyword in OpenQASM2+3. This was changed to meas for measure_active in #4079 , and addressed somewhat more generally for OpenQASM3 export in #7744 .

It would be good to:

We've run into this issue as well:
Thanks for bringing this up again.  This one particular case should hopefully be able to be handled by a simple "escape name" type of function in the exporter, as opposed to the OpenQASM 3.0 exporter's symbol-table version.  I'm happy to accept/help with PRs to fix this, though.
"escape name" type of function in the exporter
What's an "escape name"? Is it basically a way to tell the exporter to write _measure (with underscore) instead of the existing measure?
Yeah, essentially.  We already do some of this, if a gate claims its name is something like BLAH!Â£%& - that's not a valid OQ 2 identifier because of the leading capital letter and the symbols, so we "escape" it to gate_BLAH____.  That same function just needs a bit more logic to ensure it recognises that the OQ 2 reserved keywords are also invalid identifiers, and we need to apply it to registers as well as gates.
Fixed by #9100
