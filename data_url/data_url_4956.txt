QuEST-2.1.0
the num of qbits is 30
I use openMP and MPI but the result is confused
use  $ ./demo
the running time is 600s
but use $ mpirun -np 4 ./demo
the running time is 6000s
Hi there,
QuEST hybridises distribution and multithreading. You should only use multithreading when running on a single machine. Distribution requires using more memory (for communication) and additional steps for exchanging memory between machines over a network, and should not be used to parallelise simulation locally.
Hope this helps!
