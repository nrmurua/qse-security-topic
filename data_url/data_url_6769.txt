Dear Sir,
Today, I have tried the BV algorithm as discussed in P12 of arXiv:1804.03719v1. The result is quite strange, the probabilities are huge numbers larger than 1. The quantum circuit is as follows. I suppose that there are some problems in these related gates. Could you give a test on this circuit?

@xhzha thanks for reporting. I will check later when I reach my computer. Until then to be sure: are you using Quantum Programming Studio UI https://quantum-circuit.com or you are directly using quantum-circuit npm package in node.js? Asking this because yesterday we fixed issues with u2 and u3 gates. If you are using quantum-circuit npm module, please update it to latest version.
Hi, @perak, I just simulate the circuit on the website of https://quantum-circuit.com.  thanks!
Hi @xhzha ... I just tried it and looks good to me:

What is desired output?
If you have different results, then please provide me with: what operating system and browser (with version) are you using.
Thanks!
Hi, &perak, thank you very much! It's really the brower problem. Inspired by your answer, I have tried the IE brower, the result is OK, just like yours. Previously, I used the 360 browser. The result is quite strange.

@xhzha thank you for reporting the issue.
I will close this one, and open new issue for browser incompatibility.
