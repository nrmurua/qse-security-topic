I have noticed that when applying, for instance, Y1/4 on |0> Quirk provides a correct state (invariant with H) but with a global phase. This doesn't happen with X and Z similar operations.
You're probably noticing that Y^t differs from Ry(tpi) = exp(iYtpi) by a global phase. But Z^t also differs from exp(iZt*pi) = diag(e^(-i * t/2 * pi), e^(+i * t/2 * pi)).
In other words, the global phase is correct and it is also present in the X and Z cases. For example, note that the tooltip of the Z^(1/4) gate notes that the gate has a global phase, and that if you use "Make Gate" to create a 45 degree Z rotation without a global phase that you get a slightly different operation.
It's pretty common to be confused by this, because people talk about quantum rotations without really mentioning that there's these two differing conventions.
I see now that global phases also appear on Z and X, but global phase has no relevant meaning both in terms of measurement and processing interference. In fact in Heisenberg state representation (density matrix) it disapears. So, why Quirk does not suppress it?
First, because suppressing the global phase would mean that the X and Z gates had the wrong definition compared to people's expectations. Z would equal dial(-i, i) instead of diag(1, -1). This would make the output superposition display look wrong.
Second, because it's confusing to name a gate "X^0.5" and then perform "Rx(pi/2 * X * i)" instead, when those two operations disagree about a leading scaling factor (even if that factor is normally unobservable).
Third, because the global phase becomes an observable relative phase when controlling the operation.
Fourth, because in general it is impossible to suppress changes to the global phase, due to effects such as berry phasing (if you 'wiggle' the qubit, making small rotations not all around the same axis but that should equal the identity, you gain/lose phase).
I see... thing are more complicated than they seem... thank you. I have found this in relation to the topic: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/257824/global-and-relative-phases-of-kets-in-qm
Hidden variables... Hmmm...
