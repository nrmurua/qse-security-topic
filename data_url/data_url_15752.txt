When trying to run a pulse simulation, FakeBackend.run gets an Aer PulseSimulator, then calls its run by PulseSimulator.run(schedules, system_model) in these lines:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/7c8815390b1a79e76e040fbdd2b130d8b6e7d41f/qiskit/test/mock/fake_backend.py#L137-L143
However, the signature of PulseSimulator.run is actually
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/3f855b6006a18f31d6d3d6b9ff2e9f9d68066b64/qiskit/providers/aer/backends/pulse_simulator.py#L204-L207
so system_model gets passed as the validate parameter.
Run the new test added in PR #7019 in commit 2400d18.
Arguments are correct.
Pass system_model by kwarg.
