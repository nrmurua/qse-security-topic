mqt-version: 1.19.0
Docker Desktop: 4.22.1
When running the simulator backend inside a Docker Container, based on circuit transferred from a client outside the Docker container, the error message "Illegal Instruction" pops up, shutting down the Docker Container
The simulator is supposed to run a simulate the circuit, returning the simulation results.
After all the setup (Docker Desktop, client and server front- and backends that communicate across the Docker Container), simply hand over a qiskit circuit to the backend, so that it is simulated.
Hey üëãüèª
Thanks for raising this issue. Could you provide a little more details on your setup? Specifically,
Just from your description, I can't easily reproduce the error.
Hey!
The image is a custom image, created for a project which includes multiple simulator backends in a single container.
DDSIM is installed via an editable pip install upon building the image.
The error doesnt occur with the previous version.
Sorry for not being able to describe the image more in-depth. If your still unable to recreate the issue, let me know!
I see. Just some follow up questions. It's rather surprising to me that a local editable install does not work.
I might be able to reproduce the error based on the above information.
v1.20.0 is out on PyPI https://pypi.org/p/mqt.ddsim/ with a fix for the underlying issue.
