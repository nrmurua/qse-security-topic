PEP 561 says that any packages that ship with type information should have a py.typed file in their package. Otherwise, type checkers like mypy can't find Cirq. (FWIW I just did touch ~/.virtualenvs/.../cirq/py.typed, and then mypy type-checks the file correctly.)
Other than that, Cirq seems pretty awesome so far ðŸ‘Œ.
