Hi,
I tried to run the command python -m pyzx opt input_circuit.qasm in order to optimise a circuit but I am getting an error: TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not Namespace.
I could post the traceback but in a few words the error is caused by splitext method in circ2circ.py file, line 64:
base = os.path.splitext(options)[0]
In python 3.6, splitext method uses os.fspath() method that takes a string, bytes or os.PathLike object and not a Namespace object (as the error indicates).
options is a Namespace object though.
When I changed the  "base" variable's declaration to base = "output", in order to write the optimised circuit in output.qasm file, everything worked fine.
Another solution is to add the destination file when running the command:
python -m pyzx opt -d output_circuit.qasm input_circuit.qasm
Thank you.
Thank you for the report. It resulted from a silly mistake, which now should be fixed.
