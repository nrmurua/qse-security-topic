The device.specs object provides the T1/T2 times for each gate:
however, the actual gate times are not exposed in the API.
As such, there is no way of accurately using that information to compute the circuit depths (other than using the estimated ballpark values of 50 ns for 1-qubit gates and 150 ns 2-qubit gates).
Hi @tbabej , sorry for the late response. These times are exposed on our website's QPU specs page. Specs for the new 16Q QPU to come soon :)
It's much more useful to have this available programmatically
