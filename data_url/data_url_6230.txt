@padraic-padraic this may be related to issue #98, or something different. While trying to debug that issue with Sergey I found that the CH simulator will cause a segmentation fault sometimes for circuits for a test circuit with a u1 gate in it.
Run the following script, at a random point in the iteration loop it may crash with a segmentation fault (though not always).
It also returns the incorrect output (same as #98 )
The execution doesn't cause a segmentation fault.
None yet.
I'll run this example locally and see if I can reproduce the error, thanks.
The bug seems to be due to the way I cache the u1 gates in CHSimulator::Runner. The set of rotations was shared between threads but there was no barrier or single region around the calls to find and insert hence the stochastic segmentation fault.
It can be fixed by marking the rotations as thread_local. Both fixes will be pushed shortly for testing!
