This looks like a problem with the template. Where SIKE_P434_COMPRESSED or sike-p434-compressed should appear in the code as an identifier or part of a string, respectively, it is absent. This results in:

These constants and strings still end up being consistent across the code base so it still builds (and presumably works), so nothing's broken, but this should still be fixed.
Dupe of #75.
