Hi all,
I've been looking at your process_fidelity method along with your Process Tomography tutorial.
I noticed that in process_fidelity, you do not allow users to pass in a noisy QuantumChannel for target like you do for the channel argument:

If I try, I get the exception:
The reason I ran into this is because in the process tomography tutorial:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/legacy_tutorials/ignis/6b_process_tomography.ipynb
it passes in numpy matrices instead of Choi instances which ends up giving the wrong fidelities (and you see it's passing in the noisy Choi data for the 2nd argument which is target):
I came up with a little test program to explore this:
and I get:

It seems like you could allow users to pass in a noisy QuantumChannel for target if you add code to convert it to a SuperOp instead of always an Operator.
it looks like this was fixed at some point:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/a2193a5c3df131775e1b2d0f2f8fe31dc035ae0c/qiskit/quantum_info/operators/measures.py#L70-L72
that is, it looks like a QuantumChannel is now an option for both channel and target.
