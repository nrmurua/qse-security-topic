In some circuits with Kraus noise, if we print the sum of the probabilities of the qubits during execution, we sometimes get !=1.
If I print the sum of the probabilities after every operation, sometimes I don't get 1.
Should always get 1. Note that this bug is not view externally, but I expect it eventually will lead to failures.
