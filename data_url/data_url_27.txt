There is a runtime error when passing a single qubit that's been allocated with kernel.qalloc() to cudaq.from_state. The bug goes away when allocating a single qubit in a qvec kernel.qalloc(1).
Expect the from_state function to accept a single qubit that's not necessarily nested in a qvec. Or, we should pack the qubit in a temporary qvec behind the scenes.
Not a regression
