This code causes segfault. Not very consistent, sometimes I need to do more work in repl before it crashes, sometimes just pasting it in fresh repl causes segfault. Also crashes only if operator size is bigger than state size.
Tried same code with kron as operator, it returns error about size mismatch.
Found by accident.

Thanks for your report. This issue would be fixed by this PR: QuantumBFS/YaoBlocks.jl#156
