Hello,
I would like to program a circuit and then, print it's symbolic representation much like Mathematica / SymPy Quantum. For instance:

Or:

Is that possible?
Anyone ...?
It's not as well documented as it used to be, but the pyquil.latex section could be useful.
Note the warning:
For this to work, you need two external programs, pdflatex and convert, to be installed and accessible via your shell path.
Further, your LaTeX installation should include class and style files for standalone, geometry, tikz, and quantikz. If it does not, you need to install these yourself.
Thanks @genos but that is not was I was asking for  ... I don't need to plot the circuit in LaTeX, I want a symbolic representation just like the example I provided:

Sorry, @BoltzmannEntropy! I was confused by the circuit diagram in the “or” section of your note.
