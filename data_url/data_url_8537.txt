Using Time dependent Hamiltonian in mcsolve and mesolve product different result for expectation value for sigmay(). It seems to work well for expectation value for sigmax() or  sigmaz(). I wonder if dealing with complex number leads to this or there is another issue.
This is a simple code illustrating the problem.
Should be fixed in Pull #492.  Thanks for finding this.
This was fixed in #492.
