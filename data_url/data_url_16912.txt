When run on optimisation level 3, Qiskit tries to run a KAK/Cartan decomposition on 2-qubit subcircuits. It frequently suffers from an unrecoverable internal error when doing this. The error is produced non-deterministically; sometimes the circuit transpilation completes, and sometimes it throws the error. The fact that this is random is surprising to me.
I can send a wide set of circuits from the IBM routing benchmark sets which produce this error, if this is helpful.
I was able to replicate this through python -m unittest test/python/quantum_info/test_synthesis.py after recently upgrading to Mojave (this doesn't seem to be an issue on High Sierra.)
The raised error comes from https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/f1648dd9e36403f14ef844e3495d74925ff07557/scipy/linalg/decomp.py#L474  which suggests its a scipy/LAPACK issue.
I didn't see the same issue after making a new venv and reinstalling terra. Can you try installing in a new venv and seeing if the error still occurs? If so, can you also include the output of numpy.show_config()?
I think we have seen similar  eigh behavior here: #2793
This is an openblas issue with NumPy.
Closing as I'm no longer able to replicate this after #3884. Please reopen if you still see the issue.
