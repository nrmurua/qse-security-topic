Target gate sets are computed by looking at calls to INST. If the INST's are buried away, they won't get recognized. Two options:
revert the dynamic INST
allow INSTs to be discovered deeper in the call stack
I think the latter can be done provided there's a special way to define functions which themselves use INST. But it's something worth thinking about.
Just some added thoughts:
I think it's fruitless to try to do static analysis in all cases. Instead of more elaborate analysis, I'd prefer more elaborate ways to specify gate count estimates by hand that work for more complicated compilers.
