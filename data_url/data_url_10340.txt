It seems that at least on OS X the config file paths cannot include home-based paths.  For example, ~/foo/my.conf or $HOME/foo/my.conf.  If it is easy to support these it would provide some added convenience.
Isn't ~/Library/Application Support/dwave supported?
You can double check with:
Let me clarify.  In this library the call load_config("~/foo/my.conf") does not seem to work.  The problem seems to be that the special character ~ is not expanded before trying to open the file.
Oh, that is a bug. Will fix. Thanks!
