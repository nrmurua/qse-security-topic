Let's take a look at two QuantumCircuit objects qc1 and qc2, such that both of them have quantum and classical registers. If we append qc2 to qc1 and afterwards try to draw qc1 in output=text mode, the following exception may occur
Here is a sample code to reproduce
Important notes:
Produce a drawing of the circuit.
Either the line wire_label = ' ' * len(wire_label) should be changed, so that on the right hand side it does not rely on the value of wire_label from previous iteration of the for loop (and the if block), or the wire_label variable should be initialized before the loop.
I have already examined the source code, and can fix this, and create a pull request.
