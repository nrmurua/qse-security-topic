Installing qutip as an external dependency fails if cython is not installed since it's imported without checks in setup.py.
From what I can tell, this was an issue before (#426) and was subsequently fixed (#489) but then again broken (82e2095).
Sidestepping this would be great since for instance readthedocs to my knowledge doesn't allow running custom commands (like pip install cython) before installing dependencies when building a documentation that requires qutip.
