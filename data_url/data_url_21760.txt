Async co-routines have different reader limits. Related: #285
AsyncioClient:

AsyncioServer:

I would expect these limits to be the same. Is there any reason why they aren't? If I'm transferring this much data, is PYON not the right tool and I should use something else (like a client as mentioned in developing an ndsp.rst)
This caused me some errors when sending large numpy arrays (~2 MB of raw data) via PYON RPC. Actual code is too complex, but changing the AsyncioServer limit to ~16 MB fixed it for me.
No good reason. If you have better numbers, test them, and send a PR, I will merge it.
Note that the two code snippets you mention are not necessarily always talking to each other; the first one is for pc_rpc only whereas the second one factors out some generic asyncio server boilerplate. Look at the file names and not just the class names.
@drewrisinger Did you figure out better numbers and can you send a PR?
I used 16 MB for asyncio_server and that worked for my data. Think this is highly data-dependent, and I don't have a good handle on when it's worth increasing the limit vs moving to a different non-PYON protocol. The raw data that the numpy array was constructed from was ~2-4 MB of text, so it makes sense that 4 MB was too tight.
