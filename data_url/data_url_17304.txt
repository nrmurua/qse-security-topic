There was an issue in the previous version of Aqua, where calling draw() on some circuits would fail due to bad formatting of qiskit.qasm.pi. (see qiskit-community/qiskit-aqua#482)
It works fine now (since the last release), but not because qasm.pi is compatible with formatting but because of a different way of formatting pi. This still fails:
from qiskit.qasm import pi
"{:.2f}".format(pi)
returns TypeError: unsupported format string passed to Pi.__format__
So, even if it's not critical for now, perhaps it could be interesting to make the pi from qiskit.qasm.pi work with this kind of formatting, just like other constant pi from other libraries (such as numpy.pi).
I looked a bit, and it seems qiskit.qasm.pi is in fact the pi from sympy. And I'm sure symbolic computing is important for Qiskit, so it seems difficult to change from this side.
Yes qasm symbols are parsed as sympy objects currently. Is there a need for formatting those parameters beyond what the circuit drawer does?
I tought it was defined in qiskit, and was easy to do, that's why I suggested this enhancement, even if useless for now (it doesn't cause any issue for now). But now that it seems difficult to do anything from qiskit side, I guess this doesn't make much sense. We can close this issue, I think.
