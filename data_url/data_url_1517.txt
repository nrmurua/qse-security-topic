If one imports importlib.abc prior to importing cirq, no error occurs:
Suggestion
Probably you should add from importlib import abc somewhere in the Ð¡irq's code.
Searching on Google, I've found a similar issue in another project: grpc/issues/26062
Cirq version
0.13.1
Thank you for opening this. Please feel free to work on it.
