Basically, if someone provides a 20 qubit gate with a matrix and a circuit decomposition, cirq will make the very unfortunate decision to go with the matrix instead of the gates.
This is another reason decompose should only be used for a composite gate and nothing else.
Currently the simulators default to decompose first, so this shouldn't happen.
Still think decompose is dangerous and should be handled with care :)
