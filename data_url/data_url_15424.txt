Submitting a QAOA with a custom mixer which includes a mcrz gate with a parameter (even if it's only controlled by a single qubit) it throws CircuitError: 'Cannot bind parameters(t[1]) not present in the circuit.
This doesn't happen with crz or mcp gates.
Which ends up producing
There should be no actual output for this code; there isn't one when using mcp or crz instead of mcrz, and result should be essentially the same as it is when using crz instead.
No response
Although this talks about QAOA I think its more to do with the QAOAAnsatz from the circuit library which has the parameters and where things would bound. Hence while at first sight I was going to put the mod algorithms label on this, to deal with it appropriately when the algorithms are moved out, I did not since I don't think its the QAOA algorithm perse.
This should have been fixed by #11032.  Feel free to reopen if that's not the case.
