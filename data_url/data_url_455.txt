Currently, QLM noisy simulation (atos-qlm Accelerator) is only available via direct SSH access to the QLM machine.
This is due to the dependency on the qat package, which is only available on the QLM machine.
Latest update from Atos:
QLM 1.5 (released in December 2021), myQLM Power Access supports noisy simulations.
See the attached pdf for an example.
For XACC, we just need to update the noisy simulator handle to use the one from qlmaas.
