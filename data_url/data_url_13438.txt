The doc should show how to create a set of near-Clifford training circuits from a given QPROGRAM compiled to the basis {sqrtNOT, Z, CNOT}. Probably 1-2 different QPROGRAM types are good to show. It should discuss (briefly) why this is done; in other words, what step this completes in the Clifford data regression method.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
