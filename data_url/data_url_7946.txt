Following the work on #370, pulses should be stored as instances of a new Pulse object that can provide metadata about the control problem in addition to that offered by a lone ndarray. This would make it easier to, for instance, group related controls into one object, work with non-uniform timesteps, and to support distortion operators that act on multiple controls in a full-rank fashion. Perhaps most importantly, though, this would make it easier to change the internal data structures used should that be necessary for future improvements (sparse controls, for instance).
