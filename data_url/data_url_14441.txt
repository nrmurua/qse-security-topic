When trying to contribute I couldn't execute the command 'tox' to test the changes of a new pull request. They only work on some CPUs.
executing on MacBook with M1 Chip.
on terminal run tox

Matthew Treinish suggested the following and it works. "Delete the jax lines from the requirements-dev.txt file.
We should add environment markers on the jax lines to match what jax upstream supports so tox doesn't try to install it in environments where it doesn't work".
Part of qiskit-advocate/qamp-spring-22#37
I'm fine with adding markers to the requirements-dev.txt list for jax and jaxlib to avoid it getting installed on platforms where it doesn't work. We already do that for windows because jaxlib doesn't have precompiled binaries for it.
That being said I just checked the jaxlib page on pypi and there are arm64 wheels available: https://pypi.org/project/jaxlib/0.3.10/#files so I'm not sure what the source of the issue is here. Before we add the environment markers we should figure out what pip is installing in the tox venv and why things are crashing. It could be a bug in jax or a more subtle packaging issue with jaxlib.
