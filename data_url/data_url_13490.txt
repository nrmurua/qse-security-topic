There are Qiskit and Pyquil folders for platform specific functions and executors, but no folder for Cirq.
Create mitiq_cirq/ folder similar to mitiq_qiskit/ and mitiq_pyquil/ with mitiq_cirq/cirq_utils.py that includes the Cirq executors from the docs.
Based on the conversation from #552.
Hello @Aaron-Robertson, thank you for your interest in Mitiq!
If this is a bug report, please provide screenshots and/or minimum viable code to reproduce your issue,  so we can do our best to help get it fixed. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can also ask us on the Unitary Fund Discord.
That seems to be a good thing to do to make things less confusing!
