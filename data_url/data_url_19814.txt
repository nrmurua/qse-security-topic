Can we remove the readme from tomography and add content to documentation.
Yes, and once the doc PR does through I'll start assigning people to update those. This should definitely get moved to the docs.
Add the tomography documentation to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/master/docs/ignis/tomography.rst
Should be a mix of the readme and the examples. Should be usability documentation (not a tutorial).
