problems arise from
any ideas?
i can start (i prefer the last):
We could also attempt to work one redpitaya with multiple pyrpl instances, but I think we should simply forbit id. We can also leave the current mode of functining as a third (unrecommended) option in the popup box for users that know what they are doing.
The problem with a popup box is that users of the API won't see it. The problem with an API input is the other way around. Instead of the popup box, we can also have a parameter in the pyrpl config file that makes this choice for us. Then however the question becomes what default option we want...
