I want to install "qiskit-aer" with GPU and cuStateVec support. I follow the previous issues on this repository to install. And I think I successfully installed the qiskit-aer. But I can not import qiskit-aer correctly.
{'qiskit-terra': '0.22.2', 'qiskit-aer': None, 'qiskit-ignis': None, 'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.19.2', 'qiskit': '0.39.2', 'qiskit-nature': None, 'qiskit-finance': None, 'qiskit-optimization': None, 'qiskit-machine-learning': None}
How can I solve this problem?
Here is the link for colab. It shows more detail.
What is your error log?
I guess you can not install qiskit-aer that you built because !pip install -U dist/* finished with following message:
qiskit-aer is already installed with the same version as the provided wheel. Use --force-reinstall to force an installation of the wheel.

I execute the code:
!pip uninstall qiskit-aer !pip install -U dist/* --force-reinstall 
when I run
from qiskit.providers.aer import *
It showsï¼šNo module named 'qiskit.providers.aer'
And then I restart the colab, run again
from qiskit.providers.aer import *
It shows  "libcustatevec.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
It shows "libcustatevec.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
I think the above message is shown when the library is not in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  I guess colab does not apply your LD_LIBRARY_PATH configuration (os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH']=f"/usr/local/cuquantum/lib:{os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH']}").
Please try just copy libraries to /usr/lib64-nvidia/, which is already included LD_LIBRARY_PATH in Colab with GPU.
I do not think this is a good solution but I confirmed that it works in Colab.
@derwind told me that  -DCUSTATEVEC_STATIC=True can resolve this issue.
I confirmed it works: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/119Yx217cQoBazS56exLk5VSb9KyVuouk#scrollTo=E6EGA6TzI0gb
