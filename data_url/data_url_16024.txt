qiskit.algorithms.factorizers.Shor._double_controlled_phi_add_mod_N returns an instance of QuantumCircuit with the name "phi_add", just like qiskit.algorithms.factorizers.Shor._phi_add_gate.
Install qiskit-terra from master, create a Shor circuit and dive into the call-tree:
The QuantumCircuit instance returned by qiskit.algorithms.factorizers.Shor._double_controlled_phi_add_mod_N should be correctly named.
Change the name of the returned QuantumCircuit when constructing it in qiskit.algorithms.factorizers.Shor._double_controlled_phi_add_mod_N.
Solved with #6114
