Hello!
I tried to install cp2k 8.2.0 on my cluster, which uses CentOS 7.5, gcc 7.3.0, cmake 3.14.6, python 3.6.1, intel mpi and mkl 2018 update 3.
I used the script to install tools:
It gave me an error when config libvdwxc:
The error part in build/libvdwxc-0.4.0/config.log is:
It seems there are two problems: One is the variable type of plan in fftw_plan *plan; may not be a pointer, and the other is the compiler can not find the function fftw_ialignment_of;
I did a little research and found out if  I changed fftw_plan *plan; to fftw_plan paln; in the conftest.c, the first problem can be solved; and if I remove -lfftw_mpi in the compile command, the second problem will also be solved.
The detail of the succuss example is use the command mpicc -o conftest -O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g -march=native -mtune=native  -I'/opt/src/cp2k/8.2/cp2k-8.2.0/tools/toolchain/install/fftw-3.3.8/include'  conftest.c -lfftw3 -lfftw3_omp -lm  to compile the modified conftest.c program:
Is there some way to fix the errors I met?
Thanks
Thanks for your replying
FFTW is installed by the toolchain itself, and SIRIUS and QUIP are required.
Here is install/toolchain.conf
I removed the installed fftw and re-install the toolchain, here is the full output:
The flag --with-sirius=no should disable the build of libvdwxc, if you do not need SIRIUS.
Did you try to build cp2k from the current trunk (master) version, because some fixes have been applied to the toolchain recently?
