In any of the lock box modules (GUI, Windows binary), the output1 or output2 sections of any locking stage are blank.  They should contain a 3 state checkbox labelled "lock on" and another checkbox with "reset" followed by a text box for "offset".

Hmmm I have tried the same executable on a fourth computer, and it functions as it should.  So far the menu has failed to appear on 2 laptops, and appeared normally on two desktops.  I'm beginning to think its something to do with the display settings on the laptops.  Could it be weird scaling issues in Windows 10?
Fixed!  Turning display scaling off on the laptop fixes the issue.  I just have to turn the resolution down so all my icons aren't super tiny.
Microsoft's terrible display scaling strikes again.
Hi, I have seen the same effect before, but wasnt bound to the computer with the "bad" display (I have seen this once on a windows 10 and once on a Mac, I think). It would definitely be good to find a fix for this that works on any computer without human intervention like in your case @tymomboe . Possibilities to fix it that I will try are
One can try to play with the environment variable QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0 before loading QT (there is also a qt attribute somewhere), this would probaby recover the same display style as in windows 7, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35816944/improper-scaling-of-qt-desktop-application-in-windows-10
Starting from 1) with the opposite setting QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0, we should fix the QT settings that, at least, all items of the GUI are equally nice/bad. But maybe we are already happy with 1)
On my windows 7, the variable has no influence on the display properties. So I will need to find another computer first
