Periodic GW calculations in CP2K (https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.235123) have recently been detected to be numerically unstable when using large, diffuse basis sets. We are working on a replacement of the current periodic GW implementation by a more reliable implementation that includes k-point sampling of the density response and the screened Coulomb interaction.
Was this issue resolved by #1776?
@JWilhelm can we close this issue now?

Unfortunately, I see your comment not before today. The periodic GW algorithm is still under development. I hope to be finished next year.

If you like, we can close the issue. Once the periodic GW is finished, I will anyways put out new tutorials, etc.
