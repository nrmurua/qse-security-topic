The one on circuit does, the one in mux does not (also now called final_state_vector).
Actually I'm not sure the one mux should have this.  It already is a very odd thing to have something that modifies the meaning of the circut on Circuit.  It's another thing to have it on the simulation.
The method already has the argument - closing.
