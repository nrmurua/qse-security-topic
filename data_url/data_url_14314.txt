When plotting a histogram for two results, the legend is not showing up for the cases when the first bar has 0 entries for one of the results.
In the code attached, there is no legend for the simulator result.

Hey,
I have verified also the opposite case where all the counts are 00 for example, and indeed the bug occurs as you described it (11 is missing in the legend, but 00 exists):

The source of the problem is in /qiskit/visualization/counts_visualization.py, in the function _plotting_core.
I am intersted working on this please.
