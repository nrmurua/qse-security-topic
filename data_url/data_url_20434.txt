On my macOS, ./configure --enable-mcbits doesn't find libsodium, despite it having been installed with brew install libsodium.  Can you add a --with-mcbits-dir similar to the --with-openssl-dir and --with-gmp-dir options?
+1, I ran into this problem recently on Linux. What if libsodium is not in the usual directories?
I would suggest a --with-libsodium-dir.
