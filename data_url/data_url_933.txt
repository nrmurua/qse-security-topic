The histogram function has a default value for the fold_func parameter that calculates the integer value for the binary big endian number got from measurement results assuming qubits, not qudits
Take any qudit circuit and you will find below result is wrong (as per binary)
samples = sim.run(circuit, repetitions=10)
result = samples.histogram(key='out')
For above circuit res should be 26 but I am getting 7.

Cirq version
0.15.0
From Cirq Sync: need to investigate more. Histogram fn clearly is not working properly for qutrits.
Tanuj: There might be a workaround if you customize the fold function in the histogram creator. Right now it is default for base 2. Potential change to make the default for any base?
Doug: We should provide default fold functions to accomodate issues like this and not rely on the user. At the very least, requires some documentation on how to deal with this correctly.
