Unit test test_particle_hole.py was added to check particle hole transforms so we have coverage for newly introduced open-shell molecule support. While the particle hole transformation works as expected for Hamiltonians created from singlets and doublets it fails to extract the expected energy when using triplets.
The unit test currently has the CH2 triplet lines commented due to this issue.
Another way to see this is to use VQE with HartreeFock initial state and UCCSD. Run one eval e.g. using COBYLA optimizer with maxiter=1. When using PH transform the first eval energy result should be 0; with FULL transform it would be the HF energy but with PH this amount of energy should have been removed by PH transform so the first eval should be 0. This is indeed the behavior for singlets and doublets and is verified by the unit test. Triplets fail this test.
PR #616 should fixed this.
