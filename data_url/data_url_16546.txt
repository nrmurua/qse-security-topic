The latex drawer fails on an index out of range when there is a conditional on the last creg and cregbundle=True. This was discovered in test_teleport in test_visualization.py when circuit_drawer sets the default cregbundle to True.
The following code works with cregbundle=False,
and fails with this if cregbundle is True.
