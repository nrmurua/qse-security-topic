CI has not been triggered on master branch after the latest merge commit, for PR #1077.
See https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/commits/master
It may be due to the [skip ci] codeword that I used in one of the commits of #1077. My intent was to skip the CI tests for that commit but, since [skip ci] appears also in the summary of merge commit, this could have propagated to the final merge too.
Is there a simple way to tirgger tests? Otherwise we can do an empty PR.
@andreamari thanks for the information. I only know how to re-run actions on a job that has already triggered, them, e.g., by clicking the top right button on this page.
Closed by #1082.
