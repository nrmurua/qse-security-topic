ProgressBar is a good visualization tool when you have tons of jobs running in the background.
Now, the progress bar will be printed in sys.stdout, I wonder that is it possible to add an argument to TextProgressBar to print the progress on sys.stderr or the other handler?
Then, users can control when the progress bar is displayed. (I know that users can always write the wrapper to wrap sys.stdout to the logger but it seems to be a workaround.)
Thanks.
