I'm starting to use the kronecker product a lot (for kets only), and I'm thinking that using an operator may be very convenient.
Maybe the | operator?
Same question goes for the direct sum.
What do you think?
This is a good point. I'm just hesitant about the symbol | for tensor products, although I cannot come up with anything better. What would you propose for direct sum?
I implemented it and tried to use it, and it was actually not fun at all to use! Because of operator precedence, I had to think hard about parenthesis... So it's not an improvement in usability nor in readability.
Yeah, the precedence is lower than +, so it'll create a lot of issues... closing it.
