I notice that travis tests four versions of python, all on linux. Is it possible to also test on mac?
Unfortunately, the backlog of Mac builds on Travis for open source projects (https://www.traviscistatus.com/) is usually quite large. Hence, we would have to wait a long time until our tests would either pass or fail.
