The stochastic swap mapper seems to create a non-equivalent circuit for the following case:
Fixing the seed does indeed give differing results.
I run into the same issue while writing #1571. If this line is changed to 42, the StochasticSwap also returns a fully different result (in the key, not in the count)
@nonhermitian how did you fixed the seed?
Via the seed_mapper kwarg in execute.
The circuits are non-equivalent (different counts dict keys). But also it just does not swap correctly (leaves CNOTs between non-adjacent qubits).
