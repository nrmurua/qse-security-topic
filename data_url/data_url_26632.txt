I want to calculate XAS spectra by Gaussian and Augmented Plane Wave Method. I found [official tutorial] (https://www.cp2k.org/exercises:2017_uzh_cp2k-tutorial: gapw) and run cp2k with the input files of * Task 2 : compute the XAS spectrum of ice-1h *, which is not needed to edit. However, cp2k couldn't complete the calculation. Here is what I did.
Without any editing of the input files, cp2k said it didn't know MAP_CONSISTENT and aborted the calculation. So I commented out MAP_CONSISTENT.
Next, it stopped with segmentation fault error. In my workstation, stack size is limited within 8MB by default. So next, I made the stack size unlimited, and run again.
Then, it didn't stop with the error. However, it didn't finish the calculation even after 1 day progress. The system showed no error messase in the log and did not sleep. It had been calculationg sometiong.
According to the output of cp2k, it calculated up to XAS_TP_SCF WAVEFUNCTION OPTIMIZATION. The output was finished with following line:
Calculation of 7 additional virtual states of the subspace complementary to the lowest 160 states.
ice1h-xas_at * .spectrum files did not be generated.
I think this was caused by some cp2k's bug. Please verify this error, please.
This seems more like a usage problem, for which we have the forum.
