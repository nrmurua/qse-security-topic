Hi,
Basically  I would like to add to the documentation the fact that the bloch-redfield solver has a tunable secular approximation option as stated here in a comment in the forums https://groups.google.com/g/qutip/c/aHA9LjkjN9Q . I would also like to add a notebook to the tutorials where secular and non secular redfield are compared, with respect to a "true" solution which I would take to be the HEOM.
I submitted the PR adding this to the documentation, it is #2136
