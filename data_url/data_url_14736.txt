In my program (see below) I use squ() to add unitary gate into my circuit, print this circuit, run it and print result.
Then I want to print this circuit as qasm-code by using qasm() but an error is occurred, see below...
Please help me to fix this error
Run this prorgam
qasm() should be to return qasm-code without error
I don't know exactly but may be fix the current implementation of qasm()
Hey, I'll take a crack at this this weekend
@Zhuravlev-A-E does this output look right to you?
I checked the new squ.py - it issued the qasm-code and worked without errors!
Thank you very much!!!
In addition:
Unfortunately, the same error occurs when qasm () is called for circuit with the addition of the iso() gate:
The fix suggested in #4469 changes the class hierarchy and that sparked a small discussion on the nature/location of Unitary gates. I created #5011 to follow that discussion there.
Is it possible to fix this issue without changing the class hierarchy?
