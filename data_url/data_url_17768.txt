No errors should occur during import of packages.
Will this change actually eliminate the issue or will the code simply fail later when you attempt to actually use plot_histogram or plot_state?
This will fix the issue, no unhandled exception will be raised by a failure in connectivity check. It does mean it will fall back to the non-js static visualizations, but that's better than failing.
Ok I am still completely puzzled as to what the connectivity issue could be on my end to cause this. I have double checked that everything else works ok and I am able to run experiments so my connectivity in general looks ok. Could it be something with MixTex or Poppler?
It might not be an issue on your end. In the case of the visualization check where you encountered the error it's checking to see if it can establish a connection to: https://qvisualization.mybluemix.net/ which is where the js library for the interactive visualizations is hosted. In my experience the bluemix hosting can be pretty flaky at times, the firewall/loadbalancer might just be refusing the connection (which based on the exception type seems to be likely).
