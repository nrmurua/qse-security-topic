TFQ 0.3.1 has the following requirements:
cirq==0.8.0
sympy==1.4
nbconvert==5.6.1
nbformat==4.4.0
pylint==2.4.4
yapf==0.28.0
tensorflow==2.1.0
pathos==0.2.5
google-api-python-client==1.8.0
It is probably breaking because tensorflow 2.4.1 is not what it requires.
Thanks for your reply, I want to run a tfq program on RTX 3060. How can I make it?  RTX 3060 only suport for the CUDA 11.1,
Does tensorflow-gpu 2.1.0 can works with CUDA 11.1?

I don't think (someone can correct me if I'm mistaken) that TFQ 0.3.1 can run on GPU. Since qsim didn't add GPU support till 0.10 (which happened Jul 29 2021, more than a month after the release of TFQ 0.5.1, maybe the nightly build has something I haven't really been keeping up with it).
Tensorflow 2.1.0 works with CUDA 10.1. CUDA 11.1 wasn't added until Tensorflow 2.5 (according to this table: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu)
