Quoting correspondence with @mtreinish:
This is a similar issue to QPY too (it was something I mentioned in review on the AnnotatedOperation but forgot to follow up with a PR for). We need special handling for the operation types to work with qpy. I think the last time I tested with a clifford it crashed.
Adding QPY support for Cliffords is done #11495, where the Clifford's tableau is stored in instruction_params on dumping, and is used to recreate the Clifford on loading.
Adding QPY support for annotated operations is done in #11505 (which is implemented on top of #11495), where the base operation is stored as a custom instruction while the list of modifiers is stored in instruction_params.
