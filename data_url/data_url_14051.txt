Currently, if we have
We emit
And then that Wait instruction gets tied to the q1 and q2 channels in the QGL1 compiler. However, this seems to miss necessary Waits an any edges involving q1 and q2 or on measurement channels M-q1 and M-q2.
Until I figure out the proper way to handle this, I may just have the QGL1 compiler broadcast control flow instructions to all channels. That will be a sufficient bandaid until we figure out a way to properly attach other channels to those Waits.
