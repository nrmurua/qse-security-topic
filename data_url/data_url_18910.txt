There appears to be an inconsistency between the Python loop style (no parentheses) and the Java/C loop Style (with parenthesis).
For if/while, OpenQasm has:
if (bool) { body } and while (bool) { body }, but for condition { body }.
We should have consistency. Given the Python-like constructs already in the language (specifically the membership test a in b), I would advocate for removing the parentheses (or letting them be optional at least).
Agree they should be consistent. I don't have a strong opinion on with/without parens but I lean slightly towards requiring them.
I also don't have a strong opinion. I would be fine adding everywhere. It does made the code clearer. Does anyone else have strong opinions before I open a PR updating this?
I would also lean towards requiring them
Closing this for now. We can update later if the need arises.
