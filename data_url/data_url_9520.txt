The existing code is assuming that the modulation bandwidth is corresponding to a positive rise time. However, above a certain value, the value falls below 1 and then is rounded to 0, which causes issues when modulating the samples.
We should add a check on the modulation bandwidth values given to Channel and BaseEOM that raises a NotImplementedError if the modulation bandwidth is too high.
