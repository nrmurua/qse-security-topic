After an install in a clean environment (pip install toqito), the module channel_metrics (which is included in the repo) appears to be missing. I can't even find the associated folder if I run pip show -f toqito.
Right, the channel_metrics module is actively being added in 0.0.7. The current toqito on the PyPi server is 0.0.6, so that is expected. When 0.0.7 comes out, I'll update the PyPi server so that way the channel_metrics folder gets added.
I think this closes the issue, so I'm going to go ahead and close it, but let me know if something isn't clear.
