With the following code
I get the following output:
But I think that this means that the completeness relation of the kraus operator is not satisfied. Am I missing anything?
Matrix multiplication is done with @ on Numpy arrays - * is elementwise multiplication.  So the last error (your k33) is made a matrix that looks like
If you do k3.conj().T * k3 (what you've done) you'll get the zero matrix, but if you use @ to get the matrix multiplication, you'll correctly recover the missing component from the $\lvert 1\rangle\langle 1\rvert$ term.

Thank you, I didn't realize I used * instead of np.matmul, sorry.
