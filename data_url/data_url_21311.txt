We really need the three SYSREF lines only for a brief time during DAC initialization (board startup and when establishing a DRTIO link). They can be turned off at all other times, which may help reduce noise (and power consumption).
Someone with extreme patience for HMC7043 nonsense should implement and carefully test this. If they can come up with a 7043 routine that turns this clock on and off without causing any 7043 breakage, I'm happy to call it in the rest of the sync code.
We should probably look into this only after the current 7043 code is solid, to avoid adding complexity and debugging problems.
