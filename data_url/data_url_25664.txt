This issue is dedicated to implementing the Result.persist method. There are several auxiliary methods that need to be implemented in order to accomplish this. Planning documentation can be found here.
Acceptance criteria
Implement the following methods / functions:
@FyzHsn for function_filename and function_string_filename fields in the Lattice table, should those files only contain the lattice function, or should they also include the dependent electrons?
ah now I see those correspond to lattice.workflow_function and lattice.workflow_function_string
