How to reproduce the issue
The correct result should be
|2‚ü©
Cirq version
main  branch version
Isn't printing 0 the expected behaviour, given that dirac_notation is considered it to be a qubit unless qid_shape is explicitly mentioned - Code Pointer
We could give a warning when the shape is not a power of 2, when qid_shape is not provided.  On that note, there could be an error handling in place when the provide qid_shape and state vector is not compatible as well. Thoughts?

Ah, yes i didn't know you could pass in qid_shape. I thought cirq.dirac_notation should be able to figure it out on it's own but now that i think about it, this doesn't seem likely.

Yep
