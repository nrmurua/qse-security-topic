In the documentation of SPSA optimizer, the type for variable "skip_calibration" is marked as "float". Wouldn't it be better if we mark it as "bool"?

Thanks, it should be a bool as you correctly state. I do not know why none of the source code checking tools we use did not pick up on that - assigning False as a default value to something we say is a float seems like it ought to have been caught.
