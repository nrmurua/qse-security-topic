Description of the issue
Newer type checkers, such as pyright, pytype, pyre are faster, able to infer types implicitly, and catch more errors. Pyright in particular is also incremental, so doesn't have to recheck the whole project on each change, and plugs in well to provide autocomplete in vscode and other.
@mpharrigan To investigate the different options in Qualtran and develop an opinion. We can then decide to migrate Cirq if we find an easy to migrate and obviously better option.
Note that we do not follow pyright's convention for re-exporting public symbols https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/typed-libraries.md#library-interface and indeed that is the source of many of the errors flagged from qualtran
