WARNING: All the circuits I was testing were generated with initialize()
The circuit can be constructed by combining two or more circuit. But adding circuits obtained from initialize() gives the wrong result. When having circuitC = circuitA + circuitB what we get is circuitC = circuitA.inverse() + circuitB.inverse().
circuitC = circuitA + circuitB instead.
circuitC = circuitA + circuitB results in the application of circuitA.inverse() + circuitB.inverse().
No idea
Yeast

InverseYeast

Yeast + InverseYeast

The case below seems more complicated...
Yeast + Protozoan = ??? (unexpected circuit??)

This bug seems to be originated by the CompositeGate class
@ismaila-at-za-ibm seems to have worked on a fix.
Seems to be closed by #534 - @rraymondhp , could you test and reopen if necessary?
This bug has not been solved completely. I will reopen.
