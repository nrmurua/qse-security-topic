Hi there,
The python example notebook (resources/python/example/nuSQUIDS-DEMO.ipynb) has a glitch, that's why we can't read it. Is it possible to fix that?
It is a minor issue, however, it will be convenient to see the code and the results in notebook format.
Regards,
Samiur
Sorry this isn't working for you; we'd like to fix that. Could you be specific about what the problem is, at least at the level of what error you get from ipython/jupyter when you try to load the notebook? That could help us get at the problem more quickly.
When I open the notebook in my machine, this error shows up NotJSONError('Notebook does not appear to be JSON: \'{\\n "cells": [\\n {\\n "cell_type": "m...'). Note that the  current github page is also not responding due to the error.
I see, yes, the file does appear to be significantly corrupted.
Will it be possible to update the notebook soon? Thanks!
I have no way to test whether it actually works, but the file should be valid JSON again.
