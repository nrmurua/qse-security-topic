@garrison pointed out that we have lots of broken links across the Qiskit site, including the ecosystem.
This ticket is to find the best way to automate this, such as setting up a GitHub workflow. We should look into https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#options-for-the-linkcheck-builder and also what qiskit.org is doing.
See Qiskit/qiskit.org#3352.
We should use nitpicky mode with Qiskit: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-nitpicky
Fwiw, #10522, #10523 and #10547 were me starting to make progress towards this, although I didn't realise we had an issue about it anywhere.
Unfortunately, I'm pessimistic that we'll be able to get it perfect any time soon, because when the object-signature resolution happens in Sphinx, it tries to generate cross-references to everything involved, and that doesn't handle generics well at all.  The scope to improving that is likely to come as implementation of PEP 695 becomes more mature, but that's a Python 3.12 thing, so unless people add additional support for typing.TypeVar explicit mentions we might be a bit out-of-luck in getting full nitpicky enabled in CI.
(I still think it's a super worthy goal and something we should try to fix as many warnings as possible, even if we can't finally enable the warning in CI)
