For some reason, Lithium is not identified by QUICK. This has to be fixed.
Input:
Output:
Looks like Li gets identified as SAD guess is done for Li, but afterwards something goes wrong as it thinks there are only 9 electrons.
It's even worse for LiCl, QUICK thinks there are zero electrons:
So I went on and tested more. Cl2 also fails, zero electrons. HCl, also fails, one electron. F2 and HF, however, work.
