AttributeError: 'ControlledOperation' object has no attribute 'gate'
When I try to serialize a circuit with "cirq.ControlledGate(cirq.Z).on(q0, q1)", It shows the above error. (yes, ControlledOperation doesn't have "gate" : https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/ops/controlled_operation.py#L25).
Is it intended or am I doing wrongly?
CZ, CZPowGate is possible to be serialized because they are eigen gates. That means, do I have to use them always for serialization? What if I want to make C-ZZ operator and serialize it, how can i do it?
It should work if you create a CZPowGate instead of using ControlledGate(cirq.Z), but this may depend on which gate set you are trying to serialize to. It looks like we don't have a good way of supporting controlled operations in SerializableGateSet, so we will have to add support for that.
Yeah, this is a good example of how consuming gates is complicated by the ability to specify them in multiple ways.
Would it make sense for the serializer to check that an unknown gate is equivalent to one of the known serializable gates, as a relatively quick workaround? (May be not by default, but as an option)
Yes, what I am implementing requires conditioning any DensePauliString and any PauliSum. I've tried maffoo's suggestion by using ConvertToCzAndSingleGates & Ry() to use CZPowGate only, but it shows errors:
Could you give me more advices?
Ok, I found out a way. Close this issue and open the new issue related to cirq.decompose()
@jaeyoo Could you say more about the workaround to for your example? Also interested in ways to make more gates serializable with sympy symbols.
