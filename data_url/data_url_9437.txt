Here is an written example for the ground state:

The goal would be writting some wrapper functions to simplify the code.
I think we can just close this now, since we mention how to use Krylov.jl and other solver on our hamiltonian now. We may want to support converting our hamiltonian expression to ITensor definition in the future, but let's do that in separate issue
