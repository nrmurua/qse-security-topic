Currently only the recursive and eigenvalue-trace algorithm support OpenMP. It would be good to add multi thread capabilities in the repeated-moment algorithm. This might be non trivial due to possible race conditions created by the break statement in line 199 of https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus/blob/master/include/repeated_hafnian.hpp .
Note that to improve accuracy this algorithm can either use fsum or be done in quad precision.
Okay noted, rewriting it this weekend.
Solved in #120 . Great work @trevor-vincent .
