#11202 added drawer support to annotated operations.
However, for a gate with 2 or more qubits, its controlled-annotated version is not displayed correctly: the box for the controlled gate does not include all of its qubits. The code snippet in the next session draws a control-annotated CX-gate with 1 control qubit, leading to:
The box for the CX-gate should include both q_1 and q_2.
As explained above, the box for the controlled gate should include all of its qubits (namely, q_1 and q_2).
