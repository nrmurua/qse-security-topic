For calculation of various matrix elements, FluxQubit needs to provide methods returning operators in the full Hilbert space.
Current operator defs are primarily for a single degree of freedom. Using those with matrixelements methods will fail. May need to rename to avoid confusion once appropriate operators are implemented.
May be best to make single-degree of freedom ops internal by using a leading underscore in their names.
