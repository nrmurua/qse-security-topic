We attempted to run the following code:
and we get the following error:
We should be able to run the code at the line:
fakealmaden_model = PulseSystemModel.from_backend(backend)
instead of getting the error above.
Don't know how. Any ideas?
@taalexander
You cannot build a sparse representation of a system model that big. That is what the error is indicating.
Our ultimate goal is to get the last line "sim_result = backend_sim.run(qobj, fakealmaden_model).result()" to work, but we are currently struck at error at "fakealmaden_model = PulseSystemModel.from_backend(backend)". Basically we are trying to extract a schedule of a circuit "circ" with FakeAlmaden backend, then use this schedule to construct a qobj and run it with fakealmaden_model.
If we cannot build a model that big, what do you suggest we could do to execute the qobj and obtain the results? @nonhermitian
Since it looks like you are only trying to run a schedule on the qubits 0 and 1, when constructing the PulseSystemModel, you can do:
This will tell the constructor to only construct the model for just qubits 0 and 1.
