Description of the issue
Module cirq does not have attributes plot_state_histogram and plot_density_matrix.
How to reproduce the issue
put long logs in details blocks like this
Cirq version
You can get the cirq version by printing cirq.__version__. From the command line:
0.13.1
This is because you are using an older version of Cirq (v0.13.1). You can use cirq.vis.plot_state_histogram instead in v0.13.1.
Another option would be to consider upgrading Cirq to the latest version via pip install --upgrade cirq. Note that the plot functions were moved to cirq namespace in #4752 which was released as part v0.14.0: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/releases/tag/v0.14.0
I will close this issue now. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
