The failure appears to be caused by one test creating a 3D pyplot figure and another test assuming the default current figure is 2D.  My guess is that the tests are run in a different order on macOS.
One fix is to add the following code that clears the current figure to the example code in contrib/routing/device.py#L62:
Failure:
(Axes.text(x, y, s, ...) but Axes3D.text(x, y, z, s, ...))
Is there a PR out for this? It looks like a lot of PRs are blocked on it...
I don't have time to make a PR.  Feel free to make my suggested change.  If are other examples that use matplotlib, they should probably also be fixed.
I'm not sure the best way to prevent the test order from affecting other tests in the future.
