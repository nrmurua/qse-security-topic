Well, this lib is very nice. But I am so confused that how to make it work. For many node developers, it seems too hard 😢  . I can write some c code, so I wanna write it to be a module for Node.js. But, I really don't konw how to compile this lib. When I am testing minimal_sig_oqs.c, I try to use gcc to compile it like this:
When I run ./awesome.o
I will get a error:
I am so sad now 😢
@Elvenisboy Please see the detailed instructions on the Wiki on how to compile and run. First make sure that you properly configured the library: you need to run autoreconf -i && ./configure && make clean && make in ./liboqs. Then, compile with gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -I$HOME/liboqs/include -L$HOME/liboqs minimal_sig_oqs.c -ominimal_sig_oqs -loqs. This assumes that you installed the library in your home folder/liboqs.
@vsoftco wow, it is so awasome 👍  Thanks a lot. And so sorry that I only remember to see readme but forget wiki 😃
