The signature for getting a decomposition assuming depolarizing noise (the only example we have implemented so far) is
This assumes a cirq.Operation, but should be generalized.
The first and last steps could be handled with a conversions decorator in an analogous way to the converter for unitary folding.
The signature in this case would be something like:
The signature in this case would be
I'm currently in favor of (2) but would like to hear feedback.
Note: Such conversions could be handled by a custom type for decomposition dictionaries (cf. #369).
Summary from engineering meeting: Option 2 is the winner.
