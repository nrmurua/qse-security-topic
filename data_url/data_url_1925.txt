Description of the issue
QCircuit creates extra wires in diagram.
How to reproduce the issue
Here is a circuit where CNOTs pass over each other:
prints
If you run this through the qcircuit convertor,
it produces output
you can see there are extra wires here not corresponding to any of the four qubits.  Compiling this in LaTeX confirms that the diagram is broken.
Cirq version
pip installed cirq-unstable
0.9.0.dev
Thanks for opening! This could be a great first issue for someone in the community to pick up.
Here's the compiled latex for reference:

Hello @balopat @dabacon , may I try to work on this one? I presume I would try to modify the corresponding function under the branch 0.9.0.dev? If so, do I need some special qualifications to be able to see that branch? Thanks in advance for your help.
Hey @exAClior, thank you for volunteering! Yes, please, have a look, let me know if you get stuck!
0.9.0.dev means currently that that's the master version. Just checkout master in your fork, create a branch based on that and raise a PR against the master in this repo!
