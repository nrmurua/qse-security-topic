I have tried to run dashboard from Ubuntu 18.04 and noticed that the right-click context menu is not visible. for example
I tried to plot the datasets, but the applet menu that shows templates etc was missing.
similarly, all the right-click menu fields are empty.
is there any quick fix for that?
Can you post screenshots?

I found a fix.
export QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE=gtk2
Adding these lines to .bashrc fixes the problem.
Where did you find this? Looks like a Qt or Ubuntu bug?

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/176696/qt5-applications-dont-use-gtk-style-on-liux-mint
These two links helped me.
OK, well this doesn't look like a problem with ARTIQ. Good you found a workaround.
