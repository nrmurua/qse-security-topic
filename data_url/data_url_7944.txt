Measuring the statistics of electron transport though nanostructures has been found to be a powerful experimental tool to gather information about such structures. The functions in countstat.py return the first two cumulants of a transport process, which are associated with measuring the current and shot noise, respectively.  However at the moment they are a little buggy, and the current noise function fails sometimes, depending on the dimensionality of the system. As well as fixing this issue, there a couple of enhancements that can be done:
Making the current noise function frequency dependant.  This just requires adding a list of frequencies to return, and calculating the noise power for each given frequency ( at the moment it returns the zero frequency current noise).
Adding higher-order current cumulants.  This is a straightforward generalization of the current noise function, though for very high orders the expansion of a given cumulant in terms of pseudo-inverse and current operators can be a little complicated.  An iterative method for generating these can be found in C. Flindt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 150601 (2008). and C. Flindt, T. Novotny, A. Braggio, and A.-P. Jauho, Phys. Rev. B 82, 155407 (2010).
Calculate the large-deviation function of the current.  Such functions return the probability of observing deviations from the average transport behaviour, and have been found to give insight on a range of physical phenomena,  including bistability and criticality (and, more practically, life insurance!).
