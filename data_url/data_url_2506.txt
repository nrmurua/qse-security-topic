I need to run python 3.5.1
everytime I start with simple import cirq, I get:
ImportError: cannot import name 'TYPE_CHECKING'
Any ideas?
TYPE_CHECKING is not available in python 3.5.1(sphinx-doc/sphinx#4725 (comment)). Please upgrade your Python interpreter.
@Strilanc  Should we support these Python versions hence reverting TYPE_CHECKING?  I found some Sphinx code that does it: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/4735/files
Hi @omarcostahamido,
Unfortunately, I think this issue will be resolved by adding version 3.5.0 and 3.5.1 to the unsupported versions lists in setup.py. Thank you for letting us know this incompatibility was present. We use TYPE_CHECKING pretty extensively and don't intend to remove it. The type information we expose won't work without it (or at least won't work as well).
My recommended workaround is to update your version of python, which presumably requires fixing whatever is forcing you to use 3.5.1.
