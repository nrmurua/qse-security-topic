When I executed the 4th code cell in the 'quantum-teleportation.ipynb', I got the following error.
Does anybody have an idea to remove this error?
I tested it on google colab and it's ok.
! pip install squanch
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from squanch import *
% matplotlib inline
can you test it.
@cyasar
Thank you for your suggestion. It works on Google Colab!
I am able to run it using a lower version of python (3.6.3 in particular).
