It is useful to have the link to the project docs on the GitHub home page for this repo.
To fix this, go to the "Code"/home page of the repo. Then click the wheel on the "about" section on the right. Set the website to https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/.

Thanks!
@hhorii This operation can only be executed by administrator of Aer's github page, so please change the assignment of this issue.
I modified the weblink in "about".
