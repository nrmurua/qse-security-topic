Dear devs,
I'm currently trying to install Pulser on our HPC systems at Forschungszentrum Juelich.
There was some incompatibilities between pasqal-cloud requirements and the software we have in production at our site (for details see pasqal-io/pasqal-cloud#75).
These issues have been very quickly resolved by your colleagues, but when I attempt to install Pulser again it seems like the current latest Pulser release in PyPi still points to an old version of pasqal-cloud, prior to the fix I needed.
Would it be possible to post a minor update of Pulser to Pypi so that I can carry on with the installation on our systems?
Many thanks in advance!
Best regards,
Carlos Gonzalez

Hi Carlos!
I think we can get a release out by Wednesday next week (potentially Tuesday), would this work for you?
Sounds great, thanks a lot!
Hey @ccalaza !
v0.12.0 has just been released, so hopefully you'll be able to proceed with your installation.
Thanks a lot, it worked!
