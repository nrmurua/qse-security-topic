Currently the default folding method for the functions in mitiq.zne is fold_gates_at_random and this  produces non-deterministic results. This is not necessarily a bad thing but maybe, for a default behavior, it is better to use a deterministic method. E.g. imagine a non-expert user which tries for the first time mitiq without knowing the details, he/she could be confused by non-deterministic results. This change could avoid possible issues with seeds in tests.
Note that fold_gates_at_random takes an optional seed which makes it deterministic. (I guess the seeding should be updated in light of #165.)
After our discussion at the eng meeting I believe that this was closed with a decision to leave folding at random as the status quo.
Do reopen if there is more to discuss.
