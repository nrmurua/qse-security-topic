Say I have a server that has two types of signature key: one is an RSA key, the other is a post-quantum-safe (pqs) key.
Is it possible to issue the server a certificate that bound to both the RSA key and pqs key?
Because with such certificate, a client supporting only RSA can verify the server certificate's RSA key, while a client supporting post-quantum can instead verify the server certificate's pqs key that is more secure.
=============some extra information related to this question===============
an ideal certificate binding to an ECDSA key and a pqs key might look like the following, where the pqs key is added to the extension filed (but I have no idea how to implement this with openSSL):

another solution: a with two certificates--one certificate for the RSA key, and the other certificate for the pqs key
I'd think this is mostly a question regarding standardization. See for example the discussion at #300 (and all links there). Please chime in there (and/or point to standards documents facilitating such multi-key certs if you are aware of such documents: The implementation would/should follow from there).
Thanks for your rely @baentsch. I've read your redirection links, and find this link---State of Hybrid and Composite PQC in IETF Certificate Standards particularly insightful and helpful. If there is any official document related to composite certs, I will post them in discussion #300.
Discussion to be continued in #300 . New issue to be opened when implementation path is clear.
