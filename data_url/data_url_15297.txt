ImportError: cannot import name 'QuantumCircuit' from partially initialized module 'qiskit' (most likely due to a circular import) (/home/runner/work/qiskit-terra/qiskit-terra/qiskit/init.py)

I don't see any CI failures out of the expected?  The only CI failures in the last 6 hours have been in lint, except on your PR.
Ehh this is my code.  For some reason #8748 leads to a circular, just didn't see it.  Sorry.
