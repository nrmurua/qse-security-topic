Dear CP2K developers,
etc.
Finally, I did do test cases with nmr for non-periodic molecules like TMS and ethanol and cp2k worked fine.
Files are attached.
Thank you!
Sincerely,

By the way, the nmr regtests pass.  I assume they check the SHIFT files? However, I do not see any regtests for nmr with a non-orthogonal lattice?
