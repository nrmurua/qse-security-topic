Currently (in refactor code), the initialization of executors is being done in the runner but since we want the ability to run the runner in a docker container and we want to be able to use custom executors, it is better to convert the string of executor into an executor object as early as possible so that it gets pickled when sent to any microservice.
Thus, we should move the initialization of executors to the electron decorator, basically moving the line executor = _executor_manager.get_executor(executor) from runner to electron decorator.
