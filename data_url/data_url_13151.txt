Currently Mitiq is built using Qiskit 0.41.1, and Qiskit 0.43.0 has been released. Dependabot opened a PR to upgrade our support, but the tests are failing [example].
Resolution of this issue will amount to upgrading the qiskit version, and making the necessary API changes to qiskit functions so that code coverage remains the same, and the tests pass.
We've also ran into some deprecation warnings in the past in #1533. Resolving those would be an added bonus is they are still deprecation warnings in Qiskit 0.43.0.
If not spoken for, could you assign this issue to me, please? I should be able to take care of it this week or next if no one else is working on it, yet.
Hey Andr√©, I didn't want to reply until now because this is one of the bounties that are up for unitaryHACK 2023! Feel free to have a go. It's worth $80.
