Hi cyyber,
thanks for your reply..
I ran this on Mint 20.3 una.  I realize the instructions are for ubuntu 18 and I can certainly switch OS and try again.  I would ultimately like to set this up as a dedicated pool server.
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)
QRL Command Line Interface, version 3.0.1 python
SINCE  I got you.... The bigger issue for me right now is:
git clone https://github.com/muscleman/cryptonote-nodejs-pool.git pool
does not work...has me sign in using username and password then fails do to "username and password no longer valid--must use tokens"
SO I use 2 factor authentication token and still no luck..
I've tried Dvandal also with no luck --- but at least lets me download, fails during npm update.
The default cryptonote nodejs pool will not work. We made changes to these pool code to make it compatible with QRL node. Try this repo https://github.com/cyyber/cryptonote-nodejs-pool/#cryptonote-nodejs-pool , it already have qrl.json config https://github.com/cyyber/cryptonote-nodejs-pool/blob/master/config_examples/qrl.json
Please follow this link https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/pool/ to setup mining pool.
