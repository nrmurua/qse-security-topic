Following from #4942 #4939 :
Since make test is deprecated and not everyone checks CONTRIBUTING.MD for updates, perhaps the makefile target should emit a deprecation message? Are there other deprecated targets?
Is make test deprecated?
Actually 'deprecated' is too strong a term since we don't have plans to remove it as far as I know, but if tox is the preferred route for testing (for the reasons explained in CONTRIBUTING) we could emit a message to that effect. (I don't have a very strong opinion about it in case people think it's not a good idea)
Do you think make test should run tox?
Can this one be closed @levbishop @mtreinish ?
I would be in favor of adding a warning or something, but I don't think the makefile will be going away. I've been trying to get people to use tox more for a long time because it solves the dependency and install problems and sets up isolated envs for testing (basically everything I outlined in the PRs and the contributing guide). But, there are some active contributors who prefer using the Makefile and I've never been able to convince them to abandon the make test alias for unittest.run to manually invoke a test runner (whether it be pytest, unittest.run, stestr, etc).
Something like #5290 ?
I only use the make file.
