Description of the issue
It seems like the unitary of controlled QasmUGate is not correct with qiskit's CU3Gate.
How to reproduce the issue
As per the docs,

U3Gate corresponds to QasmUGate with half turns. So I am expecting the controlled version to correspond to CU3Gate. However, the unitaries are different for some reason.
Cirq version
1.0.0
Thank you for a detailed bug report! This is helpful!

If two unitaries U1 and U2 are equal upto global phase but not identical, then their controlled versions would not be equal upto global phase because the global phase of U1/U2 becomes local phase of CU1 and CU2.
A classic example would X gate and Rx gate, both of which differ only by a global phase. For example:
Note that the two controlled gates shown in the example above are still equivalent upto single qubit rotations (eg: prepend a Z rotation on qubit 0).
Thank you for the detailed comment, @tanujkhattar!
I think @tanujkhattar is correct about the root cause. Still, the fact that qiskit's CU3Gate(...) and cirq's QasmUGate(...).controlled_by(...) are inequivalent gates sounds like a problem.
