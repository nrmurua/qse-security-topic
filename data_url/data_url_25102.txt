I attempted to design a 25/75 beam splitter and ran into a strange interference problem.  I split the initial photon into 25%, 25%, and 50% beams without issue.  I also managed to rearrange a 25% and 50% beam into two 37.5% beams (of equal phase).  However, no matter how I try to merge those two beams through interference, I always end up with about 73% from one side of the half-silvered mirror and 2% from the other side.
At first I thought that one of the components was absorbing a fraction of the beam, causing the intensities to be slightly off.  To that end, I've tried using a Mirror and a Coated 50/50 Beam Splitter; a Glass Slab, a Mirror and a 50/50 Beam Splitter (in case the Coated 50/50 Beam Splitter is to blame); and even some Quarter Wave Plates, Double Sugar Solution, Mirrors, and a 50/50 Beam Splitter (using circular polarization and sugar in case the Glass Slab is to blame).  Each time, the result is the same: 73% leaves in the expected direction while 2% sneaks off at a right angle.
It seems like either there's something fundamental about interference that I'm missing, or there's a bug somewhere.
Analysis: The game reports the two 37.5% beams as (0.500 + 0.354i) and (-0.354 - 0.500i), giving them a intensity of 0.375316±0.0008545.  It reports the 73% and 2% beams as (-0.604 - 0.604i) and (0.104 - 0.104i), giving them respective intensities of 0.729632±0.0012085 and 0.021632±0.0002085.
Below is a transcript of the quantum state as reported by the status message.  Here is a copy of the level (pasted as .txt because Github doesn't like .json uploads).  Any ideas?
@Turtle1331 Could you attach a screenshot of the setup?
