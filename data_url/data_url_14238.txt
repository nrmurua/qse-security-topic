Qiskit/qiskit.org#2855 will add a new providers page (https://qiskit.org/providers) to showcase qiskit providers. In that page we will have a CTA for people interested in writing new providers to read a how-to guide. Currently, such content exist in a section of the Providers Interface module API page. We should migrate the content to a separate how-to guide and update the content if it's outdated and to include information of the process of submitting new providers information to be listed in the https://qiskit.org/providers page.
