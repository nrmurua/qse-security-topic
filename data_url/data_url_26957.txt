Hello,
I use Mathematica 11.3.0 on my iMac with macOS 10.12.6.
After installation following instructions, I check if the installed packages are running correctly by running the commands;
Needs["QUTesting`"];
RunAllTests[]
After running the commands, I found the following errors.

Could you help me fix these errors?
Thanks,
Ki.
Hmm @chriseclectic is the expert on this module, and without looking further, my best guess is that the problem is due to a change in NDSolve between versions. I think they disallowed variable names of the form a[_?NumberQ] for some reason.
In any case, I am just here to point out that if you don't intend to use LindbladSolver, everything thing else in quantum-utils should work. And also that the QSim module has a redundant lindblad simulator.
@khyee could you do me a favour and test if this runs for you:
I don't have access to 11.3 right now, but the above runs fine in my 11.0, and I want to check if my hunch is correct before posting a patch.
(by the way, all 240 tests pass on my system)
Unfortunately I only have access to Mathematica 10 so I can't test on version 11.
@chriseclectic yeah no worries. As far as I can tell, the breakage is undocumented and happened sometime between 11.0 and 11.3.
If the problem is that things like y[4] can no longer be used as variable names in NDSolve then we might have to move to something like Symbol['y4'] which will be a bit obnoxious because we don't want to leak tonnes of variable names.
@ihincks Thank you for replying.
Your code runs well in my 11.3.

Thanks @khyee . Huh, now I have no idea what's going on, and have no way to test atm. If you get any errors running stuff from LindbladSolver post them here, otherwise this issue is stuck.
