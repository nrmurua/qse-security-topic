There is a pulse simulator mock backend test failure in FakeBackendsTest.test_transpile_schedule_and_assemble:
This looks like a bug in aer. Specifically after #695 the calculate_channel_frequencies is still using dict based access despite not using a dict anymore. L220 in pulse system model module should be updated from if u_lo_idx['q'] < len(qubit_lo_freq): to if u_lo_idx.q < len(qubit_lo_freq):
I was wondering how this went uncaught by the terra tests (because we install aer in some jobs) and the failing test was introduced in Qiskit/qiskit#3797 and was put in the wrong path. So the configured discovery didn't find the tests. So we haven't been running them. This has been corrected in Qiskit/qiskit#4424
