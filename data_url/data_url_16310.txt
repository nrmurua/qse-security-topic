Using the lookahead swap mapper on a 20q QV circuit does not complete on my machine within at least 30min.  The others take 2-4 seconds.
Try to use routing_method='lookahead' on a 20q QV circuit.
I gave up waiting, but here is timings at smaller widths:

ℹ️ Could OP test out their code with the new qiskit-experiments module to see if the behavior still holds for the QuantumVolume class in ignis is now deprecated? Also an MWE would help a lot for the scenario OP is testing. I transpiled it for FakeManhattan for QV = 4 and confirm that setting routing_method = lookahead adds a significant delay
routing_method = None -> Walltime 376ms
routing_method = "basic" -> Walltime 275ms
routing_method = "sabre" -> Walltime 265ms
routing_method = "stochastic" -> Walltime 394ms
routing_method = "lookahead" -> Walltime 28500ms
Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
I'm going to close this as stale now.  The LookaheadSwap algorithm as described in the transpiler pass is inherently ~quartic in width (which ups to $n^8$ for volumetric circuits) because of its scoring requirements - the alternative is to pivot it to effectively just be Sabre with some lookahead of its own.  That's a direction we are interested in looking at for Sabre, but not for a mostly unused transpiler pass that generally has worse performance characteristics than the full Sabre.
(Technically the squaring of the complexity for volumetric circuits can be removed by using a similar relative-scoring approach as we took for Sabre in #9012, but the general gist of what I said remains.)
