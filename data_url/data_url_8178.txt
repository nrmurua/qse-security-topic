While using Qutip Latest version on Spyder with these imports:
from qutip import *
from scipy import *
import os.path
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pylab as plt
import os
I got the following error while calculating f_modes and f_energies"

Earlier in my previous system with older version of qutip and python this used to work fine
Could you also post your full code? In particular, your definition of args in
It seems that you defined it as a float number, but it should be a dictionary.
You are correct, I defined it as a float omega, I redefined it as
args={'w',omega} and change my Hamiltonian as:
H=[Qobj(H0),[H1,'sin(wt)']]
Then it ran successfully. Thankyou So much!
In previous qutip version it somehow worked with float when I defined as:
args=omega
H = [Qobj(H0), [H1, lambda t, w: sin(wt)]]
