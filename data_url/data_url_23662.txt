Need for a driver for the Keysight 33210 AWG:

please refer to the Keysight 33500B AWG which is probably very similar.
https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/instrument_drivers/Keysight/Keysight_33500B_channels.py
We have that instrument in stock. I'll see if I can make a combined driver for all the Keysight/Agilent Function/ Arbitrary Waveform generators.
But for now, we can probably be satisfied with the one we already have:
