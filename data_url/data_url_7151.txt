Hi, is there a way to export values of the amplitudes?
This would be helpful, especially when quantum register
with around 20 qubits is considered, and it is virtually
impossible to place a cursor on a pixel associated with
a given basis state.
Best, Jakub
quantum.simulator.getState() returns JavaScript array of real and imaginary values of the state (interleaved). You could place a breakpoint there or use JavaScript console to get the data for further processing.
