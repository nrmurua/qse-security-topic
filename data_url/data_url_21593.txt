When submitting a few thousand commands using DMA, kasli crashes.
I'm trying to program a few thousand commands using DMA. I noticed that this results in kasli crashing completely such that it can't even be pinged anymore. I suspect that this happens because DMA memory size is exceeded? If that's the case: is there any way to compile the gateware with a bigger DMA memory, or is it limited by hardware?
no crash, at least an error message

Anything on the UART log?
Nobody really invested in DMA support on Kasli so far, we just threw in the code that worked on KC705 with only minimal testing (also #946). M-Labs could probably fund it from hardware sales, if someone wants to work on these issues.
Looks like a simple out-of-memory error. The memory layout is currently less than optimal for the amount of SDRAM we have (too much of it is allocated to the kernel stack), so we should be able to get much larger DMA buffers. A number of things would need tweaking, including:
Should also have been fixed by 92fd705
