From @marcolincs
run twice gives error: Pin a of component Q1 is already in use. None has not been built. Please check your pin_input values.
Reason: the BaseComponent algorithm is assigning a new name at every call. Therefore, the second time around it does not know what to delete before re-drawing.
No crash
should the "overwrite_enabled" be generalized to get rid of anything attached to said pins (rather then by name)?
@marcolincs and I spoke.  There is a notebook what shows a work-around with the current repo.  It is shown in "CPW Meander Simple".
A potential solution is for QDesign to look at the pins in net_info table  and the options in QComponent to delete the QComponent before creating a new component.
This requires prior agreement of structure of pin inputs.
Also, this issue arose of for CPW QComponent, some other QComponents may not have pin_inputs.
For now, there is no immediate resolution.
@marcolincs Is this still a bug?  If so, please update 'how to reproduce it'
There is a work around.
