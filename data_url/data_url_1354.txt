Subclasses of SimulationState are "behind the curtain", so to speak - they represent the internal workings of the simulation toolkit, and aren't expected to be implemented by users. We should mark these classes as private (e.g. _QuantumState) to allow us to continue modifying this behavior post-1.0.

There's a SimulationTrialResultBase.get_state_containing_qubit that leaks the state class. Seems like that could easily be made private though. I'm pretty sure that's the only place.
Based on discussion in Cirq design meeting and the complexity of the proposed solution, we determined that this causes more confusion than it resolves. Dropping this issue.
