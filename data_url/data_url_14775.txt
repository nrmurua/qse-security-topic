There is an bug in the __init__ function of the RZXCalibrationBuilder class (in the qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration.builders module). In particular, the error occurs when the instruction_schedule_map attribute of an IBMBackend object is called:
The code above should not return an error.
The issue should be solved by replacing self._inst_map = target.instruction_schedule_map() with self._inst_map = target.instruction_schedule_map  in line 91 of the qiskit/transpiler/passes/calibration/rzx_builder.py file.
The argument to target in RZXCalibrationBuilder should be a Target instance, not a Backend instance - you likely meant target=backend.target rather than target=backend.
Thanks for the clarification, Jake! This fixed the issue.
