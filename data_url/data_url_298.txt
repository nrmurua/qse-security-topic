From triaging #336, we have run into an issue whereby the Bridge will take a callable kernel argument to a cc.struct passed by value, but the LLVM code calling our MLIR-generated entry points will pass a pointer to a struct.
Our MLIR Generated entry point function will have the following signature after lowering to the LLVM
while the LLVM calling code will pass a pointer to the empty struct argument
This leads to incorrect values in the kernelArgs pointer passed to altLaunchKernel.
The fix should be to update the signature in GenKernelExecution for callable cc.struct types to a pointer.
I believe this is fixed. The second argument is a pointer to a struct in both MLIR and LLVM.
