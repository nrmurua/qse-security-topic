It would be nice to be able to show off the groups/projects/papers using Mitiq and provide links to the projects.
I think a section in the readme would be just fine.
Collecting some here:
Great idea. A section in the Readme could link to a section in the documentation. We could add a subsection in this page in the documentation, https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/citing.html. From experience with QuTiP (http://qutip.org/users.html), it is possible that the list becomes out of sync with latest papers if one does not actively manages this. So, together with the list of papers, I'd add a link to some automated bibliography metrics tracker, such as on google scholar, e.g., https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12810395086731011605&hl=it&as_sdt=0,5 or "cited by" once that item is picked up by scholar.
