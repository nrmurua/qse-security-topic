pytest is catching quite a few deprecation warnings related to some of the third party packages in a virtual environment of the workflow run. This issue is to keep track of one of these.
cvxpy warning is currently an open issue.
My two-cents here is that since this is a cvxpy issue, we let the devs over there take care of the warning and update contingent on their progress. I would be wary of deliberately silencing any warnings that might require our attention.
@vprusso What's your opinion on Qiskit deprecation warnings? It's tangentially related to this issue.
Qiskit has way too many deprecation warnings. For example, see the warnings raised at https://github.com/vprusso/toqito/actions/runs/7459174748/job/20294616315#step:7:1478
Keep or suppress?
Hmm, I don't think we should suppress the warnings necessarily as they might be relevant. Yes, they are a bit annoying, but I think keeping them should be fine. I would just be worried if we did suppress them when they were relevant.
