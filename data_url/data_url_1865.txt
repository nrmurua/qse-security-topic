Description of the issue
_write_annotations method adopted the mesh.get_paths() which groups edges together to find the cells to be annotated. Under certain use cases, the method would group the wrong edges together that forms "empty cells" instead of the correct cells.
To reproduce the wrong result, use an input contain has empty cells.

@balopat Sorry just saw the comment! I opened this bug per @pingyeh 's request. Do you have a immediate example at hand?
My current implementation took out this part of code and adopted a different solution.
@pingyeh mentioned in our 1:1 that he wants to fix this bug and add rendering to the graph in this quarter. Please let me know if you are still interested in working on this.
Got it, thanks for the clarification - I'm marking it as triage/accepted.
cirq.vis.Heatmap has been refactored. I'm closing this for now. Please reopen / file a new bug if find any error in the new implementation.
