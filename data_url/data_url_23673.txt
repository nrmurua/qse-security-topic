The "Get help" page in the documentation /Qcodes/blob/master/docs/help.rst suggests that a slack group for QCoDeS exists, however no further information is provided regarding to whom I should ask for access to the group.
Most of QCoDeS maintainers don't have their emails publicly available in their github profile so I'm not sure to whom I should Ask.
Also there is a section that says "if you want to know more send us an email." But no email is provided nowhere in the docs page.
