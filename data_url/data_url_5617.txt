I'm using the simulator (only the C++ code) in a Visual Studio project (as also described briefly here: #1905). Works nicely in debug, I managed to compile de code with Visual Studio as described in the mentioned issue and with cmake by doing this change: #1906. As far as I tested until now, it seems to work fine... in debug mode. I tried to compile a release in Visual Studio, which failed with
Start a Visual Studio console project, include all necessary headers and libs, compile in release mode.
Probably it would need some additional flags in order to have it compiled successfully, I'm not yet sure why it fails in release but in debug it does not. Might be a VC++ bug, I'm not familiar enough with avx2 code to know what's the cause here... the solution below is basically equivalent code and it compiles fine, so it's probably a VC++ issue.
Not failing the compilation.
The problem is in qv_avx.cpp, the case 2 and case 3 in this for:
I replaced the for with
and like that it compiles the release as well.
I only unrolled the for, avoiding the switch inside the for, the issue seems to originate from VC++ but anyway maybe this change makes sense even without a compiler issue?
I could make a pull request for this. Either a new one or push to this one I already have #1907, whatever is considered better.
@aromanro thank you for your contribution. Please make a PR to fix this issue. Unfortunately, it is difficult for me to setup windows dev env now. I think your fix looks very reasonable.
