The mct gate has several issues:
For one or two controls, the function calls cx or ccx respectively but still requires q_ancilla to be set.  This should default to None.
For more than two controls the inputs are not consistent with the rest of Qiskit nor cx or ccx.  cx and ccx allow for int inputs.  However mct requires registers or Qubit class.  Yet in the two or one control case ints are accepted because they dispatch to functions that handle them.  mct should accept int inputs as well.  Note that the Qubit class is not even exposed to users.  Passing an int to q_target does not tell the user to pass qreg or Qubit but instead gives the unhelpful error "'MCT needs a single qubit as target."  Also note that in the one or two control case I can pass any value I want with no checking.  E.g. this works just fine
Try to use the mct gate in the same manner as other gates.
The gate should behave the same as other gates.
With the recent merge of #4082 two of your points have been addressed, namely q_ancilla defaults to none and one can use integers as indices. However there's still no check on the ancilla input, if no ancilla is required (if one is required, checks are implicitly done on appending the gate). I'll open a PR to fix this.
