environment variables in tests.yml are not being set correctly
I believe the correct "recommended platform" is Ubuntu 18.04 / Python 3.8 / Dask
the matrix.container for this platform is ghcr.io/agnostiqhq/covalent-dev/ubuntu18-py38:latest
however the workflow is looking for python:3.8-bullseye, so RECOMMENDED_PLATFORM is always empty
also, there's a double == where there should be a single =

Open any PR with passing tests, like #1157
RECOMMENDED_PLATFORM should be true for  Ubuntu 18.04 / Python 3.8 / Dask
match on ghcr.io/agnostiqhq/covalent-dev/ubuntu18-py38:latest instead of python:3.8-bullseye
agree here; should be ubuntu20-py38 though
