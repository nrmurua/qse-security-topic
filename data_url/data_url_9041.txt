It would be cool if it was possible to save and load stim tableaus.
I am interested in using a list of stim tableaus that I append to a circuit as gates. However, producing these gates requires external packages that I do not want to rely on anymore. Fortunately, the list of tableaus is always the same, so I want to save the list to directly load tableaus and use later.
I tried saving a tableau using pickle.dump, but I get TypeError: cannot pickle 'stim.Tableau' object. Is there a way to save and load stim tableaus?
You can use repr(tableau) to get a valid python expression evaluating to the tableau. You can save that string and eval it later with stim imported as a janky way of serializing the tableau. Using eval on data read from a file isn't a great idea for security reasons, but then again neither is using pickle.
Pybind11 does allow me to add pickle support... I'll look into doing it for next version.
Thank you! this works well.
