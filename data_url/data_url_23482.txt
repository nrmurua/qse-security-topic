We are using autodocsumm to generate helpful summary tables for modules classes and attributes.
However this triggers a warning and skips the member for inherited instance attributes. I bit of debugging using the
most verbose setting of sphinx with $env:SPHINXOPTS = "-v -v -v " reveals the generated code for this.
It turns out that autodocsumm generates the correct code using the autosummary extension. However, this triggers a bug in sphinx
sphinx-doc/sphinx#9884
In #4273 I have tried working around this by converting instance attributes to properties. While this is often a good solution this does not work well for Parameters that are assigned using self.myparam = Parameter(...) in instrument super classes such as the ones done in #4371. This means that we cannot document inherited instruments using autodocsumm without a propper fix
To debug this I created a project here https://github.com/jenshnielsen/debugproject doing things but without any extra dependencies
Currently worked around using a fork of Sphinx. Will close when this has made it into an official release and we are using that
