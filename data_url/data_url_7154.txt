Where are the unbundled js and css files. css/codemirror-bundle.css, js/bootstrap_js-bundle.js, js/codemirror-bundle.js, js/jquery-bundle.js, and js/threejs-bundle.js are bundled together using files not present in the repo. There also is no documentation on how these files are bundled together.
The unbundled files are completely redundant: the bundles are concatenated bunches of files, with headers in the form like:
//third_party/javascript/jquery/v2_0_3/jquery-2.0.3.min.js
so it is obvious which versions of the libraries the files come from.
