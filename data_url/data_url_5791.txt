Simulation fails when circuit contains metadata.

Simulation should succeed. The metadata should be handled according to https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.html#qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit, which says
metadata (dict) â€“ Arbitrary key value metadata to associate with the circuit. This gets stored as free-form data in a dict in the metadata attribute. It will not be directly used in the circuit.
None (yet).
@hhorii For this one it might be better to not attempt to serialize the header information at all, and instead store it on the python side and add it back to the results after execution.
