This is definitely a bug in DBCSR. Can I ask you which compiler you are using?
That's the only compiler we don't test and it is actually the only one that does good checkings... I've actually fixed in DBCSR. Could you test it?

Recompiler CP2K
I will update DBCSR in CP2K with a new release next week.
Sorry, sorry, I was using the alises:
(co is an alias for checkout, sorry!)
Concerning nagfor, I know the compiler, but we don't have any license...
BTW, if you are interested, we are organizing this event: https://tcevents.chem.uzh.ch/event/12/
Maybe, you can present nagfor there...
I believe this issue may be closed.
