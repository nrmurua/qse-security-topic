I was trying few gates. Not sure if it's a real issue however Bloch sphere representation of both operations below is the same? Am I missing anything?
op1: X|0>
op2: Y|0>
Further if I modify the operations by adding another H gate for both operations, they also show same Bloch sphere representation.
That's the correct behavior. The two states are equal up to global phase.
Thanks for the confirmation. Could you guide on how to show complex part on the bloch sphere as:
X|0>= |1> and Y|0> = i|1>
I tried searching any good article about this, appreciate any information.
The bloch sphere doesn't show that information, by design.
