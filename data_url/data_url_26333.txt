Dear CP2K developers,
is that possible to add the rotationally invariant DFT+U scheme with explicit U and J, as introduced by Liechtenstein?
Liechtenstein scheme
To my knowledge, semiconducting MnO2 will open its band gap only if the explicit exchange interaction (J) is considered.
Hybrid functional is also nice, but it will be rather expensive for large systems.
See comparison between (a) and (c) in this paper (doi:  10.1103/PhysRevB.86.205126)

@mattatlincoln Great to learn about that. Looking forward to the PR.
