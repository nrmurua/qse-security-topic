Ideally would like the server mode to be indestructible.
Is there an example of this @notmgsk ?

@notmgsk Is that blowing the stack? Do you have output? I'm running it right now and it's been going for a good while and it hasn't done any damage.
@stylewarning
perhaps this crash is only visible on JQE-grade workstations
It is on a pretty meager VPS. Still
That's not a stack issue, that's heap exhaustion. Is that what you mean?
I never said stack
I think we ought to put some nice checks in places that are prone to allocate a bunch, like allocation of matrices or allocation of wavefunctions.
