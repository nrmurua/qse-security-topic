plot_state_hinton isn't plotting all matrix components for computational basis states.
Plot a computational basis state on any number of qubits

It should look like the hinton version of hte city plot, but there are not enough ticks or entrys on the real part of the plot. It is only plotting the one non-zero component.

I have fix for this in my old PR (not reviewed for long time)
