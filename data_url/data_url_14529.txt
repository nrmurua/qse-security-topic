The rescale_cr_inst method in qiskit.transpiler.passes.calibration.builders.RZXCalibrationBuilder says the area of the Gaussian part of the input GaussianSquare pulse is

where
(which is consistent with the paper describing the original idea for this transpiler pass) but I am not sure if this is correct. There are two issues:
Unless I'm missing something, I think the area of the Gaussian part should instead be

where b = .
That being said, there is only a minor difference in the actual pulses that are generated using both formulae. I ran schedules of an RZX gate with various angles using both implementations on ibmq_bogota, and saw negligible differences in the result.
No reproduction is necessary.
This line
should instead be
No response
