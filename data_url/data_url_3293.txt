Attempting to use conda to install pyquil into an environment with Python greater than 3.8 (i.e. 3.9-3.11) will fail. This is because pyquil depends on rpcq, which depends on msgpack-python<1.0. msgpack-python 3.9 support begins with version 1.0.
For additional context, see the relevant rpcq issue: rigetti/rpcq#118.
This should be solved by rigetti/rpcq#156 and rpcq == 3.11.0. Please let us know if that's not the case.
