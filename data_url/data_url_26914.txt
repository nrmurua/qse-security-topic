For example here: https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/runs/21516830
The users can't possibly know what actually failed or what they would have to do to remedy the situation.
Furthermore, clicking the view more details leads back to the (almost) same page.
I changed the message. See e.g.: https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/pull/34/checks?check_run_id=22415485
In the future I could also add a link to some wiki page for more help.
but the link still points to the same page, doesn't it?
Yes, it seems I can not remove that link. So, the best thing would be if we had a wiki page with instructions to which we could link.
https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/wiki/CP2K-CI#git-history-contains-merge-commits if you can use a variable in the link (for example the name of description of the check), otherwise simply link to https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/wiki/CP2K-CI#checks ?
Ok, that small persisting link at the bottom now always points to https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/wiki/CP2K-CI.
I moved the links that actually relate to the test results to the output section where I can use Markdown. Have a look:
looks good, thanks!
