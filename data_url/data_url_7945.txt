The usage of the tensor_contract function is explained in QuTiP Example: Superoperators, Pauli Basis and Channel Contraction.
It is explained in terms of the graphical notation in http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6950. However, there is no figure explaining how the "tensor wires" are numbered. In the notebook it says "Numbering the tensor wires from 0 to 3, this corresponds to a tensor_contract argument of (1, 3)." But it is not clear what the convention is... does the numbering follow in an anticlockwise fashion, starting with 0 at the top left?
A figure in the notebook showing the numbering convention would be extremely helpful.
I agree, the current documentation isn't clear. I'll work on getting better documentation up soon. Thanks for the report!
Looking into the issue in more detail, I think that the documentation wasn't just misleading but wrong: because QuTiP uses the column-stacking notation, the order of dims for type='super' doesn't have the same meaning as for type='oper' or for vectors. In particular, the column-stacking basis maps |i><j| to |j> |i>, such that the order of the tensor indices for superoperators is swapped from the ordering [left, right] that is used by QuTiP's dims notation. I'll break this out into another Issue, but I think the simplest way of handling it is to keep dims the same as it is now (I don't want to break that, for crying out loud), but to transform the arguments to _tensor_contract_dense if the order of dims doesn't match the order that we need to pass to np.reshape.
This problem has since gotten worse. The linked notebook is no longer available. I'm going to update the documentation with the numbering convention.
