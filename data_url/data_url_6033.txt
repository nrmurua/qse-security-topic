Add parsing of terra diagonal gate into a diagonal unitary gate for simulation.
Aer expects diagonal gates as unitary with a 1xD matrix:
Terra assembles diagonal gates to qobj that looks like
So we just need to add a case to the json op parsing that converts the terra case to the supported Aer instruction
