Transpiler generates a wrong circuit when an original circuit has a qubit that has no gate.
Ancilla bit is added, and the number of qubits increases.
I think the bug is due to VF2 transpiler-pass related to 62670da.
When there are qubits without gates, and there is a missing gap in the placement to the real bits (e.g. 0,3,4 are assigned and 1,2 are not assigned), an ancilla bit will be added on its own.
There seems to be two ways to fix it.
I'd like to know opinions which is better.
