Hello @ikkoham, as we discussed during the partial transpose PR, I and @PayalSolanki2906  would like to create a new function in Qiskit that calculates both the negativity and logarithmic negativity, which are important quantum entanglement measures. We believe that this function would be a useful addition to the qiskit.quantum_info.states.measures module. Before we proceed, we would like to confirm with you if you agree with our approach. If you do, we will create a new PR for this feature. Thank you for your guidance.
Sorry for lazy reply. Yes, qiskit.quantum_info.states.measures is fine.
