There are not any files when i install artiq 3.6. How can I build a normal environment?
You also need to install the artiq package.
How to install artiq package now? The command "conda create -n artiq-main artiq-kc705-nist_clock"  is install everything before.
activate artiq-main then conda install artiq
@whitequark Is there a problem with the dependency of the board packages?
@whitequark Can be reproduced (on Linux); the board package no longer installs artiq.
