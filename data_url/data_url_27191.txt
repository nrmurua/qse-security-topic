QCi offers access to its devices through Qatalyst. The API supports minimization of QUBOs and Ising Hamiltonians. The maxcut benchmark would be a good one to implement.
The starting with the code for ocean provides a quick path to implementing this. The package qci-client on PyPI is a wrapper for the Qatalyst REST API.
I have done this already and will submit a PR for it.
