Not sure yet what this would look like.
I agree this is absolutely necessary. I don't know what you think is so fundamental about half turns though. How would having "rads" as a symbol be any different? Do you mean that you don't know what you'd output in the ASCII diagrams?
This will be fixed by fixing #393
Fixed by switch to sympy
