OpenQL print_options function does not working.
The following snippet should print the options of openql. The snippet does nothing.
This is OpenQL version 0.5.1 . The ql.get_version() correctly returns "0.5.1".
@AdriaanRol this is strange as with me this prints the options, as you can see in the screen shot below:

@imranashraf , I just tested this on the latest released version (0.5.1) and I do not see the problem anymore. Maybe this has something to do with #171 but since it does not reproduce I will close the issue. Thanks for looking into it.
