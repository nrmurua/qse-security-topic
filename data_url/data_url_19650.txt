RabiFitter raises the scipy warning:
/Users/dpuzzuoli/anaconda3/envs/QiskitDev/lib/python3.7/site-packages/scipy/optimize/minpack.py:795: OptimizeWarning: Covariance of the parameters could not be estimated category=OptimizeWarning)
and sets _params_err to np.inf for each parameter.
It is coming up when Rabi data generated on Armonk using rabi_fitters calibration routine from ignis is being used to instantiate the RabiFitter. This can be seen in the pulse simulator
tutorial.
I'm not sure exactly what the 'correct behaviour' should be in this case. Note: the parameters are being fit well (at least visually), it is only the computation of the errors that is causing a problem.
There seems to be an inconsistency in the way curve_fit handles different fitting methods:
As a potential quick fix, I tried switching to one of the other curve_fit methods by passing an optional method argument to curve_fit, but the other methods are not as good as lm for unconstrained problems (I had to put the initial guess very close to the values found by lm before they would work).
So, I think one potential solution is:
