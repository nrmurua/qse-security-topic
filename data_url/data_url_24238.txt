Just noticed that the links at the top dont all work:
Notably when I click tutorials

This is because you need to overload the layout.html file used by the theme.  The theme by default is set for the main docs.   It needs to go in the _templates folder.
See for example here: https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners/partners/tree/main/docs/_templates
Thanks @nonhermitian I was just emailing you about that!
