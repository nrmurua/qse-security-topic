Current Problem
Setting sampler.parameters['beta_range'] does not affect the sample() method
Proposed Solution
Parse the parameter.
This is in spirit of dwave-hybrid's runnables' behavior where .run() params override params set during block construction, but are overridden themselves with input state values.
