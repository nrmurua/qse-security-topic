Currently a data set can run in one of 3 modes:
I think the data set mode is currently mixing a few bits of information about the data set:
Today we make some assumptions about the allowable combinations of these mode attributes. In the future, we may want to allow more combinations.
This should get folded into a broader issue covering distributed data sets, which would deal with things like "slice" data sets, multiple update sources, data sources/publishers and subscribers, data set subscribers, data set aggregation, etc., etc.
I added a thumbs up, but part of the issue is not long-term I think. Making the dataset more usable outside a loop is on the v0.1 list #265.
To give a concrete example: it is not possible to use the qcodes Loop with combined parameters (#111). At Delft we solve this by writing our own loop, and then storing the data in manually constructed Dataset. This does work, but not with the data_manager (e.g. only the Local mode works)
(note: adding the combined parameter to the qcodes Loop is only a partial solution, I have more examples of loops I want to do that are not (yet) supported by qcodes)
