I might be missing something, but when I try to implement a controlled H gate on a PyQVM and execute it, the system crashes.
Operating System: MacOS Catalina 10.15.4
Python Version (python -V): Python 3.7.8
Quilc Version (quilc --version): 1.22.0 [cb8ba42]
QVM Version (qvm --version): 1.17.1 [cf3f91f]
Python Environment Details (pip freeze or conda list):
I have the same issue with Controlled X. But it is strange Pyqvm can work with CNOT. CNOT should be the same gate with Controlled X, right?
