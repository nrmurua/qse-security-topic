@basnijholt and me tried to make a conda recipe to install QCoDeS (conda-forge/staged-recipes#1806).  However it was noted by one of the maintainers of conda-forge that there is an inconsistency in the docs of QCoDeS:

The README says this package is compatible with python 3.5+, but the setup.py pypi metadata indicates 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 are supported. The docs say only 3.4 and 3.5.
What version of python does QCoDeS support?
