Consider the following code:
When run in a Jupyter notebook, as per the tutorial on http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-bloch.html, the Bloch sphere is immediately displayed in the cell output. However, nothing is displayed (no matplotlib window opens) when this code is run as a standalone script from the terminal, or even in IPython. For this, an additional call to plt.show() is required.
I understand how this behaviour could be useful when moving code that has been developed in a notebook into a standalone script, as plt.show() is a blocking command. However, I still see this as inconsistent as we get distinctly different results depending on where the code is being run.
If this is indeed intentional behaviour, might I suggest a note in the tutorial/API documentation? At present, there is no way to tell that this is what happens and if this is consistent.
(It is possible that this is specific to my OS/environment, so I can provide those details if necessary)
We can potentially work-around this behavior by including a plt.pause() statement right after the show statement in the bloch.show() code. It is a hacky way to display the figure and it will keep displaying as long as the code runs. This will ensure that you do not need to use plt.show().
This works for me with QuTiP 4.6.2.
Another Bloch sphere rendering issue is being worked on in #1619, but I believe it is unrelated so I am closing this issue. Please comment or reopen if there is more to report.
