The ComputeUncompute  (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/c29e938c2ba1c359a0a3268679c68f3237b2c1b7/qiskit/algorithms/state_fidelities/compute_uncompute.py#L29C7-L29C23) is a necessary ingredient in several applications like QML and computing excited states, for example.  The routine should be moved to the circuit library, taking two circuits as inputs, U, V and returning the circuit that computes the overlap $\langle 0|V^{-1}U|0\rangle$.  A more descriptive name, e.g. UnitaryOverlap, or the like, should also replace the current name to ease in understanding.
This function would also have to re-parameterize the unitaries if it was called with the same circuit input in both arguments and add measurements, so that the fidelity could be computed as
A good point about the unitaries that needs to be worked out.  However, I do not think measurements need or should be added.  For example if the projectors discussed in #10587 get implemented, then it could be passed to the Estimator.
