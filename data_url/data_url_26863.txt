Hello,
I'm trying to use a manybody potential between a metallic slab and water molecules in FIST but I would also need to use a simple Lennard-Jones potential to govern my water/water interactions.
Unfortunately, it would seems that the neighbour list building went badly between those modules because as long as my manybody potential (here, Tersoff) is present in the input, some of the Oxygen/Oxygen Lennard-Jones interactions are ignored.
Moreover, the verlet_skin parameters starts switching on or off some of these interactions.
For an example, I looked at two couples of water molecules away from my Pt slab and distant for each other.
the oxygens of only one of my water couple are experiencing LJ interaction from each others while the others doesn'tfeel any forces at all
with no others changes, it is the second water couple that undergoes LJ interaction but not the first one anymore.
with no manybodypotential, both couples are resenting LJ interactions.
I have observed the same exact behavior with a Williams potential instead of a Lennard-Jones. I'm joining the example input in the message.
This might have been fixed by 46f1fb8.
This has probably been fixed by #1343.
