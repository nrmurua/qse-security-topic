I am following the present documentation at qiskit.org here https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.visualization.plot_state_hinton.html#qiskit.visualization.plot_state_hinton
but on running the same code, it gives the following error
However, it does gives a plot

but this plot is not according to the one given on the documentation
I think this error is because of the matplotlib version 3.3.
Got the error on matplotlib v3.3. Maybe its isolated to that particular version. Its working fine on prior versions (tested on matplotlib v3.2)
