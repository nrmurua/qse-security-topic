Description of the issue
When I set clear_span to negative, PointOptimizationSummary result in an infinite loop
How to reproduce the issue
It also happens when I set clear_qubits to some unregistered qubits. I think it should give an exception instead of running endlessly.
Cirq version
0.9.0
Thanks for filing this issue! I agree that the right solution here would be to validate the values of clear_span and clear_qubits in the PointOptimizationSummary constructor. You're welcome to open a PR with the fix, or one of our maintainers should get to it within a week.
Should clear_span allow for 0 to be a valid value? Also @wjy99-c, do unregistered qubits here refer to qubits that are just not in the set of qubits acted on by the operations in the parameter new_operations?
Should clear_span allow for 0 to be a valid value? -> Seems the program also run endlessly for 0
For the unregistered qubits, I mean:

Adding the check for clear_span <= 0 was easy enough, but I'm not familiar enough with PointOptimizationSummary to be sure how to check for these unregistered qubits other than seeing if they're in the qubits acted on by the new_operations. Looks like @Strilanc was the original author of this class; maybe he can offer some insight?
The PointOptimizer class itself is the main consumer for the optimization_at method, and that's the only context that knows about the Circuit instance itself. We could do the validation at this line: 
@tanujkhattar do you want to take this
PointOptimizationSummary is deprecated in favor of Transformers.
