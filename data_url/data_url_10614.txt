Current Problem
Scaling must be done manually for VirtualGraphComposite, but autoscaling is available for FixedEmbeddingComposite and EmbeddingComposite.
Proposed Solution
Add autoscale to VirtualGraphComposite in same manner as for the other composites.
Alternatives Considered
Provide a separate autoscale method
Additional context
Is this something that is being considered?   I have been looking through the code but can't seem to find an example of how this scaling should be done. Any pointers until this can be added?
Yes this is being considered. No timeline yet, though we have gotten this request in a few places so we will prioritise it as a feature. The feature added in dwavesystems/dimod#372 might help in the mean time. As of writing this message though it has not be deployed.
#191 gets us part of the way there. However, at the moment we cannot use the ScaleComposite as an intermediate composite between the VirtualGraphComposite and a DWaveSampler without also explicitly specifying a chain strength because the method used to determine the chain strength only looks at the child sampler.
