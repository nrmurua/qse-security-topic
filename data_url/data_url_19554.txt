if not isinstance(x0, numpy.ndarray):
x0 = numpy.array(x0, shape=(len(x), 1))
I suppose there is a small typo, instead of len(x), it should be len(x0). Also the shape argument in np.array() seems to be outdated.
A simple fix would be
x0 = numpy.reshape(x0, (len(x0), 1))
Indeed, now fixed. Thanks!
I'm still working repackaging NOMAD. Will cut a release once that is done.
