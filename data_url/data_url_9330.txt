Which part of the documentation/examples?
https://solid-journey-b55ed955.pages.github.io/dev/#Installation
What content needs to be improved/added?
The installation instructions reference the command registry add https://github.com/Happy-Diode/Miskatonic.git, but that repository doesn't seem to exist?
We need to remove this after open source. I think it's because you don't have access to that repo.
I removed Miskatonic and added more installation guide
