The PyPi package in question is not an official package.
It was created another open source programmer.
The OpenQASM 3 Technical Steering Committee has been attempting to contact the author.
The Committee has received no response from that author, so is moving forward with the openqasm3 package.
This repository is primarily for defining the specification of the OpenQASM language.  It also includes a Python package that can be used to build a Python-based AST for the language (openqasm3).  These are separate things.  At the time of writing, the version of the language being worked towards is 3.0, and the version of the Python package is 0.0.1.
