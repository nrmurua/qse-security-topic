Which part of the documentation/examples?
https://queracomputing.github.io/Bloqade.jl/dev/lattices/#References
What content needs to be improved/added?
More code examples should be incorporated into the docstrings to make it easier to figure out how to use certain functions and types
@johnzl-777  can I Get assigned here Thank you
Hey @AbdullahKazi500 sure thing! Apologies for the delay, super glad to see interest on this issue ðŸ˜„
For some additional context this primarily centers around the different lattice types Bloqade supports (e.g. SquareLattice, RectangularLattice). The goal is to provide some more examples of their usage inside their docstrings. Furthermore, they should be formatted properly so that they render correctly in the web version of the documentation.
You can take advantage of the built in CI tools Bloqade has (if you do .ci/run -h at the base of the repo it'll give you all the possible options) to locally build and deploy the docs to ensure they render properly.
Feel free to reach out should anything come up!
Hi @johnzl-777,
I have made some small changes. Let me know if it is similar to what you're looking for, or not. I'd be happy to amend it.
Thanks for reviewing!
Hi @johnzl-777 Please assign this issue to @Amana-L I am not working on it
Hi @Amana-L
The effort is greatly appreciated (I also see you fixed a rather glaring typo with our 2D Lieb Lattice being referred to as a 1D chain lattice!) but I was hoping to see more code examples for usage.
For example, the linear_ramp function that's offered as one of Bloqade's waveform generation functions has a docstring like this: https://queracomputing.github.io/Bloqade.jl/dev/waveform/#BloqadeWaveforms.linear_ramp where there's an example of it being used in code.
In a similar fashion it would be nice to see something like:
In the docstring for each lattice type. The output doesn't have to be the image of the atom layout, just the raw text output you see in your terminal would be perfect.
It would also be preferable to state (for the 1D vs 2D geometries) if the "...number of site repetitions being specified by other arguments of generate_sites." is a single integer argument or two integer arguments.
One last thing, when referring to other functions/types in the documentation (such as generate_sites), it's desirable to have it referenced so the documentation generator auto-links it to the relevant section of documentation. In our case, generate_sites should be referenced via:
You can see this reference behavior in action here: 
Hi @johnzl-777, thanks for reviewing the changes!
The direction you've provided is very helpful. I'll make the additions soon.
Hi @johnzl-777, made another commit with the changes you suggested. Let me know if there's anything else.
Also, when running the code for RectangularLattice, it came up;
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching RectangularLattice()
So, I manually wrote the output for that one. But it's probably something that needs looking into.
Thanks.
Hi @Amana-L ,awesome work!
Just a couple small things:
would be nicer to read if the period after "pattern" wasn't there, so it reads like:
The RectangularLattice is slightly different from the other lattices in that you need to pass in a single integer on construction which ends up being an aspect ratio (essentially allowing the user to modify the length of one of the Bravais lattice vectors):
See this code in the RectangularLattice:
https://github.com/QuEraComputing/Bloqade.jl/blob/master/lib/BloqadeLattices/src/lattice.jl#L315
and
https://github.com/QuEraComputing/Bloqade.jl/blob/master/lib/BloqadeLattices/src/lattice.jl#L322
I believe the Fields section of the RectangularLattice docstring documents this but would definitely be helpful to have this in your code example!
Hi @johnzl-777, thanks for the suggestions! I've made the changes.
Sorry about the RectangularLattice example, I should've looked more closely. I was able to run it now and have fixed the example. Also, I added a few words about that.
I appreciate your attention to this. Let me know if there's anything else.
Hey @Amana-L no worries! Just merged in your pull request, excellent work!
Hi @johnzl-777, this was fun ðŸ™‚ thanks for your guidance along the way!
