Within vscode debug mode, not able to import qiskit_metal as metal
but am able to from qiskit_metal import designs, draw
Us vscode and try to set a breakpoint and run in debug mode.
It seems related to the gui and qt5 from the error you showed me.
Invalid Qt API %r, valid values are: %r, %r" % TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting
This seems to come up with pyqt with changes in versions. What is odd is the error is missing not only the thing that is invalid, but also what the valid values could be.
Failed to enable GUI event loop integration for 'qt5'
The tell is from QT_API.
Pull request merged, but issue not closed.
