Description of the issue:
When running the following simple code block, it throws the NotImplementedError. There is no issue if I change to other simulators such as default.qubit, or replace the observable to simple observables such as qml.PauliX(0).
Expected behavior: It returns the expectation value of the Hamiltonian.
Actual behavior:  It throws NotImplementedError.
Reproduces how often: Every time

Hi @yitchen-tim, thanks for reporting this! üôÇ
This is a feature that is not supported with lightning.qubit, the error is meant to refer to that. It's great to know that this would be useful to add in. üëç
@yitchen-tim a further note here: this is expected not to be working for default.qubit either, see the restrictions to the underlying adjoint_jacobian method in the note box on this page: https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.devices.default_qubit.DefaultQubit.html?highlight=adjoint_jacobian#pennylane.devices.default_qubit.DefaultQubit.adjoint_jacobian
