Hello, guys. I'm new to QuantumKatas and thanks for the Microsoft Quantum computing tutorial. I'm enjoying the quantum computing learning journey.
And I'm a maintainer of several opensource projects, so there may a little suggestion, please take a look on Aisuko#1
I mean the ImgBot will make the file size go down, but leave the dimensions and quality untouched.
So, if you guys feel this a useful feature, just add it to the repo https://github.com/dabutvin/ImgBot
Hi @Aisuko,
I'm glad you're enjoying the tutorials!
Do you think that there is a scenario in which size of images is a problem for the user? The size of non-image files alone in the Superposition kata (to which majority of the affected images belong) is over 200KB, which is order of magnitude more than the savings offered by the image compression. I imagine in most cases the user downloads the whole Katas repository (around 170MB) and then uses the tutorials locally, so a difference of under 100KB won't make an impact on the user experience.
Thanks for the quick reply @tcNickolas, in my personal experiences. I'd like to let the static resource (especially format png or jpg images) as small as it can. Especially for opensource projects, there may attract many contributors to contribute, as far as the number of contributor ingress, the ImgBot can help maintainer control the size of the images.
And another reason, may some situation like this:

I spent some time looking into it, and for now I won't be adding this bot. As I mentioned, the improvement in the size of the images offered by it is less than 0.1% of the total size of the repository, and I just don't think it's high enough priority at this time.
I'll keep this idea in mind, though, so if we ever get to a point that the repository grows to a size (and the number of contributors) that it's unmanageable and the images make up a significant portion of that size, I'll return to this issue. Thank you for the suggestion!
