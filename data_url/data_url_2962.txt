In many algorithms measurement results are combined into a little endian 2s complement integer. Should we support that?
I think the measurement gate should be a multiqubit gate, rather than applying multiple measurements with the same key to individual qubits. Because the gate is one big multi-qubit box, this would enforce that the measurements are applied to all qubits at the same time even as the circuit goes through various optimization and scheduling steps, which is what the hardware wants. Also, could specify with the measurement gate what form the measurements should be in, e.g. a list of qubits as now, or a little-endian int. This would also affect #216 because you only need a 2-d result when you have the reps and bits indices.
Can still have keys to identify measurements to get the right results, but would enforce that each key is unique across gates in a circuit, rather than merging same-keyed measurements.
Multi qubit measurement gate is done.  #513 is fist step in exposing big or little endian strings by providing histogram.
@Strilanc This is done since our move to TrialResult, correct?
Closing as stale.
