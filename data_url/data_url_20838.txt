Is this "on Debian" or "in a paravirtualized virtual machine". We have seen similar issues only in containers.
It was in Qubes, so virtualized. Still, why would virtualization have any influence on sanitizers?
Because the sanitizers hook into some system calls in similar ways, apparently.
To be clear, it seems so far that HVM is fine, but other types of virtualization may have issues.
We've switched to pytest, so maybe this doesn't happen anymore.
