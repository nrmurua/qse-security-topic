Update documentation for disordered zero-pi qubit (missing disorder parameters, for example).
@PhilippAumann When you get a chance, please take a look at the docs and let me know whether changes address the issue. I only realized late that the situation was worse than I thought. Should be much better now.
Fixed with f203deb
Thank you for the fix!
