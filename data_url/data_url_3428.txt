I think there is an issue with the Qubits order when using the Wavefunction function. I run the following commands:
p=Program()
p+=X(0)
p+=X(1)
p+=X(2)
p+=X(0)
wf_sim = WavefunctionSimulator()
wavefunction = wf_sim.wavefunction(p)
And I get ket \ket{110}, when I should get \ket{011} right? The problem is only in the wavefunction ordering since when using run_and_meassure() it works fine (i.e. this gives me zeros for the first qubit and ones for the other two).
I think this is expected. My understanding is that pyQuil orders qubits like binary bitstrings.
