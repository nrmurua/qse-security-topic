Tranpilation return a not-properly-routed circuit.
The documentation of qiskit.transpiler.Target.add_instruction says If there are no constraints on the instruction (as in a noisless/ideal simulation) this can be set to {None, None} which will indicate it runs on all qubits (or all available permutations of qubits for multi-qubit gates)..
So, let's create a target and add a single-qubit instruction to it by specifying {None: None} as its properties
This code prints the following circuit
which is clearly not routed against the target.
The root cause seems to be, that in this scenario the transpiler target fails to generate the coupling map. Note how the assert line in the above code snippet passes, meaning that the coupling map is None.
Transpiler target should have a properly defined coupling map and transpilation should work correctly
