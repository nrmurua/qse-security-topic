Description of the issue
After activating MacOS and Windows testing in ci-daily.yml in #6331, the notebook tests failed on these platforms, example.
As a temporary solution, #6335 restricts notebook testing to run on Linux only.
For a proper solution we need to fix notebook tests on Mac and Windows platforms.
The affected notebook tests are those touched in #6335, ie, those decorated with
Cirq version
1.3.0.dev at 34e8dab
I can take this on.
I can use my own local Windows/MacOS environments to reproduce the issues.
3c6a305 removed all but one of the skipif(sys.platform != "linux", reason="Linux-only test") tags.
The remaining one is in dev_tools/notebooks/notebook_test.py which failed in integration testing.
From the macOS output:
papermill is included in dev_tools/requirements/deps/notebook.txt. Let's have pip install that when we run integration tests.
Windows output:
I'm not too well versed on Windows/PowerShell, but it looks like you're trying to run a Unix style multiline command in a Powershell/cmd context.
Edit: it's interesting that's how it's being run, when the && line breaks are used for the Windows version of the command. I haven't had a chance to run this locally, though.
30b6c39 addresses macOS bug. Will begin on Windows side now.
I'm a little out of my depth on the Windows side of things (all my dev experience is Unix). I will pick up something else. Thanks!
