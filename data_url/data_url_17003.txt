Following the suggestion from #601 (comment)
Please refer to my comment on the recent PR about this: #3208 (review)
If we want to do this we'll have to subclass QiskitBackendNotFoundError and properly deprecate it to make sure people can transition. But I personally don't understand the point here, sure BackendNotFoundError is probably a better name for the exception, but the amount of effort to just rename it to drop the 'Qiskit' seems kind of high.
Indeed. Just renaming is not enough. Proper deprecation is needed.
Wondering why renaming it. Qiskit (Terra) is not and end-user software,  can be used with many other libraries by a product developer, so having the Qiskit prefix will give more context to the developer about where the exception is coming.
That would apply to every exception.
It's relatively easy to see where is the exception coming from with the traceback, if that's a problem.
