measure(q, c) always gives the same result, regardless of the order of q and c.
Result is:
I would expect the result to be:
I get the same result when I change the measure line to:
or any other permutation.
I have the same problem with the MPS simulation method. I didn't check the other methods.
I think the issue is in the arguments to the measure command. The first arg is a list of qubit indicies, and the second argument is a list of clbit indicies, that will be zipped together to generate the individual measure commands. e.g.
In your example, the order of the generated measures will be different, but the qubit->clbit mapping for each will be the same ( still q_0->c_0, ...).
To generate a permutation in the measure, you'd want something like:
I see. So I understand that this is the specification of what the behavior should be.
Thanks for explaining @kdk
