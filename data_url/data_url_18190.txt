Experiencing error with Quantum emoticon program
I am not really sure about the expected behavior. Given that it is a one of the trivial program, it should not be a problem for the developers.
In this file 3rd block is throwing the following error
Not sure about it.
Just try to execute hello-world example
I was trying to getting started with some development around it.
thanks @tremblerz to let us know about the issue. Here is a possible action plan:
Hi @tremblerz,
Few days ago I pointed this same problem out here and @rraymondhp provided the following answer:
Hi,
Thank you for pointing this. I also got the same error when running the notebook. It is due to a bug in compiler that swap measurement to the middle of the computation but the devices do not support such operation yet. I confirmed that I can avoid the error by inserting barrier before measurement, like:
//put barrier before measurement
qc.barrier(qr)
//measure
for j in range(16):
qc.measure(qr[j], cr[j])
//run and get results
results = qp.execute(["smiley_writer"], backend='ibmqx5', shots=1024, timeout=240)
stats = results.get_counts("smiley_writer")
I cannot run the real device now because it is under maintenance though.
Fixed via #347
