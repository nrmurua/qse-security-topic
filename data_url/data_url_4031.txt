The function kernel.print_custom_instructions() and program.compile do not print any output in Spyder or ipython notebook. The reason is that the print functions (printf, std::cout) used are not compatible with the Python stdout. One way around this is to wrap the print statements using special code for python such as is done here

Probably other function that print information, warnings or error do not function either.
I have added get_custom_instructions() (in 1e66403) which returns list of custom instructions, which of course can be printed. I have tested it in jupyter notebook and it works as can be seen below:

@imranashraf The function helps in printing the instructions, but it does not solve the issue. The .compile function will not output anything, and the fact that .print_custom_instructions() does not print anything will be confusing for users.
I suggest we either fix the problem, remote these functions from the swig interface or document that using ipython/spyder not all output is printed.
@peendebak I already removed it from interface file in the favor of get_custom_instructions().
