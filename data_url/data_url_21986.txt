On Windows 10, Artiq 3.2:
When attemping to run the led.py example, we encounter a syntax error in the edited device_db.py:
A SyntaxError is just that: your file is not valid python. Could you please show the contents of the file.
Contents of device_db.py in question.  The only edit from the provided file was to change the IP address:
What happens when you run python device_db.py?
python device_db.py returns with no output and no errors.
OK, that's what it should do.
It seems you are mixing ARTIQ versions, attempting to use an ARTIQ-3 device database with ARTIQ-2.
@TheCakeIsAPi Some suggestions.
Look for old version of ARTIQ using $ pip list | grep artiq.
Double check that artiq resolves to your current conda environment.
$ python -c "import artiq; print(artiq.__path__)"
@TheCakeIsAPi Is that resolved?
@TheCakeIsAPi Please try again. Would like to close this Issue.
