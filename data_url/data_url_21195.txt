Error when passing argument (in this case with a type hint) with default value in delay_mu, also occur in simple arguments without the type hint.
Will successfully compile/run. Current workaround requires running the method in a separate manner.
Sample:
Returns an error log:
We should just strip out any remaining special handling of delays from the compiler; this has long been unused. delay_mu should just be handled the same as any other runtime intrinsic.
