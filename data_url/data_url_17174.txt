The circuit is not in the given basis and does not fit in the given coupling map. However, the execution is allowed.
I think the user parameters should have priority over the backend properties.
should be fixed with #2676
Nope...  #2676 did not fixed it.
I don't see why your given example should error (it does not error on a device run either). The transpiler translates the circuit to the basis gates and coupling map.
I also do not understand the original post. Probably I was somehow confused. Closing.
