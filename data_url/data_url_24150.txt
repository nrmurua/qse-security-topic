Add icons for all the tutorials that are missing one



None of these have graphical output.  The cards require graphical output otherwise it will use the default qiskit logo.  The exception is 4.14 which doesn't execute due to a bug that will be corrected in #648.
Nice. We can use some of the visual from them or icons. For example, for the transmon analytics we can use some of the resulting plots from nicks notebook or just a schematic image of the transmon.
For wavefunction for example we can show one of the images of a wavefunction etc.
