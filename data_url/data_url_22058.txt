Using the master version of Artiq, I sporadically get the below error.
This occurs when calling an async RPC with an integer argument (code below).
I do not see any errors in the core log.
The provided code is not enough to unambiguously construct a reproducing example. I've modified it as follows so I can run it with artiq_run:
Running this for a few minutes does not result in a crash. Can you provide a more specific example, and tell me about your environment?
@whitequark my complete reproduction is below - it is pretty much the same as yours. It took ~2 minutes to crash.
Here is a packet dump: dump.zip
As you can see, the core device responds incorrectly in packet 3809 (the last 6 bytes of the message are missing).
Bad packet (3809):
Equivalent OK packet (3806):
@whitequark believes that this is due to former smoltcp bugs corrupting data.
@cjbe I've been running your code for 20min without problem. Can you still reproduce the issue with the latest master? If not let's close this issue.
@sbourdeauducq using the latest master I also cannot reproduce this.
