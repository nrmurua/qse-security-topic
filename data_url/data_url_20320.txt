Fixed in PR #395
@christianpaquin does AppVeyor also run the KAT checks on Windows to see if it generates the right values?
AppVeyor runs kat_kem.exe; is there anything else it should be doing?
kat_kem just generates the KAT values.  On Travis we subsequently run check_kats.sh to check that the generated KATs match the stored ones.
Ah, no it doesn't. That's a bit more work and I'm not sure how to easily enable that on Windows/AppVeyor. I'll take a look, but we should perhaps move that as a stretch goal for V1, in order not to block the release.
Okay, I've created a separate issue to track this after we're done V1.
