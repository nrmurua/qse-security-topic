Hey,
only a small stylistic question.
For reporting some results, i want to create some circuits like

However, I need a theta with a tilde above instead of theta itself.
Is it possible to do that directly for the parameter or do i have to fix it manually afterwards?
So far, I tested the variants theta = Parameter('$\tilde{Œ∏}_i$') , theta = Parameter('$~{Œ∏}_i$') , theta = Parameter('$Œ∏^~_i$') , but none of them worked.
At the end, it should look like

Either of
should work for you.  There are two problems: the first is correct LaTeX formatting (in LaTeX, you want something equivalent to $\tilde\theta_i$, and your unicode theta may work as well), and the second is a Python one.  You need to remember to escape backslashes \ in Python strings like in my first line, or use a "raw string" (put an r before the first quote) like my second.
Thanks a lot @jakelishman for the answer.
This works üëç
