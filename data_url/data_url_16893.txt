Link with error correction/error detection codes (like repetition code) of qiskit ignis for the operator evaluation circuits. This enhancement will allow for better results in the execution in exchange for more qubits.
Is this still requested (qiskit-ignis is deprecated)? If so, can you add an example on the expected feature?
Closing as stale.
