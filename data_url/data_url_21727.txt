Instructions to rework hardware:
Those reworks do not interfere with any current board function and can be left on permanently.
After each power-on of the board, the RTM Si5324 needs to be put into bypass mode. The bitstream for doing this is built as follows:
It needs to be loaded after each power-up, but with the reset rework, the Si5324 configuration is not lost when bitstreams are loaded, so this needs to be done just once if your board power supply is stable (tl;dr cranking up the ÂµTCA fans to the maximum seems to be a workaround).
contents of sayma.cfg:
@hartytp @marmeladapk Could you reproduce this on your boards and let me know what the DDMTD results are? Also after reverting ec230d6
Note that before ec230d6 the firmware does not need any hardware rework.
Further instructions:
Patch for 125MHz/2.0GSPS (default is 150MHz/2.4GSPS)
@hartytp Has anyone at Oxford reproduced this, or is this hampered by some random breakage?

Too much random breakage too little time
The rework on the Sayma we have seems to have been damaged during shipping and getting life out of them is proving non trivial
Obsolete with v2 hardware.
