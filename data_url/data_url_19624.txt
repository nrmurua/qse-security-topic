When installing using pip install --user qecsim, the subdirectory demos should appear in the installation directory with the notebooks required to run these demos.
The directories graphtools, models, and tensortools (subdirectories of qecsim/src/qecsim) are present, but demos is missing, along with the other subdirectories of the top-level qecsim directory.
