Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Oftentimes one has a circuit whose portion is to be repeated a number of times and one would like to sweep the repetition count. Example and context for this issue: implementing CPMG pulse train in cirq, see #3255.
Describe the solution you'd like
Current workaround entails parametrizing each repeated instance with a boolean parameter, so we end up with a number of parameters equal to the maximum of the repetition count. Ideally, we'd only need one parameter for this - repetition count.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters

Discussed on Cirq Cynq, no objections - we just need to think through the design around this.
Subcircuits + loops should help in this

CircuitOperation is pretty close to supporting this - all we need is to allow repetitions to take a Symbol, and for the parameter resolution methods to check repetitions for parameters.
Actually sending circuits with this feature to hardware is another matter; that behavior is tracked by #3634.
Requires #4888 or #4274
Prototyped a "CircuitOperation.repeat_until" option here: 968773a, to go in after #4997. It only works on "flattened" subcircuits. To make it work on non-flattened circuits we'd have to do #4888 first, which is prototyped at 8a5f71d.
I started an attempt at parameterizing CircuitOperation.repetitions, but that's blocked by CircuitOperation._resolve_parameters_'s inability to handle recursive calls so I gave up.
@viathor #5043 will address this.
