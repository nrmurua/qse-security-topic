Many equivalences in the clifford group are missing from the equivalence library. Some examples:
I opened an issue that may be related to this one.
In brief, the transpile method ends the task with error when passing the universal gate set ['h', 's', 't', 'cx']
where is the equivalence library? is it the templates library?

It's not the templates library (that's only used for pattern match in the optimization passes). This is the circuit equivalence library which is used to dynamic build a graph of equivalences between gates: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/equivalence_library.py which gets used by the BasisTranslator pass to search for and convert from an arbitrary circuit to one in the native basis set.
This issue is just about some missing equivalence rules in the library (although I would expect the search to find some of these even if there isn't a direct edge).
This is in the equivalence lib already: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/equivalence_library.py#L391-L399

Hi, I have started working on this issue with @ShellyGarion .
