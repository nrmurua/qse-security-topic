Multi quibit readout errors are ignored.

The second block of code above should do the same thing as the first block.  However, it seems like the multi qubit readout errors are completely ignored.
I think the problem is in the function https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/src/noise/noise_model.hpp#492, but I'm not exactly sure.  Hopefully someone who wrote this code will be able to quickly spot what is going on.  My sincere apologizes if I am misusing the code.  N.B. I had two independent colleagues check the above example and we all can reproduce it and believe the usage is correct.  Thank you!
The problem is Terra doesn't support multi-qubit measure instructions by default: measure on a register is always unrolled into single-qubit measure instructions.
To get it to work you have to define your own multi-qubit measure instruction. You can see an examples of this in the tests here.
Eg for two-qubit readout error you would need to make an instruction
Then this should work with a noise model with a two-qubit readout error on qubits [0, 1].
Hi @chriseclectic,
Fantastic, thank you!  I get the error
File "/usr/local/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/qiskit/circuit/quantumcircuit.py", line 348, in _check_qargs
raise QiskitError("qarg not (QuantumRegister, int) tuple")
qiskit.exceptions.QiskitError: 'qarg not (QuantumRegister, int) tuple'
Which version of the code do I need to use?  (should I compile from source?)
Thank you again-
Sincerely,
Ben
You might need to update qiskit-terra (or use master)
@bnachman did the update fix the issue?
Hello,
Yes, this works, thank you!  I had some troubles compiling aer from source though - in the end, I compiled terra from source and then pip installed aer.  The instruction update is in terra anyway so this worked well.  Thank you again for your help.
Sincerely,
Ben
