See #174 , specifically e.g. https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk/935/workflows/2517b2a7-7ed8-4cdf-9f46-7b7879bb6673/jobs/17765
The specific failure seems to follow from pyenv WARNING: `pyenv init -` no longer sets PATH..
Nevermind, I was branching off from an old CI. Will rebase #174.
