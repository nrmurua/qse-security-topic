Hi!
I am trying building CP2K with HIP (ROCm ver. 5.0):
After building the toolchain
./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh --with-mpich --with-elpa=no --with-cosma=no --enable-hip --gpu-ver=Mi50
I do the make
make -j 8 ARCH=local_hip VERSION=psmp
but it fails with
If I add -D__NO_OFFLOAD_DBM it fails too
And only if I add -D__NO_OFFLOAD_GRID the building is successful.
As far as I understand, the problem is connected with the general problem  that hipcc (clang) does not see omp.h
Please let me know if it is possible to make a full HIP build without switching off those 2 GPU acceleration options?
NB: Building for CUDA (--enable-cuda) does not show such a problem.
Best regards,
Vladimir
Interesting, I don't have OpenMP in my OFFLOAD flag... Could you check the line
(this is mine)
in your local_hip.psmp?
My OFFLOAD flag looks exactly the same
However, e.g. in cp2k-2022.1/src/grid/gpu/grid_gpu_task_list.cu there is the following
And hipcc cannot find omp.h...
I believe this is a mistake because we're not actually using OpenMP in the grid GPU backend. I'll look into it.
Well, I can compile in my case... What I see as a difference is that your compile line is
while I don't have -fopenmp. So I wonder where that flag is coming...

The original error is reported in the dbm code too, in particular from dbm_shard.h....

Oh, I missed that. Well, dbm_shard.h does need OpenMP because dbm_shard_t contains a member of type omp_lock_t.
I can actually compile that code with the following line
and it compiles. There is something wrong in ROCM installation...

removing  does not change anything in my case...

Please let me know what ROCm version do you use? The latest one?
I use the following
I'm using 5.0.2.
Let me see if I have 5.0.0 somewhere...
OK, just tried with 5.0.0:
it compiles. No sure where the problem can be... Maybe you can make a small code (helloworld like) with the include and see if it works?
@alazzaro , thank you very much!
I'll try to find what is wrong with my ROCm installation...
Indeed, our ROCm installation was not complete. After additional dev packages have been installed, building with HIP goes without issues. Excuse me for the confusion and thank you for the help.
P.S. The GPU performance, however, is far from being proportional to the theoretical peak performance if we compare with the CPU build of CP2K:
H2O-512 benchmark:
1 node x (E5-1650v3 with 6 MPI ranks + one Mi50): 144 sec for 1st iteration and 47 sec for the next iterations
2 nodes x (E5-1650v3 with 6 MPI ranks + one Mi50): 79 sec and 26 sec
1 node x (2 x EPYC 7662 with 128 MPI ranks): 18 sec and 6 sec
I'm glad you got it to work!
For GGA calculations currently only the grid routines (collocate and integrate) can take advantage of GPUs. See https://www.cp2k.org/gpu for more info.
