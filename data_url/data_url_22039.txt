a3bb6c1 caused the following obscure problem: DMA now underflows unless the first DMA event in the buffer is far in the future (at least ~400Âµs).
DMA and SED otherwise appear to function correctly.
Here's the test code I wrote so far:
It typically goes from fail to ok at dt 17 or 18 regardless of anything else I change.
