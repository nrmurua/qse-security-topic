I would like to know how to extract elementary gates from Initialize class?
The initialization of the state does not show that. I tried to extract basic gates by using 'Instruction.definition' and 'QuantumCircuit.data'. However, every time, I get same circuit which is far away from being the right one (very low fidelity).
