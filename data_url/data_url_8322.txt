I am using anaconda and qutip on Win10 system with VS2015 (community version). When solving Hamiltonian with time dependent coefficients, I get an "ImportError" that caused by cython which does not occur on linux. I've re-installed VS2015 and qutip many times, but this problem still exists. Is there any way to solve it? Here is my error message.
ImportError: Building module rhs22280 failed: ["distutils.errors.CompileError: command 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\VC\\bin\\cl.exe' failed with exit status 2\n"]

I solved this by adding C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\bin\ to the PATH variable

I don't know why, but setting the PATH variable does not work for me :(
I was using VS2017 before installing qutip. It was recommended that qutip should work with VS2015 on windows. So I uninstalled VS2017 and reinstalled VS2015. I guess something went wrong in this process, but I haven't figured out what it is.
I have two possible solutions for this, one is legit, and the other's a little hacky.
We run tests on Windows in CI now and they pass, so I'm going to close this now. Feel free to comment if needed.
