Knowing commutation information can be helpful when working with circuits, and it seems likely that we will need it. For example, we may want a stronger version of "place at earliest possible position" where CZ gates being added actually commute over Z gates and other CZs in their way.
@dabacon opinions?
I vote in favor.
