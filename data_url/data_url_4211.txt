The NodeJS version of ProjectQ is here: https://github.com/tearsofphoenix/Q-js.
Currently, it has ported most library features. IBM backend & examples is still under porting.
Sorry, I forgot about this Issue.
What is the goal of porting ProjectQ to NodeJS? What is aim behind porting everything instead of just writing a NodeJS interface?
