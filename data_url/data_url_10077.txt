If I determine the correct scaling factor to scale a QUBO such that the Ising form fits in the QPU range, I should be able to scale the QUBO by this amount, embed it, and solve the Ising.  However, the embedding causes some linear QUBO terms to be out of range in the resulting Ising model.  As discussed with @arcondello.

Example case:
Output:
This model is 'mathematically correct', in that the resulting model has the same energies for states without broken chains, but the 'ideal' model would have all 0 linear biases.
A solution is to add a parameter to embed_bqm that forces the bias smearing to happen in either spin/binary space.
embedded_bqm = dimod.embed_bqm(bqm, embedding, graph, chain_strength=1, smear_vartype=dimod.SPIN)
