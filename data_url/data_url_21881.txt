I've tried several builds and only get partial (~50%) success booting Sayma. This is using Sayma_AMC (TS190717-6) sent to Duke from HK -- now temporarily being testing at UMD. Builds I've tested include db4d187 and bcb9c3. Observations:
Similar behavior from 8fd57e6 which is yesterday's master.
duplicate of #727 though I had not seen it on that particular board before.
Actually @jbqubit are you using the latest jesd204b core source?
Before m-labs/jesd204b@03718be JESD was intermittently failing to initialize on all boards.
This is the JESD I'm using.
Please package the right version of jesd204b with conda.
@sbourdeauducq Do you have updated installation instructions for Sayma standalone? This post is the most recent that I know about. Diffs presently are the following.
This is the script I'm using to automate my builds.
Building master with jesd204b=0.6 now.
We updated JESD and built from master 38b5128. We reloaded RTM AMC .bit and observed successful booting each time. This looks resolved.
But spoke too soon. Built with 8fd57e6 (and JESD update) and find that the same error happens. ''' AD9154-0 initializing...'''
Unfortunately we have a holidays and the university is closed. Would be able to check it on Monday...
Ignore that post from five minutes ago. I accidentally used a build of the gateware from this morning that predated the JESD204B upgrade to v0.6. Just now I repeated test again using JESD204B=0.6 with SAWG and HMC830 build 38b5128. Boot was successful four times in succession.
