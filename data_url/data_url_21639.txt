The docs (at https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual/management_system.html#pauses) write that self.core.close() should be called before self.scheduler.pause(), however the comments in #390 imply that this is now handled automatically. Is this right? If so, I can make a PR for the docs.
No, this was reverted before the 2.0 release. The manual is correct.
