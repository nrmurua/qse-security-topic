Hi @j-i-k-o, thanks for bringing this up.
What version of numpy are you using? If itâ€™s 1.21, I believe the error is coming directly from numpy: see numpy/numpy#19310. This problem should be fixed by 1.21.1 (see numpy/numpy#19311).
As a temporary fix, you could try downgrading your numpy (should work with 1.20), or try a python >= 3.8.
Hope this helps!
HI @hhtong, thanks for the comment!
Yes, The version of  numpy is 1.21.0.
I'm going to wait until numpy is uploaded to 1.21.1.
Many thanks.
I upgraded numpy and dimod to 1.21.1 and 0.10.2, respectively,  which still has a similar error.
I suppose the current quick solution is to install typing_extensions package since the problem basically comes from typing_extensions in numpy (numpy/numpy#19310)
I've opened an issue on numpy here: numpy/numpy#19521
Closing since NumPy 1.21.2+ is now deployed.
