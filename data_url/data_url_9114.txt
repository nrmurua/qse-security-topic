Currently the Network component has a single packet queue in which all Host packets arrive. They are processed in FIFO order. This may cause congestion if some parts of the network are sending more packets than others and therefore the network should use one queue per connection so that traffic is sent fairly throughout the network.
@stephendiadamo I would like to work on this issue. Could you assign this to me?
@WingCode Done, let me know if the description here is enough or I can provide more details.
@WingCode are you still work on this ticket ?
@cometta Thank you for asking. No, I am currently not working on this ticket. I got caught up with other works, so I won't be able to look into this ticket at the moment. Would you like to work on this ticket?
