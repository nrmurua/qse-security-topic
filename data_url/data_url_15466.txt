When ConfigurableFakeBackend is initialized with qubit_t2, an actual T2 value of the device is set based on qubit_t1.
The T2 value of the backend initialized like above should be generated based on qubit_t2.
In qiskit/test/mock/utils/configurable_backend.py, pass qubit_t2 instead of qubit_t1.
Current implementation:
And unit test for ConfigurableFakeBackend with T2 set does exist, but T2 is NOT asserted.
We should add assertions to check all attributes set through __init__().
I am working on this.
