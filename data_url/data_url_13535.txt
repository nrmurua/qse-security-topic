The table in this API docstring doesn't render:
https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html?highlight=fold%20random#mitiq.zne.scaling.folding.fold_gates_at_random
Not sure from sphinx how to get it to parse this as a markdown table, I get the following sphinx message when building locally:
Use the about() function to summarize information on operating system, python version and dependencies.
Additional Python Environment Details (pip freeze or conda list):
Ah, good find Sarah. Probably can be fixed by a raw string r"""...""", if not just formatting the table as markdown. Also note the same table appears in other folding function docstrings (see error output above).
This is fixed now, and will be merged with the mystdocs PR #509.
