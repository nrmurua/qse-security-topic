The docs should point to useful resources for quantum computing, quantum noise, etc.
This can be in a separate section from the getting started.
Some references may be papers.
We can add a bibliography, so that multiple references point to the same object, and things are tidier. I'll open a PR for that.
Let me just mention here that jupyter-book could be considered. It basically renders in a better and more customizable way tutorials and notebook content in a cohesive document.
It is a recent project by some of the same folks of jupyter notebooks.
It also stemmed from the understanding that documentations are not always the place to put some of the auxiliary supporting information surrounding a coding project but more loosely related to that. The folks at IBM Q took advantage of it for a textbook. I think that some didactic material on error mitigation could contribute substantially to drive adoption of mitiq tools.
