I'd like to initialize a qubit, ask for the spectrum (including eigenvectors) and write to a file, and then create a SpectrumData object later from that file. However I have found that doing so with too many parameter values leads to issues. For example running
the last line returns false. Note oddly enough that changing number_params -> 10 or lower fixes the issue.
I have verified that the issue is qubit independent - i.e. the same failure exists for FluxQubit

Eigenvectors were in a wrong order due to a bug in converting from dict to list. This should be addressed by b0a46fb
@dkweiss31 Please verify the fix when you get a chance.
I believe this fixes the main issue. However I am still running into a related problem with respect to running some of my CurrentMirror tests. Running
passes, i.e., the previous problem is fixed. However initializing my CurrentMirror object the way it would be initialized for a test throws an error upon comparing the eigenvectors
returns False.
As discussed off-line, your last issue is unrelated (the small mismatch appears to be due to finite precision of ARPACK, nothing to do with file IO).
See this:
For this, np.allclose(np.abs(specdata1.state_table), np.abs(specdata2.state_table)) results in False.
