In the development of a new feature (PR coming soon), I ran into a problem where adding new indices to dims can break __mul__ in surprising ways. The full details are in this notebook, but in summary, the bug causes multiplication of Qobjs with dimensions of the form [[n, 1], [n]] to not multiply correctly with Qobjs of dimensions [[n], [n]].
