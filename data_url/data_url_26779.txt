mentioned test turned out to be unstable, needs to be updated
We have quite a few regtests with loose thresholds. I don't think it makes sense to open individual issues for each of them. Instead one can look at the Regtest Survey. Nevertheless, it might be good to keep a generic issue around as a reminder.
Btw, we also have many regtests which have stabilized and where we could tighten the threshold (marked in green).
I haven't noticed SE/regtest-3-2/SiO2 in a while. So, it seem the tolerance is now sufficient and we can close this issue.
