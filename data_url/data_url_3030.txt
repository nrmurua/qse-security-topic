Tried to run the "hello qubit" example from the README.md. Got this error:

for op in moment.operations:
AttributeError: 'Operation' object has no attribute 'operations'
It seems the variable "circuit" should contain a list of moments (which have the operations attribute), but instead it contains a list of operations.
I think all it needs is to add a line to create a list of moments for the operations and provide that to the Circuit initializer. Let me know if that's not the intended design.
