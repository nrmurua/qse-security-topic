I am trying to use different devices with Pennylane with the help of different device plugins. I am able to use these devices properly when I run the code without covalent. However, when I tried it with covalent they are throwing different errors for each device.
With dev0 = qml.device("forest.qvm", device="4q-qvm") I am getting TypeError: no default __reduce__ due to non-trivial __cinit__ error
With dev1 = qml.device("qiskit.aer", wires=4) I am getting HTTPError: 500 Server Error: INTERNAL SERVER ERROR for url: http://0.0.0.0:48008/api/submit error.
Look into the code in the following section.
By replacing the 'dev' in @qml.qnode(dev) the above-mentioned errors can be reproduced.
A float value must be returned as an answer.
No response
Hi @poojithurao ,
Since dev2 default.qubit works, i suspect its something to do with Pickling with the other plugins. While we expect someone to resolve this soon, I would strongly recommend the following pattern over the one you have for constructing workflows
Hey @santoshkumarradha, thanks, noted and will take care of that.
