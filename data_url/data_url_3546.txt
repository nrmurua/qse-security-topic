Hi,
I renamed the file .pyquil_config to pyquil.ini and opened it using notepad.
Now I'd like to set the PYQUIL_CONFIG environment variable by opening up a command prompt and running: setenv PYQUIL_CONFIG=C:\Users\Username\pyquil.ini as suggested by Installation and Getting Started documentation.
Unfortunately once open the command prompt this is the output:
C:\Users\DS>setenv PYQUIL_CONFIG=C:\Users\DS\pyquil.ini
'setenv' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
I using Window 10 Pro (latest update).
Thanks
