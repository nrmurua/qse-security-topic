The interface for QGL.ControlFlow.qwait has changed, so that the QGL sequences that are supposed to compile to something equivalent to pyqgl2 sequences no longer compile at all.  (the pyqgl2 sequences are "right", but the QGL sequences are no longer equivalent, or even valid)
This looked like a pyqgl2 problem because the QGL failures were silent -- so there's going to be a related ticket on the QGL side, because when intstruction assembly fails the program should raise an exception, not silently return None.
