The Windows /W4 flag complains about conversions from larger to smaller integer types. (See also #61 ) The gcc and clang compilers also support -Wconversion, to report similar errors.
I'd suggest turning on this warning flag to shorten the development cycle of people programming stuff on Windows, but somehow Windows doesn't have problems with the Kyber768 code, while GCC and Clang do find a lot of problems.
Do we want to include -Wconversion?
Makes sense.
I do think it's weird that Windows somehow doesn't complain about the kyber code while -Wconversion seems to complain exactly similar complains that I needed to fix in #61. I'd like compilers to complain about similar things, so that people don't need to go through appveyor dozens of times, but then -Wconversion should do sensible things...
-Wconversion indeed complains about too many things, we'll leave it off.
