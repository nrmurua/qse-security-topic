Currently, probability gradients evaluated from using Opflow / Gradients on a CircuitStateFn will be returned as dense arrays. Even when approximated with a QASM simulator (or real hardware) using (sparse) samples / shots they are converted to dense arrays that grow exponentially in size with the number of qubits. This doesn't work for larger circuits and needs to be changed.
Side note: a similar problem exists or the probabilities themselves, but this is a more difficult question and is not part of this issue.
There are (at least) 2 options moving forward:
The following shows some code illustrating the problem and the possible solutions:
which returns
For option 1, the result could look like:
[{0: -0.395, 1: 0.395}]
For option 2, this could be mapped to:
which prints
Option 2 seems to be cleaner and the preferred solution.
