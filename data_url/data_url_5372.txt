Expected return:
Reproduces how often: (What percentage of the time does it reproduce?)
Error occurs always.
System information: (post the output of import pennylane as qml; qml.about())
This error is surprisingly different from PennyLaneAI/pennylane#2203
Hi @dominicpasquali thanks for reporting this.
It seems you are trying to run a GPU workload using Lightning, which may likely be the problem here as Lightning has no GPU-based support right now. Can you try running the script but instead set the device to CPU only?
device = torch.device("cpu")
As another follow up, could you also try the original workflow using default.qubit with diff_method="parameter-shift".

Hi @mlxd - of course!
Only changing

However if we instead run
we get the expected output

Making this change:

Hi @dominicpasquali thanks for the update.
Based on the above outputs, I think this is an issue with PennyLane, rather than a Lightning-specific issue (since we still get failures on default.qubit using the parameter-shift method too). I think if you have an issue opened on the main PennyLane repo, that would be the best place to provide the above feedback too, as lightning seems to fail in exactly the same way.
I suspect the issue may be with some data locality method not being called, or similar in there (likely 4 GPUs don't play as nicely as testing under 2 GPUs). I will close this issue, but feel free to reference the above in the other repo if it helps. And, as always, don't hesitate to open another issue if we can help on this.
