Hi, as shown in the following full dependency graph of dwave-system, dwave-system requires dimod >=0.9.0,<0.10.0, dwave-system requires dwave-networkx >=0.8.4 (dwave-networkx 0.8.4 will be installed, i.e., the newest version satisfying the version constraint), and directed dependency dwave-networkx 0.8.4 transitively introduces dimod >=0.8.0.
Obviously, there are multiple version constraints set for dimod in this project. However, according to pip's “first found wins” installation strategy, dimod 0.9.1 (i.e., the newest version satisfying constraint >=0.9.0,<0.10.0) is the actually installed version.
Although the first found package version dimod 0.9.1 just satisfies the later dependency constraint （dimod >=0.8.0), such installed version is very close to the upper bound of the version constraint of Dimod specified by dwave-networkx 0.8.4 .
Once dwave-networkx upgrades，its newest version will be installed. Therefore, it will easily cause a dependency conflict (build failure), if the upgraded dwave-networkx version introduces a higher version of Dimod, violating its another version constraint >=0.9.0,<0.10.0.
According to the release history of dwave-networkx, it habitually upgrates Dimod in its recent releases. For instance, dwave-networkx 0.6.9 upgrated Dimod’s constraint from >=0.6.8,<0.8.0 to >=0.6.8,<0.9.0, dwave-networkx 0.7.0  upgrated Dimod’s constraint from >=0.6.8,<0.9.0 to >=0.8.0,<0.9.0, and dwave-networkx 0.8.4 upgrated Dimod’s constraint from >=0.8.0,<0.9.0 to >=0.8.0.
As such, it is a warm warning of a potential dependency conflict issue for dwave-system.
Thanks for your help.
Best,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention, @NeolithEra.
For the same reasons listed on dwave-neal#79, I recommend a 4th option: dwave-networkx>=0.8.4,<0.9.0.
Closing as resolved.
