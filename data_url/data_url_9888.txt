Introducing dwave-preprocessing as a full dependency in #924 is causing build from source of dwave-preprocessing (and consequently the whole Ocean) to fail. Note: dwave-preprocessing has dimod as a build dependency.
See dwavesystems/dwave-preprocessing#26.
Proposed solution: revert to optional dependency on dwave-preprocessing until we remove it completely in 0.11.
If that is the only way to fix it then yes, I think we'll have to make it optional again. Though I wonder if we can keep it as a full dependency but put try/except in the code to get through the build process. I will investigate unless you want to.
Not sure that's the only way, just my first thought. I don't mind we try/catch it -- although those would have to be at the root level, when importing everything. Feel free to investigate it further. Thanks!
