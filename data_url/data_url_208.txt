The nvq++ compiler is generating IR that always executes the instructions involved in ternary operations. It should generate conditional IR instead. That is - for the a ? b : c expression, it should evaluate a, and then based on the result of a, it should then evaluate b OR c, not both.
The following kernel generates invalid Quake. Note how the resulting IR performs 3 measurements even though only mz(q1) OR mz(q2) should actually be exectuted.
Generated IR:
In the above example, mz(q0) should obviously be executed, but ONLY one of mz(q1) or mz(q2) should be executed.
Not a regression
A PR with a fix is forthcoming.
