This cannot be compiled:
This is fine:
So, the qpp.h is not self-contained because of the external dependency on iostream.
Not sure if that was recently introduced or not.
Good point, thanks. This issue is in the code for quite a long time, as we write (std::cerr) some additional context information before throwing exceptions. It is indeed a good idea of not having <iostream> a standard dependency, I will try to refactor the code. One idea is to replace e.g.
with
Or change the constructor of qpp::Exception to accept an optional context
Most likely I'll go with this last option.
Having a dependency on the <iostream> does not bother me at all as long as it does not come as a surprise.  I think the fix could be just to add this to the qpp.h
#include <iostream>
After all, the qpp.h has already included a whole bunch of std libraries, including this:
#include <ostream>
It seems the <iostream> has been forgotten to be added into the master header qpp.h. I guess, it is kind of a typo.
I think I'll get rid of explicit <iostream> dependency. It's quite a large header, and it's not really necessary, so I want to leave the user the opportunity to use e.g. <cstdio> if s/he wants. I personally don't like heaving an I/O header as part of a header-only library.
Cool. Whenever possible, less dependency is always better, of course.
Fixed on my side
Great. Thanks.
