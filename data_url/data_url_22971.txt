Current error message:
Hi, I've been coming across this error using the pyrpl-osx executable on sourceforge. I've also tried making an executable using the instructions here, but it seems that these instructions are out of date. I had difficulty understanding how to follow the answer on Stackoverflow so if you could help with a solution that would be great. Cheers!
