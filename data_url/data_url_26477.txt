hello,I meet a problem:make -j$(nproc) ARCH=minimal VERSION=sdbg test failed about cp2k@master on openEuler20.03_aarch64
log detail:
test-suilte.log
Can you tell me how to solve this problem?
@mkrack This command cannot be used and an error will be reported.
As hinted by the usage description of do_regtest.py, try
make -j ARCH=minimal VERSION=sdbg TESTOPTS+=”--timeout 900” test
instead.
@mkrack It's no use
[root@localhost spack-src]# make -j ARCH=minimal VERSION=sdbg TESTOPTS+=”--timeout 900” test
Discovering programs ...
make: *** No rule to make target '900”'.  Stop.

I don't use "+=", could you try with:
@alazzaro The TIMED OUT test case problem still occurs.
Same as the log above.
We can compare your timings with the https://storage.googleapis.com/cp2k-ci/dashboard_minimal_report.txt
For instance, your libcp2k_unittest takes 112.19s, while the CP2K dashboard reports 2.29s.
For the test li_chain.inp the dashboard reports 271.07s. So, my conclusion is that there is something which makes your execution very slow. Can it be that you are oversubscribing the number of cores? There is an option --maxtasks=2 that you can use in TESTOPTS=, i.e. TESTOPTS="--maxtasks=2 --timeout 900"
