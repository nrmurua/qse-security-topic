In many cases, we can assume the elements of the operators and states are real.  For example, SparsePauliOp has a real coefficients in many application cases. It is useful to configure its dtype as float. SparsePauliOp with dtype=float ensures that the operator is Hermite. This property will be used to check the Hermicity to make Unitary matrix by evolution.
In addition, configurable dtype can
This issue is completer for SparsePauliOp in #8620.
Other modules should support this feature.
