Description of the issue
The doc string here refers to cirq.MSGate which appears to have moved to cirq.ion.ion_gates.MSGate.
How to reproduce the issue
Look at https://quantumai.google/reference/python/cirq/ops/XXPowGate: "See also: cirq.MSGate".
Cirq version
0.10.0 and 0.11.0.dev
I think its appropriate to just update the docstring, so I opened #3992 for this.
