Could you provide the compilation guidance for AMD EPYC?
I have tried to use standard flags with Intel Compiler ver. 2018.
https://xconfigure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cp2k/#build-the-intel-fork-of-cp2k
After the compilation with Intel Compiler series 18 using Intel tool chain, I get an error:
[azure@ip-0A000104 cp2k]$ ./exe/Linux-x86-64-intelx/cp2k.sopt Please verify that both the operating system and the processor support Intel(R) X87, CMOV, MMX, FXSAVE, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4_1, SSE4_2, MOVBE, POPCNT, F16C, AVX, FMA, BMI, LZCNT, AVX2, AVX512DQ, AVX512F, ADX, AVX512CD, AVX512BW, AVX512VL and CLWB instructions.
Please note that xconfigure is a separate project and you should report problems with their documentation on their bugtracker: https://github.com/hfp/xconfigure/issues
We successfully build and deploy CP2K using our toolchain scripts or via Spack on AMD EPYC machines (using gfortran).
Just for reference, the issue is covered here: hfp/xconfigure#12
