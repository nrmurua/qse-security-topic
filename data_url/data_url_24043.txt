An option for exporting custom hardware calibrations from Qiskit Metal. This feature should mesh well with the existing Qiskit ecosystem, so I propose having a calibration .csv available for generation similar to quantum-computing.ibm.com's "Download Calibrations" button.

I believe this feature would be helpful to computer scientists involved in quantum computing. It would allow users to take advantage of the wide range of existing features offered by the Qiskit frameworks. For example, this calibration .csv could be easily used to create a Noise Model in Qiskit and visualize performance, run simulations, publish research, etc.

Code
I don't have a background in physics, so I'm not sure if an approximate gate error/thermal relaxation can be derived from what Qiskit Metal offers.
But, I think it'd be helpful to at least offer to export the coupling_map.


@ThomasGM4 Thoughts?
