Some files are missing __all__ and leaking variables.
Only user facing qutip functions should be available.
__all__ is missing in:
Hello @Ericgig,
I would like to work on this issue. I think everything is already included in all  in "qutip/solve/piqs.py" and in "semidefinite.py" do all the non-internal functions have to be in all ?
Sorry, piqs is fine, when I did the scan, it's qip.py that was found. qip.py is fine without a it.
semidefinite.py does not have a __all__, it would be nice that add one.
Yes, all user facing function should be included.
