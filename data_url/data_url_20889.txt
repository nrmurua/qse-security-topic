Should make sure that the Makefiles really have dependencies on all .c and .h files
and possibly the Makefile itself.
It would be quite unusual to list the Makefile as a dependency of a target, I think.
In terms of .h and .c dependencies, each scheme has that in its own Makefile, and the test Makefile just calls that.  However, the test Makefile didn't force a rebuild of the individual scheme, is that what you wanted?  If so, I've now added that in a7328f8.
I don't think we wanted that, we discussed exactly that option yesterday in the office and just having rebuild-scheme was and should be enough to make sure that the target was up to date.
The problem we ran into was that changes in the individual scheme files were not picked up by running the pythonized tests, because they would not trigger a rebuild. This make target takes care of this problem. No need for the make clean, if the Makefile correctly specifies the dependencies. That latter part is the crux of this issue I think; making sure that the Makefile does correctly specify this.
However, I think that this may be a bit overly complicated, because if you want to check that manually, you need to build a dependency tree of the C files; at that point you might as well generate the Makefile from the tree you built.
(Also not sure if e.g. automake or CMake may at that point be more suitable â€“ are they able to do that for you?)
We may just add this as a checkbox for the manual review process.
