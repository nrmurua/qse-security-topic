In NewHope's ntt.c there is the following bit of code:
If you set -Wstrict-overflow to a value larger than or equal to 3, it will complain that i + 1 < 9 is being simplified to i < 8. This is of course relying on the fact that i+1 won't overflow, otherwise this operation is not valid. However, this is trivially correct in this case.
To suppress this warning, you'd change i+1 < 9 to either i <= 9 or i < 8. However, that is not more clear that you're now thinking about the odd case i+1, so I'm not a fan making of this change. Instead, -Wstrict-overflow=4 isn't the right thing to set here. It's a warning that can be informative (like many of the higher levels of stuff not enabled by -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic), so you can double-check if the compiler is making the right assumptions, but not something to fail builds on.
