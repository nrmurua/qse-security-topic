Please be as descriptive as possible, including: what is expected, why is this feature needed, what is the objective, etc.
Another potential improvement, having the port names match up (Eg. not simply S11, but S_LumpPort_cpw_openLeft_end_LumpPort_cpw_openLeft_end, or S21 -> S_LumpPort_cpw_openRight_end_LumpPort_cpw_openLeft_end )
This way the user knows what port is actually pointing to what part of their layout. Although we probably should be simplifying the names of the ports being generated in Ansys too anyhow. (eg. LumpPort_cpw_openLeft_end ->LP_cpw_openLeft_end)
The user would know what is S11 vs S21.
The information is returned from pyEPR, however, may have a quick solution to get the list of "excitations" from Ansys and the order of the list corresponds to numbers in "S11 vs S21".
This has been resolved with future pull requests.
