Until version 0.3.1, there was a function called get_initial_state_instance, which disappeared from 0.4 without a mention in the changelog. I would appreciate if the documentation was enhanced to hint what we should do instead of using this function. Thanks.
Hi, at 0.4, all declarative methods are removed (get_xxx_instance).
Now you need to import the targeted class directly and construct the object via the constructor, for example, if you would like to use the Custom initial state, you can do like this
And then you can use the custom object as before. Thanks.
That worked. Thanks.
