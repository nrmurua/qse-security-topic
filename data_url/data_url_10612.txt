The term "full yield" is not accurate here.
An "evil" coupler, in my old terminology, is an internal coupler (a coupler between a horizontal and a vertical qubit) for which both qubits exist but the coupler does not.
"No internal defects" means that "no internal couplers are missing unless one of their qubits is missing"
It's quite a far cry from "full yield" -- and using that familiar term would cause significant confusion -- it's fine for qubits to be missing, and it's also fine for external couplers (those between qubits which are parallel) to be missing where both endpoints are present.
also, do you mean to be propagating the "embeddor" typo?
No, I just seem to really like that spelling
