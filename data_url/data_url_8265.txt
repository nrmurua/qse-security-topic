The changelog file is present in qutip/qutip-doc. This means that for each new release, the maintainers need to go through the merged PRs and update the file accordingly.
I propose introducing a copy of the changelog file, which would simplify maintenance: each contributor could update their own contribution without opening a PR in the separate repository, which often does not happen. A message of a basic template with checklist could be prompted in the PR for itself.
To prompt these actions, just like for the changelog, a template with suggested checklist could be made in the PRs.
Actually, this is all part of a wider problem for which the qutip-doc does not get well updated in general. In Qutip 4.5.0 I added a lot of missing elements to functions.rst and classes.rst in the api-doc. Moreover, the User guide is seldom updated. Maybe, moving the qutip-doc repository in the main qutip/qutip repository could help in this regard.
