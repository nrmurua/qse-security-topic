I was trying to see the phase transition of magnetization of a transverse Ising model, and I have the following graph. The magnetization changes unusually rapidly under the change of magnetic field and, I don't have this problem using my own library. Since the code I wrote is extremely simple and there is no error message, I wonder do you possibly have encountered the similar issues and have some suggestions on what it happens.
Here is the code, and the graph.
harray = np.zeros(11)
for i in range(11):
harray[i] = 0.0001 * i
#print harray
marray4 = np.zeros(11)
Mx = tensor(sigmaz(),identity(2),identity(2),identity(2))
+ tensor(identity(2),sigmaz(),identity(2),identity(2))
+ tensor(identity(2),identity(2),sigmaz(),identity(2))
+ tensor(identity(2),identity(2),identity(2),sigmaz())
earray4 = np.zeros(11)
for ii in range(0, 11):
plt.plot(harray, marray4, 'o-')
plt.show()

Thanks. I did just now.
