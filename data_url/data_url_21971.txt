I built a new development machine this afternoon based on Ubuntu 16.04. It has Xilinx Vivado 2017.4.
You need to update misoc.
I did the following again this afternoon. Same error.
Then when installing misoc... #914
why not use conda?
So I updated Misoc and the error is still there...
By using the artiq-dev.yaml I'm recreating the same build environment that your build bot uses. I create a new environment from scratch for every build. This has reduced the incidence of wrong-version dependency problems I've encountered in the last several months. Shouldn't this work?
Use the latest misoc from git (conda package probably available still, or you can trigger a build on Irc) we're not doing ci and full conda support for Sayma yet.
@jbqubit Did you run git submodule update --init in the misoc checkout?
(Or alternatively, did you clone it with --recursive, as the "Developing ARTIQ" guide recommends?)

Is this something @whitequark can work on in parallel?
@whitequark I cloned with --recursive.
Try using the conda packages. https://anaconda.org/m-labs/misoc/files is up to date.
@whitequark I cloned with --recursive.
Are there any files in misoc/misoc/software/unwinder?
@hartytp You also encountered this problem, did you resolve it with a correct recursive clone?
AFAICT this is a hidden dependency of cargo on libcurl. See the output.
This is currently working fine for me.
PS like the new diagnostics in artiq_flash.

No, libunwind is not written in Rust.
It's still a bug. Maybe not the underlying one here.
Anecdotal solutions are either conda install libcurl or checking for proper recursive git checkouts.
