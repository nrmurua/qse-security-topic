Describe the bug
The optimization target for our "extensions" constant time test is set to generic in the configuration.
To Reproduce
See https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/6287171192/job/17071374287#step:6:312
Expected behavior
The optimization target should be set to haswell, as per the arguments passed here.
Additional context
Per our documentation, the OQS_OPT_TARGET variable only has an effect if  OQS_DIST_BUILD=OFF. The value of OQS_DIST_BUILD isn't specified in the workflow configuration, so it defaults to ON. Hence, OPS_OPT_TARGET defaults to generic.
