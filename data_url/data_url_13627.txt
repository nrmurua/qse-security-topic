As far as I can tell, the contents of these files are all utilities for benchmarking. I don't think they would ever be used otherwise. Thoughts?
Also these files don't have unit tests (?) and pyquil_utils.py sets a global seed "for testing"...
Nice catch. Some cleanup of these files would be good.
Some reasoning about their location structurally is that they are for distinctly testing the different front/backends for mitiq. Benchmarks is for testing mitiq in its native representation (Cirq). Having these are separate modules makes it easier to extend or drop support for different ones. For example if someone didn't want to install the whole pipeline to test every platform, then they could pick and choose.
Closed in favor of #589
