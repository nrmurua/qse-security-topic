Introduced in #4763 , likely at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/ee854fb/qiskit/transpiler/passes/optimization/consolidate_blocks.py#L150 .
@kdk is this possibly fixed by #7185?
‚ùì PR #1186 seems to have removed time_transpile_simulator_ripple_adder and all tests depending on BasicAer entirely. Original link posted by OP needs an update.
Closest equivalent benchmark -https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit/#ripple_adder.RippleAdderTranspile.time_transpile_square_grid_ripple_adder?p-level=3&commits=2bd49408. For these tests, there are quite a few improvements (and dips) since the posting of this issue but and more or less the performance is same atleast as per this graph (the test which OP mentioned no longer exists). As with Issue #5067 comparing the original behavior on the newer test bench precisely with the old data could be a challenge even if we had the tests.
The code block check mentioned by OP resulted due to adding synthesis-based translation method in PR #4763 still exists but there have been significant changes since then as mentioned above also in #7185

https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/transpiler/passes/optimization/consolidate_blocks.py#L109
Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
Since #7185, ConsolidateBlocks is faster than it's ever been, so I'll close this as "almost certainly fixed".
