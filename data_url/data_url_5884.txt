Noise on gates that are made conditional on a classical measurement using .c_if is applied even if the conditional gate isn't triggered.
result:
{'0': 485, '1': 539}
The 50% bit-flip error triggers, even if the conditional gate never was applied.
Noise should only be applied if the conditional gate triggers.
As it works now, simulating for e.g. QEC is very challenging since you get noise from correction procedures that aren't triggered.
This may depend on the hardware you are trying to emulate, especially as classical conditioning is not a common feature in many real-world devices at the moment. But the option should probably exist.
Make gate errors from e.g. add_all_qubit_quantum_error(), only apply when c_if is triggered if such a conditional is used on the targeted gates. Potentially make this optional.
Thanks for pointing out this bug, this should be fixed by #1154
Great! Thanks.
