This benchmark was suggested by @andreamari. It is great because it (a) is easily understood by experimentalists and theorists and (b) rolls up an instance of ZNE (e.g. a noise scaling method and an extrapolation method) into a single performance number.
It proceeds by:
[1] Running RB on a backend to get an average gate fidelity
[2] Running RB + ZNE on a backend to get a new average gate fidelity
Allowing these to be compared to see that ZNE improves average gate fidelity.
After some further discussion with @andreamari, it is best not to include the fitting of the exponential decay. The ZNE is likely to do some unexpected things to that decay. Better will just be to check the average infidelity on increasing circuit depths. Mitigated circuits should be better
