Quantum needs to support multiple subnets. The multiple subnets should be able to span any network segment, i.e. the 172.16.0.0/12 network should be able to talk to the 10.0.0.0/8 network. However this needs to be built in a way that will allow locking subnets out of other subnets. Something like the 172.16.0.0/12 can only talk to the 10.8.0.0/16 network.
There will most likely be a new addition in the form of a control binary to manage the subnets and which subnets can communicate.
This needs to be completed before work on #26 can commence.
