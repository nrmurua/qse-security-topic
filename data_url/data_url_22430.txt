Using Artiq 1.0rc2 on Ubuntu 15.10, with the examples/master device_db, and the kc705-clock gateware, artiq_gui leaks memory.
Over 1000 minutes, the RSS linearly increased from 87 MB to 1500 MB.
I don't think this is a regression - I believe I have seen this issue in earlier versions of artiq_gui.
Were you running something in particular or is the memory consumption increasing while nothing is happening?
I was not running anything. I just started the master, ctrlmgr, and gui, and monitored the memory usage
Were there any logging messages emitted by e.g. ctlmgr?
No logging messages were emitted
Reproduced. Comes in chunks of about 6MB and valgrind doesn't see it. It's probably not strictly a "leak" then.
Python has some functions to print the state of the GC (number of live objects, etc.). What do they say if you call them regularly with a timer?

10 Qtimers, 10 functions, 10 tuples, and 30 cells per second.
probably harvimt/quamash#62
was quamash.
@sbourdeauducq or @whitequark could you please copy the package over?
Already there.
There is a bunch of Exception ignored in: Exception ignored in: pairs with the new quamash one for each applet. https://bugs.python.org/issue22836
