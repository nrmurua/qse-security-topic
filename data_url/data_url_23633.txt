PR #954 breaks the ami @spauka @sohailc .
on qc 0.1.9:
leads to:
I cannot seem to reproduce this with pyvisa-sim backend. Maybe the issue only occurs with an actual instrument?
I will run the QCodes example with AMI430 notebook in the documents with an actual magnet to see if everything still runs ok. I may not have access to a magnet today though. @spauka can you also look at this?
Hey @Dominik-Vogel,
I can't seem to reproduce this on v0.1.9, or on master (e4986ac) on an actual magnet.
Could this be related to #966? Can you try manually running the CURR:RATING? command?
@spauka we are now seeing this on a fridge in Copenhagen. I'm shooting blindly here, but do your powers supply have the PSwitch option installed? Ours don't and I think it might be the cause.
Hmm... now I'm less sure about my blind guess. It seems more like a firmware version issue. There are several options from the manual missing in the onboard menus.
The power supply controlled by our AMI 430 programmer is a 4Q06125PS. @spauka, which one do you have? Our firmware version (from the QCoDeS IDN parameter) is 2.52.
@WilliamHPNielsen I will double check the version string of the controller on Wednesday (currently out of the lab), but the power supply at least is the same (4Q06125PS).
I would be reasonably confident that it isn't the PSWITCH option as I checked that this disables correctly but the firmware version seems likely.
The other thing you could try is upgrade the controller firmware? From my reading of the manual the idea of the two commands was to be able to set a limit by the magnet construction (current rating) and a user limit (current limit) as an extra level of safety. But there's also no need for two things that end up doing roughly the same job, so #1052 would be a good fix if it works :)
