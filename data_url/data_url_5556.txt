A circuit with reset operation(s) is not guaranteed to be deterministic when shots=None, a setting which is supposed to cause probabilities to be calculated exactly.
is not deterministic.  The last line evaluates to (on successive runs):
Should evaluate to [{0: 0.5, 2: 0.5}]
[none]
Similar to #1810, I have created my own Sampler implementation based on Qiskit Terra's Statevector that supports resets exactly: https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/blob/main/circuit_knitting_toolbox/utils/simulation.py
I roughly read simulation.py. Here is my understanding:
This is very similar to #1766 (and #1766 supports c_if and other control-flow operations). We would like to re-think this issue after merging #1766.
