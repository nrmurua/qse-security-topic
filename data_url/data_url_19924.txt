Describe the bug
At least pytest-7.2.2 and pytest-7.4.2 fail for me with the following error:
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Expected behavior
Test execution starts. (no error)
Environment (please complete the following information):
Workaround
Remove --numprocesses=auto from /liboqs/tests/CMakeLists.txt
As removing this option seems to increase compatibility, I suggest this to be the default (or to replace it with a similar option).
main.py: error: unrecognized arguments: --numprocesses=auto
This error occurs if pytest-xdist is not installed. However, this package is clearly listed as prerequisite in documentation.
As removing this option seems to increase compatibility, I suggest this to be the default (or to replace it with a similar option).
Without this feature of "pytest-xdist" testing takes way too long -- and is way too inefficient on standard multicore processors. If you know of an alternative (command line option) to bring testing to the same performance level, please let us know. Otherwise we'll have to close this issue as "documented"/don't fix.
You are correct. I apologize for my misunderstanding. Thanks for the extra explanation.
