Describe the bug
Qutip can't handle number smaller than about 1e-15 in its operators?
To Reproduce
Please provide a minimal working example. For instance:
Expected behavior
I would have thought that you could store any double precision number in qutip array
Your Environment
This is because of the automatic tidy up of any matrix entries smaller than 1.e-12. You can turn it off by qutip.settings.auto_tidyup=False. Or set this threshold to a different number (http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-settings.html). This behaviour does seem a bit confusing though...
Ok this makes sense to me know, given the use of sparse matricies. Thanks @BoxiLi
