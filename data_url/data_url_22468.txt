Flashing pipistrello on Ubuntu 14.04 following Installing ARTIQ instructions. First problem is openocd is neither part of conda deployment nor is user instructed where to obtain openocd.
Install openocd using apt-get. $ sudo apt-get install openocd
Try to run artiq_flash.
Problem is that artiq_flash assumes location for .bit and .cfg files which is incompatible with the Getting Started documentation.

You need openocd from the git repository. See the manual.
Confirmed that building openocd from the git repository works fine. Please apply the following patch so users are not confused.
Sounds good. Please see https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contributing-code

The formatting was wrong and the location you move the openocd section to is also bad. I redid the changes. Ok now?
Thanks for applying the patch Robert. I've rebuilt the sphinx docs and it
looks good from my end. -Joe
