Executing some get started code from the site install section, I create a circuit and execute circ.draw() - the following error occurs:
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)

After Installing the recommended visualization software and libraries per this page: -
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/INSTALL.md
Windows Installation:
Install MiKTeX.
Install Poppler:
Download the latest binary.
Extract the downloaded .7z file into user directory: c:\Users<user_name>. Note: You will need to have the 7zip software for this.
Add to PATH:
Right click on "This PC" -> Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables
Add C:\Users<user_name>\poppler-0.51\bin to the user's path.
After Initial Install of QisKit:
import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
from qiskit import execute
q = QuantumRegister(3, 'q')
circ = QuantumCircuit(q)
circ.h(q[0])
circ.cx(q[0], q[1])
circ.cx(q[0], q[2])
circ.draw()
The presentation of a circuit diagram such as the ones on this page:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/qiskit/terra/quantum_circuits.ipynb
I need to understand the solution to this exception being raised, what DLL could not be found?

ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
SOLUTION FOUND:
This was a PILLOW problem not a QisKit Problem - which was the wrong version of PILLOW was installed using CONDA instead of PIP.
Instead, make sure you only have one version of Pillow installed, eg. uninstall the conda version and Re-install from pip
