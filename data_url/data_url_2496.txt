Now that Gate implements a validate_args that checks the qubit count, MultiQubitGate does nothing but replace def num_qubits(self): return X with super().__init__(X), which is not enough to justify its existence.
Find all cases where MultiQubitGate is used and replace them with inheritance from just Gate with a defined qubit count.
I'm happy to pick this up
Hi @balopat - if there is any grunt work associated with this one that you might be looking to offload, I would be more than happy to help out. Please do not hesitate to reach out!
Thank you @davemc84 - it wasn't that bad!
