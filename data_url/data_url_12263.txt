The current notebook of superposition_and_entanglement.ipynb does not work as desired if run on remote backends.
https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/reference/qis/superposition_and_entanglement.ipynb
The current notebook runs ok with local simulators, but when backend=ibmqx_qasm_simulator it cannot be run anymore unless the lowest_pending_jobs() function is called.
The circuit_drawer does not work (the image is misalign). Also, please provide the installation instruction of required packages for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

i dont see why we want the user to be using the online and if they want they can do write backend = "ibmqx_qasm_simulator".
Also i dont see what is wrong with the image. If is is the cropping make and issue just on that in the sdk and give the machine you are on.
also @ajavadia is working on that as an extension to the INSTALL in #95.
