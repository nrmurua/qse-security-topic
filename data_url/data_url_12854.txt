Hi.
I'd like to create a kata on quantum cryptography, is it alright to get that put on the roadmap? Intend to introduce the coder to a quantum key distribution scheme, show how it could be used to create a one-time pad, and have them test whether the line is being eavesdropped on when generating the key.
Thanks,
Daniel
Yes, absolutely! I'd call it "quantum key distribution" rather than "cryptography" kata, or even name it after a specific protocol you'll be showing, similar to the naming scheme we're using for quantum error correction katas.
I'll add it to the roadmap.
Thank you!
Great, quantum key distribution sounds good to me. BB84 is the natural place to start, will see if it feels right to focus strictly on that or introduce other protocols in the same kata as I develop it.
Hey @daniel-melia, just wanted to check whether you're still working on this kata? Please let me know if you need any help from me.
Hi @tcNickolas, had to limit my keyboard time and put personal projects on hold for a few months after developing RSI! Have it under control now so will be cracking on with the kata.
No rush, and glad you're feeling better!
