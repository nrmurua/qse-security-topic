Hello,
I am trying to package strawberryfields 0.15.1 into linux openSUSE Tumbleweed.
Strawberryfields was build on Open Build Service (OBS) which is a headless server with no internet connection.
While testing the package with pytest I found an error as shown below.
Specifically test_logger.py AssertionError which I suspect that it need network connection, therefore running test_logger.py with no internet connection will cause this error?
Also test_sf_cli.py AssertionError is cause by mismatch of antlr4-python3-runtime, because antlr4-python3-runtime on openSUSE TW is 4.8? Is it safe to ignore?
Full log here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/home:andythe_great/python-strawberryfields/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/x86_64
Python 3.8.5, pytest-6.0.1, py-1.9.0, pluggy-0.13.1, plugins: cov-2.10.1
Thank you.

Hi @kevinsmia1939, yes I believe the ANTLR runtime assertions are fine to ignore (and I'll look into why this mismatch is happening...).
For the other errors, this is very weird; none of our tests should require an internet connection, especially the logging tests.

Hello,
I was just guessing but does the module strawberryfields.api.connection that test_logger.py use, use the api/connection.py that check for network? If that is the case I will just ignore the test_logger.py.
The package buiding system (open build service) that were use to build strawberryfields is an isolated VM. Would this cause yltest_logger to fail?
If that is the case I will just ignore the test_logger.py.
That is a good solution for now ðŸ™‚ I believe that strawberryfields.api.connection may in fact be attempting to open a connection... this should be fixed and instead use a mock request.
@kevinsmia1939 I believe this issue can be closed now. #675 updated the logger tests. Let us know if you're still having issues with the logger tests and we can re-open the issue and look into it again.
