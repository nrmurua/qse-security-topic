I'm not sure if this is an issue but the latex would not compile unless I imported the package amsmath due to the use of the control sequence \text. Is the \text necessary?
I suspect that \text is the way to go. So this would be more a matter of documentation as opposed to changing the behavior. Also the documentation should do a better job of explaining how to get QCircuit.
What about \mathrm? It's a slightly inappropriate use, but if you're only using it for single words it should do the job (and it would be simple to extend beyond single words). I'll try it out after dinner if nobody objects.
Keep in mind that this may be applied to gates where people didn't even think for a second about the fact that the output of str might go into latex. Who knows what might be in there. Arbitrary unicode, left-to-right markers, you name it.

I don't think requiring amsmath is onerous (it's pretty standard), and it seems that \text is the best solution.  I'm going to close unless someone really objects and has a better solution.
