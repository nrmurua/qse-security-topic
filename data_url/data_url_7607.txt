Cache is used for storing intermediate variables to speed up calculation. (This is python)
A block has its favored data format, such as 'sparse', 'function' and 'mpo', only sparse and mpo allow caching.
Caching is needed only if this matrix can be used multiple times.
e.g. a block consist of a queue of Controlled-Z gates, the sparse matrix representation is diagonal, caching the constructed sparse matrix can be super efficient for future use.
