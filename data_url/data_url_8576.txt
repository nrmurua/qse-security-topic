Setting the phase option with fid_params does not seem to work.   set_phase_option() does not have access to fid_params and when passed in None, sets the option by the fidcomp.phase_option field. However, that appears to be deprecated and requires hard coding in the FidComputer reset method.

set_phase_option() replaced by phase_option.setter, which is called by apply_params()
