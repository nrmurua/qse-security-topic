In this issue I am only speaking about pragmas, not annotations.
Please read the whole issue first, the initial improvements proposed are not needed anymore if the last proposition is validated.
Currently, the parser seems to require that pragmas are in the global scope:

Currently, a pragma is not a Statement in the AST

Possible improvements:
As a side note, a type checker like mypy would likely catch this inconsistency with the right test.
Here is a proposition that I think will simplify everything: require pragmas to be at the beginning of the OpenQASM 3 file, right after the Version specifier. This has numerous advantages in my opinion:
The statement rule

The addition to the program rule would also be trivial, from

Changing the grammar as in the previous section would also enforce directly in the grammar that pragmas have to be in the global scope.
Having a definite place for the pragma would allow a simpler processing of the AST: instead of processing a generic Statement and having a specific branch for pragma, they would be processed separately.
This is the last but in my opinion the most important improvement of the proposed change: OpenQASM 3 programs would be more readable with all the pragmas at the beginning.
As pragma can potentially change a lot of things in how the OpenQASM file is read/interpreted/executed I think that enforcing a specific place at the beginning of the file for them to be would help everyone.
If this proposition seems like a good idea to the community, I will do a PR trying to implement it correctly.
