The text circuit drawer with vertical_compression="high" can over-compress classical register conditions when cregbundle=True.

There should be an extra line between q_1 and the c registers to have the classical wire condition in place completely.

Actually, a simpler reproducer:

This was apparently intentional behavior in the past. In test/python/visualization/test_circuit_text_drawer.py see
for example. There are 7 other tests with similar displays. I think vertical_compression="high" means high compression always.
Yeah, looks like you're right that it was originally the intended behaviour: #2480 (comment).  That's a little strange to me, but I suppose it's a valid design choice, so not a bug.  Thanks!
