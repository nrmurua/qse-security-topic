In the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10876.pdf three metrics were proposed to represent Ansatz quality of variational circuits were proposed: Expressibility, Entangling capacity and circuit cost. However, to the best of our knowledge these metrics are not available in Qiskit nor in any of these issues in progress.
We have implemented these metrics and matched our numbers to that of this paper. We have 3 different ways to calculate fidelity distribution for Expressibility which are as follows:
(Note: The paper found the expressibility values for the circuits using PennyLane, as mentioned, however the codes are not available. We have discussed the results with the authors of the paper and they followed the method in point 1. Since the first method is the easiest/fastest and our results are also matching, we kept that as default method, but the user can choose whichever method they want to use.
Hi, I would love to help but I'm new to qiskit. Could we break this down perhaps and maybe make a good-first-issue? How can I help (with research/code/etc.)?
Hi Kris, thanks for offering help. We have already completed the code and submitting the PR today.
