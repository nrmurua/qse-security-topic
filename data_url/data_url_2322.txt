An unused import (Optional) passed CI here: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blame/master/cirq/ops/pauli_gates.py#L15
Now I'm getting an error for that on Travis: https://travis-ci.com/quantumlib/Cirq/jobs/225990740#L253
When I run pylint locally, I don't catch this or other import errors.  This has happened during my last few PRs: https://travis-ci.com/quantumlib/Cirq/jobs/225990740#L251
I updated my local pylint to pylint==2.3.1, astroid==2.1.0 and still don't get the errors that Travis shows.
Can anyone else reproduce this?
Could it be that the errors have nothing to do with the unused import? What you linked has
Alongside the unused import error.
The same thing happened in #1963 (last commit on Apr 15).  I got an unused import error on Travis but no errors locally.
I just ran your cduck:eject-pauli branch locally on my machine and i received lots of unused imports.
I also have pylint==2.3.1, astroid==2.1.0. I always get these but i ignore them and they pass on Travis.
At least some of those are imports only used in a type comment.  The latest pylint version should handle that.
We are on the latest version on pylint, what we are not on the latest version of is astroid because this bug has not been fixed pylint-dev/astroid#650.
This is growing stale and we probably need someone to repo again to make progress.
I still notice pylint checks returning more results on my machine than in ci.
I noticed that the pylintrc has a weird configuration - it used [config] instead of [MASTER] section - not sure how it was working at all - I think we were running pylint with default settings everywhere.
#3387 is fixing this + upgrades to the latest pylint.
I believe that #3387 should fix this issue.
