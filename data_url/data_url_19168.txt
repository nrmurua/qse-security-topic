I've been trying to use the expectation_from_samples method under SymbolicHamiltonian together with measurements in the Pauli X/Y basis (#799).
However, expectation_from_samples currently only accepts Hamiltonians with only Z's (link) and raises an error otherwise.
Is this check still necessary, and can it be removed?
Sample code:
Other than that, a minor documentation issue with expectation_from_samples: the lines under freq are missing 4 spacesðŸ˜€
@AlejandroSopena are you looking into this and #719?
I haven't looked at it in detail, but I can take care of it
