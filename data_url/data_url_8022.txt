I'm unable to run a time-dependent Hamiltonian, or even compile one with a string coefficient.
I tried to copy the example code on the website

as well as write a simple script (below), but both fail.
The output is a traceback which ends with the following errors and exceptions:
I'd appreciate some help, as my code requires the string input to run faster, with the speed-up offered by Cython. It is quite slow with the function-based input.
The expected behavior is a quantum object with a list of results plotting the expected value of sigma_z.

@HarshBabla99 I'm guessing based on the error message that you are running QuTiP on Windows. Do you have a C compiler installed? The compiler is needed to compile the strings. The Windows installation instructions are outlined at https://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html#installation-on-windows. I would recommend installing everything using conda if you can (see higher up on the install documentation page).
If the compiler is installed, perhaps it is an issue with the compiler not being present in the PATH.
Either way, this appears to be not an issue with QuTiP itself, but let's keep this issue open for a bit so that we can help you resolve things as best we can.
I would also recommend upgrading your Python, QuTiP and numpy to more recent versions if possible. If you use conda, you should get the latest versions unless you explicitly request otherwise.
Closing this since there hasn't been a reply, but please reopen if needed.
