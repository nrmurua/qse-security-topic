The expected enhancement is to make the parallel functions located in qiskit.tools.parallel able to run across multiple nodes in a cluster. Also, instead of CPU_COUNT = local_hardware_info()['cpus'], the functions should only use the cpus allocated to it by the job scheduler.
‚ùì : As per PR #5324 and #5384 users can now specify the number of parallel processes to use with parallel_map with the 'QISKIT_NUM_PROCS' environment variable. The parallel functions fall back to CPU_COUNT = local_hardware_info()['cpus']
only if 'QISKIT_NUM_PROCS' is set to None. I believe what OP wishes can be achieved by setting 'QISKIT_NUM_PROCS'.
Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
Indeed, I thinks this was fixed by #5324 . Thanks @mrvee-qC !
@Qutrit  , feel free to reopen otherwise.
