There are several synthesis algorithms for linear nearest neighbor (LNN) connectivity (that can be embedded into heavy-hex connectivity). These algorithms include:
These algorithms should be added to qiskit.synthesis.
For completeness, it would be useful to transfer Clifford and CNOT-Dihedral synthesis from qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis to qiskit.synthesis.
Further advanced synthesis methods could be added to qiskit ecosystem, and used via the High Level Synthesis plugin, such as the ones suggested in:
