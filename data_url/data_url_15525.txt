When I read the Transpiler document, it says the basis_gates are ['id', 'rz', 'sx', 'x', 'cx'] which matches the basis gates for ibmq_manila. However, when this document uses qc.decompose() to transpile gates later, it transpiles the circuit to 'u2', 'u3', and 'p' which are not listed in the given basis gates. Should we change qc.decompose() to transpile(qc, backend) to make sure they use the basis gates listed previously?
Yeah I would agree. We should probably exchange all the qc.decompose() occurances to transpilations since e.g. the final decomposition of the Toffoli also doesn't use the actual basis gates of the device. Using the decomposition method is outdated (and far from optimal!) now that we don't have U1/2/3 as basis gates anymore.
Hi, did #8129 fix this or is there still work to be done?
