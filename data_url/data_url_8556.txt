version 3.2.0 can not run testing in my mac system OS X EI Capitan. When I try:
$  python3 -c "import qutip.testing as qt; qt.run()"
I get the follow message:
Ran 0 tests in 0.000s
However, the testing.py and the folder 'tests' exist. I can run the test in the 'tests' folder one-by-one. For example, when I run:
$ sudo python3  test_mesolve.py
I get
.....................
Ran 21 tests in 48.167s
OK
sudo is needed here for permission. For example, when I run:
$ python3  test_mesolve.py
I get a set of the following error message

The problem is solved by myself. This is due to remain files after I  uninstalling qutip 3.1.0. One
just need to delete the whole folder 'lib.macosx-10.11-x86_64-3.5' at the position ~/.pyxbld. Then the self testing working.
The delete is not needed. Reopen the terminal may solve the problem
