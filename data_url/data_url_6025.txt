The code block below takes ~100 seconds to run using qiskit 0.18.0 and uses an excessive amount of CPU time (~600% on MacBook Pro). Running same code on qiskit 0.17.0 only took about ~0.1 seconds.
The following code produces the issue. The problem seems to arise when the noise_model and initial_layout options are used in the execute command.
Time taken for the code to run would be similar to that using qiskit 0.17.0.
Not clear to me at the moment.
Hi @a-rawlinson! This bug is already solved (see #693) in AER release 0.5.1 (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/releases/tag/0.5.1) , which is already available. Please, update your AER version:
Thanks for letting us know!
Thanks @vvilpas. The update to qiskit 0.18.3 resolved the issue.
