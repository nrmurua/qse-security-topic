I wanted to know how to use supported algorithms (mc_eliece for example) that are not listed.
You write on the main page, that "it might still be possible to use it in the fork through either one of two ways", but the link leads to an empty page.
Thanks in advance.
The link is here. It seems there's a slight typo in the README.
Perfect, thank you
