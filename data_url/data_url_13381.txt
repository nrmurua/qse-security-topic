We need to add the Clifford Data Regression (CDR) section to the Users Guide part of the documentation. An example with the "CDR API" is present already.
This should appear in the table of contents in Section 2, after PEC.

I can take a first stab at it, as I understand @L-P-B is working on making the CDR example(s) more detailed.
This can be a basic paragraph to start with, plus workflow figure. Related issues on #908 and #944.
@L-P-B can I assign this to you?
yes!
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
