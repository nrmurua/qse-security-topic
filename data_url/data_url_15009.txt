The partial_transpose should return a density matrix of the same dimensionality as the input DensityMatrix object. When the dimensions are for systems different than qubits, the dimensions are currently not preserved.
For in the following example, the dimensions of the output density matrix œÅ2 are (9,) but they should be (3,3).
It should be an easy fix. The function should return:
instead of just:

Thanks, Diego.  Would you like to make the PR as well?
Hi @jakelishman. Will do.
