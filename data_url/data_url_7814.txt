Hi,
I want to use full ED method to diagonalize the Hamiltonian of the S=1 Heisenberg chain and derive the magnetization value of the model versus applied magnetic field in the z direction.
the efficient way to speed up calculations is considering conserved Sz total.
Is there any option to conserve Sz total in qutip?
