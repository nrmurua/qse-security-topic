StructuredSolver.sample_bqm(bqm) submits linear/quadratic coefficients to the QPU, but it drops off the constant energy offset (if it exists). SAPI doesn't accept energy offset, but sample_bqm should apply it to QPU results, if it was provided.
This means we need to "patch" energies returned by SAPI not only in the sampleset, but also in raw solutions data.
If we are doing this for sample_bqm, we might as well add optional offset parameter to sample_ising and sample_qubo methods. In both StructuredSolver and UnstructuredSolver interfaces.
