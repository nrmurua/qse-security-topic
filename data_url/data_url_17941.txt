The clbit_labels and qubit_labels are currently specified in the qobj-level schema. They actually belong to experiment-level schemas as they vary from circuit to circuit.
To add to this in the #879 PR I changed the clbit_label to be more like the qubit_label. This isn't something enforced by the schema, but I would still like to change the meaning inside terra.
The old meaning of clbit_label was that each creg mapped to a contiguous region of the memory, but I think we should do it like the qubit_label which is that each part of memory arbitrary maps back to a qasm register (or doesn't map and is NULL)
