It would be great to have a bit more structure to branch naming and/or labeling to make automating release notes and house keeping easier.
Some options I found are:

https://github.com/marketplace/actions/label-actions
https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pr-labeler
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
