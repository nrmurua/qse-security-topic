Hello,
Thank you very much for the fantastic package. It is extraordinarily helpful.
I would like to use the composite Hilbert Space feature with my qubit design implemented in the custom circuits feature. I intend to build semiclassical models of multiple custom qubits and interact with them using QuTiP. In my quick tests, I run into type errors.
Is it correct that this feature is not implemented?
Is there a workaround, e.g. wrapping the custom circuits object into a compatible format?
Do you plan to implement such compatibility?
I am a PhD student focusing on numerical cQED simulations and I am interested in contributing to a solution
Thank you very much,
Chris
Hi Chris,
Thank you very much for your message. Could you please post a minimal working example snippet to show the failure? Thanks!
There are some ongoing developments on the HilbertSpace and Circuit module in ZTP_qcspice and/or sec-noise branches which are not yet going into the main branch.
Best,
Tianpu
Thank you for your response. Here is the requested minimal example:
I get the following error messages:
I would like to input a custom circuit into a composite Hilbert space and interact with it using QuTiP.
Hi Chris,
Thank you for sending the example. The problem is that the attribute truncated_dim is set to None by default in the Circuit module (I will correct this in a future commit), which should be an integer for HilbertSpace. Thus, just setting that attribute (as shown) should be good enough.
Please let us know if you would encounter any other problems.
Since, we did not get a reply I will assume that the issue is resolved. I will close the issue now, feel free to open it if it did not get resolved.
Yes. The issue was fully resolved due to your comment! Thank you very much. Sorry for not answering before. I got fully absorbed into the vast capabilities of scQubits.
