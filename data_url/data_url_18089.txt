I am going to try the issues first approach :-)
I will work on a pull request to remove the openquantumcompiler and the tools/apps. This is low priority and is not in the main updates for next release so we dont need to track
I will do these as two seperate pull requests.
the opencompiler is remove.
New is to remove the tools/apps does anyone see any problem in removing them and if comments come up we suggest they use acqua.
Chopping unused and redundant parts is always welcome, thanks Jay! Perhaps it would make sense to aim for the removal of tools/apps along with 0.6? I think the tutorials might be their main visible users, and this way we can include the change in a major version in a clean-ish way.
Sure I agree that this should not be part of 0.5.6
Any news about this? The idea is to move them to Aqua?
@chunfuchen this is the issue for removing the tools/app when you do the pr just link to this one.
