CompilationOptions is given too much importance:
Remove the compile entry.
Show the compile entry at the end and shorted it to only show the non-default values.

Hi @Ericgig, I would like to work on this issue. It seems to be a minor issue that I might be able to fix. I also request you to give more information about the changes to be made and where.
Hi,
The print should show all the important information without being overwhelming...
I am not sure what would be the best way to do it and am hopping that someone with a good idea comes along.
But the compile entry is too long and not important enough to be placed first...
qutip.settings is defined in qutip/settings.py.
If you think it would be useful to change the compile entry representation, it can be updated by changing qutip/core/options.py:QutipOptions.
Great! I was thinking of doing the same. I think it has something to do with  _use_cython, _compiler_flags and _link_flags which do not hold the default values. In my opinion, all the other values should be removed other than these three. I also need some clarity though.
I did not know that you replied to my comment. My deleted comment is this.
Hi. I moved compile at the end and want to know what is a good way to tell values. The values comes from _options in qutip.core.coefficient.py. qutip/core/options.py just copied them so it can't see if they are default. What do you think is a good way to set default values and tell it to qutip/core/options.py? Thank you.
@devyloper I thought the same thing. However, In options.py. It is said that "Default options are in a class _options dict." So I just compared self.options with self._options
