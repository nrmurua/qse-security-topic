Hi guys,
The last day and a half I've been struggling with the tektronix 5014 AWG driver. Most of it is working except for writing .awg files. Sending over the data and creating the file works fine, however when trying to load a file it gives met the very undescriptive error  E11401: File C:\\Waveforms\test.awg wrong format.
I am quite sure the error has something to do with the difference between data formats between python2 and python3 but as the file that get's generated is quite massive it is rather hard to debug.
As most of the labs are actually using the tektronix 5014 I was wondering if anyone has a minimum working example that sends and loads a file using python3.
From experience I know that sending a .awg file without some of the settings loads just fine, but sets the default settings for those settings that are not specified. I tried reducing my minimal working example to send just a filename with the records "MAGIC", "VERSION" and 1 setting but even that does not load correctly, possible because this is too little or potentially because there is some error in my encoding.
I am using the struct.pack method for packing my bytes and the visa_handle.write_raw() method to write it.
For those interested in giving it a go,
The dataformat is described in the "online-help" of the tektronix under "Fiile and Record Format of the AWG".
Any help would be much appreciated.
Found the bug, turned out the format requires an extra Null byte after specifying the name string. Also updated the docstrings in the pack record function of the AWG driver so that other people will hopefully not experience the same frustrations.
