Sometimes you want to test metaclass stuff.  When you do this you typically write a test that creates a bad class.  Currently incremental coverage marks this as uncovered.  Stuff in tests shouldn't count for incremental coverage?
Test code is important to include in coverage. I've seen too many cases of someone writing the equivalent of tesl_does_not_run (note the typo).
We do have a way to manually disable coverage with a comment "coverage: ignore". It's per line.
Closing now that Craig has contributing.md fix that calls this out.
