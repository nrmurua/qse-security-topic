This issue rounds out the epic to support cancelling tasks and dispatches.  As this feature involves several moving parts, it is important to verify through functional tests that they interact correctly:
 Test cancelling an entire dispatch
 Test cancelling specific tasks within a dispatch. Verify that tasks without a cancelled parent complete successfully.
 Test cancelling a task in a dispatch that corresponds to a sublattice. Give the sublattice dispatch time to start running. Verify via ct.get_result(sub_dispatch_id) that the sublattice dispatch status is cancelled.
 Please incorporate at least the linked functional tests.
 Check that the UI marks cancelled tasks as cancelled.
  Document ct.cancel() in the RTD.
