Would it be an idea to look at autodoc for setting up automatic documentation of the API?
My colleague uses it for his project:
https://kwant-project.org/doc/1/
As  I understand, it can generate an API reference from the code, which would be handy. The tutorials are great, but also a bit out of date, and then I find myself doing a lot of code hunting and grep search_string $(find . -type f). And for things without a docstring, you can at least still get a direct link to the code, for example.
There is something like this: https://pyrpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py-modindex.html - it just needs a (human) hand to become a little more practical...
Ah, yes, gotcha! Indeed, its a tricky one to automate.
