Dear developers,
Could you add options to print gaussian cube files having higher resolution? The current maximum (STRIDE 1) is not enough for, say, Bader analysis.
Thanks in advance.
I would be possible - but an easier option is just to rerun the calculation with a higher cutoff. As the wfn is stored in Gaussian AO form, there is no problem reading in the converged density matrix from a calculation with a different cutoff.

Thank you, it is the answer I needed.
