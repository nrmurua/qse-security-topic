Hi all!
From https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15044:
In practice, a properly shaped waveformâ€”like the Blackman waveform, which we will use here â€” can mitigate unwanted modifications to the modulated signal, stemming from spectral leakage or noise sensitivity.
From https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.blackman.html:
The Blackman window is a taper formed by using the first three terms of a summation of cosines. It was designed to have close to the minimal leakage possible. It is close to optimal, only slightly worse than a Kaiser window.
Hence, should we implement a KaiserWaveform based on https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.kaiser.html (probably with beta = 8.6)?
To implement, with beta=14 by default, as suggested in numpy's documentation.
