Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
If I use an almost unitary (because of numerical error) matrix using e.g. scipy.linalg.expm to construct input for MatrixGate with dtype of np.complex64, allclose should be less strict for it to pass unitarity check. If I use np.complex128 instead, it passes but some simulators like QsimSimulator do not accept np.complex128 for its dtype.
Describe the solution you'd like
I can specify rtol/atol for linalg.is_unitary as optional arguments to MatrixGate.__init__.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
I am actually surprised that atol/rtol is not propagated to the constructor, we typically (should) do that! Good first issue for someone, as it should be relatively easy to introduce these with the same defaults is_unitary has.
