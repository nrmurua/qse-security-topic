There shouldn't be a problem installing spyder.
qcodes does not install spyder by default and the user needs to install it to the qcodes environment using pip or conda.
So when you create a conda environement for qcodes, e.g. conda create -n qcodes python=3.7 (or later)
Then let's say you are using pip to install qcodes:
Then in the same environment:
Finally run the spyder after the installation completion:
This should open spyder with qcodes kernel
Let me know if the above steps work on your side and if you see error, please share us the error. I am gonna update our qcodes documentation to clarify installing spyder.
thank you!
