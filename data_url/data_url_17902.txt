Currently, the classical register stores counts with a label written in the following immutable ordering

I'm guessing this convention was probably chosen because it nicely matches the binary representation of an integer, i.e.

However, after dueling with different basis conventions and circuit diagrams I came to the conclusion that adding to the create_classical_register() function a simple Boolean parameter, e.g. reverse, to reverse this ordering, would be very helpful. This would be set to False by default not to alter the current behavior, but the option would be available for the users needing it.
It would be useful because, for some applications, the binary representations of integers and fractional numbers are more conveniently written in the reverse order. There's a workaround by changing which qubit is measured to which classical register, but I think it is still valuable to consider adding this feature as it would be cleaner to only declare this when creating the classical register and then perform all measurements matching the indices of the quantum and classical registers. I leave this to your consideration.
We have decided to make the convention ordered MSB to the right. We provide a reverse function for viewing the circuit in the opposite order.
