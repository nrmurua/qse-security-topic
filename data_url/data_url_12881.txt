I'm using OSX.  I've tried tracking this down, but have spent way too much time trying to figure out where the pre-processor is called, and how to resolve this.

I assume the standard C++ headers are used.  If that's true, these are installed and used in my C++ code.  For the record, I can go to the scripts dir and run regression_tests.sh.  12 of 20 run fine... only the ones requiring headers math.h or stdio.h fail.
Guessing there's not a lot of OSX users here...
I gave up on this after also trying to get the QX simulator to load and run on OSX.  That crashed on startup.  With that, I switched to using LINUX.  Everything works fine.
Bummer that Mac QC tools seem to be orphaned; but happy LINUX appears to have support.
