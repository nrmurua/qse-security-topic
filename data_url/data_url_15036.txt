(I'm new to quantum computing, please excuse me if this is not a mistake, thank you)
When we realize the circuit as followed:

It should return |00>+e^{-i\pi/2}|11>, but it results:

Using IBM Quantum composer, we have:


Actually, it works weirdly for x gate p gate, too. p gate should change the phase of |1> but it didn't.
This isn't entirely a bug, but it is somewhat confusing behaviour.  A quantum state is only really defined up to some global phase; the state $\lvert 00\rangle + i\lvert 11\rangle$ will have the same expectation value for every physical observable as the state $i\lvert 00\rangle - \lvert 11\rangle$.  The qsphere code in Terra chooses to fix the global-phase gauge in some particular way (I forget what exactly), which was a deliberate choice back when it was first written in #765.
I think we've had enough complaints about the global phase gauge fixing now that it's worth us considering removing that normalisation step.
OK, thanks a lot for your reply :)
Closing as wontfix for now. If somebody wants to contribute to the "enough complaints", please submit a new issue and refer to this one. Thanks!
