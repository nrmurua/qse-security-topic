Running python from within the protocols directory causes protocols/json.py to shadow json, resulting in AttributeError: module 'json' has no attribute 'loads' (for example).
This makes running individual tests in protocols slightly confusing. Does the module need to be named json.py?
To avoid problems like this it's best to never cd inside a python package hierarchy. You can still run individual tests by just passing the fully-qualified path, e.g.:
Same problem for cirq.google package, but I think the solution is the same. There are just too many possible name collisions to be able to avoid them all, so the best thing is to use namespaces (they are a honking great idea after all :-) ). CD'ing into a package hierarchy puts subpackages onto your python path, which breaks package namespacing.

Fair enough.
