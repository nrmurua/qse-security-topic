A gate operation is formed by a list of qubits and a gate, but there is no check for consistency between the two. As an example, you can make a GateOperation with a CCX gate which must act on three qubits but only give the GateOperation one qubit.
This second line returns false in this example whereas it should always return true. The qubit list provided should need to pass the gate's validate_args method.
