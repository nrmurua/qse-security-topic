Description
I'm trying to create a CQM from an existing BQM, but when I run the code I get this error :
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\Users\elmm\Desktop\MIT OCW Codes\CQM.py", line 189, in 
best_solution = solve_bqm(cqm, x, SimulatedAnnealingSampler())
File "C:\Users\elmm\Desktop\MIT OCW Codes\CQM.py", line 147, in solve_bqm
response = sampler.sample(bqm, **kwargs)
File "C:\Users\elmm\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\lib\site-packages\neal\sampler.py", line 206, in sample
bqm = bqm.change_vartype(dimod.SPIN, inplace=False)
AttributeError: 'ConstrainedQuadraticModel' object has no attribute 'change_vartype'
Expected Behavior
I expected the code to output the results from the annealing through CQM. I'm quite new to this suite and would really appreciate the correction on code to get the CQM of this BQM. Can you kindly walk me through converting this method to create a CQM please?
Hi @ACE07-Sev
I believe the problem is not the CQM you've made from a BQM but the fact that neal.SimulatedAnnealingSampler accepts BQMs, not CQMs. If you just pass your original BQM to it that should work fine
Hi, I tried this sampler, but got error again :

MemoryError
this was my sampler code :
cqm, x = build_setcover_cqm(U, V)
sampleset = ExactCQMSolver().sample_cqm(cqm)
hi, what sampler will work for CQM so I can try to see if it works with that?
The ExactCQMSampler will work for very very small problems with small integer ranges. Your other option is LeapHybridCQMSampler from dwave-system.
If you want to solve a BQM on that CQM sampler then you can just do
Closing as I believe the runtime errors are resolved.
