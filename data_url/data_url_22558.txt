There is no reason to enforce start < stop. Use cases are those where there are experimentally desired side effects of scanning start > stop (non-returning transport of ions) or those where small values should be scanned last because they are "dangerous" in some sense (potential ion loss).
See also #128.
I agree with Robert.
