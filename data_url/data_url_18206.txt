Fail to compile cpp-simulator (qiskit_simulator) with g++ (GCC) 6.4.0 on Windows 7 (Cygwin 64bit).
Add the following lines in the head of simulator.hpp
Hi @itoko , I'm working on some stuff for QISKit that will add Windows support among other cool things ;)... I already have a Win64 executable with all it's dependencies in a package, just in case you need the Windows simulator right now, and cannot wait until my changes are merged (very soon I hope!).
@itoko we have merged CMake integration in master branch, so anyone should be able to build the simulator on Windows. Just follow CONTRIBUTING guide steps to make the build.
I'm closing this issue, if you find problems building it with CMake, let's open a new one.
