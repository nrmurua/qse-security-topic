Describe the bug
Possible tensorflow performance bottleneck due to repeated tracing of tf.function decorated modules
To Reproduce
In Simulated_Calibration.ipynb:
Suggested workarounds
Possible causes and solutions:
(1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, -- please define your @tf.function outside of the loop.
(2) passing tensors with different shapes, -- @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing.
(3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. -- please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.
