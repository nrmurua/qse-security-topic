LeapHybridSampler and LeapHybridDQMSampler update required solver features on kwargs level only, effectively ignoring user's config from file/env.
This behaviour predates #288 and fixes in #317, where we addressed such behaviour only in the QPU samplers.
This issue can be seen as a hybrid analogue of #335.
