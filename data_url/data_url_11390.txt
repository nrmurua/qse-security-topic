When trying to generate a random problem (e.g. TSP.random_instance(n_cities=[10])) I get the following error. I think it is because the check_kwargs function returns a tuple that is then directly fed into numpy (which doesn't like the tuple). However, I may be using the function wrong, if that is the case just let me know.
Is there any particular reason why you are passing n_cities as a list, i.e. n_cities=[10], ?
On dev, running tsp = TSP.random_instance(n_cities=10).get_qubo_problem() runs ok. I agree the docs are not the easiest to navigate when you use the random_instance() method! Apologies!
It threw the same error with int or list, but it is fixed on dev now
Ok! I will close this assuming that the bug has been fixed by some of the changes we made to dev then :)
