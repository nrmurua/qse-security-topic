In circuit qobj, experimental header comprises qubit_labels, n_qubits,  qreg_sizes, clbit_labels, memory_slots, creg_sizes and name. This header information is copied to ExperimentResult and this may be utilized in other post-processing modules, e.g. in qiskit-ignis.

A pulse experimental result with meas_level=2 is expected to return a comparable ExperimentResult, but it is actually deficient in the experimental header. Currently it has only name, and memory_slots is added in #3048 .
We need to add other header items as well even though a pulse schedule is not necessary to have those information - qreg_labels, qreg_sizes, clbit_labels and creg_sizes.
It may be worth to define default pulse header policy, i.e. schedules has a single qubit group and classical bit group. This default header can be overwritten by scheduler, as discussed in #3046.
The issue preventing a straightforward implementation of the circuit approach is the dual nature of the clbit. Within the circuit model there is only a ClassicalRegister or bit, however, the pulse module and qobj specification provides both a Memoryslot for persistent storage and Register for fast feedback. There may be a much larger number of memoryslots compared to registers.
I see two possible solutions to this problem:
As we move towards actual conditionals instruction execution we will run into a problem on one of two sides:
Thoughts @ajavadia, @lcapelluto?
