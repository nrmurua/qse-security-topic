Qobj.ptrace is inconsistent between sparse=True and sparse=False arguments if the selection arguments are not in order:
I'm fairly sure the only problem is that the dimensions come out incorrectly - for separable states, we find
which is also consistent with _ptrace_dense (which sorts sel).
Pretty sure the solution is just to sort sel on input, but wanted to check with @Ericgig.
Also, I was just quickly searching for a quick-and-dirty "obviously correct" method of doing the partial trace to use as the test case (rather than keeping around a legacy Cython version just to test against), and found this StackOverflow answer which has like 3 people telling someone "don't do it yourself, just use QuTiP"!  Pretty neat!
I looked at the documentation and there is no mention about which is expected.
But sparse seems in the wrong here since only the dims are switched, not the data.
I would have expected:
Yes, just sorting sel seems appropriate.
