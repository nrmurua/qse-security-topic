Description
dimod.ising_to_qubo({}, {(1,2): 1}) gives a key error. The function seems to work only if all nodes specified in J are also specified in h:
But h={}, h={1: 1}, or h={2: 1} give a key error; e.g.:
Steps To Reproduce
dimod.ising_to_qubo({}, {(1,2): 1})
Expected Behavior
J nodes alone should be accepted with h nodes implicitly set to zero.
Environment
Additional Context
I think this used to work
I think this is consistent with the behavior from the legacy sapi clients. Based on a quick look at the git history, I don't think this ever worked. We can definitely update the behavior.
