To guarantee easy readability and maintainability of the code, conventions for syntax, documentation and testing must be established and followed by the developers.
Such conventions must first be established and documented in the wiki (https://github.com/qutech/qc-toolkit/wiki/Coding-Conventions).
I would suggest to follow the PEP 0008 guidelines for code and PEP 0257 guidelines for docstrings.
Those guidelines are nice. @j340m3 and I have decided to stick to them.
I've referenced them in the aforementioned wiki page.
