Scope gui: when in untriggered mode. Disabling "Channel2" or "Channel1" leads to strage behaviour:
====> Should be fixed now (871fcbd)
loading gui second time after it has been open without restarting session: infinite loop
in untriggered mode: change time to one forbidden by untriggered mode: freezes
when 2 guis (on 2 separate redpitayas) are open in the same kernel: very slow (more than 2x reduction) -> needs some automatic reduction of update rate to avoid deadlocks
Gui open. User forgets to restart the kernel and loads redpitaya and gui a second time: Infinite competition between 2 guis leads to infinite timeout error
last issue: can be avoided by catching socket.error in all timer-related functionality. We should make a function decorator for all functions that are called by a timer that kills the timer if socket.error happens.
