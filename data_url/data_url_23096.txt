Despite unittests, something is still wrong in the NA logic:
I take a curve (with the API), and after acquisition is finished, the output is not turned off. When I hit "stop" in the gui the output is turned off, but not when a call to curve() returns.
-> the turning-off logic needs to be inserted at a lower level, not just when the buttong is pressed...
I believe this is solved in spectrum_analyzer
