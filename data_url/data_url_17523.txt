Make initialize a gate element that can be used directly in Aer simulators, and unrolled into reset + gates by the transpiler for devices and noisey simulations.
The (current) format for initialize as a QuantumCircuit method is circ.initialize(statevec, qr) to initialise a quantum register in a fixed state.
The circuit method could be initialize(state, qubits), where state is a list/ndarray that is a valid statevector, and qubits can be either a full quantum register, single-qubit, or list/tuple of qubits that match the dimension of the state vector.
A suggestion for how this could be directly serialized to qobj (if the backend supports the "initialize" instruction in its basis gates) is
Consider a 2-qubit circuit, where I want to initialize both qubits into the |1> state, the following should all be equivalent:
This is done via #1816. But I'll keep it open because the reset part is not done yet.
I think #2139 is that part that was missing in this issue. Feel free to reopen otherwise.
