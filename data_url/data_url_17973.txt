The merge of #724 has reintroduced the pylint: disable=invalid-name directive removed in #739
This happened because #739 did not touch test_quantumprogram, assuming it will entirely go away.
However, #724 took some of the useful tests from test_quantumprogram and reworked them into other tests. Those tests had "invalid-names".
I will issue a PR to fix these names as well.
