For reference: PR #2899 fixes a bug due to argument types in list_processors. Issues of this type cannot be caught by mock-based unit tests (likely how it escaped notice to begin with) which means we need to check for it in our integration tests.
Additionally, there are several other methods in the engine_client.py file which have similarly-fragile type-agnostic tests. If any of those are not covered in integration tests, they probably should be.
It might also be possible to catch this kind of issue with better type-checking in the affected files. (Honestly, it's a little strange to me that mypy isn't complaining about the lack of type annotation on arguments in quantum_engine_service_client.py - we don't appear to have any type: ignore directives for that module...)
Discussed with the group - this can be resolved by some combination of forcing keyword arguments (e.g. func(self, *, [args])) and improving type annotation of the affected functions.
Note also that mypy does not protect against untyped function arguments.
