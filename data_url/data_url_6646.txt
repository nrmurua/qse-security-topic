Hi. I want to test DLT in QC. ItÂ´s a professional project. May I try Liquid? How to start?
Follow the instructions at  the website. The kit contains a lot of examples. I would also follow along on the tutorial video to get started. As far as it being a ``professional project'', as long as your not selling the results (commerical effort), you're welcome to do all the research you want.
