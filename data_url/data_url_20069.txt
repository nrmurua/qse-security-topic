After the addition of new algorithms, the weekly constant time tests are running too long again and thus fail
I'd suggest to eliminate another algorithm subset from these weekly runs, namely the "Classic-McEliece-6*" set: This still tests McEliece sufficiently, but should shave off substantial test time.
Alternative proposals welcome.
