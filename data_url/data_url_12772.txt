An example can be found in ExploringQuantumClassificationLibrary notebook; the import string looks like this:
We should add this to the cases already handled by the Update-QDKVersion.ps1 script.
I don't think we have this string in Python files (yet?), but the script could probably address that case as well, if it looks for qsharp.packages.add followed by "Microsoft.Quantum.<a string>::".
(Putting this issue on hold, since it looks like #468 will make it unnecessary.)
