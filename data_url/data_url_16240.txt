When drawing a plain quantum circuit (just initializing the quantum and classical registers without implementing any gates), the figure rendered in matplotlib renders chipped text. Testing this with a previous release of terra (I used 0.15.1), the text appears fine without any chipping whatsoever.
With current release (0.16.1):

With a previous release (0.15.1):

The expected behaviour is to draw the circuit without any text chipping and draw the circuit as implemented in version 0.15.1.
I'm willing to work on this issue.
Assigning it to you in that case. Thanks.
This is an outgrowth of #5074. I think you should somehow treat the empty circuit as a special case, rather than trying to undo any of the changes from that PR.
@enavarro51 Hi! Isn't it possible to fix this truncation without reverting any of the changes made in #5074? I have made a PR for this which fixes the truncation of a plain circuit. However, drawing the circuit with gates renders extended lines for some reason. I would appreciate some pointers.
Right. That was the point of my comment. You need to first determine if the circuit is empty and only if so, change the increment that's added to xmax. You can do that by checking if self._ops is empty. Also, .2 seemed a bit long, maybe .4.
@enavarro51 I've added the condition to check if self._ops is empty as per your suggestion. It works with the cases I've tried. Let me know if it's alright.
I printed a quantum teleportation circuit using draw() function without 'mpl' parameter, as I was getting an error. The Measurement and the Hadamard boxes are overlapping.

@arkarc What error are you getting with the 'mpl' backend? Also, please open up a separate issue for this, since this does not pertain to this issue thread. Thanks!
