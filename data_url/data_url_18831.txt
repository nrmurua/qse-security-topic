I have tracked this down to a bug in the docutils package, which is required by sphinxcontrib-bibtex and occurs because of a missing opening div that is followed by a mismatched closing div.
Details are here: mcmtroffaes/sphinxcontrib-bibtex#309
A patch is available here: https://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/patches/195/
Link to patchfile: https://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/patches/195/attachment/0001-Fix-previous_sibling-in-case-index-is-0.patch
The patch was merged into docutils dev about 6 months ago, but I have no idea when a new version of docutils will be released. We could either try to patch docutils using the file above during publishing of the webpage or directly insert the missing line <div role="list" class="citation-list">\n into the built html page after the line <div class="docutils container" id="id1">.
I should mention that I was bothered by this bug when working on my PR for publishing multiple versions of the specification (#452). The sidebar contains the links I've inserted for the different versions, so having it missing off the side of the page on the index is very inconvenient.
