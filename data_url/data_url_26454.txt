Unfortunately, the old exercises are not being maintained because they were created for specific lectures. For that particular exercise you could try to contact the last author of the linked paper: https://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja505936b
More generally, we're working on a curated collection of common exercises that will be kept up-to-date:

I'm going to close this issue now because it's actually more of user question. In the future please post those to our forum.
