Currently there the basis_gates argument of the compile function is ignored when compiling circuits to JSON. This fix simply passes the value of basis gates to the dag2json compiler so that the JSON can be compiled in a user specified set of basis_gates as intended.
When you run QuantumProgram.compile('circuit', basis_gates='a,b,c,d') the resulting qobj should compile using the basis gates a,b,c,d.
When you run QuantumProgram.compile('circuit', basis_gates='a,b,c,d')  the JSON unroller is always passed basis_gates='u1,u2,u3,cx,id instead.
Will add pull request to fix this by adding basis_gates argument to the dag2json function in _openquantumcompiler.py.
