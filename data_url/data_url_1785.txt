Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
This will make it easier for us to review Jupyter notebooks from the Github UI. I'm surprised Github doesn't already have this baked in. I won't be surprised if they end up adding something similar in the future.
Describe the solution you'd like
Signup for https://www.reviewnb.com through quantumlib. It should be free with our public repos.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
Thanks for the idea - I think we can give it a go as it does not require write permissions for code.

Write access to PRs is not that damaging (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/permissions-required-for-github-apps#permission-on-pull-requests), so if it would misbehave we can limit the impact.
Here's a test PR: balopat#8
@quantumlib/cirq-maintainers what do you think?
This seems like a no-brainer, seeing as Tensorflow Quantum has it installed. For example: tensorflow/quantum#428
Alrighty, I installed it. Happy ReviewNB-ing!
