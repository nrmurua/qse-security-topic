Following #210, the compilation routines associated to individual hardware objects are assembled on the fly from highly programmable hinting. We haven't yet incorporated any such programmability for the list of "generic compilers" (i.e., those not bound to any particular hardware object, like qs-compiler or ucr-compiler); the main conceptual obstacle is that many of these routines consume n-qubit gates and emit (n-1)-qubit gates for a variable n, and it is difficult to convince an automated routine that this qualifies as "progress".
We might aim to resolve that. We might also aim lower: providing the user any kind of ability to select from these auxiliary routines might do the job well enough that we can leave the complicated version alone.
