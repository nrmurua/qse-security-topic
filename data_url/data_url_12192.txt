hello,everyone. I want to run part of qiskit-ignis in my PC. Its path is qiskit-tutorials/qiskit/ignis/  .
When I  run three .py in this directory, I find that they  all exist import package error( from pycharm 2018.3.2).
in process_tomography.ipynb
in relaxation_and_decoherence.ipynb
in state_tomography.ipynb
I hope that  I can execute these three .py and get corresponding results in your tutorials.
Can you tell me the mistake I made ?
Hi,
Have you looked at this issue?
Qiskit/qiskit#1599
thanks!   So the problem may be solved in qiskit 0.7.1
I believe so. Also, you can solve your issue now by following the instruction there. Have you tried?
@infdahai I'm going to close this as i think @rraymondhp comments should have fixed this. If not please reopen the issue.
