It is possible to make this:
Negative times should be caught.  It does however work on IBM HW but gives odd results.
A simple if and raise would likely solve this.
This can be handled in the validate_parameter method for Delay: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/db3b35e/qiskit/circuit/delay.py#L69
how this is going @nonhermitian ?
