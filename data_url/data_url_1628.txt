Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Sweeps rerun the whole circuit from scratch for each parameter set. They could be made more efficient by caching the result of the unparameterized prefix and restarting each parameterized simulation from there.
Describe the solution you'd like
We do something similar in run, where we cache the result of the unitary prefix, and rerun repetitions starting from there. So it should be straightforward to add this same style of optimization for sweeps.
Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
