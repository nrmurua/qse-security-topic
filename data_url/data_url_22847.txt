Hi!
Thanks for the wonderful package! This is just me being pedantic but it would be nice if the Github linguist would display python to be the source language of the package. Currently, it shows the majority of the codebase to be jupyter-notebooks, which is not the case.
If one agrees, I'd be more than willing to open a PR to fix this issue.
Thanks!
👏👏👏 You are awesome! Thank you for making your first issue to pyEPR ' first issue
