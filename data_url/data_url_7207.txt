I doubt this is correct. $\sum_{i=1,2}$ but then $\sigma^{(1)} + \sigma^{(2)}$??
It looks like $i$ is enumerating lasers here. Which is confusing because in the second bullet point it's enumerating the ion. I think this should stick with the convention at the beginning of $m$ indexing lasers and $n$ indexing ions.
To be more precise: I suggest changing the equation by replacing $i$ with $m$, and changing the second bullet point by replacing $i$ with $n$.
Neil's right. I tend to recycle indices in new expressions. Feel free to change it if you'd like.
