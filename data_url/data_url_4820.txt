I'm using tensorflow as backend and trying to jit compile a circuit with any_gates where thire unitaries are parameters of the jit function. However, any_gate needs unitary with dtype complex128 but during jit compile process, only SymbolicTensor is pass to the unitary, causing error. Are there any way to go around this?
please attach the minimal code demo to reproduce the error
