The standard deprecation message states that features will not be removed for 3 months after their deprecation, which is not quite true for deprecations of the 0.46 release that are removed in 1.0. We should ensure we consistently use a deprecation message phrased something like
This is already done in some places in quantumcircuit.py using the removal_timeline kwarg, but is not yet done in some other places such as here or here.
We should do this just before the release, such that we only need to do it once ðŸ™‚
I think #11296 (1.0.0) and #11564 (0.46.0) should address this.
Changing the decorator will do some/most, definitely. Not all deprecations can be done with the decorator though - sometimes there's just a small part of the inner function, or we're deprecating fetching from one module in favour of another, and those need custom handling. The issue's just to remind us to scan all of them.
