It is unclear from the specification why, in this case-sensitive (language/index) language some gate names are uppercase and user-defined gates are uniformly illustrated as lowercase.
My interpretation is that the built-in gates will be uppercased and the user can choose case for all user-defined gates, as long as the names chosen do not conflict with built-ins.
Somewhere the intent, whatever the understanding is, should be expressed.
The intent is that a universal gateset can be constructed from three built-in operations, ctrl, gphase and u/U which is a three-parameter single-qubit unitary. There is some ongoing internal discussion of whether u/U should be lower or upper case. All other gates will be constructed from these keywords in the standard library or by the user.
U being Unique there's no problem with it being uppercase, but other than that I have no opinion.  I just was ready to throw a sentence or two in the edits to clarify. Obviously we'll hold off on that.
For that matter, CX is also capitalized everywhere.
@taalexander we also require CX for a universal two qubit gate set, right?

Seems this discussion has been resolved. Closing the issue
