Printing a quadratic program currently just prints the object reference. It would be nice if
would print a readable overview of the problem, as with quadratic_program.prettyprint().
We can do this by overloading the __str__ method. While changing this we probably
can also overload the __repr__ method to print a unique identifier of the quadratic program.
Should we do a similar thing for other objects?
I agree with you.
The drawback of prettyprint format is that it does not include the information of lower bounds and upper bounds of variables. So, I used LP format in the tutorials.
Including lower and upper bounds would probably good, yes. We can just add them to the output. Maybe we should remove the prettyprint function then as well, since it will be covered by __str__.
Hi @Cryoris , I am having look at it.
Should I wait with the pull request until #981 is merged, to avoid conflicts?
Great to hear!
The batch-generation PR should not touch the same places of code, I think you would be fine to start. ðŸ™‚
Hi @Cryoris
I implemented str method with export_to_lp_string,
and I agree to remove the prettyprint, since it is not used anywhere in qiskit.
How would you override the repr ? Its default implementation returns <qiskit.optimization.problems.quadratic_program.QuadraticProgram object at 0x1340c76d0> and overriding str does not change repr.
What other objects did you have in mind, where we could provide str implementation?
