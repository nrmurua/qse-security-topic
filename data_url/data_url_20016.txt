I tested 0.7.2-rc1 and cmake files, such as liboqsConfig.cmake, are installed in /usr/lib64/cmake/usr/lib64oqs:
Previously they are correctly installed in /usr/lib64/cmake/liboqs/liboqsConfig.cmake under DESTDIR.
It seems that liboqs is expanded there to /usr/lib64.

"Previously" meaning version 0.7.1, or something more recent? I don't know enough about CMake to know how to solve this other than using git bisect to try to find when the behaviour changed.
As far as I remember, the "proper way" to install liboqs for cmake-inclusion was created with #1191, i.e., long after 0.7.1... Glancing over the files changed (since) then also didn't flag anything immediately suspicious... Some more digging required... As stated by @dstebila any indication as to which commit was the last one working for you would be very helpful...
Edit/Update:  oqs-demos also has new problems properly locating liboqs. This error didn't appear before 2 days ago, i.e., probably was caused by #1272 and/or #1267. Update: oqs-demos problem is different. Keeping searching....
When trying to reproduce your run, I changed this command:
to DESTDIR=/tmp/liboqs-buildroot ninja install and ran that inside build (to avoid messing with '/usr'): OK?
So the question to you, @vt-alt : How did you generate the ninja setup, i.e., which parameters did you pass to cmake? When trying cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/usr/lib64/cmake/liboqs .. (again within build), a plain ninja install placed liboqsConfig.cmake as expected into /tmp/usr/lib64/cmake/liboqs/lib/cmake/liboqs/ (or into /tmp/liboqs-buildroot/tmp/usr/lib64/cmake/liboqs/lib/cmake/liboqs/ when running the DESTDIR-prefixed install.
-> Is any of this not as you'd expect it, @vt-alt ? Any further information for us to reproduce your setup? When trying the above, I used Linux Mint 20.1., ninja 1.10.0 and cmake 3.16.3 (and liboqs-0.7.2-rc1).
Sorry for a delay.
"Previously" meaning version 0.7.1, or something more recent?
0.7.1 was installing correctly.
I changed this command:
Yes, sorry, it was DESTDIR=/tmp/liboqs-buildroot ninja ... install  but I was just copy pasting bash trace log (with set -x which rpmbuild shows), where it's shown as separate commands.
So the question to you, @vt-alt : How did you generate the ninja setup, i.e., which parameters did you pass to cmake?
Following you questions I found mistake in our build script. We had a line sed -i '\!DESTINATION!s!lib!%_libdir!' src/CMakeLists.txt which was intended to relocate /usr/lib/cmake/liboqs to /usr/lib64/cmake/liboqs (appropriate in our distribution) by replacing only first occurrence of lib, but in newer version of liboqs src/CMakeLists.txt introduced CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR and sed replaces incorrectly second occurrence of lib causing such install error.
I am very sorry for the false alarm!
Just to confirm, when I removed that sed line from our build script it now installs correctly to /usr/lib64/cmake/liboqs.
Thanks for the help!
