Our use case involves using a Sample layer to obtain bitstrings, then computing a loss as a function of these bitstrings.  We wish to obtain gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of the circuit given to the Sample layer; we want to use the Parameter Shift rule to calculate these gradients.  What would it take to break out the parameter shift code into a user-facing call?
We have example code for how we would like to use Sample layer with gradients:
We have a notebook we started to prototype solutions: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h6aUeQ6rLVhd0sE600kA0X6hDSAazw4o#scrollTo=ZXpGyhYSNpFK
