The newly introduced Qxelarator allows getting back the measurement result from a qasm code with the command
res = qx.get_measurement_outcome(<qubit_number>)
According to the example test cases of qxelarator, the qasm file should already have in it the
measure q<qubit_number>
How do I put that in the qasm through OpenQL?
It's a required step to fully encapsulate QX from OpenQL.
you can add it as k.measure(q0) like any other gate or with the custom instruction format as k.gate('measure', q0). see more examples in tests.
Thanks.
k.measure(0)
and
k.gate('measure',0)
works.
