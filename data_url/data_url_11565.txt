Providing a PassManager to a QuantumInstance will generate an exception whenever its execute() method is called (i.e. when it is used in any algorithm). qiskit.transpile() is called with a custom PassManager, which conflicts with the backend and all of its properties.
Run any algorithm with a PassManager, e.g.:
No exception is thrown and the effect of calling transpile() should just apply the PassManager to the circuit.
Either edit qiskit.transpile() in Terra to enable the application of a PassManager without the conflict checks, or edit QuantumInstance.transpile() to check if self._compile_config['pass_manager'] is None and either call qiskit.transpile or apply the PassManager.
