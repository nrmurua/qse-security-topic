also c.f. #686 for tracking various aspects of coredevice performance
Not to make the issue tracker degrade into a collection of "+1" posts, but let me just stress again I'm still concerned about network transfer rates for medium-term applications – if there is anything in particular I can do to help with making sure things don't regress to even slower speeds than we are currently at, just let me know. (Being able to stream a few MB/s of diagnostics data without having to put Ethernet MACs on the satellites would be great.)

A simple thing you could do is identify what exactly caused the slowdown between the two commits I posted, and submit a PR.
Oh, sure, I can spend some time debugging this one issue, and might if it gets critical for us at some point (or investigate alternative hardware platforms). What I meant was more in terms of the bigger picture – I'm quite happy leaving this to whitequark else as there are many other things to spend time on in our experiment, but if there is anything in particular you know you won't get to because there isn't enough time-expertise product, etc., I'd probably be able to spend a few weekends with a profiler, building a more elaborate CI setup, or whatever it is.
This has been fixed in master. In fact the transfer speed is slightly higher than it was before, 2.5 MB/s to device, 2.1 MB/s to host.
