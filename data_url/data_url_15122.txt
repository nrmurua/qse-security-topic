What is the file name(s) where you found the bug?
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.ZGate.html
What is the current text that needs to be fixed or removed? (You can copy and paste)
In the 'note' box:
            RZ(\pi) = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = -Z
What should the documentation say instead?
            RZ(\pi) = \begin{pmatrix} -i & 0 \\ 0 & i \end{pmatrix} = -iZ
In accordance with the matrix form of the RZGate.
Nice spot, thanks!  Would you be interested in fixing it?  The relevant file is qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/z.py, and this is in the docstring of the ZGate class.
