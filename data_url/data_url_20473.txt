Migrate to the 9.x branch. Interestingly, hybrid PQC is now the default since 9.0.
From the 9.0 release notes:
Is this a "migration" or rather a more complete code update -- incl. the requirement to first implement #66 to be able to interop with "sntrup761x25519-sha512"?
Just to keep track of the most recent OpenSSH release; this update can be done independently of our other work items. I don't see the need to interop with the built-in OpenSSH PQC suite through OQS.
