Hi. I see that the QRL blockchain and the metadata of each block can be viewed in explorer.theqrl.org website. Is there other way to download a single raw block than running a whole node? (Just for analysis for a valid implementation of a QRL block.)
(This is not an issue but more of a question. I wanted to post this in the Discussion since it's more suitably but it isn't available/enabled.)
The explorer also exports the data via a rudimentary API: eg. https://explorer.theqrl.org/api/block/2891168
There are a number of projects that iterate through the chain and export blocks for various purposes (MySQL/Mongo storage, for example) but I'm not aware of any other public services that directly export a raw block.
Hi. Thank you for your reply. I'm looking for a raw binary block as described in https://docs.theqrl.org/api/qrlproto/#block if its possible.
You can use GRPC to interact with a public node:

The docs-beta site has some examples.
Thanks, I manage to interact with the mainnet with grpcurl but recieved a json response. Haven't manage to get grpcurl working with binary so I'm resorting to manually crafting the blocks from the hex since i need only a one or two. Thankfully, "data" can easily be replaced with uint8_t https://explorer.theqrl.org/api/block/2891168
