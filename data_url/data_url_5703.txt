Chee-Kong and I spoke about this on Slack briefly, and from my looking at the problem, Terra seems to be constructing the problem correctly.  I think the issue is that the inlining of control flow in jump/mark instructions within Aer isn't enforcing that the control-flow block stays together as a basic block.  The jump/mark instructions alone lose some of the data-flow ordering of the tree structure of control-flow since they don't include the clbits of the control-flow block.
Assuming I'm right (I'm fairly confident I am), I can fix it tomorrow.
I've made #1666 which hopefully should fix this issue.
