While trying to run simple Maxcut (for 4 qubits) with ibmqx5, get the following error:
WARNING:IBMQuantumExperience.IBMQuantumExperience:Got a 400 code response to  {"error":{"status":400,"message":"Error parsing QASM. Error parsing qasm number 0. The qasm has no measures.","code":"QASM_NOT_VALID","statusCode":400}}
The same notebook runs ok with the simulator (local_qasm_simulator). I ran the classical_optimization example in 4_applications folder.
Hi @venkatbgs
We are working to rewrite the tutorials. I suspect that this is due to the change in compiler of real devices.
Please allow us some time to fix.
@rraymondhp can you look into this.
@venkatbgs  Please use this notebook. It will be merged to the tutorial once Jay and Anna reviewed it.

@rraymondhp what is the status of this
@jaygambetta
We found a bug in creating Hamiltonian in the example. My colleagues is working on it. Hopefully we can push the correct version next week.
@venkatbgs
Sorry for keeping you waiting.
Please update your qiskit with pip install -U qiskit and get the latest tutorial of maxcut from the tutorial.
