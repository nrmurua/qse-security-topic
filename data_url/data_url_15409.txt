Something seems broken in V2 backends, in that making a Target out of them takes an extremely long time.
code above
Killing this process shows that loading backend defaults (presumably lots of pulse shapes) is what is taking so long. But that should be a lazy load and not needed for accessing some other device properties. And also it should be based on parametric pulses so it's not so slow to load in the first place.

This is essentially a duplicate of #7914 (although this has a more descriptive name). The fundamental issue in that issue is that parsing the pulse defaults payload is super slow in general and for something like Washington with 127 qubits this gets quite bad. For the test import in #7914 this effects unit tests import particularly bad because it is loading all the fake backends on  import to generate the ddt test list for the fake backend tests.
Ok yeah seems similar. I searched for an issue but couldn't find. Feel free to close it if it's being tracked elsewhere.
