If you don't provide a config to the matplotlib drawer, but you provide a style dict an error is raised AttributeError: 'MatplotlibDrawer' object has no attribute '_style' . I think this is because of the logic introduced in #2344, which results in the self._style variable never being initialised.
Provide a style dict but no config
Set the style to be the one provided by the user.
yes, this is my fault as I did not even know that was an option at the time. The use of a dict here also does not match the other plotting routines like text where things like line_length are kwargs not a single dict
