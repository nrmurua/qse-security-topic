Right now the start_here tutorial shows up last in the qiskit repo, is it possible to add a 1 or something in front of it so it shows up at the top of the qiskit tutorials?
Good idea
It would be nice to also extend this good idea to other tutorials to give the user a sense of logical progression
I have in basic. Working my way through if you want to help ðŸ˜€
