When running a circuit's operations 1 by 1, certain measurements are determined by previous measurements (called "redundant" or "commuting" or "determined" measurements) while others anticommute with the current stabilizers (called "random" or "anticommuting" measurements).
A circuit where all measurements were random is completely unpredictable; it has max entropy. The number of redundant measurements is how many bits away from max entropy the circuit's results are, not accounting for noise channels. It's the number of measurements minus the entropy introduced into samples by Heisenberg uncertainty.
Basically this issue is to port this python method into C++ and expose it via stim's python API:
