When dispatching Leptons, the python wrapper code gets rendered to the UI instead of the Lepton's source instead.
This can be reproduced by dispatching a task containing a lepton and observing its output in the UI. The python wrapper code gets rendered to the UI instead of the Lepton's source code.
A lepton's source code should be rendered in the UI and not its python wrapper.
No response
short term solution: do not show source code for C Leptons
Hi, @Emmanuel289. Just to make sure that I understand expected result let's take a look an example, to be more concrete https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/blob/develop/doc/source/how_to/coding/construct_lepton.ipynb. You would expect to see in this area instead of python_wrapper function

code from Python file, right?
I was considering looking at this one; however, I am getting errors trying to install covalent.  I am following the "First Steps" to contribute instructions at https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md.  I am getting an error in the third cell, after the command: python setup.py webapp
The error:
File ".../anaconda3/envs/cov_dev/lib/python3.8/subprocess.py", line 516, in run
raise CalledProcessError(retcode, process.args,
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['yarn', 'build']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
Any suggestions?  Thanks!
Hi @nrhawkins. Can you execute the following?
Probably you have an issue related to the node version. To setup webapp part there is another doc here https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/blob/develop/covalent_ui/README.md or https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contribution-for-covalent-ui
Hi @TerraVenil - thanks so much!!!  I hadn't read ahead, but I see there now that it requires node v16 or later.  I had 12, which was the default for my latest Ubuntu and Fedora Linux.  Looks like I am in business now!!!  All the tests pass too.  Thanks again!!!  I guess the hack is over, but, at least, I feel better!
