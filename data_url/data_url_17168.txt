qiskit.extensions.standard.cx.CnotGate.to_matrix
Matrix defined here is in the opposite direction of the standard in literature

qiskit.extensions.standard.CnotGate().to_matrix()
Expected behavior is matrix as defined by:

qiskit.extensions.standard.CnotGate().to_matrix()
Change the to_matrix to match standard.
Hi @dahlend. This is not a bug. In Qiskit, qubit 1 is the the more significant qubit, and qubit 0 is the less significant qubit. So the tensor order is defined as q1 â¨‚ q0, which means a CNOT would be
This is done to match the computer science convention, so for example when you read out 10 from those qubits, this corresponds to decimal 2. Also as you add more qubits to your system, you don't have to reindex the other ones, e.g the next significant qubit will be q2.
