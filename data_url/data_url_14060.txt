If you supply a Qubit (or list of or ...) to the QRegister constructor, extract the label to make that qubit part of this QRegister. That would make it easier for programs running QGL2 to create / retrieve Qubits from the channel library, and use the desired qubits in the QGL2 program.
A QRegister created from a Qubit produces a QRegister with the same name.
