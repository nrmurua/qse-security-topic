The following snippet
Produces
As you can see, instead of creating a single rzx instruction that uses param0, it creates a single rzx for each value present in the circuit.
This happens with at least all other RPPGates, where PP is placeholder for some Pauli matrices. I haven't tested it with other parameterized gates.
I think the output QASM string should look like:
I tested it and using that string to build a QuantumCircuit gives the intended circuit.
Output:
I have tried to export this program into OpenQASM3. The result is:
There is only one rzx definition. However, the parameter is not used in the body. Therefore, the program is not correct.
The problem I mentioned above, i.e., not using parameters in a gate's body, is the same as this example:
Therefore, the authors should be aware of this problem. There are probably some documents, issues, pull requests, or code comments that explain the design choices or the difficulties leading to the current status. I have not found them, though.
