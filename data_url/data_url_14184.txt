Qpy cannot serialize large conditions on registers
QPy should serialize/deserialize these large conditions
No response
The condition value field for an instruction is stored as a 64bit signed integer in QPY (https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/qpy.html#changes-to-instruction). The only way to solve this would be to change the value type and use an encoding that supports arbitrarily large integers, which requires a new QPY format version. One thing to try in the meantime is using an equal() Expr instead of a tuple:
which uses a different encoding and IIRC should be able to represent this.
