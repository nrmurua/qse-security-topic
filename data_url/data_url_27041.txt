The following calculations hang up in SAD guess. This should be fixed.
Find it. In your input denserms=1e-8 can not be correctly parsed by rdnml and renders quick_method%pmaxrms to be 0. You can try denserms=1.0e-8 instead so that the uscf for getmolsad can converge in about ten iterations for Potassium. By the way Iodine doesn't exist in the 6-31G**.
@Altaimorin I am aware of this and there is another PR open. We have to save the guess for important S block elements. For example, see the following MgCl2 HF/6-31G calculation. The guess takes >90% of time which is totally stupid.

@Altaimorin Can you please fix this? We cannot expect users to put decimal numbers all the time. God knows what they will do!
Agreed with Madu. Also, afaik the decimal point is not a requirement in scientific notation, also not in Fortran. So if a user puts 1e-8 and the program crashes, the user is not to blame.
This has been fixed in PR #125 so I will close this issue.
