Idea is to add an input to the asg modules which can be used instead of the phase-register to specify the index of the output value in the stored waveform. This will enable the implementation of arbitrary 1-to-1-functions, such as division, magnitude, squaring, sine, arcsin, arctan,  arctan, arbitrary correction of DC-nonlinearities, and so on.. An immediate use-case will be automatic testing of the lockbox API for simulated cavities.
