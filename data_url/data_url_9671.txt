I am getting this error and I am not sure where the toolchain is broken in my system:
It seems to break at the yosys execution step: in my system yosys is installed in /usr/local/bin/yosys
Yosys 0.9+932 (git sha1 4072a966, clang 10.0.1 -fPIC -Os)
and all its tests are passing.
The files friends.v and friends.ys can be found in the intermediate folder /var/folders/t4/f39wd1sd25x8ry2hq74xhz1r0000gn/T/qap-443035463
Would be very grateful if you could suggest where to start debugging. Thanks, Andrea
I'm not able to reproduce that problem with a similar version of Yosys: Yosys 0.9 (git sha1 UNKNOWN, gcc 8.3.0-6ubuntu1 -fPIC -Os).
What happens if you run
from the intermediate folder?  Do you get the same error message?  If so, what happens if you add a -s before the script name:
?  How about if you additionally specify Verilog input?
It does not seem to make any difference
Not sure if this helps or not but, from the temp directory,
The only issue is that I do not understand what I am doing :)
What if you put the input filename at the end?
That works and geenerates the friends.edif.
Great!  Does it require the -f verilog, or is that unnecessary?
It seems to be working also without specifying -f verilog
yosys -q -s friends.ys  -b edif -o friends.edif friends.v
Does this command break your version or can you simply patch this command?
Patching seems to work.  Reopen the issue if the latest commit (80c5da0) doesn't fix the problem.
Thanks for the bug report.
mhmm ... I deleted a couple of time the old version, and tried to install the new one with
go get github.com/lanl/QA-Prolog
but I am running on the same issue.
Strange.  Could you repeat the command from your initial post and paste in the output?  I'd like to see what yosys command is being generated.

I have used the Makefile to build qa-prolog from the (80c5da0) commit and it seems to work from there (I only had to remove the -D option because I am on mac OS X):
I'm glad you got it working!
I just realized why go get didn't work: You forgot the -u (update) option.  According to https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Legacy_GOPATH_go_get,
The -u flag instructs get to use the network to update the named packages and their dependencies. By default, get uses the network to check out missing packages but does not use it to look for updates to existing packages.
Regarding installation failing on macOS: The macOS command-line tools give me no end of grief due to their minimalist feature sets.  I just pushed out 793336d, which avoids install -D.  I hope this helps other macOS users interested in QA Prolog.
Thank you!
