I'm not actually sure whether this is a Cirq problem or a qcircuit problem or a jupyter notebook problem. I'm trying to plot a graphical representation of a Cirq circuit in a jupyter notebook using circuit_to_latex_using_qcircuit. However, the produced output has effectively negative margins, so that parts of the image are outside the borders (and thus are not displayed).
Different circuits can have different parts cut off, but for a simple circuit the input and output labels are not visible. This is true whether the output is pdf or png.
Here is a repro case (if you take out the work-around of border=25pt which forces it to work for the particular example):

This is a qcircuit bug. That being said, I don't think it's going to be fixed there and we probably should work around it somehow..
Where can I report (or fix) qcircuit bugs?
(Also: Filed https://gitlab.com/qosf/qml-mooc/issues/2 to remember to update the notebook where I found the problem once it's fixed or worked around.)
I don't actually know if there's anyone maintaining it...
This is probably another vote fore #1290 especially if qcircuit isn't being updated.
