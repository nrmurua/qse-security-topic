To avoid complexities with overlays/checkpoints on the dataset-DB and master interaction, browser/replay will be implemented as a separate application. It will be entirely standalone  (not connecting to the master) and run re-analyze locally. This also allows users to run analyses offline (when disconnected from the rest of the ARTIQ system) with just the HDF5 and the experiment source file(s).
All features should be there. Might benefit from caching the h5 opening/h5 data or having a common h5 data provider. Icon provider, metadata tooltip provider, dataset loader, argument loader each open the h5 file.
It took me a while to figure out how this feature. Here's the steps.
Without some guidance users may find that setup is non-intuitive. I was completely missing that loading .py is a necessary step.
It would be convenient if as different .h5 are selected...
Thanks for implementing this!
