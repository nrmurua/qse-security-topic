Hi! In the documentation, there is a broken link on this page that is supposed to link to examples:
http://docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/basics.html#parametric-compilation
"...compared to compiling the program each time a parameter update is required. (Some more details about this and an example are found :ref:here .)"
