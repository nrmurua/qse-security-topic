Sure. Thanks!
Hey @ishmum123 , it seems like this problem affects all currently open pull requests. If you don't have the bandwidth to fix this ASAP, we can transfer this issue to @MichaelBroughton.
Please do, I am looking into it RIGHT now but not that confident about speed. Sorry about that
Okay. If your are able to reproduce this problem on your local machine, you should be more than halfway there. Feel free to continue your work until @MichaelBroughton responds.
sorry I wasn't able to reproduce this locally. This was my best (blind) bet #4451
Lets try replacing

with
import numpy as np
and in that file replacing poisson with np.random.poisson
please check now
Nice! That did the trick. Will merge.
Before we merge your fix to the main branch. Please merge your ishmum123:mypy-fix into ishmum123:add_probabiliy_utility branch and push it.
done
I don't see the update on #4439, also it looks like your cla got reverted in that PR.
can you please check again?
The cla label is back but not the numpy chnages we made in the other branch. Are you performing git merge mypy-fix on your add_probabiliy_utility branch?
Okay never mind the merge. We'll just merge main to your branch automatically now that the numpy fixes have been merged.
Sorry about the confusion
No worries. Again, thanks a lot for your help ðŸ˜„
