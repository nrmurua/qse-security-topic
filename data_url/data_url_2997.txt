Step 1: Argue about what structure to use.
My preference is to have clear encapsulation boundaries by using the underscore convention, relative imports, and flattening at the top level.
Since cirq.ops is flattened into cirq, I would rename ops to _ops.
Everything inside ops that current does import cirq.ops.file would instead do import ._file. This makes it clear which imports are local and which are not.
Everything beside ops that was doing import cirq.ops.value would instead do import .._ops.value. Again this makes it clear which imports are focused within a specific part of cirq instead of involving the whole thing.
Users would always just say import cirq.value.

@dabacon , please add your suggestion for how this should work.
Decided not to do this.
