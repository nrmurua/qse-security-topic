Currently the API reference/docstring for QuantumCircuit.snapshot_* methods look like this: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.snapshot_expectation_value.html, which is the docstring from 
However these snapshot methods are not native to QuantumCircuit object in terra, instead they are registered on QuantumCircuit class at runtime when from qiskit.providers.aer.extensions.snapshot_expectation_value import * , this behavior is due to the runtime registration 
It may be confusing when the users try the following with AttributeError:
So my suggestion is adding one line to the relevant snapshot_* docstrings, which tells the user that to use this method, one should first  run from qiskit.providers.aer.extensions.snapshot_expectation_value import * to register the corresponding method on QuantumCircuit class.
Closing since snapshots are being deprecated for new save instructions, and the new instructions include the suggestions from this issue.
