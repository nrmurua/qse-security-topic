The problem is that if you have AWGs enabled that aren't used when calibrating a particular qubit, then you will either get an error in PulseCalibration.loadSequence() or you will have bad/dummy data coming out of an AWG. We should disable those AWGs not used in calibrating a particular qubit.

Yes, I think all of these can get cleaned up with meta file data.
