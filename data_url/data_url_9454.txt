blockade_subspace(;blockade_violations = m)
Default is m = 0. If m = 1, consider the blockade subspace as well as all strings that have 1 blockade violations. For m, consider additional strings that have <=m blockade violations.
should it be blockade_violations rather than no_blockade_violations?
yes, right. I meant number of blockade violations... Now I see it's very confusing. blockade_violations sounds good!
After talking to Bea, I realized that this may not be the best way to add configurations that violate the blockade constraint. Some edges are shorter and some are longer. We would want to add configurations that violate a longer edge first. I think the best way is to see the spectrum of the interaction term, and add configurations from the lowest excited state from the spectrum. Perhaps add a fraction of the total number of states. Or if there are big gaps in the spectrum, it also makes sense to add chunks of states according to the big gaps.
I think we now conclude that this is not gonna happen? can we close this issue? @Wang-Shengtao
yes, let's close this issue.
