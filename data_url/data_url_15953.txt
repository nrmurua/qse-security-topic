An H gate does not get decomposed correctly. It is easy to see this at optimization level 0:

becomes

when it should involve no more than one sx gate and two rz gates.
An H gate gets decomposed into the correct minimal set of basis gates.
It looks like the decomposition for s and sdg does not know they are simple z-axis rotations.
Hi @nonhermitian !
This is an interesting issue. I would love to fix this, but this is my first time contributing to Qiskit, so a lot of guidance will be helpful.
@nonhermitian Can you share the steps to reproduce this problem?
Simply transpile the H gate using optimization level 0
@nonhermitian I transpiled it with optimization level 0, but all I get is the H gate back

Yeah sorry, you need to target an IBM backend or set the basis gates to be the same.
By backend, do you mean the actual hardware or the simulator? qasm_simulator gave me the same output as above, and so did basis_gates=['h']
A real backend
I used ibmq_belem as the backend, and I got this error. What am I doing wrong? (the code is same as above)
This works on the latest release:
If it is not working on master than it is a bug.
Ah..I see. My bad, I was checking on PyPi version
The latest pypi version should work.
The latest is version number 0.26.2, and I checked my code on this version. But I wasn't able to reproduce the problem.
The IBM Quantum website is at Qiskit 0.26.2 and give me:

I am not sure what you are seeing or not
I see. Wonder why I'm not getting it. Btw, I tried it on a Jupyter Notebook.
This is the full code
@nonhermitian Can I take up this issue?
Sure thing
Thanks!
Thanks for your interest @Avhijit-codeboy ! Closing as this was already resolved as part of #4837 :
Please feel free to re-open if you're still seeing this behavior.
