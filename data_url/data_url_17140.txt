Following #2769 my text circuits are not aligned in Jupyter:

verses the old way:

Hmm... Do you know what's the effective font that your browser is using?
You can check that in the Computed tab, Rendered Fonts at the bottom of the list. In my case is Menlo.

style="word-wrap: normal;white-space: pre;line-height: 15px;font-family: SFMono-Regular,Consolas,Liberation Mono,Menlo,Courier,monospace"
If I recall correctly previously it was just monospace
It seems that Menlo is messing things up
Your Rendered Fonts is Menlo too?
If i remove menlo then things look good again.
OS? Browser version?
Firefox, mac
check out if font-family: "Courier New",Courier,monospace; works...
That seems to work fine.
awesome. Let's go that way.
