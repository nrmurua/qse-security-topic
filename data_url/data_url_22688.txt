I tried flashing the KC705 with nist_qc2 but the led.py example doesn't seem to work. I reflashed it to the default and the LED works again. Is this an issue with the TTL channel?
Related, how does soc/runtime choose AD9914 or AD9858? Can see #ifdef DDS_AD9914 but nowhere #define DDS_AD9914.
The RTIO channel numbers are different on QC1 and QC2. Did you update your DDB?
They're missing in the docs.

It's unclear to me which pins correspond to user_led.

The problem is it's not clear yet what the QC2 hardware will end up being (with that I2C IO expander for TTL directions etc.) and I do not want to spend my time refactoring docs. So RTFS for now.
LED works fine here. The correct channel number is 16.
Which file and line number should I be looking at?

artiq_kc705.py, the channel numbers are the indices in the rtio_channels list.
