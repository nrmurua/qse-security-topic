Hi there,
The clean/avx2 implementations of Falcon-512 and Falcon-1024 seem to be unaligned with some changes introduced in v1.2 of the spec.
In particular, the implementation of the signature verification algorithm currently in libOQS accepts mauled signatures due to how comp_decode in codec.c is implemented. I attached an example program for ease of inspection.
Following Section 3.11.2 and Algorithms 17-18 in the Falcon spec v1.2, I believe that in order to enforce a unique encoding of compressed signatures, the decode implementation should not accept 100000001 ("-0") as a valid encoding of 0, and should check that signatures are padded using zeroes.
Kind Regards,
Giacomo Fenzi
Attached bug: bug.c
Hi Giacomo, thanks for raising this issue. We are planning an update to all algorithms as per #1292. Falcon in particular is integrated to liboqs via https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean, so it may be good to raise the issue there, too.
Falcon updates have landed at PQClean, we can now proceed updating liboqs.
Closed by #1395
