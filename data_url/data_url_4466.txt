The execution result for a circuit with density_matrix=False in form of the probabilities of a circuit vs. the same circuit with noise is the same. Could the probabilities() method be overwritten or could at least a warning be printed? Since it does not reflect the probabilities anymore.
The circuit without noise:
The circuit with noise:
Agreement: implementation of warning message.
