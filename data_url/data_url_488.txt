We should add a new interface to xacc that provides an extension point for Observable Grouping strategies. The goal here is to expose an API for taking an Observable and reducing it to a new Observable that is reduced, i.e. less terms for measuring, based on some implementation-specific strategy. That method (or some other method) must also expose a way for mapping AcceleratorBuffer results (smaller list of them due to the reduction) back to expected values for the original full Observable.
We could then let this be an input to VQE for instance.
