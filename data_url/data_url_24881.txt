This issue is meant as a unitaryHACK bounty issue.
Bounty: $50
We would like to add more complete documentation to the scqubits source code.
Here we ask for documenting signatures of 15 items such methods, functions, classes, etc, where the details are either incomplete, or missing completely.
Documentation should follow standards observed by the rest of the code.
I can work on this issue but I need some guidance with this
Let me know if that works.
Thanks
Hi @divshacker, sure! Are you available during my unitaryHACK "office hours" tomorrow (Chicago time: 4pm)?
Done
It means three and half hours more from now? Right or I have lost the office hours?
@divshacker Actually, it looks like unitaryHACK booked me for 22:00 CEST instead of CET, which would make the starting time 7mins from now.
old issue from previous unitary fund hackathon - closing.
