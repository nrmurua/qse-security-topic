The circuit execution time for algorithms has been requested in the past but was not reported. time_taken is a field which has been added to the job result object that now reports this. Accumulating this time and having access to it, as well as universally having a wallclock runtime field (some algos have run-time today but not all), most likely in the base AlgorithmResult class, would let users have access to a feature that has long been requested.
