Hi @Strilanc. A few of us are working on a Quirk-related project as part of QOSF and we're needing to allow for some customization with regards to the UI. Specifically, it is being able to turn off/on whole Toolboxes (e.g. Toolbox_2), individual columns in the toolbox (e.g. Spinning), and displays on individual wires. Before embarking on this work I'd like to know two things:
I'd much prefer working on this with the intention of contributing rather than maintaining a separate fork.
Yes, although I'll note that the toolboxes are one of the things I'm more sensitive about changing.
The toolbox entries are specified in AllGates.js 
Turning entries on and off would require some sort of menu, and also code changes to deal with things like the toolbox image being cached to avoid redrawing costs.
Coming back to this now that we're wrapping up our QOSF projects for cohort 2.  I'll likely start on this soon. If I determined that it isn't needed any more by our project, then I'll close out this issue.
The main project is a circuit and pulse dashboard that I'll post URLs for since Quirk is used for the circuit dashboard, but I'm still in the process of preparing those repos. For now, I'll post this auxiliary project that is standalone for anyone who wants to use Quirk in Jupyter with a little more control than the standard HTML widget: https://github.com/adgt/pyQuirk
That's pretty neat to use it as a UI element in a notebook.
Here's the full project: https://github.com/adgt/qonduit
