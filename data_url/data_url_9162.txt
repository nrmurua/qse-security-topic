Hi @GregoryMorse --- Could you tell us which version of thewalrus are you using?
Hi @nquesada, version 0.16.1, the one in PyPi
Thanks for bringing this to our attention @GregoryMorse. As of the latest release (v0.18.0), The Walrus no longer uses libwalrus for any calculations. The function corresponding to thewalrus.libwalrus.perm_BBFG_complex is now thewalrus.perm.
The equivalent code to your example above would be:
With that said, it seems like this function has the same issue, so a fix would still be needed to make sure that the permanent function returns 1 for an empty matrix. We will look into fixing this in an upcoming release!
or, alternatively, @GregoryMorse , you are most welcome to do a PR fixing it and become a contributor! You can use the example of how this is solved in the hafnian function here
