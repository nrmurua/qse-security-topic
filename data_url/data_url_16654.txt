random_clifford fails to generate some elements from the whole Clifford group. For example, random_clifford(1) only generates Cliffords with stabilizer +Z, -Z, +Y, or -Y, and random_clifford(2) never samples Clifford with stabilizer [+XI, +IX], etc.
The output is
The case Stabilizer = ['+X'] never happens. In other words, the Hadamard gate is never sampled.
Similarly, random_clifford(2) never generates the case Stabilizer = [+IX, +XI] . This bug also exists for larger number of qubits.
random_clifford should uniformly sample the whole Clifford group. Otherwise, some protocols based on random circuits would fail, e.g. quantum compressed sensing, randomized benchmarking.
Maybe to check whether the algorithm in arXiv:2003.09412 is correctly implemented.
