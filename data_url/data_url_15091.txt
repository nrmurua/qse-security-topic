We are moving towards qiskit=qiskit-terra and many subpackages have been removed from the metapackage (aqua, ignis, ibmq-provider and soon aer). What are going to do with the version string __qiskit_version__ and the handy %qiskit_version_table jupyter magic command (which just display the information of __qiskit_version__?
There a few cases:
Tbh, we should just remove it, this was added for the context of everything sharing the same qiskit namespace. Like specifically it was because when everything was all under qiskit you couldn't use qiskit.__version__ to figure out which versions of all the various elements were installed. In a world where all these things have different namespaces they all should have different version attributes and we don't need a common entry point (especially for the core project that all these others depend on).
All the Jupyter tooling currently uses __qiskit_version__ to make the version table at the bottom of basically every notebook that's built into any form of Qiskit documentation.  We'll most likely want some sort of single-callable replacement for that if we're getting rid of __qiskit_version__.

Yes I agree with this. The version table is still very useful for documentation purposes.
Related to this, it would be great to have an equivalent version table that is friendly for rst files without using jupyter-execute directive.
A bit unrelated, maybe a QiskitVersion._repr_html_() instead of the magic?
