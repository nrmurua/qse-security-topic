Hello ! In the Cloud SDK, there is an option wait in sdk.create_batch. Setting wait = True keeps your code running until the results are available on the Cloud platform (i.e. batch is marked as Done). It is very useful to build a continuous communication loop between a local computer and the distant Emulator/QPU. It is possible to make the code artificially wait but since the option is already in the Cloud SDK and that the Backend objects are wrappers around that, I feel like it would be useful and easy to keep that argument. Thank you a lot !
