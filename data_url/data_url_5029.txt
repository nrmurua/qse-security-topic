MAXHOSTNAMELEN is used in seedQuESTDefault and is defined in sys/param.h on most Linux systems.
An error was reported where QuEST does not compile in Windows using MinGW, seemingly due to MAXHOSTNAMELEN not being defined:
QuEST/QuEST_common.c:148:19: error: 'MAXHOSTNAMELEN' undeclared
Initial patch in bugFix/master_hostnamelen but need to set up a windows system to test this properly so not merged into master yet
Fixed by removing seeding by hostname from seedQuESTDefault altogether. See PR #132
