hello_ everyone,
I got an error in installing elpa
==================== Installing ELPA ====================
elpa-2019.05.001.tar.gz is found
Installing from scratch into /sob/cp2k-7.1/tools/toolchain/install/elpa-2019.05.001
ERROR: (./scripts/install_elpa.sh, line 103) Non-zero exit code detected.
and there are the “*.log”, but I really don't understand what they mean
can anybody explain it? many thanks
make.log
configure.log
config.log
Looks like an ancient cp2k version, try the most recent commit? Though I compiled ELPA myself, I believe currently the library linking in ELPA generated by up-to-date toolchain script is correct. (I learned from it to solve a strange problem that the linking args generated from mkl link advisor does not work)
You can try compile elpa yourself then use the toolchain script to choose --with-elpa=system
(The difference from what mkl link advisor gives is the deletion of -Wl,--start-group and -Wl,--end-group, which I thought was necessary.)
