Presently the state_distinguishability function in state_distinguishability.py includes minimum-error and unambiguous quantum state distinguishability using the argument dist_method = "min-error" and dist_method="unambiguous", respectively.
This task should enhance the state_distinguishability function to include the ability to compute the maximum confidence discrimination. Refer to Section 2.5 of arXiv:1707.02571, specifically the SDP below equation (31) in this section.
The formulation of the SDP should look familiar to the other distinguishability methods and should serve as an example for how to include this feature.
