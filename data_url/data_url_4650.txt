As was introduced in the last meeting, similarly to the to_qasm module, qibo could also include a from_qasm function that reads a qasm file and transforms it into qibo circuit.
This could be useful in order to transfer circuits from outside to qibo (either generated from another library or found elsewhere) and also potentially as a way to receive data from the quantum device and get it back in qibo as well.
