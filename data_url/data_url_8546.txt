There doesn't seem to be the package released under Ubuntu 16.04 channel. After I added the Ubuntu PPA for QuTiP, I got the following error/warning:
Thanks for maintaining it :)
We have decided not to continue to maintain the Ubuntu channel. Please
install from source to using qutip 3.2.
Alternatively you can use the conda-forge channel if you are able to work
with qutip 3.1

@ajgpitch Do you have any detailed instructions on using the 3.2 develop branch in Jupyter notebook? I posted a thread in the email list while having trouble to compile the examples in using Stochastic equation solvers. I have tried to compile the source and to call from Conda-forge virtual environment, but always fail despite all tests have been passed. Let me know if those examples are outdated. Thanks.
Yes, the development notebooks can become outdated. Sometimes they are used to test specific new features.
Please remind me here specifically which notebook you have found a problem with and I will raise an issue for it.
As per @ajgpitch's comment above, since the Ubuntu channel is no longer maintained, I think it makes sense to close the issue now as a wontfix.
