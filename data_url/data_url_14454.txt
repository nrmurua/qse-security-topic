If I use the multi-controlled Z gate rotation I cannot use parameter binds to run a circuit. It fails to create the QOBJ.
If we ran the code, the exped result would be the counts of the outputs of the measured value. However, we get a message saying it failed to convert from python to C++ and returns a empty string.
ERROR: Failed to load qobj: Unable to cast Python instance to C++ type (compile in debug mode for details)
The controlled Z-gste seems to be working fine, maybe inspect it.
Thanks for the report!  It's pretty arcane, but this is actually caused by CUGate rather than the multi-controlled rz - it's to do with misalignments of expectations between how CUGate.params works, and how other parts of Terra expect to be able to mutate those lists.  There's more information in #7326 - we don't have a work-around yet unfortunately, but it is a bug we need to squash.
