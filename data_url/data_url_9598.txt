Hello,
I'm using Pulser in a conda environment to create registers and plotting them, showing the Rydberg half radius.
For some reason the half radius is shown bigger that it should. The problem does not appear in a Jupyter notebook.
A simple working example is shown in the pictures.
These are the versions I'm working with:
python 3.7.10
pulser 0.2.1
matplotlib 3.4.1


Thanks for raising this up @darcangelomauro ! I think this is coming from a transformation from "data" to "display" coordinates that is currently being done, but that can be avoided. I'll open a PR with a fix and tag you for review, so you can test it on your device and see if this behaviour goes away.
