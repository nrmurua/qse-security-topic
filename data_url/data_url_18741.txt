Hello,
I tried to compile quantum-blackbird on linux openSUSE Tumbleweed.
The problem is that it could not find antlr4-common.h.
However, I have installed libantlr4-runtime-devel package which provide antlr4-common.h
Which I check and found it in /usr/include/antlr4-runtime folder, so I don't know why make cannot see it.
Thank you
It seems like openSUSE might not install antlr4 in a standard location, is there cmake flag to specify antlr4 location I can use?
I fix the issue by patching the directories in CmakeLists.txt.
But I got error: control reaches end of non-void function instead. Will close this issue for now.
