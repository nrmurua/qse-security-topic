Hi, i'm quite new to qiskit so i'm probably wrong on this, but it seems that there's no way i can pass the datapoints by small batch into svminput and predict.
For example, i have a 30mb csv file which i load and convert to correct format, but if i pass it as the datapoints to the svminput, even the best computer i can find freeze, so i'd like to pass say maybe 100 rows as datapoints, predict it, pass another 100 rows etc, but to do that i have to also pass training/test_input and run_algorithm each time.
Is it possible to return a trained model so i can break the datapoints up and predict however much i want?
hi @XBLDev
yes, you can. But you may need to change the code.
Consider qsvm_variational.py,
the entry method is _run():
As you see, the logic is fixed as train-test-predict. You can modify this logic to have multiple rounds of training.
Besides we provide the load_model/save_model APIs:
Hi @liupibm
Thanks for the reply, how do i use this qsvm_variational? The only source code I found that's somewhat relevant is in another issue:
#200
I tried to import it and initialize it, and it keeps giving an error saying:
init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'feature_map'
But feature_map is one of the arguments for qsvm_variational, it seems that passing the parameters to svminput is the only way i can use it? But once i do that i don't think i can use save/load_model anymore
hi @XBLDev
can you try the option minibatch_size? see more details in the code:
It seems that the questions have been answered since there has been no further discussion so am closing
