There is an issue of real-devices that permute the order of qubits. This will be solved with the next release of qiskit-sdk-py. Until that release, we have to provide a workaround of fixing the qubit order.
This apparently has been fixed with the version 0.4.12 of qiskit-sdk-py.
i dont think this is an issue. Did you put an initial_layout in
It has been solved with 0.4.13.
