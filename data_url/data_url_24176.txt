Please be as descriptive as possible, including: what is expected, why is this feature needed, what is the objective, etc.
Currently, when you enter an argument into Param Entry Window, the cursor gets moved to the top of the window.
Instead, keep the cursor wherever it last was
Ease of use
To clarify a bit, the issue is when you open the dialog to create a new component, you see this

Then if you open the options and edit the name of some key, the focus of the cursor is lost and reset.
For instance if you rename "Test" to "SomethingElse"
Ideally, the cursor and highlight would stay where it is. This one is a minor feature update
Looks like this has merged by @ismirlia , will close.
