Dear CP2K developers,
I wanted to request your help with an issue I have been facing, building a docker container for deployment on NERSC Perlmutter (CPU only). While the docker container provided by your team works as intended, we had a user request to provide them with CP2K built with libxc and libint support. Therefore, I tried writing a docker image for the same. I am attaching my docker recipe:
The above recipe fails at the final step with this error:
I believe this error is typically generated due to the lack of -fallow-argument-mismatch but I observe this flag being present during compilation:
Therefore, I dont quite know how to proceed with this. May I please request your help?
Thank you!
cp2k/dbcsr#661
Thanks @dev-zero I will try to build the image with 4.0.3
Thanks again for a prompt response.
The suggested tweak worked. Thank you!
