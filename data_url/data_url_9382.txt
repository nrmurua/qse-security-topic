Describe the bug
If I use the following code to build a evolution,
prob = ODEEvolution(reg, 4.2, h; dt=1e-4, adaptive=false)
Then I tried to calculate observables
for info in prob
rho = density_matrix(info.reg, (1,2,3,4,5))
entropy[info.step]= von_neumann_entropy(rho)
end
clocks = [t for t in 0:1e-4:4.2]
There is a mismatch of the dimension of clocks and prob. The clocks has one more step than entropy. This will cause inconvenience for plotting the results.
Expected behavior
I wonder if this is caused by the info starts to measure after the first evolution stepï¼Ÿ Is there any way also to make the info.reg also includes the starting state?
I don't think this is supported, this is the behavior of DiffEq and there is no option to change this. However there is info.clock which will return the current clock of the result, you can just use that
I just realize clock is not only returning t but also the state, should be fixed in #155
