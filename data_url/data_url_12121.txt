According to Qiskit's installation requirements: "There are optional dependencies that are required to use all the visualization functions available in Qiskit". These can be installed by running pip install qiskit-terra[visualization].
During the tutorials, these optional features are sometimes required but never referenced, which may lead to issues for people new to the software.
Now that the tutorials are rendered in the docs, this is not needed anymore.  The main docs discuss the need for the visualization add on: https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html#install
