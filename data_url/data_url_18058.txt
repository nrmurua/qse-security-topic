The Qobj / QASM generated after doing the swap mapping can be invalid due to the use of already measured qubits by the swap mapper.  In addition, the measured qubits can be swapped in such a way that measuring multiple qubits gets mapped onto multiple measurements of the same qubit.
The output circuit is:

showing that the measurements are no longer last, and the measurements of q[0] and q[4] become repeated measurements of q[0]:
The hardware requires that no gates be done after a measurement.  In addition, this blocks the possibility of swapping qubits so that the same one is measured twice.
Working on it.
