Most of the playbook documentation under docs/ is derived from the notebooks in examples/. However, while we have CI checking the notebooks never go out of sync and are always updated with breaking code changes, this is not the case for the playbooks in the documentation.
The current workflow for generating the docs/ content from the notebooks in examples/ is to use jupyter nbconvert --to=rst examples/[notebook name].ipynb manually from the terminal and then committing the resulting rst files and images. This is obviously not great for ensuring stuff stays in sync.
We probably start enforcing this manually and then move to a more automated approach.
