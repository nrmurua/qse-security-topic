The IBM Quantum Composer does not allow _ in the gate name. For example,
The OpenQASM 2.0 clearly specifies the validity of the _ in the gate name. Have you asked the IBM Quantum Composer people to stop using _? Or, is that just an outright bug in their parser?
The _ is so useful. I cannot imagine any reason to deprecate it.
This seems like a bug in the IBM Q Composer specifically. I will raise internally with this team.
This is confirmed a bug and an internal ticket has been opened to fix.
@taalexander can you link that issue for the IBM Quantum Composer here and close this issue (as it is not a bug within the OpenQASM3 specification)?
+1 to closing this since it's not an OpenQASM issue
Agreed.
