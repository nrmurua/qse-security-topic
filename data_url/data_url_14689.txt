When drawing the Quantum Circuit, with circuit.draw(), using the Matplotlib(circuit.draw('mpl')) parameter, leads to crashing of jupyter notebook, while the output gets printed as expected, but the jupyter notebook acts wierdly.
Before:

After:

1.) Initialize the Quantum Circuit.
2.) Use command - circuit.draw('mpl')
The command should draw the circuit, without interfering with the Jupyter Notebook's UI.
There might be errors while calling the matplotlib and using it to draw the circuit. Code changes in the integration part might be needed between the libraries(Qiskit and Matplotlib).
I guess the issue is in general with the matplotlib when used in Qiskit. No plots are getting plotted using matplotlib, without  jupyter notebook behaving unusually. I am not sure whether it is a local problem or it is happening with everyone.
The main thing is the update . Previously we need to add an extra line %matplotlib inline for using  q.draw('mpl'). But for the new version in qiskit you don't need to do that now . And when you are using that same thing in new version then it is crashing.
Try using this in IBM Quantum Experience if there is any system error .
