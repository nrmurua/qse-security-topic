Some tf.function wrapped functions that only have a single tape result in:
One possible cause is mentioned at this link:
It should be noted tf.GradientTape is still watching the forward pass of a tf.custom_gradient, and will use the ops it watches. As a consequence, calling tf.function while the tape is still watching leads to a gradient graph being built. If an op is used in tf.function without registered gradient, a LookupError will be raised.
So solving this seems like it would involve removing tf.function decoration from the library, leaving it up to users to decorate as desired.
Can you provide a minimal snippet that reproduces this issue ? It looks like this lookup is related to trying to get gradient info from the gradient op which could be caused by trying to do 2nd order or multi-tape things.
Still need to get a more minimal example.  Most toggleable place it's turned up is line 144 of the tests here , where  I found that adding persistent=True to the gradient tape causes the error LookupError: No gradient defined for operation'TfqAdjointGradient' to happen.
