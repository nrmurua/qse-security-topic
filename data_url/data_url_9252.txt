In simulation with Bloqade, one can use ForwardDiff.jl to do forward AD of parameters. This works with KrylovEvolution. But if one wants to simulate time-dependent Hamiltonian with Waveform, and SchodingerProblem. The ForwardDiff.gradient and ForwardDiff.jacobian breaks down and outputs NAN.
do you have a minimum-not-working example to demonstrate this bug?
