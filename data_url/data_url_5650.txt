Since Qiskit/qiskit@75673c7 of Terra, close() is removed from Sampler but AerSampler has close() with assuming that docstring exists in its base class. This mismatch causes Lint error: qiskit_aer/primitives/sampler.py:161:4: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring).
Just run lint.
Pass Lint.
Add docstring to close() or  change Sampler implementation in Aer.
