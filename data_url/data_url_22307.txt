Sounds like Python 3.5.2 broke IPv6 TCP/IP connections with asyncio ProactorEventLoop. conda install python=3.5.1 for now, or try using 127.0.0.1 everywhere instead of ::1.
Maybe one day, ARTIQ will run without monkey patches...
Downgrading to python 3.5.1 worked, thanks. Is the version available through conda enough to test the new contract stuff like editing datasets, RPC pause, seamless handover etc.?
Yes. And try it on Linux which doesn't have this bug.
Okay. The version according to the conda list that was installed was
Note that the monkey patches that allowed ARTIQ to run despite two problems in Python 3.5.1 are not in ARTIQ 2.x anymore. Those two issues are fixed in Python 3.5.2, but they introduced this one. So ARTIQ 2.x cannot be used on Windows for now (unless you reintroduce the monkey patches and downgrade Python to 3.5.1).
