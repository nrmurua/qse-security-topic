Looking at the SPI code for the AD5360,
You have to bitshift the data by 8 as only 24 bits are written, but the write register is 32 bit. However, this is only true for MSB programming. For LSB programming this bit shift is not necessary. It would be nice if this were handled automatically based on the LSB config value. If not, this should be added to the documentation, maybe under the spi write function.
That shifting is much better done in software.
The behavior is documented:
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/coredevice/spi.py#L78-L82
When you write a driver on top of spi, you have read that docstring. I am hesitant to rip that part out because it is here where the size/lsb/alignment behavior topic is described as a whole.
It could be helpful to include that under write, something like,
