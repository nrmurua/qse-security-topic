For developers working across elements, we should support a consistent development environment, including standard versions of pylint/astroid.
Terra currently uses pylint 2.3, aqua uses 2.4, and ignis doesn't specify a pylint version.
According to @Cryoris , running pylint 2.4 against current master (after globally disabling import-outside-toplevel) yields:
For sake of completion, that's the exact version of pylint yielding the above complaints:

A possible starting way would be to globally ignore them and create issues to gradually remove the global ignore as we introduce the fixes. Seems like good first issues.
All those failures is why we pin versions in the constraints version, every pylint and astroid version introduces new failures (either because of behavior changes or new default-on rules), also behavior across python versions is not consistent (see #1179 and a bunch of other linked issues related to this). When 2.4 was released there was a fire drill on some of the elements when the release broke CI and to adapt and pins were added, see: Qiskit/qiskit-aer#362 and qiskit-community/qiskit-ignis#279.
I agree we should sync the versions we pin to between all the elements and add the same to aqua (which doesn't pin anything right now). Everything is using a slightly different version for everything. For the terra side change it's just a matter of bumping the pin and fixing the issues, I will push a PR for this it's straightforward enough
