A possible continuation of #375, I'm still getting spurious failures with HQC's avx2 implementations in my Rust wrapper around PQClean. Of course, in some version of Murphy's law, I'm not getting the failures when I run the unit tests under gdb...
It doesn't seem to happen when I don't run the tests multi-threaded...
New HQC code was announced on pqc-forum a few days ago. I'll take a shot at integrating it.
This hasn't been a problem for a while now I think.
