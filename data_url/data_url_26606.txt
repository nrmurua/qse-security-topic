Posting to make this issue known to the devs. I pulled the latest development version (v9.0) this morning and built it on my machine to run some tests. I found that electronic convergence is not achieved for this new version, when my other build (v8.0) converges rapidly.
The system in question was MgO, and the same input file is used in both cases, but only v8.0 converges. I have attached two output files and the corresponding input file where I noticed this. Hope the devs find what caused this soon.
cp2k.inp.txt
cp2k.out.8.0.txt
cp2k.out.9.0.txt
I cannot confirm your observation. I have run your input with the cp2k release version 8.1 and with the current trunk version 9.0 of today and from May 15 on a CRAY XC40 and XC50. All runs show the same convergence behavior. The total energies and the electron counts are numerically accurate. I suggest that you check your installation.
@nwinner could you share your arch file?
@mkrack That is very odd. I've never had CP2K build successfully but not perform correctly. Thanks for checking. My arch is below.
You are using Intel MKL with a GNU compiler environment, but there is no -D__MKL flag for CP2K. Is the FFTW3 library in TACC_FFTW3_LIB from MKL, too? You have possibly an unfortunate merge of incompatible libraries.
@nwinner I have added an arch file combining GNU with MKL.
Ah that did not occur to me. Thanks so much for sussing this out for me @mkrack . Closing this issue.
