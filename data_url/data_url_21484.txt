Get proto_rev mismatch error when using Urukul
Scripts/experiments involving our Urukul cards give a proto_rev mismatch.
We originally bought a crate from m-labs with our Urukul cards connected to the Sample in an SU-Servo configuration.
To access the Urukuls individually, we tried to uncouple them by re-flashing the gateware with a new json file, and it started to give the proto_rev mismatch error.
We reflashed the Urukuls, making sure we used the v1.4 gateware to ensure compatibility with our Urukul hardware version (v1.5). However, we still get the proto_rev mismatch error.
Ideally we wouldn't get this error.
We reflashed the Urukuls,
Which ESD precautions did you take?
Did you hotplug any EEM cables?
Did you change the Urukul DIP switches? For regular use, only the first one should be on, for SUServo, the first two.

Thanks! I didn't realize I had to do that. Did it and it fixed the issue for most of our Urukuls.

We made sure to keep the cards on an ESD mat and wore ESD wrist straps. I tried David's fix and it worked all of our cards except for one, which still gives the proto_rev mismatch error.
Another thing that might be useful to check would be the actual value of the incorrect proto_rev â€“ whether it's e.g. all zeros or random noise might tell you something about the state of the electrical connections.
