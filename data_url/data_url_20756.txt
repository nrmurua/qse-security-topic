Hi! Are there any plans to upgrade the Classic McEliece KEM to the round 4 specification? I suppose it will be done. But I could not find any issue or PR on it. So I figured I could create this tracking issue.
Coincidentally, I started work on this today. Cleaning up Classic McEliece is lots of work though, so it might be a little bit.
