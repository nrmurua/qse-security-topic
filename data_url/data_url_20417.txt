From https://travis-ci.org/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/jobs/251993063, before the fails due to clang-format, we get the following error:
I have no idea where it comes from, I never got it on my mac. Anyone? Maybe we should valgrind.
Idem in https://travis-ci.org/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/jobs/252002293 that reverted the last commit to a previous version of master.
We just discussed this in our weekly call, our colleague Vlad will be looking into it.
Fixed it by replacing .global in all asm files with .globl (that's because macOS uses some ancient "as" tool), see the "Fix unknown pseudo-op: .global under macOS" pull request
Fixed in #152
Still broken.
