Please be as descriptive as possible, including: what is expected, why is this feature needed, what is the objective, etc.
Export the qubit Hamiltonian in a format that can be accepted by the PulseSimulator in Qiskit Aer
Users can design a qubit and study it using Qiskit Pulse. This is great for teaching. With this feature, we can integrate Qiskit Metal to the Pulse section of Qiskit textbook to create awareness of Qiskit Metal for a much larger audience.
This would really be quite desirable.
