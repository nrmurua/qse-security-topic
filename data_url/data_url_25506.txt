If one attempts to run covalent start and there are migrations pending we instruct the user to run covalent db migrate. However when a user installs a fresh version of covalent given there have been no migrations run at all we want for those migrations to run automatically without instructing the user to run the migration themselves.
Hey, can I take this on for Hacktoberfest? Also, is this essentially automating the migrations command when updating a DB model and such?
Hi @oliviacarino , I have updated the acceptance criteria to provide more information on the issue. Let me know if all is clear. Thanks!
@AlejandroEsquivel thanks for clarifying the criteria! So upon fresh install, using the covalent._data_store.datastore.DataStore class will check whether there have been any migrations or not? If it is a fresh install and no migrations have been run, perform migrations automatically without prompting the user? Then, if it is NOT a fresh install, continue to prompt the user for running migrations when necessary?
Yes that's exactly right @oliviacarino
@AlejandroEsquivel I don't see the DataStore class under covalent._data_store.datastore.DataStore but instead see it within covalent_dispatcher/_db/datastore.py Is this the correct class?
@oliviacarino this was recently migrated from the SDK to the dispatcher module.  You're correct, that's the new location.
