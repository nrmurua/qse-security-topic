While running some tests I was getting crashes when I tried to use Kraus noise on the MPS simulator.
Run the following code:
This crashes the python kernel with a blas error:
No crash
The error looks like something is going wrong with a matrix multiplication somewhere in the source code
Closed by #1003
@merav-aharoni looks like this is still an issue on master. A couple of times when running the above script I get a malloc error instead of the BLAS error:
But if i run it several times in a row it seems to return to the BLAS error
Hopefully fixed this time by #1188
