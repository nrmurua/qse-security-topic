#906 added the ability to wait for old jobs to finish before submitting a new one to IBMQ, so the submit doesn't fail due to job limit. The wait has a timeout value of 5 minutes, to see if a job slot frees up. However, if the old job doesn't finish within the wait, the wait_for_final_state() method will throw a timeout error, causing the submit to fail.
Run an experiment that requires more jobs that the job limit on IBMQ, and each job runs for more than 5 minutes.
The job timeout error should be suppressed.
Catch and suppress the timeout error.
Please assign this issue to me.
