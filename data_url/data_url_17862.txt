I don't think retrieve_job should be associated with a backend. It is really associated with a queue in the IBMQ. I think in the future all jobs in IBMQ need a unique jobid but I would like to discuss this function a bit.
I take this back. Getting the jobs by backend is correct. You know where you ran it.
