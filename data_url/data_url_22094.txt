Slack is something you have to manage yourself. We have never handled that and I can see no way to do that.
We are giving some slack in core.reset() and break_realtime() but that's more aimed at avoiding annoyance. That scheme will only ever work for "trivial" experiments and I can always construct an experiment where that amount of slack is not enough.
Slack is handled by both the core
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/coredevice/core.py#L164
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/coredevice/core.py#L173
and sawg
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/coredevice/sawg.py#L317
I advocate for large-enough slack in these cases.
Please refer to my comment above. I explained the first two cases. The line from SAWG has nothing to do with slack. "large enough slack" is un-knowable in core.reset() and break_realtime(). And having methods pre-compensate by adding slack for their own runtime would not be helpful.
