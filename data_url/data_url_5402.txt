Two test cases were found to cause hanging behaviour when using pytest on a Windows machine:
Running these tests cause the suites to run without termination. When run as a stand-alone case, the code for 1. could be executed with/without using pytest.
#59 includes a small fix to split up running 1. and the rest of the device tests when building the wheel.
Are the two tests with the issues related? Maybe they are both applying a Rot gate with problematic parameters/wires/qubit number?
