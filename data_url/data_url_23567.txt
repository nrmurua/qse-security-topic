When creating a virtual instrument (i.e. a wrapper around a device) which has parameters with a get_cmd or a set_cmd method, the creation will fail as it assumes that all instruments have a write or an ask method, which is not true for virtual instruments which subclass InstrumentBase.
For example, the following code snippet will cause an AttributeError:
Though this example is contrived, it came up in https://github.com/QNLSydney/qcodes_measurements/blob/master/qcodes_measurements/device/channel_wrapper.py which labels gates/keeps track of gate connection state.
