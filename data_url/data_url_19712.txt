The process tomography fitter does not correctly include the trace preserving constraint when using the cvx method
The resulting channel should be trace preserving, i.e. the second assert should not fail in the above code.
I have tracked down the error to the file qiskit/ignis/verification/tomography/fitters/cvx_fit.py. The cvxpy fitting routine is supposed to add the TP constraint by making sure that the partial trace of the Choi matrix is the identity. However it only checks the real part of the partial trace and not the imaginary part. The resulting choi matrix is therefore not TP.
The fix is a simple one-liner, I will submit a PR
