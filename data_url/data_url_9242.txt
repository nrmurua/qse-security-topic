CI is failing in BloqadeKrylov because BloqadeKrylov has BloqadeODE as a test dependency which can't be deved as far as I understand.
The best option os to rewrite the test so that it uses OrdinaryDiffEq.jl instead of BloqadeODE so that it doesn't depend on having a functional version of BloqadeODE to work.
