A utility function that can take as input a quantum circuit (or list of quantum circuits) and a noise model that will
This circuit will no longer be possible to be run on a device, but it could be sent to the Aer simulator to execute directly without including the noise model class in the qobj (as the nosie is already inserted as explicit circuit instructions), and could be used by the Terra QuantumChannel objects to generate the noisy superoperator output for the circuit, or the DensityMatrix object (in PR 2364) to get the noisy output from the circuit.
Note: this would still not be the optimal way or running noisy simulations in Aer as it will be significantly less efficient than simulating with an explicit noise model due to it converting all errors into Kraus errors.
The ability to insert QuantumError objects directly into a circuit is already present in Terra 0.8 / Aer 0.2, but the to_instruction method needs to be added for ReadoutError objects to convert them to the readout error instruction understood by the simulator.
