There are many changes happening on the matplotlib drawer and we need better confidence in the changes (given that there are no automated tests). I think we just need one reference circuit with all gates (standard library, a unitary, a state prep, QFT, opaque, reset, measure). This can go in tools. And then every PR has to show how that image will look like after the changes.
This could be used to test other things too but matplotlib is of immediate importance.
@ajavadia I thought I might try to take on creating the reference circuit you've described. It would help a lot in testing mpl drawer, especially in testing global changes, like layer widths and box widths.
I started by creating an import list, taking essentially everything from circuit.library and qiskit.extensions. I thought before I proceed further it would be good to get an approval on which of these gates are required and if there are others. I assume doing some controlled versions would be good and also doing some to_gate() gates. Here's the import list.
If we follow the #4544 approach, I think would be better to do one test per each.
But that creates a 100 images to manually check?
I could "fold" the cases that having no differences to reduce the amount of images to check. See #4544 (comment)
Also some issues might arise in bigger circuits not trivial ones like how different boxes are spaced next to each other. I donâ€™t have a good answer and we probably have to refine over time.
I agree that it's hard to imagine. I think we should start by adding those cases that we know are problematic (based on the tests we are currently skipping and the new issues that are popping) see how far we can go.
I think having a huge reference image has little value, since it will be hard to find where the difference is.
