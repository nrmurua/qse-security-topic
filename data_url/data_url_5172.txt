Quantum contextuality is known to be a key ingredient in producing quantum speedupâ€”and, hence, in stymieing efficient classical simulation of quantum systems. As a sort of converse, Raussendorf et al. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.05374.pdf) have a paper where they propose a scheme with the following traits:
I haven't read this paper myself, but it seems like it could be reasonable fodder for a new QVM simulation mode. Someone ought to investigate.
