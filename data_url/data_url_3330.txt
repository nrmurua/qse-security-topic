Per #1417, DefFrame.out currently does not render valid Quil if we put a JSON string into a string field on the DefFrame. I'd like to go ahead and fix that independently of fixing the parser to read back in an escaped string.
The escaped string will have to do in the absence of an allowance in the Quil spec for JSON strings, ee quil-lang/quil#52.
