Hi, I have a question about CompleteMeasFitter function from ignis.
I am using it as a part of my quantum instance -
quantum_instance = QuantumInstance(backend=backend,
measurement_error_mitigation_cls=CompleteMeasFitter,
cals_matrix_refresh_period=120)
Although I am never using matplotlib in my code, I get a plt error as follows:
File “/cephyr/users/../.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/qiskit/ignis/mitigation/expval/base_meas_mitigator.py”, line 170, in BaseExpvalMeasMitigator
ax: Optional[plt.axes] = None) -> plt.axes:
NameError: name 'plt' is not defined
It comes from the BaseExpvalMeasMitigator function.
So essentially I'm getting a plt error when I'm trying to use CompleteMeasFitter through quantuminstance. I do not have matplotlib loaded as a module, if that makes a difference. How do I get around this issue?
backend - 'qasm_simulator'
use quantum_instance = QuantumInstance(backend=backend,
measurement_error_mitigation_cls=CompleteMeasFitter,
cals_matrix_refresh_period=120)
I'm using the quantum instance for VQE
VQE runs with measurement error mitigation
Here’s the complete error message:

This looks like it is a duplicate of a bug filed earlier #532 that's been fixed on master and will be included in a pending bugfix release (probably tomorrow). I'm going to close this as fixed. please feel free to reopen this if I'm missing something, or there is something else to discuss on this.
Thank you. I missed that bug report!
