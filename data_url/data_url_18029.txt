Many quantum algorithms, such as amplitude amplification, require the use of inverse of quantum circuits. Inverting a circuit should be possible as the method initialize(), a quantum circuit, already supports this.
Can be related to #728
@rraymondhp could you propose a code sample for this in a hypothetical use case?
I wonder if it is as simple as this:
For one of the use cases, see this notebook:

The inverse of a circuit can be used to compute how close are two quantum states.
We can easily compute inverse QFT, and much more.

Thank you very much for your detailed explanation @rraymondhp. In the meantime, someone could use CompositeGate which has a reverse but perhaps, this is something we want at a circuit level. @ajavadia, thoughts?
It would also be nice if you could call inverse on a subset of gates - say inverse(i,j).  An example case of this is in the HHL algorithm for linear systems.  You have to perform a phase estimation on some qubits, do some other controlled rotations, then invert just the phase estimation part of the circuit.
closing as supported in the latest version.
