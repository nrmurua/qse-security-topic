Code in the MATLAB part of qupulse has some occurences of "qc-toolkit" still that should be in principle be removed/replaced by "qupulse" for consistency.
I did not yet do that because they are contained in hardcoded file paths and thus would break the code. Hardcoding file paths is bad practice though, please consider finding another solution for this (e.g. uncommited/git-ignored configuraton file for paths).
(I assigned the issue somewhat randomly, don't know who exactly is concerned with this...)
