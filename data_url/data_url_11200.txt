@lamberta This is just a reminder.
We are transition away from sphinx and read the docs for generating and serving docs.  This keeps us aligned with the documentation strategy in the other repos of quantumlib.  We will use the tensorflow docs engine to generate docs.  The OpenFermion docs are already in the Google Style so hopefully there aren't too many doc problems.  Once the new doc infrastructure is merged we can work on upgrading the docs and guides to reflect the new module layout from PR #620 and transition example notebooks to colabs as suggested in #628 by @balopat .
