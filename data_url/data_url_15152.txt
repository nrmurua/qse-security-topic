According to documentation OneQubitEulerDecomposer is supposed to return the angles of U gate if basis is U or U3.
But, it returns wrong angles for some gates.
output
The U gates bound with angles by OneQubitEulerDecomposer should match the original gates.
No idea to fix the issue.
I notice that the unit test does not check the case basis=None in the following code. It may be good to check basis=None too.

This looks correct, up to a global phase?  If you want that as well, use OneQubitEulerDecomposer.angles_and_phase.
Thanks. I forgot about the global phase. I will try angles_and_phase later.
The outcomes match with global phases.
