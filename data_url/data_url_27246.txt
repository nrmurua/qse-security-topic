Hello! Wondering if including AES-256 is in the security level roadmap?
Nathan Aw
Seems useless. The point of SIDH/SIKE is to establish a key for any symmetric encryption algorithm (see Diffie-Hellman key exchange), be it AES, ChaCha20, TwoFish, etc... The symmetric encryption algorithm should be chosen or implemented by the programmer, not by this library.
EDIT: I just realized you most likely meant the post-quantum security level compared to AES. That is determined by the parameters in p503.c and p751.c. Honestly p751 (comparable to post-quantum AES-192) should be plenty for regular use, as it's comparable to the current (non-PQ) security level of regular elliptic curve cryptography (Curve25519, for instance, offers 128 bits of security).
I did however find that SIKEp964 was also submitted to NIST, offering stronger security, code available here: https://github.com/dconnolly/NIST-PQC-SIKE
There are no plans to include P964 for now. P751 already offers plenty of security for the foreseeable future (unless there is a breakthrough in cryptanalysis).
@patricklonga I'd appreciate if your reconsidered: several applications are not satisfied by symmetric strength equivalent of AES-192, and insist on AES-256 equivalent (for example, see the follow-up to Suite B).
Since P964 seems already included in the NIST submission - what is the problem adding it here, as people (including myself) explicitly ask for it?
Besides, AES-192 has about 96 bits of strength against Grover, while AES-256 provides 128 bits.
