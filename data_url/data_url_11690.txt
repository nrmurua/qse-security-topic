Eigenvalues are not correctly detected even when these can be exactly represented in binary with the given amount of qubits. The problem was found while investigating issue #899 from which it seemed that the problem was in detecting only the negative eigenvalues.
The matrix

has eigenvalue -0.5 for the eigenvector v and 0.5 for w. And below is the code used to create the eigs_qpe circuits in the subsequent examples.
In this example the eigenvalues can be exactly represented in binary, however playing with the time and using 3 qubits to represent the positive eigenvalue gives the following results:

The case for negative eigenvalues,i.e.
is incorrect in more cases. However, writing down on paper what the eigs_qpe.py module does for this example gives the right result. So the problem might be either in the Hamiltonian simulation (which should be exact in this case) or in the phase_estimation_circuit.py module.
HHL is being reworked under this PR Qiskit/qiskit#5698 where core algorithms have been moved to Terra repo and are being maintained there. The code here will be deprecated and as such is frozen - hence I am closing this issue.
