This should all be done! Will work on making the other tests?/ Will brief Gita for her to get involved tomorrow as well.
@rryoung98 Awesome, thanks! Next time for updates that address a specific issue like this, create a separate feature branch and submit a pull request so I can review the changes and do a merge if needed. Also in the future that helps us track which commits addressed which issues if we ever need to go back. This time it's on me because I created the issue after you'd already started, so no worries. I'll open some more issues this afternoon that you and Gita can both work on!
