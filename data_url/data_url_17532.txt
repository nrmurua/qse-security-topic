The circuit of the shor algorithm in the tutorial cannot be compiled for real-device backends because of error in combining multiple one-qubit gates into a single one-qubit gate.
See the details here:
Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#536
It can be fixed if we turn off the pass for optimizing one-qubit gates.
Run the circuits in this tutorial on real devices:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/community/algorithms/shor_algorithm.ipynb
Compilation succeeds without error.
Turn off optimizing one-qubit gates if it produces error.
I'll look into it but that circuit won't run on a device anyway. It has a reset.
