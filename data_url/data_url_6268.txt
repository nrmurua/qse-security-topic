In the previous simulator, we had a job.qobj. I know @ajavadia wanted this for the IBMQ. I am not sure we need this for simulators but I'm putting it here as I think we need to either add job.qobj here or remove job.qobj from basic. I don't mind which way we go but i would like the two simulators to have the same methods with aer having more not less.
Maybe the qobj method should be added as an abstract method to the BaseJob qiskit-terra class if we want to force all Job classes to implement it
I don't think we should add it to the base as that forces every third party simulator to do the same. Rather having it as an extra feature of the provider sounds good.
