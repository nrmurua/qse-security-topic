I ran into this while working on a different project, but tried to simplify the bug in another simple example. It compares some of the ways to input the same thing, with the last part (which uses list callback format) obtaining different results. Thanks to @Krastanov for encouraging me to submit my first bug report.
Hi, and thanks for reporting this issue! There might be some inconsistency in how the callback function is documented/implemented, but I think that you example should work if you define the callback function as:
Thank you for replying so quickly. I changed the definition as you mentioned and updated the example; no change in behavior.
It seems to be working for me:

What version of QuTiP are you using?
I'm using Qutip 3.0.1 for Python 3.4, just updated from Python 2.7 to compare. Bug persists, but it seems that your version of Qutip doesn't have it. Sorry about not using the dev version.
I downloaded the latest official version from apt-get, is there a way to get the dev version from there or do I have to compile etc.?
Qutip 3.0.1 should be ok, I think. Can you try to run the notebook I linked to? Compared to the example you linked to there is still a difference in that sqrt(alp) is used in the function alp1sq in my notebook, but not in yours.
That works. So this just means that superoperator input via list callback has an extra squaring operation. Thank you for the clarification.
