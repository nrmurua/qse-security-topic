It is not possible to use initial_layout unless you explicitly name the QuantumRegister or extract the automatically assigned name.
KeyError: 'q'
This is even worse for compiling multiple circuits because all circuits must have the same QuantumRegister name that is not the default behavior because the names are automatically iterated:
KeyError: 'q'
The ability to apply an initial_layout should not dependent on having to explicitly name all my registers or dig for the automatically applied names.  The name is actually pointless internally, as all that is needed for the layout mapping is the order in which the registers where added to the circuit, and their sizes.  For multiple circuits, I should not have to make all the register names the same.
I think the first part is just me being stupid, as you can just use the initial QuantumRegister instance. So only the second part about multiple circuits is the issue.
I think if transpile() accepts a list of circuits, it should also accept a list for all other args: initial_layout, seed, coupling_map, etc.
