Description
I am using LeapHybridCQMSolver to solve the CQM model. If I set the time_limit to None (which is 5s according to the details of problem status), the solver returns satisfying feasible solutions. However, if I set the time_limit to a larger constant such as 30s, the solver cannot find a feasible solution.
To Reproduce
I am unsure whether my model causes this kind of result or something from the SDK and solver. Since my model is under business work, I cannot provide it here.
Expected behavior
I expected a better result by making the time_limit parameter larger, or at least the same result.
Environment:
Additional context
I wonder if it is a rare case and mostly comes from the model's structure or if it comes from the internal issue of the hybrid solver.
Hi @scorpioares, thanks for the report! Would it be possible to share the CQM that you submitting? You can save it by running
@arcondello, thank you for your reply. I have saved the CQM file. How can I send it to you? Is there a safer way to do that to protect sensitive business information?
