The CCZ gate is locally equivalent (up to 1-qubit gates) to the CCXGate (Toffoli gate).
The CS gate is locally equivalent (up to 1-qubit gates) to the CSXGate.
First, it may be useful to add these two gates to the circuit library.
Then, one can also add them to the CNOTDihedral class, to obtain a better synthesis of CNOT-Dihedral circuits, using:

Hi! If possible, I'd like to work on this issue :)
thanks @epelaaez - I've assigned you to this issue :)
This is also useful for CNOT-Dihedral Randomized Benchmarking of some non-Clifford gates:
