Describe the bug
Perceval has a renderer at the Circuit or the Processor level allowing to generate svg or png through matplotlib library. At the processor level, it is possible to add heralds on some modes - as a result, these modes are not anymore available and the heralds are showing inside the circuit.
However, the rendering of the circuit does not take these heralds into account which makes sometime the herald appears as overlapping with the circuit box.
To Reproduce
within Pycharm or any editor supporting in-app matplot display, or within a Jupyter notebook

or

Expected behavior
The herald on the first mode should be displayed inside the circuit bounding box
Additional context
In notebook, a svg renderer is used (perceval/rendering/canvas/svg_canvas.py), in editor, matplotlib renderer is used (perceval/rendering/canvas/mplot_canvas.py)
I'd like to work on this. I have reproduced the error on a Jupyter notebook. What would be a good starting point to go about solving this?
I've inspected the code, and I suspect there might be some slight miscalculation in the precompute_herald_pos function. Checking implementation of PERM to see what I can find there.
Hello @alt-shreya, thanks for your interest in the issue üëç ! I believe that the core issue is coming from the fact the heralds are added after the circuit, we would expect them to "push" a bit the top beamsplitter while the circuit is being rendered.
However how it is done currently:
Let us know if you can figure this out !
(see @raksharuia for further help)
Hi @alt-shreya, are you still working on this issue? I'm also interested in this issue but I do not want to disturb you if you are about to figure out.
hi @king-p3nguin, thank you for checking in. I have been working on it, yes. In all honesty, I haven't figured out the final solution yet, but I'm hoping to take another crack at it.
