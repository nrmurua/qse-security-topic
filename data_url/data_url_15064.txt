While debugging other issues with the coupling_map, I noticed a puzzling section in the code:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/1282a04d528dd56d8e401dccc388a32178e9c6cc/qiskit/compiler/transpiler.py#L358-L361
At this point, coupling_map is either a CouplingMap, a list of lists of integers, or None and unique_transpile_args is a list of dicts with these keys:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/1282a04d528dd56d8e401dccc388a32178e9c6cc/qiskit/compiler/transpiler.py#L757-L763
So I don't see how this condition could ever be true.
Here is some code that can raise an exception because of the problem with the code:
No error for the above code.
I think code needs to check if "coupling_map" is in the shared dict, pull the coupling maps out of the unique dicts if not.
