See unitaryfund/pyqrack#9. We don't effectively expose optimized measurement methods via the shared library that are taken for granted, in "raw Qrack." Partially, this a failure of oversight, but it's also a poor implementation of Qiskit- and Q#-centric measurement APIs.
I'm going to start by optimizing multi-shot measurement in an obvious way, at QUnit layer. At least, I want to provide a shared library interface that internally picks the correct available measurement variant to maximize performance.
