We're trying to build cp2k 8.1 on macOS as part of Homebrew: Homebrew/homebrew-core#68951
We are seeing several failures:
I do not see the reason why -fopenmp was not added to CFLAGS in the darwin arch files (or BSD ones, for that matter). Are we doing something wrong, or is it a bug?
Thanks for testing and updating the package in Homebrew!
Yeah, v8.1 was not tested on macOS it seems, but I'm working on it.
That's a GCC bug, see https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/tools/toolchain/scripts/files/gcc-10.2.0-cpp-__has_include.patch
Patch was accepted into GCC and should be part of GCC 10.3+
That's not supported and not recommended.

This is a bug and needs to be added.

Which isn't? Using the beta version of libint-cp2k?
@carlocab the beta version of libint (and therefore also libint-cp2k) is not supported. We only support v2.6.0 of libint at the moment.
@dev-zero I understand your position but as a result, it means cp2k is uncompilable for us with the latest version of every dependency. We won't distribute version 8.1, and wait in hope a later version does work with "everything up to date".
@fxcoudert there are several points from my side:
Since all the other issues were solved and CP2K itself builds with gcc-10 on macOS I am closing this.
