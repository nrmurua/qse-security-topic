Currently, the CircuitSampler requires a parameter binding dictionary in the following format
 {â€˜aâ€™: [0]}, i.e. it requires an iterable to be assigned to a parameter.
The following format  {â€˜aâ€™: 0} is compatible with operator.assign_parameters but wouldnâ€™t work with the CircuitSampler.
@Zoufalc @Cryoris I'm happy to work on this if no one else is already planning to.
Actually, I think this is already fixed?
I'm looking at this commit: 4235603
And the following pull request in Aqua: qiskit-community/qiskit-aqua#1447
@Cryoris Could you confirm if this is fixed, or if I am perhaps misunderstanding something?
@spencerking Sorry for the delayed response! Yes this has already been fixed ðŸ™‚ But thanks a lot for your interest, maybe there are some other open issues that you'd be interested in working on!
