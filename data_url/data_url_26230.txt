Currently, the Contributing guide in the documentation is split into two pages. The page on RTD links to another page in .github.
It might be better to split the page on .github into a Code of Conduct in the documentation and move the contributing info in .github to the section in the documentation.
More info will be added later after a make target is created for this and github actions also checks for code syntax etc.
üëç for this one.

remove instructions for using pip for an editable installation. poetry is a better dependency resolver.
