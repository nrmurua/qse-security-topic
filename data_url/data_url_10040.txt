Application
Most hamiltonians for real life applications are not defined within the linear/quadratic ranges of the QPU, making scaling a neccesity. In addition, the QPU has precision limitations that needs to be taken into account that get amplified further during scaling.
Proposed Solution
a scaling composite that takes care of scaling problems and dealing with precision issues. Since HigherOrderComposite is in the making, this composite ideally should be able to handle HUBOs.
