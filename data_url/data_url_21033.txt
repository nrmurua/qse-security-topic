Hello!
This is a lot of info, but this is mainly what I get stuck on and need to close and re-open to sync (not sure if its just my wifi but my server is in a DMZ:
It appears to fetch the same block a few times then gets hung after banning the peer/node.
However my first sync went really well, just required a restart or two.
I think this may be resolved, not sure. I just wanted to throw out the output. I don't think it will be an issue when there are more miners as, upon restarting I have 9 peers, but when it bans a peer/a peer goes offline it will stop syncing when my peers dips below 3 peers. I think this is due to the slaves setting (but not sure)
I am looking to this problem. Will have a fix for it soon.
Thanks, I was just unsure if it was a bug or just normal functioning and takes awhile to acquire more peers. :) I did restart the sync on the first install to see how it went. It seems to go smooth, but once peers are in my pool, they start to slow down and gradually fall off (like I said it could be my wifi haha)
Just eventually gets below to about 2-3 peers and won't sync and it's faster to restart :)
Yes this could possibly be because of wifi or bad internet connection.
