Compilation of the C++ backend currently has a hard-coded '-march=native' option as part of the setup instructions. This causes problems when a single python environment is used across multiple machines with different hardware; importing ProjectQ will cause immediate kernel death with no error message.
Would it be possible to add a setup flag for this instead of hard-coding?
I currently don't know of a nice way to achieve this. As with features I suspect that this will cause problems when using pip (instead of running setup.py).
As a quick fix, I'd clone the repo, replace the flag in setup.py and install that version. Does this work for now?
This workaround works fine, although installing manually rather than via pip is always slightly more complicated. In lieu of a better option for the install itself, it might be an idea to mention the issue in the installation documentation; it was very difficult for us to diagnose this when we encountered the error.
Thanks for the suggestion and mentioning this issue to us. We have now included a notice in the latest documentation.
