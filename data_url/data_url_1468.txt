Currently all the logic for converting a zero to, say, a state vector resides in SparseSimulator._create_partial_act_on_args. The ActOnStateVectorArgs requires a full state vector to be passed in. This makes working with ActOnArgs inconvenient. You either have to have a Simulator around to create one, or call the function that creates a state vector from a basis state and pass it in, or whatever. It should be possible to call ActOnStateVectorArgs(0, qubits) and have it know what you mean. (And we should rename it, but that's a different issue).
This would also be nice because you could then write a generic function that adds some qubits to an existing state space, something like
Again, currently if you want to do something like that, you have to have full Simulators around, and it would be nice not to have to.
I believe this would be a fairly small, uninvasive change, just moving some code around. Could be a good first or second issue. Would likely want to finish #4789 first.
@viathor this is more "area/simulator" than the other two labels.
