The Status dataclass is currently imported and used in Result where all the statuses are defined. Now, since we're going to have new statuses, we need to come up with better definitions than in covalent/_shared_files/util_classes.py.
Acceptance Criteria:
For the status descriptions, the DB might also need to be updated. In #1271 however, since I'm introducing these in a backwards compatible manner, hence DB related changes can be done later.
