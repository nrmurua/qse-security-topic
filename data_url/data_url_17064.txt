When running through the notebook, the cell demonstrating the QuantumCircuit.bind_parameters() method fails with this stacktrace:
Run through the advanced circuits notebook here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/advanced/terra/advanced_circuits.ipynb
or just run this script:
It doesn't stack trace and works as expected.
Fix this bug. It looks like it was introduced in #2537 (reverting it fixes the failure)
This was tricky to track down. #2282 changed argument broadcasts from a decorator on the instruction constructor into a loop in qc.append, which in turn meant that qc.append only received a single Instruction instance, even when broadcasting across multiple bits. (Previously, the decorator would call the instruction's constructor multiple times.)
This causes a problem for ParameterTable which keeps reference of Instruction instances based on the assumption that any Instruction appears in the circuit at most once.
(I'm not sure why the example code continued to work between #2282 and #2537.) This check wasn't introduced until #2537 .
#3013 works around this for this case by deepcopying the instruction for all broadcasted args (except the first.) I opened an issue ( #3014 ) to discuss and resolve the broader approach of ParameterTable's gate tracking.
