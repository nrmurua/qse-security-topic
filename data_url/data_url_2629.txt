Expected behavior:
Maybe it should just be Z?
The reason for this behavior is that the period of a gate returned by Rz is explicitly set to 4 instead of 2.
I will fix this after #1055 , which allows EigenGate to compute its own period (and in particular the unshifted period)
The solution to this issue would have been simpler if we could examine group properties of the gates more easily. I suggested one way to achieve this on #1099.
In the specific instance of this issue, the suggestion on #1099 would help by making the internal representation of Z and Z^-1 identical! (because -1 = 1 mod 2).
