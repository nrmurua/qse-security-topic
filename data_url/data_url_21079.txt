The network is accepting transactions that are signed with OTS Keys that do not match the OTS Key Index a transaction object.
Validation should be added so that the OTS Key Index defined in a 'transferCoins' object matches the first 4 bytes of a signature provided in 'pushTransaction'.
Second major critical error is that self.pubhash is derived incorrectly from self.PK + ots_key..instead of a concatenation of hashes from self.pk.
This requires an urgent fix..
Fixed in PoW version of Testnet
