Note: To convert a controlled-X gate into a Toffoli gate (and vice-versa), hold the Special key down while wielding the Control Tool and left-clicking or right-clicking. Left-clicking moves the second control qubit up one wire, and right-clicking moves the second control qubit down one wire. There is a blue dot on the second control qubit to help you distinguish it from the first control qubit. The Special key mentioned earlier may be known, and set, by pausing the game and choosing the Change Keys button.
How to reproduce:
Install Minetest 5.1.0 with flatpak's flathub repo, install the latest version of Qiskitblocks from the contentDB
Take the TARDIS (nice!) to the portals, take the portal to level II
Complete rooms 1 and 2
When you get to room 3, place an X gate on a wire, then wield the control tool and left/right-click on it to turn it into a controlled X gate.
Hold the Special Key and left click on the controlled X gate. Then right click on it.
Hold the special key and left click on the black dot where the controlled X gate was extended. Then right click on it.
Optional: Hold the Special key and left/right clock on other blocks in the quantum circuit to see if anything happens.
Expected: A second "control qubit" appears with a blue dot.
Reality: Nothing happens.
After further experimentation, I discovered that I can create that blue dot IF the black dot isn't in the way. So I can put the X gate in the middle, left click it with the control tool, then hold the Special key and right click it with the Control tool. Or I can put the X on the bottom wire, left click twice to put the black dot on the top wire, then hold the Special key and left-click to put the blue dot on the middle wire.
