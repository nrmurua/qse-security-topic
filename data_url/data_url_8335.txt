Hi all, I'm learning to use this great package and I've found it very helpful, but I'm having trouble looking for thermal equilibrium density operator, $e^{-\beta H}$. There is a thermal density matrix constructor thermal_dm in this package but it seems to be too simple for my purpose. Any advice on how to calculate this value? Thank you all in advance.
Hi! An easy way to do this for arbitrary Hamiltonian is using the expm() method for a quantum object.
E.g., assuming you have a predefined H and beta
(-beta * H).expm().unit()
unit() is necessary to re-normalize the state (i.e. it is equivalent to dividing by the partition function).
You can check it works by comparing to thermal_dm() for a harmonic oscillator.
I get it now. Exactly the elegant solution I'm looking for!
