assemble ignores backend option
The code outputs 1024.
But it should be 3000.
This may be related to #6898 as well?
If anyone else is not working on this issue. I would love to take this up
Thank you @prathameshbhole, I will assign it to you. Please let me know if you require any help.

Sure, I will
I have opened a pull request #6926. Which has cleared all the tests, now the code review is remaining. This was a quick fix, I am hoping to contribute more to the qiskit community in the near future. Thank you
Following a discussion here #6926 (comment) and internally with @jyu00  and @mtreinish we have decided that this falls in the category of "Won't fix". The reason for this is that the qobj path will shortly be deprecated and moved out of Qiskit Terra to qiskit-ibm. In the new backend configuration, it will become the provider's responsibility to determine how to serialize the circuit for transport to the QPU. The qobj path will then be directly called from within backend.run and this is where the Options should be used as they pertain to the relevant backend.
@prathameshbhole  To resolve this issue I would recommend adding a note to the assemble documentation mentioning that Backend.options will not be used within assemble and that the required values should be manually extracted from options and supplied directly when calling.
