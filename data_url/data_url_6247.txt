FEATURE REQUEST TEMPLATE 
ENHANCEMENT REQUEST TEMPLATE 
Hi @alex-choquette the CONTRIBUTING guide has comprehensive steps on how to build from source code. Take a look and let me know if something is not working for you.
It's been a while since there was activity in this issue, so I'm guessing that the CONTRIBUTING guide has helped.
Please, reopen the issue if you feel you need to!
