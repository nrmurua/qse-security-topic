I am trying to understand and run the liboqs tests. I have to mention that I have liboqs and the oqs-opensll fork. I have tested the signature and kem examples from the github and I get this output which I find positive.
└─$ ./example_sig
[example_stack] OQS_SIG_dilithium_2 operations completed.
[example_heap]  OQS_SIG_dilithium_2 operations completed.
As these examples use dilithium2, I think as they work, the algorithm should be enabled. Anyways, when I try to compile and run test_sig.c, test_sig_mem.c, when executing the resulting executable file, I get this message:

I have even try to pass as an argv OQS_SIG_alg_dilithium_3, as in the example_sig.c: sig = OQS_SIG_new(OQS_SIG_alg_dilithium_3);
I have seen that there are some flags for cmake command https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Customizing-liboqs#OQS_ENABLE_KEM_/OQS_ENABLE_SIG_
The solution would be to install everything from the scratch and mention all the flags at cmake? Is there another way?
Thank you in advance!
./test_sig_mem 0 Dilithium2
is incorrect: The two parameters must be switched: ./test_sig_mem Dilithium2 0 works
