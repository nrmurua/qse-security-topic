Last year, GH added support for a citation file that then adds UI elements to the repo pages to help folks generate a citation for the project. Blog announcing: https://github.blog/2021-08-19-enhanced-support-citations-github/
Add a .cff file for the mitiq paper.
Docs for the feature: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files#about-citation-files
