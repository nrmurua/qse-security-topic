XACC can be successfully built on Summit. However, following runtime errors occurred.
[2023-07-28 18:08:31.324] [xacc-logger] [error] [XACC Error] Could not load xacc_aer, error message: Bundle#11 start failed: ~/.xacc/plugins/libxacc
-aer.so: undefined symbol: slamch_
[2023-07-28 18:08:31.324] [xacc-logger] [error] [XACC Error] Framework Exiting
The libraries included in the project are:
xacc::xacc xacc::quantum_gate
XACC was built using
cmake 3.23.2
GCC 9.3.0
I have talked to Ang and loading the openblas module fixes this, so I take we can close this issue.
