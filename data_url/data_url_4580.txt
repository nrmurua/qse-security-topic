For some VQE applications it may be extremely useful to evaluate the circuit in parallel for different parametrizations. I believe there are 2 options:
Concerning point 2, consider this simple example:
Executing 2 instances in parallel reduces the overall performance of the circuit evaluation for large and small circuits for 2 reasons:
