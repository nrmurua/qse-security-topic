Regarding the deletion of the "doc" folder, I must say this is intriguing, my best guess is that I tried to rebuild the doc from scratch, didn't succeed and I somehow ended up accidentally committing without the doc folder. Looking at the commit, we are in particular still missing all the files that were sitting at the root of /doc and that are not reconstructed by sphynx (sorry):
They should definitely be reintegrated in the repo.
To make sure we are not doing the job twice, I am reintegrating them right now...
