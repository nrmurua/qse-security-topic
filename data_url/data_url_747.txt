Hi,
I want to report a bug in qpp::applyCTRL function, that there is a discrepancy in the behavior of the function regarding vectors and density matrices. Following is the code, that reproduces the bug.
I suspect the bug is in the density matrix part, and the pure state or vector part is absolutely fine.
Thanks for reporting. I will investigate the issue.
I can confirm it. Will fix it soon.
Thanks.
Fixed, new release v0.8.6. Thanks again for reporting it, please let me know if there are any additional issues with it. The error was indeed only present in the applyCTRL for density matrices, due some logical flaw in the code. After fixing I ran some tests in ./examples/_test.cpp, and everything looks fine now.
Great!!!!
BTW there was one more issue in qpp::apply, which is based on qpp::applyCTRL (with control subsystems set to an empty vector). I fixed it in the develop version, but will update the master tomorrow.
Fixed in the master release also, unit testing added in ./unit_tests/testing.cpp
I can confirm it. Thanks!!!
