The latest pip installable version of QCoDeS does not list jsonschema as a dependency but requires it.
This problem came to light when running tests on a project that depeneds on QCoDeS. Part of my build script installs qcodes (pip install qcodes). Importing qcodes then raises an exception because jsonschema is missing.
