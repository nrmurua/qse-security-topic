In README.md sometimes if the user directly copy-pastes the example code written, it might not work as expected. Two places where I found this were:
In README.md for the "Without and With Covalent" example, result = ct.get_result(dispatch_id), here since the default value of wait parameter is False, this might not give the expected result because it didn't wait for the calculation to complete. So, simply changing it to result = ct.get_result(dispatch_id, wait=True) will do the trick.
In the same file, ideally we would like to increase the width of the Without and With Covalent table, using some markdown magic in order to fit the dispatch_id = run_experiment.dispatch in one line.
In covalent_ui/README.md the port number is mentioned as 48008 whereas now the UI server runs at 47007 by default.
