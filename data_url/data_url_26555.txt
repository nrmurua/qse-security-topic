It looks like PR #1879 may have lead to back compatibility issues for LIBXSMM with version < 17. After pulling the latest changes to the master branch and trying to compile, I get the error:
I get the same error on Eiger, where the library is provided by CSCS and currently at version 16.2.
Thanks for reporting, I have reproduced the problem (straight-forward).
