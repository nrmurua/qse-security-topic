I have installed boto3, aws cli, and python-braket-sdk. I have run aws configure, and config with my IAM user. My IAM user isn't root user, but it has AdministratorAccess, AmazonBraketFullAccess, AmazonBraketJobsExecutionPolicy policies.
But if I tried to get some quantum device by this command:aws braket get-device --device-arn arn:aws:braket:::device/qpu/ionq/ionQdevice, it always return this error:
An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the GetDevice operation: User: arn:aws:iam::178363055402:user/hblab-rnd is not authorized to perform: braket:GetDevice on resource: arn:aws:braket::178363055402:device/qpu/ionq/ionQdevice with an explicit deny
If I run same below python from this link: https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python#usage, it also return similar error:
Error output:
I have already added permissions for Braket, but I can not figure the reason for this bug. Please help
System information
Have you enabled third-party devices? If you haven't yet, visit the Amazon Braket console, go to Permissions and settings, read the notice, and if you agree, click Accept terms and enable. Without doing this, you won't be able to access third-party quantum devices, only the Amazon Braket simulators.

I have enable this config, I also have create a execution role for "Service-linked role" and "Jobs". But nothing helps. But when I tried to run this command with my root account, everything is fine. I don't know what is problem with IAM account
I wasn't able to reproduce this at my end looks like something incorrect with IAM configuration. Can you try using the command rm -rf .aws to remove the current credentials and then performing the aws configure command once more with a new access ID and key for the same user with attached policies?
And then try running aws braket get-device --device-arn arn:aws:braket:::device/qpu/ionq/ionQdevice. Also make sure to set Default region name as us-east-1 before running this command.
@astrung This looks like a duplicate of question on quantum computing stack exchange. Closing this issue since you have found the answer, feel free to re-open if you need any further assistance.
