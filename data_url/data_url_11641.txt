This issue was reported on the aqua channel in the Qiskit slack workspace. This is the original report
QAOA XY mixer  - I want to create an XY mixer and a simple cost function in QAOA.  So that I can confirm, As Wang showed in April 2019, that all parameters will create a state conforming to the XY mixer constraint. In this way the cost function does not need to reflect the constraints becasue the XY mixer can do this instead.
The programme below Creates either the default X mixer if UseTraditionalMixer == True, or my attempt at the XY mixer otherwise. It runs successfully with the former, but give the Error messages;
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'complex' and 'ParameterExpression'
The code attached below is based on the sample provided there, and shows the reported problem. In initial investigation it seems that the message is a result of the complex coeff in the Paulis of the mixer being multiplied, via primitive_op mul function, with a ParameterExpression, where latter does not support complex.
The operator attempted to use as mixer Hamiltonian is not actually a Hamiltonian as it is not hermitian. The first summand if useTraditionalMixer=False is
which is not hermitian. Or from another point-of-view, if we try to use this operator in a time evolution we obtain e^{iH} = e^{Z} which is not unitary.
If we supported imaginary time-evolution we could lift this restriction, but this feature is not yet available. We could turn this into a "feature request" issue ðŸ™‚
