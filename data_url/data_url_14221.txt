Following up on #8685 (comment) , we need an explanation about primitives (probably based on https://medium.com/qiskit/what-are-qiskit-primitives-9bf63c1eacc7) following https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit_sphinx_theme/explanations/
The description in https://qiskit.org/providers/#primitives should link to that explanation.
Maybe this can be dealt with Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#1385 at the same time
