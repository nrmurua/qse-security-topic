Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The gate-dependent NoiseModel only works for gates with the same gate type (Unitary, RX, RY etc.), but sometimes this is not enough.
Describe the solution you'd like
I would like to propose to add a condition to the NoiseModel class which would add an error only if a condition specified by a user is satisfied.
Example
Current add() method does not allow to add different errors to $R_X(\pi/2)$ and $R_X(3\pi/2)$. A user could create a function condition(gate) that would return True if the noise should be added to a specific gate in the circuit.
