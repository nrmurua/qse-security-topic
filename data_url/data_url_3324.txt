@yurivict are you running QVM on the default port? It's easy to miss in the README, but just above the program it says:
PyQuil, along with quilc, the QVM, and other libraries, make up what is called the Forest SDK. To make full use of pyQuil, you will need to additionally have installed quilc and the QVM. For more information, check out the docs!
The easiest route is probably to use Docker
Hi @dbanty ,
I didn't realize that quilc and QVM are required.
They fail to compile, see quil-lang/quilc#824
Yuri
For just simulating (as in the README example) you should just need QVM, not quilc (if that one is working for you).
I'm going to go ahead and close this issue since it seems like the only remaining problem is getting those applications runningâ€”which hopefully the quil-lang team can get sorted for you.
