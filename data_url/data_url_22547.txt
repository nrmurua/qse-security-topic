Released/stable packages (e.g. dependencies) should go to the main label. Those on autobuilder (migen, misoc, artiq, pythonparser, m-labs/pyqtgraph) should go to the dev label unless they are a release. At the moment, the labels attached to packages are chaotic.
I suppose we can move autobuilder packages manually from dev to main when they correspond to a release (= git tag).
The idea is users of ARTIQ releases would only add our main channel. The documentation should be updated to reflect that, too.
When we have this resolved, track the recommended procedure in https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/RELEASING.rst
I corrected the problem with packages from conda-recipes ending up in the dev channel a while ago. Also, I have just went through the packages and fixed labels everywhere.
There isn't any particular recommended procedure in addition to what you already described in RELEASING.rst, I just went through the anaconda.org interface and manually altered every one. This is annoying and error-prone (the "Move" and "Remove" menu items are quite close and there's no confirmation on "Remove"... stupid) but no other way.
Let's keep this open until the docs are updated - right not they still tell to use the dev channel.
Ah yeah. I missed that part.
The docs were fixed in d0d56bd.
