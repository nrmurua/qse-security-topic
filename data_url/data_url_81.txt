I'm looking for a way to construct CUDA quantum kernel from pre-defined quantum circuit. It'd be nice to be able to have some text-based representation of the circuit other than direct Python or C++ code, which would directly be provided to a constructor.
I'd think about maybe using OpenQASM code provided in an external file like
or anything else like JSON representation and subsequently having a constructor like cuda::make_kernel(qasm_file).
If that's already possible in any format, I'm thankful for the info and sorry for delaying you ðŸ˜„
Thank you very much!
