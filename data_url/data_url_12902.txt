It is hard to know apriori how long a SAT-based or A*-based synthesis will take.
Therefore a particular synthesis can get stuck for a long time, with no ability to skip it from e.g. an outer loop.
A timeout argument could be used to cap the runtime, and raise a TimeoutError when it is hit. In that case the user can choose to fall back on heuristics.
