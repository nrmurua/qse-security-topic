When retrieving the results of a failed compilation job, the accessor method job.compiled_quil() on the Job object will silently fail by returning None. This might be semantically reasonable behavior, but it can cause significant user confusion, since it does not reply with the error message. A better solution (in my opinion) would be to check the Job's status for ERROR and instead raise an exception with the error message in this case.
