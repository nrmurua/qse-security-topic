What's it been replaced by?
I believe it was moved to this URL:
https://learn.qiskit.org/course/ch-algorithms/quantum-phase-estimation
If that's correct, you could assign the issue to me, and I can change the URL in the file and create a PR. :)
@Andir16: thanks - Sanket hasn't responded, and your link looks right to me, so let's just change it to that.
Awesome, @jakelishman thank you :)
