This is due to the fact that spectrum_analyzer is bypassing the normal mechanism to pop its iq
----> it directly picks iq2 because it is customized to have 2 quadrature output signals
A quick fix would be to make the customization on iq0, which is the last one to be poped, instead of iq2. But anyways, my understanding is that the customization of a single iq is a temporary things, so I guess this bug doesn't really need to be taken care of before the next hardware update.
or simply ensure that NA doesn't take iq2 somehow
