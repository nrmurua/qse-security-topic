Many times we want to be able to view the jobs we have ran and save on the cloud.
In the spec, we defined a  backend.jobs() method which returns job objects. The problem is if this returns a job object then service that requires the job to be deleted after it has been called it removes it from the cloud. Since the use case is just to have a way of checking on all my jobs
I suggest that we change this to
Are there any other things that should be displayed. I think something like a message to add that is human readable if an error occuers.
Actually, with some help from the API we might be able to keep backend.jobs() returning Job instances, but avoid consuming them until the user explicitly calls the_job.result(). Would that be preferable to adding a .view_jobs method? I think it would be conceptually neater (as in, the user would get one or more jobs one way or the other, and they can decide how to list them and inspect them).
This works as long as they donâ€™t delete and I can get enough meta data to eventually go into an activity monitor.
