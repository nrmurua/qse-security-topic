When creating a quantum circuit with more than one quibit. Printing the counts and plot_bloch_multivector behaves unexpectedly (in different order).
counts -> quibit_n, ..., quibit_0
plot_bloch_multivector(state) quibit_0, ..., quibit_n
What is the expected enhancement?
Both should either print from 0, ..., n or n, ..., 0
I am assuming by counts you mean counts_visualisation, basically histogram of how many times a given output string was produced?
If so, it is a bit confusing, because plot_bloch_multivector will plot a Bloch sphere for every qubit, vs counts will display stats for every state, so up to 2^{number of qubits} possibilities. In other words, in counts you are not looking at individual qubits, but at states (and yes, Qiskit does index them right-to-left, so that most significant bit has the highest index, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiqHj3_Avps)
