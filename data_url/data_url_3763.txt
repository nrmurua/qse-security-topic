I didn't see it stated anywhere but it seems pyQuil is python 2 only. I started to make some fixes on a branch but quickly ran into deeper issues.
Any plans or roadblocks for Python 3 compatibility? It seems a shame to start a new project as Python 2 only.
Hey @caryan, there are no roadblocks for upgrading to python 3 compatibility.  All of our dependancies are python 3 compatible (requests, numpy, scipy--which will be removed soon).  We have the upgrade as part of the near term roadmap for pyquil.  Great to see you've started that push.  We'll take a look!
