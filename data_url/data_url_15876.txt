should take forever to run but it does not.
I have not seen this feature before, but if it does what it says,
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.compiler.transpile.html#qiskit-compiler-transpile
I should be able to modify the duration of instructions.  Perhaps this is for pulses only, and the documentation just does not spell this out?
This will be used if you specify a scheduling_method. I agree the docs should say this.
Alternatively we make the passmanager take this info to mean scheduling is required. This is how e.g. coupling_map and basis_gates are used, even if you don't specify routing_method or translation_method. I think we should go with this.
Hello, I am new here, can I look into this issue?
