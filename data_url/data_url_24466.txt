In the requires list in setup.py there are two (potential) sources of errors when running python setup.py develop:
@CJvanDiepen Fix the second issue in master branch. For the first issue: after cloning you need to do python setup.py develop in the qcodes directory. Does that solve the issue?
@peendebak I did not test it but manually removed the requirement from setup.py (A)
Can you test again? We can close the issue if it works.
