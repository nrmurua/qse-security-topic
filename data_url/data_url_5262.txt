I failed to run almost every examples in this repo following the tutorial
,
and only the running of ToeplitzSimplify_constant.py is successful.
I also tried to follow these lines in .travis.yml,
but still failed to run make -j2 build_all_test.

my machine os:  ubuntu 18.04
I have the same problem in testing installation of HiQsimulator. Though the installation process is very success. But the version of HiQsimulator I installed half month ago works correctly. I just do not know why for now because there are none of new commits these days.

I think it may be caused by dependencies updates, for these dependencies in https://github.com/Huawei-HiQ/HiQsimulator/blob/master/requirements.txt are not fixed.

How about try to import hiq based packages before projectq packages? Will this help you in this bug? It does work for me.
Thanks for your suggestion.
If I import hiq based packages at the first few lines of example scripts, then this issue is fixed.
Could you provide an explanation about why it can work?
This relates to some environmental conflict problem between ProjectQ and HiQ packages. This may be fixed in our fork of ProjectQ.
