The following code works well:
Where perform_state_tomography is a wrapper function I wrote for the state tomography workflow. The result is the correct 8x8 density matrix.
I am also able to compute the 4x4 density matrix for the first two qubits by performing
However, this fails for other subsets. For instance,
Fails with the following error:
I'm not sure I understand what causes this error. I can debug it myself, but maybe you have a clear idea on why this fails.
This was due to an Aer bug fixed about a week or two ago.
