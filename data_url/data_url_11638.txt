In categorizing algorithms in the 0.7 release the intent has been to move away from the result as a plain dictionary to result objects where the fields are properties and hence documented and discoverable when coding via code complete etc.
This process commenced in 0.7 with refactoring the algorithms into categories and minimum_eigen_solvers has a defined interface and result, that is consistent over the set of those algorithms. This work needs to be completed in a similar manner for the algorithms in the other categories where it makes sense (e.g. education category is a mix and match of most text book algorithms so does not fully apply there).
TODO
This work has been ongoing in Terra - AE has been refactored Qiskit/qiskit#5517 and Grover is being done Qiskit/qiskit-terra/#5680 HHL is being completely rewritten Qiskit/qiskit#5698 Since these algorithm have been moved to Terra and the work is done/ongoing there via the referenced PRs, I am closing this here.
