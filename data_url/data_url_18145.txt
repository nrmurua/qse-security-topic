Circuits obtained by initialize cannot be combined.
Circuits generated by initialize() should behave the same with those created manually.
Circuits constructed manually can be combined with + as below:
This will create a concatenated circuit as in the image below:

The following code generates error:
Note that qc1Error and qc2Error are essentially "H" and "X H" as below:


No Idea. Here is the error message:
Seem to be a byproduct of  #409.
I found the problem, I think. It's a very simple mistake of incorrect number of arguments (as your helpful trace shows, see very last call). I made one change and I think it now works. I need to prepare a pull request. In the mean time, do you mind making the following change to line 103 (of _initializer.py, please see the last call of your trace):
def reapply(self, circ):
"""Reapply this gate to the corresponding qubits in circ."""
self._modifiers(circ.initialize(self.param, self.arg))
