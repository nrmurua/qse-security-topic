HiDPI (a.k.a retina) screens need special consideration for drawing, explained here among many other places. But Quirk seems already support some kind scale fixing on some of its canvas calls, I wonder why it doesn't support HiDPI here? Is that a platform specific issue? (as I didn't test it on a retina mac device which is more popular than all Windows browsers I tested and had the issue)
Here is Windows Chrome screenshot of Quirk on a HiDPI screen,

(open the picture in full screen and compare browser buttons with the tool)
I also went ahead a little and saw it needs more familiarity with the project in order to provide a correct fix:

Looks like the text and ellipse painting methods have had their coordinates doubled, but not the box painting ones.
The reason you're not seeing the gate labels all over the circuit is that the toolbox image is drawn and cached on its own ahead of time, and the labels fell outside the captured area.
I bet the mouse code is also all wrong if the coordinate space is twice is large.
