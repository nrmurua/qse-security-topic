Because it is a channel.
Proposal:
If a gate implements channel and measurement_key, then when simulated it will record results in measurements and outputs will be conditional on this.  If it only implements channel, then the measurement results are not recorded, and outputs will need to be at least density matrices but recording that the information was not recorded.
If a measurement is not recorded, and you are performing a density simulation, do we randomly pick one of the outcome branches (project to one of the poles) or do we keep going with a mixture of both (project to the Z axis)?
@dabacon verify if this is done
@dabacon says done
