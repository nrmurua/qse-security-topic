When calling compute_eignevalues it fails as follows
This was raised on external Slack for Qiskit https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/CB6C24TPB/p1675060749792269
The code below, that reproduces the above, is a cut down version of that as supplied in the thread there.
If the above optimizer is change to COBYLA then it runs to completion
It should work with SPSA and not raise an error
This comes about I think from this https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/06f5ac1e8d7cbf4dcd157c127911f83c1e43e6ae/qiskit/algorithms/eigensolvers/vqd.py#L275-L285 where we allow the optimizer to batch points where it can. SPSA will do this for calibration (and for each gradient step later). Disabling the code which does that setting (ie forcing it to do things one at a time) allows it to work.
FYI setting max_evals_grouped on the optimizer, as below, in the above code fails too (though not quite the same way) - by default max_evals_grouped is 1 but setting it higher allows points to be batched (grouped) together which it will do when using its internal default finite diff gradient.
I think I have identified the cause of this issue. VQD is missing some parameter batching functionality. I will follow up with a bugfix PR as soon as I find the bandwidth.
