Blocks #4208.
To deprecate circuit.combine/extend we need to add another way to "stack" circuits -- which is not possible with compose. This functionality exists as tensor in the quantum info module, so this could be added to the circuit.
Considering two circuits:
Extend/combine (or +=) act as
To be consistent with the qubit ordering, this would look like this with tensor
The signature should be as similar to compose as possible, e.g.
For circuits with the same registers, what is the desired behavior?
For example, this will be the case if the circuits are initialized like
or after adding measurements like
I can see three possibilities
In the case of anonymous registers like you described above I think it should be possible to tensor circuits together. However it's true that after calling measure_all the classical registers have the same name 'meas' and that could be a problem.
I think this method should not care about registers (as we should move towards registerless circuits) and just rename or resize the registers if the name is the same. @kdk this would probably be a use case of resizing ðŸ˜‰
