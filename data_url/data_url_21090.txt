When trying to get details of a transaction through the PublicAPI grpc service, it throws 'Invalid Address'.
My node gets the following in debug logs:
JS Client gets this:
Test transaction hash: bade7769d112ea6d0cf5aabc9499383e9e024b0451ae80445657831a331508b8
See qrl-wallet issue for more info: theQRL/qrl-wallet#49
This should have been fixed in #554
