The following circuit has two angle parameters s and t, and it fails in the estimator with:
ERROR: Failed to load circuits: Invalid parameterization: instruction param position out of range
But it works when the parameters are removed and replaced with concrete angles.
This may be related to how the instructions and parameters of the circuit are parsed with Aer. In terra this should be trivial to bind a circuit with a list of parameters so I'm not sure why it fails in Aer / if it's trying to do something custom?
