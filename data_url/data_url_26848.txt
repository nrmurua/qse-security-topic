When using the toolchain script to create arch files and activating the --enable-cuda option, the generated arch file does not contain any optimisation flags for CUDA (see  NVFLAGS variable).
We should probably add -O2 (maybe even fast-math?) at least in the ?smp versions.
For completion: DBCSR passes -O3, but no fast-math to nvcc.
We don't support fast math anymore. -O3 is fine.
