Output:
stimcirq.cirq_circuit_to_stim_circuit fails converting 2 qubit
Could you provide the code that caused this exception? In my testing it seems to work:
The issue is the other direction.
Prints the cirq circuit, like so,
but then gives the error above
A note on this. Should be a relatively easy fix. cirq.AsymmetricDepolarizingChannel objects have an attribute, "error_probabilities", which returns a dictionary with their associated error probabilities. (e.g. {'I': 0.94, 'X': 0.01, 'Y': 0.02, 'Z': 0.03} or {'II': 0.8836, 'IX': 0.0094, 'IY': 0.0188, 'IZ': 0.0282, 'XI': 0.0094, 'XX': 0.0001, 'XY': 0.0002, 'XZ': 0.0003, 'YI': 0.0188, 'YX': 0.0002, 'YY': 0.0004, 'YZ': 0.0006, 'ZI': 0.0282, 'ZX': 0.0003, 'ZY': 0.0006, 'ZZ': 0.0009}).  So, to convert from a cirq.AsymmetricDepolarizingChannel object to a stimcirq._two_qubit_asymmetric_depolarize.TwoQubitAsymmetricDepolarizingChannel object, all you need to do is
I'm not familiar enough with this codebase to locate where this change should be made, but if you can find where this "ValueError: num_qubits should be 1" error is popping up, you can make the above simple change to draw the error probabilities directly from the cirq.AsymmetricDepolarizingChannel then feed them into whatever function generates the appropriate stim Pauli Channel.
