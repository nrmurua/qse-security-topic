After #2808, the visualizations represent fractions of pi very nicely.
However, there are some corner cases missing. Like this one:
The last example should look like this:
There is a separate but related behaviour here where the check on line 68 doesn't work correctly.
In your example above x = 3.141592653589793 is just below pi, and therefore (x / pi) % 1 = 0.9999....
0.99... is obviously greater than eps, so this doesn't get recognised as 1 * pi.
The logic is correct in the following lines, so it is then recognised as a fraction of pi and is printed as pi/1.
