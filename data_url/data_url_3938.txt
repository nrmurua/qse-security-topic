On the mapper branch (at least),
After making changes to .cc files in the /tests  folder (in my case the test_mapper.cc file), Lemon is always getting recompiled. (I'm not making any changes to any files except test_mapper.cc)
This is making development a bit cumbersome, as after every time I make a change to one of the test files, a 2min compilation awaits.
Here's a the terminal output I get:
@Astlaan one simple thing which you can readily do is to generate the openql module once and then test your changes in python, which will not need recompilation.
