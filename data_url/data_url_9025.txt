I noticed that while there's a sample_write method to write samples of detection events to file, I can't find a method to read these file formats using the Python API (unless it's there and I can't find it). The same is true of the measurement sampler sample_write method. It would be convenient to have a sample_read method or equivalent to read these file formats.
You're picturing a method that takes a file, a format, an expected number of bits per shot, and returns a 2d optionally-bit-packed numpy array?
Yes pretty much, I think it would need to take both the number of detectors and the number of observables, rather than just bits per shot? It's easy enough for the user to write their own parser (e.g. for the dets format at least, I haven't played around with the others yet), but it might be handy if this was already available in the API for all the formats.
This was implemented in #242 . There are now methods stim.read_shot_data_file and stim.write_shot_data_file. Will be in the 1.9 release (and already in the published 1.9dev versions)
Great, thanks!
