Find that ARTIQ does not automatically generate an empty dataset_db.pyon if dataset_db.pyon is missing. Auto generation is better default behavior vs throwing exception. Same goes for artiq_gui.pyon and device_db.pyon.
artiq_gui.pyon might better be called gui_db.pyon to match new naming scheme.
Ok for dataset_db.
I do not see the point of having an empty device_db.pyon. How would you use ARTIQ with no devices?
Note that this file is read-only for the master, e.g. the way to add new devices is to modify this file and trigger a rescan.
The GUI already creates artiq_gui.pyon when it is not present.
For both debugging and to eliminate accumulated dead datasets, it's
convenient to simply delete dataset_db.pyon and fire up ARTIQ again.
Thank you for making this change.
