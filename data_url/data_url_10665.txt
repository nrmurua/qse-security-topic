Due to a bug in dwave.cloud.solver.StructuredSolver.sample_bqm, and DWaveSampler using this method since 0.9.2, sampling QUBO BQMs returns a sampleset of type dimod.SPIN/Ising instead of dimod.BINARY.
The input problem is converted to Ising before sampling on the QPU, but the result is not converted back to the QUBO domain.
