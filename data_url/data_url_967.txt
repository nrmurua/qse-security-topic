@dstrain115 : what's the plan with all the methods on Engine that aren't in AbstractEngine? I think we should deprecate them and/or modify them to delegate to EngineProcessor methods.
I am not sure about this.  There's a bunch of non-standard features, like sending to multiple processors or sending programs without jobs, etc that I am reluctant to get rid of.  On the other hand, it's not great to have a bunch of methods that are not in the abstract interface.
Bringing in @wcourtney to weigh in.
@wcourtney what do you think?

2Â¢: As I understand it, both of these features are confusing to users. IMO, it's a user win to clean up these legacy features even if it's a bit of work to bring them back. If that happens, I expect that we'll have new requirements for the features and a new model and if there was churn in the meantime, we can skip all intermediate the migration work :-).
