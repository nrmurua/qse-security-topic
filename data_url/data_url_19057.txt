Describe the bug
Simulated_Calibration Notebook and Docs are outdated and throw errors when attempting to execute
To Reproduce
jupyter nbconvert --to=notebook --in-place --execute examples/Simulated_calibration.ipynb
Additional context
We should add a test to ensure all notebooks are running since they often get missed when breaking changes are introduced in the code.
