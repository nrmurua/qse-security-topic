Scanning the entire output data filesystem does not scale. There are usually millions of files there (I checked).
If run-ids do not need to be sortable, they don't need to be monotonically increasing and they could be uuids. But sortability is nice for browsing the filesystem, so let's keep it.
Can't we just put the last/current run id into e.g. the dataset db?

I would use a dedicated file for that and rewrite it at each RID assignment.
You will want to keep the current code to a) reconstruct that pointer file in case it gets lost and b) tarnsition old repos.
