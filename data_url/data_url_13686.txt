The motivation is from the VQE H2 example notebook where the executor had to be defined within nested loops:

I propose we change the signature of mitiq.execute_with_zne to:
or allow for *args or **kwargs to be passed to the executor. My preference is for the latter but we have used something like executor_args in other places before.
Thoughts @andreamari @willzeng @nathanshammah? I can make this change once we all agree on a strategy.
I agree. I don't know what is the optimal way of doing this.
It would also be very handy if the function mitigate_executor could return a new executor which has the same signature of the unmitigated one. Maybe this trick could help but, also in this case, I am not sure what is the proper way of doing it.
For the second point I think the best way is using args and kwargs again. I'll open a PR with these changes and we can discuss more.
