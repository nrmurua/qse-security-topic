Using artiq 3.0 on windows, when disabling an applet on the gui, it closed but generated this error in the log,
This happened with the big_number app and also the custom_applet.py example. Enabling and disabling the app generates this error most of the time, and can even lead to the dashboard crashing with this error message,
In addition, it seems the disable_applet command from the ccb doesn't seem to be working. Running the example code ,https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/examples/master/repository/code_applet.py, should close the applet at the end and uncheck the box on the dashboard right? Neither of those things seem to happen. Maybe that's a separate, unrelated issue.
disable_applet does work correctly here. Did you modify the ARTIQ code at all to try to fix #629? Have you tried on Linux?
And is the first problem also on 2.0?
I didn't modify the code to try and fix the other issue. I'll try and fix it on linux. This problem has been on 2.0 but I didn't look into it in detail because I thought it was maybe from the custom applets we have, and aside from producing an error message on the log doesn't really do anything terrible.
Happens on 2.0 as well
Enabling and disabling big number applet.

I tried on the virtual machine as well and it doesn't seem to disable either. The applet runs and I can see the countdown from 9 to 0 but then it just stays at 0 and the applet is still enabled. I'm using the exact some code as you have in the examples as far as I can tell.
@r-srinivas @sbourdeauducq re-visit (for new Qt)?
Does this still occur?
