During EOM mode, though the Rabi frequency and the detuning_on are chosen by the user, the detuning_off is not, and there should be an easy way to find out what the chosen value was, which can then be used to correct for incurred phase changes with a phase shift, for example.
The way to implement this is straightforward for a non-parametrized sequence (simply access the chosen value and return it), but what if the sequence is parametrized? There are two scenarios here:
Built-in phase correction
The usecase I currently have in mind could also be incorporated in add_eom_pulse() and it would be available under any scenario. I'm thinking we could call it correct_phase: bool = False. At build-time, it would have all the information it needs for the correction.
