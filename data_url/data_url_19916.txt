needs urgent help don't know what to de new to PQC
As the warning states, you are using the developer version of liboqs (0.10.0-dev), which is too new for the python bindings (0.9.0). This is just a warning though, so it shouldn't cause any issues? Are you experiencing any issues other than the warning?
If you want the warning to go away, then you need to use liboqs 0.9.0.
