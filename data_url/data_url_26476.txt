==================== generating arch files ====================
arch files can be found in the /media/hxz/Mdel/gmx/cp2k_qm/cp2k-2022.2/tools/toolchain/install/arch subdirectory
ERROR: (./scripts/generate_arch_files.sh) Cannot find nvcc, please check if the package cuda is installed or in system search path
ERROR: (./scripts/generate_arch_files.sh, line 125) Non-zero exit code detected.
I am running install_cp2k.sh, however issues have occured to me all the time. I would be grateful if someone can answer to me.
I pretty sure my environment variable is fine since I have encounted it in a CMake ERROR form when sirius installing.
Thanks I' ve  solved this. You just need to put the specific path of nvcc into the owner's bashrc and source.
