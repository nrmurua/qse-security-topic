I'm running a DFT based QM/MM job with PBE functional. This is a newly compiled version so it may be a compile time problem. Initially I compiled with other external libraries like libint and libxsmm, etc. Then this problem can be repeated even if I only use the bare minimum--compiled only with MKL 2018.2 and PLUMED. CP2K is version 9.1 cloned from the git.
Calling stack:
And GDB shows neither pw1%cc and pw2%cc is associated
It looks to me that in pw/pw_type.F, after ALLOCATE(pw), it was not kept by the compiler but destroyed? Here's additional debug information I had.
In line 168 the object is still existing but in line 180 it is again not associated.
Sorry for the late reply. Have you tried to run the regtests (make -j ARCH=... VERSION=... test ) ? From the code (second post), I do not see any reason how pw should lose its association state between the given lines. How do you compile the code? Can you try a later version (2022.1) ?
Maybe it is a problem of stacksizes?
Thank you @alazzaro !  It is indeed a stack size problem. Running ulimit -s <a_bigger_size> helps.
