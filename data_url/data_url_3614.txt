I was using pyquil and it was working, but now it always gives me the error:
As far as i know I haven't changed anything from when it was working, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times but still get the same error
@Fagin-H  Hey, did you ever solve this?
This usually indicates the wrong version of the antlr4 runtime (a package we depend on) is installed since they have separate pip install packages for python 2 vs 3. We have conda packages now which is a nice workaround
@vtomole I did in the end but still not sure exactly what caused it. It seems when I installed grove it broke the rest of the install. I made a virtual environment and installed pyquil in that with conda, but it wouldn't work with spyder, so I had to change the Python interpreter in settings to the new virtual environment one as it didn't automatically change.
@Fagin-H  Glad you got it sorted out. Even though it was painful.
@mpharrigan  I think we can close this issue.
