MPS simulation method is already functional, but several features have not been implemented yet. I am creating this issue to keep track of what features still need to be completed:
 Support for all types of noise
 Reset
 Initialize from MPS
 Partial initialization
 Gates on more than 2 qubits, e.g., ccx
 Fix FP warnings in SVD
 Support approximation
Made a preliminary version of approximation, with no external interface yet.
 Snapshot_probabilities on a unordered subset of the qubits
 Fix all tests in unittest that are still failing
Related issues include #370, #371, #372
We implemented a new algorithm in MPS for computing the expectation value on many qubits. In the previous implementation, we computed the expectation value by taking the trace of the density matrix. Therefore the number of qubits was limited to 24, and performance was worse than that of the state vector.
In the new implementation, we compute the expectation value by contracting the mps, therefore it is much more efficient. We demonstrate with 2 graphs. In both graphs, we compute the expectation value on all qubits. The first graph compares performance to the statevector simulation method, and goes up to 28 qubits. The second graph runs on mps simulation method only, and goes up to 500 qubits. Note that the performance of the computation on mps is highly variable, depending on the level of entanglement in the circuit.


@merav-aharoni long time with no activity here. Shall we close this issue?
@juan, I believe the only item not implemented is Kraus noise on MPS. We can open a separate issue for this purpose. Do you see anything else still missing?
@atilag , sorry, sent this to the wrong juan.
Closing since this is basically done now. The only missing part is the save/set state functions using MPS structure. We should open a separate issue for these though.
