There's code duplication all over the place. For example, functions to read different formats of circuit files have large overlaps.
There also appear to be a number of variables which are unused. Some of these are due to code being copied and changed.
PR #24 addresses some of this; I'll follow up with generic behavior for contraction ordering next.
This is resolved as of PR #34
