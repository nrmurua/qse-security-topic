As part of Qiskit/RFCs#41, we are planning to migrate qiskit-tutorials content to qiskit-terra. This issue assess the current status of the tutorials content and recommend actions. This is a draft. This list will be reformatted and linked with existing issues.
The content in this section is pretty good. I recommend making the introduction notebook a full fledge tutorial with more hand holding and background information and convert all the other tutorials into how-to guides.
As stated in Qiskit/qiskit#10666
I wonder with this one
vqe_simulation_with_noise: can be moved to Aer. We can link to it from algorithms_introduction tutorial.
When it was based on QuantumInstance it use to show not only adding a noise model but also QI's noise mitigation. The latter is something only the Runtime does at present. There is an issue around adding some sort of mitigation there so you could experiment a bit further with local simulator before moving to the runtime.
Now in regards of algorithms and running on different backends it comes up all the time as primitives are still new. A tutorial/howto in this regard might involve primitives from different providers - switching backends is again more related to runtime but the connection to switching primitives often needs to be explained. I mention this since sometimes I refer to that Aer tutorial as its using a different primitive (other than qiskit.primitives one) with VQE.
An update on the status of the algorithm tutorials to make sure we are all on the same page, the move to qiskit-algorithms is happening in this PR, and following the list above with 2 main differences:
Now that the tutorials are almost done being moved, I'm closing this in favor of Qiskit/qiskit#10680.
