The gates Xgate, Zgate and Fourier do not call the displacement gate and the rotation gate; instead they go directly to the backend. Ideally they should be replaced by Dgates and Rgates with the appropriate parameters.
By not calling the backend directly but instead being replaced by the "canonical" gates with the special values a number of circuit checks can be simplified when calling Xgate, Zgate and Fourier
Thanks @nquesada for picking this up. This is a small fix that would lead to big improvements. By treating these gates as decompositions, we have more flexibility within circuit compilation.
