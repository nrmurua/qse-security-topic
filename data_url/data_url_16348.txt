When you create a QuantumCircuit from a qasm string including composited gates,
the circuit is correctly created. But if you get qasm from the already created circuit
the composited gates params are not present, so the qasm is incorrect. Any attempt of creating a new quantum circuit from this qasm will fail:
The qasm of the created quantum circuit should include the params of the composited gate.
Take into account Instruction params when creating qasm in qc.qasm().
