Windows consoles do not support ANSI color codes and they just clutter the output. Disabling diagnostic colors on Windows is an acceptable solution.
Yes. Or pull in colorama.
NB: The problem happens when running unittests that happen to print compiler diagnostics, and I guess artiq_compile and artiq_run are also affected.
