when IBMQ is closed for a longer time and reopens it lags and sometimes dose not even open the page to code. Have to wait and close all threads to IBMQ and then restart the process again so would like to see it fixed
Some times refreshing the space also dose not work and it just shows white screen and it mostly happens on challenge days badly.
even sometimes it works in normal server work on program works just refreshing it but 80% it dose not work
If gets server time out for no activity after few min it shall get connected immediately after refreshing or clicking the pop up window stating "got disconnected".
It is a server end problem and really needs to be solved from cloud access.
would love to see it fixed
So I am not sure if I follow correctly, but this seems to be the same issue that I have seen.  Namely if you submit at job (then grab it) and then put some length of time in between your next submission, seems to be on the order of minutes, then try to execute a job again you get this:
IBMQBackendApiError: 'Error submitting job: "('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(104, 'Connection reset by peer'))"'
However immediately trying to run the job again results in successful submission.  @SarthakCh is this what you are seeing?
