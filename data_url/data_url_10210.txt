At bare minimum, include a site local directory, e.g. virtual environment's data directory.
Additionally, support a list of search paths in DWAVE_CONFIG_FILE environment variable, and/or config_file kwarg.
Optionally, implement another system-wide mechanism to extend the search list. Unknown which, atm. Maybe iterative include starting with the first default config file?
