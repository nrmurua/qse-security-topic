Can import and use libraries and commands associated to Windows-only renderers. Implementation of the renderer may use libraries that are windows-only, thus causing ModuleImportErrors
design = designs.DesignPlanar() appears to import the renderers already, thus causing said errors.
Renderers that are written in and for Windows (or other OSs) should only be available/reachable for those OSes they are compatible with.
use the following where most appropriate:
from platform import system
if system() is 'Windows':
Currently I have moved the import pythoncom into the individual methods that need it, but that should not be the case because some of those methods are time-critical.
Even better: keeping as much of those renderers out of memory as possible would be ideal. For example, why to allow users to run fourq_hfss = design.renderers.hfss if they are not on Windows machines?
