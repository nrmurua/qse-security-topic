The partial trace used to calculate the reduced density matrix for the entanglement entropy callback is implemented using tf.tensordot. This takes a lot of time and memory, which may be improved using a custom operator.
Similarly it might be possible to find improvements on the matrix diagonalization algorithm used to calculate the entropy.
