@mikeumus I'm fairly new to quantum computing but would like to contribute where I can. This seems like a good place to start. Can I work on this issue?
Hi @Claeb101, glad you're interested. However, I'm just an observer of the Qiskit repo.
You can reference the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
@camitava0321, any advice for Claeb101 for starting out on this ticket?
Oh I'm so sorry. I wasn't quite sure who to ask if I could contribute. I will ask @camitava0321 in the future. I take it I'm allowed to work right away on any issues then instead of asking every time?
@Claeb101 yeah I'm sure if your PRs match the requirements in CONTRIBUTING.md that they'd be welcome. 😃👍
@camitava0321 , if x->(1-z)/2, then (1-x)->(1+z)/2 . I think the equation seems correct as there is /4 in the denominator. However the latex code needs to be looked into. @Claeb101  Are you still working on this, if not I would like to.
@shil-m Sure, you can work on this!
Hi, thanks for your interest and apologies for the slow response! the code referred to in this issue belongs to qiskit-optimization: https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-optimization. We are now focusing on archiving this repository and moving its contents to the relevant projects. If you think this issue persists, I encourage you to open the issue directly in qiskit-optimization.
Thanks anyway for your feedback and helping us make Qiskit better! 🚀
