There is an example of this in #72
Strangely the github actions CI is not behaving as expected. The failing tests here are failing because of the flake8 problem on master (see #76 ) not because of code on this branch.
The tests that pass are just testing this branch, which does pass.
It isn't clear to me why the pull_request trigger is testing the master branch.
Any ideas?
I think we sorted out this difference and maybe we can close this issue if it's fine.
One thing I'd like to point out is that, with PR #123 (closing issue #121), which adds Mac and Windows build in CI, we have added cloud minutes that are counted in for billing purposes. So far so good, but maybe this is something to keep an eye on.

There's been recently (April 14th) an announcement on free features for teams that I haven't understood if impacts us at all, as the organization has a billed account.
Getting back to that discussion on features to provide to UF microgrants recipients, including stuff such as GH Pro profiles, and the possibility to contact GH directly, I found out this:
https://github.com/nonprofit
I think we could definitely apply â€“ and see if we can save the GH org fee for UF, to begin with.
