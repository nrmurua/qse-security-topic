Users should not pass backend_options anymore to transpile and execute. Instead, they should set the options data member of the backend object, before the call. See details in #1009. Examples and explanations in all types of documents need to be fixed accordingly.
What are the relevant documents, and where do they reside?
Yes the tutorials need a good update. I wouldn't say removing run/execute use of backend options is a blanket change, but is most important for simulation method and noise model. Quickly looking over tutorials I think the main changes needed are:
Text should be updated to say that QasmSimualtor.from_backend uses the configuration of the backend (including coupling map, number of qubits, and basis gates). The second way only updates basis gates for the noise model, not coupling map or qubit number.
Which tutorials have you looked at, what are their repository these days?
Regarding (2), what does the simulator do with the information about number of qubits and coupling map?
@chriseclectic In Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#1074 everything is ready except for device noise model. To progress here, I'd like to understand what the simulator does with the number of qubits and coupling map (looking at the code, at least the coupling map does not seem to be used). In addition, I suggest not to show two options as in your comment, but only the option of device_simulator = QasmSimulator.from_backend(device_backend); and consequently, now that there is a single option, omit the explanation about the second option and the difference between the options.
Done
