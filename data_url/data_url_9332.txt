If one turns up the total time to be like 10, then the MIS probability is bigger than 1. Not sure it's precision problem or not.
https://github.com/Happy-Diode/Bloqade.jl/blob/37a4a1775e79bed92023d37e96a290ca0f18b196/examples/weighted-mis/main.jl#L118
It seems to be a numerics problem; for the unweighted problem, independent_set_probabilities also gives MIS probability > 1 at large times.
I am also experiencing this issue, in my case running a simulation with Omega=0.5 and T_end = 4pi gives a state with sum of probabilities being 8.25. I'm not sure if it's the same issue as with MIS probability, but looks so. Should I just increase Omega and reduce time accordingly? Maybe Bloqade should raise an error if it sees this kind of error?
For reference, my minimal reproducible examlpe:
