Hi, when I run the excecutable named demo, the following errors occur:illegal instruction (core dumped). Does anyone know the reason? If it is because the version of cpu, what is the minimum version of cpu required by Quest ? Thanks!
Hi Amanda,
This may relate to issue #259, caused by a default compile flag for AVX, which may be a facility that your CPU doesn't support.
If that's the case, you can merely disable the flag. Just remove line 205 of QuEST/CMakeLists.txt
What CPU are you using by the way? This might help me better understand the issue.
Thanks,
Tyson
Hi Tyson! Thanks for your reply! The CPU I use is Intel Celeron(R) CPU J1900. Thanks again!
Ah yep, indeed that has no AVX support. Glad to help!
