Hi, I tried to use the noise_model = noise.device.basic_device_noise_model(device.properties()) to simulate noise on real device. However, it returns the following error message:
"NoiseError: 'Depolarizing probability must be in between 0 and 1.'"
I am using properties from backend 'ibmq_20_tokyo'
This will be fixed by #243
Closing this since there is already an issue to track this bug in #241
