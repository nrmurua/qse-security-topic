Badges tell some features of a project, such as code coverage, build status, downloads.
A comprehensive list of badges can be generated on shields.io.
Not any badge that can be generated is interesting to be displayed, but some badges might be cool and informative.
Anaconda provides some of them at https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qutip/badges.
Recently the conda-forge download counter was added to Readme.md:  .
It could be interesting to add meaningful badges from shields.io. On https://github.com/badges/shields it is even possible to generate new badges (one could eventually think of badges providing information about the integration with the quantum-tech ecosystem).
Some examples I found interesting:
PyPI - Downloads (monthly) 
GitHub code size 
PyPI - Python Version 
Code Climate maintainability 
Conda platform support 
GitHub contributors 
PyPI status 
Closed Pull Requests 
Already on Readme.md:
Travis status 
Coveralls github 
I put some more download and versioning badges into the README in #1511.  If you're happy Nathan (@nathanshammah) we can close this issue now?
