Hello,
I am trying to build openfermion on openSUSE Tumbleweed.
I encounter an error on AssertionError when running test, could I have been missing dependencies package?
Here are the package I included as dependencies:
Python 3.8
networkx
numpy >= 1.11.0
nbformat
PubChemPy
requests
scipy >= 1.1.0
pytest
Full log here: https://build.opensuse.org/build/home:andythe_great/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/x86_64/python-openfermion/_log
Thanks
The newest commit addresses the strictness of the Prony's method test.
