Describe the bug
test_fileio is failing on Windows because this use of tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile doesn't work on windows. The temporary files cannot be opened twice on Windows according to https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile.

To Reproduce
Run test_fileio.py on windows.

Do you have any idea on a replacement @jakelishman ?
Ugh, Windows sucks soooo much.  Is that the only test that fails because of it?
Yeah, the fileio test is the only one. tempfile is also only used there (sofar).
Hopefully #1312 should fix it, then.
