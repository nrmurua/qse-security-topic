The circuit cache fails when setting optimization_level to None or 1, 2, 3 (since Terra changes None to 1 internally.)
In test_caching.py, change the optimization_level to None
Pass the tests
It seems to work if optimization_level=0 but it conflicts the default value of QuantumInstance.
Thus, either we fix the circuit cache with transpiler or it is limited to be used under optimization_level=0
Hi - I can't reproduce this. Did something change?
I've tried increasing the optimization_level and setting to None in both test_caching and test_vqc, and tried explicitly turning caching on to the most aggressive settings, but don't see any failure.
Do you use the newest terra? I change self.optimization_level = 1, following tests fail:
