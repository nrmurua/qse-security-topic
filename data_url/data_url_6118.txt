A Hadamard gate applied to |0> would create even superposition of |0> and |1>. It can be visualised as following circuit.

If I simulate this circuit using aer backend for 1024 shots I find measurements of 0 and 1 are not evenly distributed.

Briefly,
Please consult this public gist repository for a complete example that reproduces the issue.
As no noise or decoherence has been simulated, the expected behaviour would be to have exactly the same number of counts for both possible outcomes.

If you go through the code in the linked above public gist repository you will see I tried several things to ensure no noise is simulated, I set the NoiseModel option to None, I also tried to build my own NoiseModel such that it ensures no readout errors are simulated (which I tested with built-in method is_ideal()).
I cannot suggest a solution until I understand this behaviour. Here are some of my thoughts:
Thanks a lot in advance for taking your time to help me understand it better. Cheers!
Measurements are random samples of the probability distribution that is 50/50.  You should not expect to get exactly 50/50, just like you should not expect that when flipping a coin a finite number of times.
QuTiP is doing a statevector simulation and computing expectation values.  Expectation values are what you would get having performed the experiment infinity many times.
@nonhermitian now it makes sense! Thank you for such quick response immediately after I opened the issue!
