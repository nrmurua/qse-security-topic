Thanks!
Now that I think about it, this might be due to having an old version of SBCL.
@notmgsk oh yeah,
Just confirmed that this change is still necessary with sbcl --version = SBCL 2.2.8.124-ba95d2ff0, the current development version.

I regret to say I've also seen this (second) error and failed to file a report about it.
I hit this TYPE-ERROR as well, but using SBCL 2.0.9 fixed for me, but sounds like @stylewarning upstreamed a fix to SBCL that should be released towards the end of the month: https://discord.com/channels/842124688002908231/842124688494428233/1025320591491866685
