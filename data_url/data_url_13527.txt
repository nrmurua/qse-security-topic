In PEC we need to convert operations defined in Qiskit or PyQuil to Cirq and viceversa.
However this can create ambiguities: for example operations acting on different Cirq qubits can be mapped to
the operations acting on the same qiskit qubit (and probably viceversa).
OUTPUT:
In the example above two Cirq operations acting on different qubits are mapped to the same qiskit object.
I see two possible options but I am not sure:
This is good to note (see also here) but I'm not convinced this is a bug or is blocking. The intended workflow is
Here you have a conversion between steps 1 and 2. (Why is this?) I don't imagine a user ever doing this.
I would replace this with
then use the reps. Or am I missing the point?
If we wanted to modify conversions at all, I guess the easiest thing is add an optional argument to conversions.to_qiskit which specifies the qiskit.QuantumRegister of the returned circuit. I think qiskit.QuantumRegisters are uniquely specified by their "name" attribute, so we would do something like
Then with your example:
Discussed in Community Call: Upstream this issue to Circ and Qiskit
Discussed in Community Call: Upstream this issue to Circ and Qiskit
(Conversions are in Cirq, not Qiskit.) I think its best if we handle it here, then optionally open a PR to Cirq if its useful beyond this context.
