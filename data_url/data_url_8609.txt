The version of qutip in the macports repository is outdated (2.2.0), which is unfortunate especially since it is still included in the documentation as an "official" installation path (http://qutip.org/docs/3.0.1/installation.html#installation-on-mac-os-x-10-6).
I saw that a patch to 3.0.1 was submitted to MacPorts a while ago (https://trac.macports.org/ticket/44555), but apparently there were some errors and then nothing further happened. It would be great if this could be updated.
It seems the problem was with the blas_opt['extra_compile_args'] call in the setup.py for the Fortran solver.  This is an odd error given that is works perfectly well on the mac:
The problem is indeed the use of blas_opt['extra_compile_args']which works well on my mac too, but for some reason that I couldn't get to the bottom with, it does not work on the macports build environment. Perhaps the numpy dependency is not properly specified in the ports file, or something similar.
I agree with the OP that it would be highly desirable to get this working, but right now i don't have the time work on trying to fix it. Unless it this get fixed somehow, we should probably revise the recommended installation instructions to use macports+pip or homebrew+pip instead.
I vote for macports+pip or building qutip manually (this is what I use) .   Even if we get macports up and running,  the port will always be behind everything else as it needs to get reviewed before the update is uploaded. The new homebrew scripts are also convenient.
One can also think about moving the fortran solver to its own installer as a qutip add-on.  With the recent performance gains of the Python based solver, this change is not so bad in my opinion.
It looks like we are going to just go with installing dependencies with macports and do a pip install for qutip itself from here on out.  This is already the procedure listed in the 3.1 docs.  Therefore, I am going to close this issue if there are no other thoughts on the matter.
Fine with me. Since we don't have any control over the qutip macport and we didn't create it in the first place I think we better focus on the pypi/pip method.
