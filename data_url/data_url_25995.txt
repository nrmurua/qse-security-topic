Write function that takes in OpenQASM 3 string as argument and returns the int number of qubits in the circuit.
Similar to qasm_num_qubits() but for qasm3 instead of qasm2. (Right now the linked function already works for some qasm3 strings. But there are multiple ways to define qubits using qasm3, so we want to write another, separate function that accounts for all of the possible cases.)
Hi @ryanhill1 , can I take a look at this issue?
@TheGupta2012 Yep go for it! Should be a quick one
