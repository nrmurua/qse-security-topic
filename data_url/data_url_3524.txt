In the "Installation and Getting Started" section, which was updated 22 days ago, we state that "pyQuil requires Python 3.6 or later," while the Changelog section "Supported Versions of Python", updated 5 months ago, states
We strongly support using Python 3 with Pyquil. Although this release works with Python 2,
we are dropping official support for this legacy language and moving to community support for
Python 2. The next major release of Pyquil will introduce Python 3.5+ only features and will
no longer work without modification for Python 2.
We should update the minimum Python version here and remove
...this release works with Python 2...
since that is no longer true.
the changelog for 1.9 will be kept for historical reasons. we should fill out the v2 section
this was done in #643
