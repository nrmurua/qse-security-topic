This code transpiles a simple circuit and I look at the callback to get the list of passes run.
However I see that SabreSwap is not run here at all.
If I change layout_method='dense' then SabreSwap is run.
If I change routing_method='basic' then BasicSwap is run.
So I'm confused why sabre routing and layout together are not working, unless it's somehow skipping the SabreSwap. But swap insertion is actually done here.
code above
run SabreSwap
No response
This is because there's a fast-path in the Rust implementations of SabreLayout so it never re-enters Python space if if the inner pass is SabreSwap. It is running the Sabre routing algorithm internally.
ok thanks I'll close this but i think it makes it harder to debug if we can't rely on the callback. I get the performance benefits.
