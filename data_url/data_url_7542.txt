 block(blk) should have deprecation warning.
 put the deprecation plan of DefaultRegister, MatrixBlock in to release note, alias DefaultRegister to ArrayReg, MatrixBlock to AbstractBlock.
 This behavior is not consistent.
 addtimeevolve interface
 depwarn collect
 depwarn join
 Fix following operations
Notice:
And some native code should also be fixed, AdjointReg and ArrayReg should not be compared
Remove this line.
And this one is wrong for AdjointReg.
When changing/adding new features. Please submit pull request, so that I can review these changes to prevent these naive codes.  To find this error, I spent a lot of time, so please add more tests. Especially for AdjointReg, untested features should be removed immediately.
dispatch! is a bug I found the other day, it should be fixed once I tag each component package.
@GiggleLiu
it is not good to bind a function to an attribute
This is exactly what block was, we don't encourage people to use dot to get properties here in general since v0.6.
