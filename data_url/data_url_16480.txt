The MSBasisDecomposer pass and ms_basis_swap check in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/41cf87c/qiskit/compiler/transpile.py#L290 were introduced as workarounds to support transpiling to devices with other basis gates. This is now supported directly by the transpiler, so these can be removed. The MSBasisDecomposer pass should be deprecated with a note re-directing to the BasisTranslator. ms_basis_swap can be removed directly.
I can take this one.
