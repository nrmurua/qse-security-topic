Hello,
I'm currently trying to compile the latest version of CP2K (2022.1) with the intel compiler. I used make -j 4 ARCH=Linux-intel-x86_64 VERSION=popt. I'm using the intel compiler (version 2021.4.0, if that matters).
However, I get a long list of errors, starting by
and continuing with many Name in only-list does not exist or is not accessible. and This is not a component name that is defined in the encompassing structure.. Full log is available here. There seems to be something missing somewhere, but I don't know what. It might be related to Intel compiler, thought.
Note that got the same error while using v9.1.
Ok, nevermind.
The isssue is due to me creating a XXXX.popt file in /arch to set up the environement, which is not read by the Makefile (complaining about popt being equivalent to psmp) which switch to the XXX.psmp file,... Not containing the correct includes. Maybe you could upgrade the INSTALL.md.
