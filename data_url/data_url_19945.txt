While implementing open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider#157 it became obvious (due to no difference in version IDs) that #1420 did not update the version name/ID for the new code version. This is somewhat confusing when listing old and new OIDs: See https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/mb-algdocs/oqs-template/oqs-sig-info.md : All Sphincs+ algorithms are listed under the same moniker/version string.
As the Sphincs algorithm naming got a complete revamp with #1467, it is no real problem, but this issue is to ask whether it is intentional that there is no (different) version name between the previous Sphincs code base and the current one.
You're right, I see that the spec-version line in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/1420/files#diff-cfe013791f73d0afd5867c1e07d9d2e33112f0e04dae3d989fdd67a98234a19fR26 was not updated. I've fixed this is #1475, does that address the downstream issue?
