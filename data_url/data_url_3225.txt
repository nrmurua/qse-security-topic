When writing complex algorithms and proposals a typical workflow looks like this:
The current API to add advanced noise models to a program do not foster a single transition from step 1 to 2. The reason is as follows:
The QVMConnection does either take in simple X, Y, Z errors after 1Q operations and simple measurement noise, or you have to write a full Device specification which currently is non-trivial as there is no supporting functionality. Moreover, it does not allow to specify noise on gates that are not native to the underlying QPU gateset, e.g. I cannot specify the fidelity for a CNOT gate.
The more usable API to add advanced noise into my programs interleaves with the construction of a pyquil Program and hence forces the developer to re-write large chunks of the code developed in step 1, marking a disruption in the development workflow. On top of that the construction is fairly verbose and debugging it is complicated as the noise specifications happen in various different places, instead of a central location.
