Another approach would be to have the samplers that require structured children to look down the child-tree.
Structure propagation makes more sense to me. That way inconsistencies will be detected earlier (on composition). With the DFS approach from #488, parent structure is ill-defined.
Inheritance has several issues:
I agree dfs does not cover all cases.
Yes, before clarifying how inheritance should work here, it would be useful to think about composites with multiple children. What would be a good example of such a composite?
I think dwave-hybrid has covered the cases where we would want multiple children, but the original vision for composites included analogues to some hybrid components, for instance RacingSamplers(sampler0, sampler1).
