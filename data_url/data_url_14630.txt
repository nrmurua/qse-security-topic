Having qiskit_backend_overview as a qiskit.tools.jupyter magic is not ideal. It creates unintuitive situations. For example, from qiskit.tools.jupyter import qiskit_backend_overview does not work. And %qiskit_backend_overview fails if no load_account() was not executed yet.
I suggest to make qiskit_backend_overview a method in the provider or just a standalone function.
Or is there any key advantage in having it as a magic?
I would just deprecate it and remove. It is legacy code that has been replaced by other tools in the IBM Cloud.
