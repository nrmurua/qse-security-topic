In CUDA and CUDAMPI versions, we need to implement a better estimate of required memory based on 1. number of SMs 2. type of calculation (e.g. highest angular momentum) and 3. system size. Probably number 1 and 2 are most relevant due to memory requirement of ERI kernels.
The issue has been fixed in one of the previous PRs: https://github.com/merzlab/QUICK/blob/master/src/cuda/gpu.cu#L243-L278.
