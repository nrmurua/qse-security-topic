Cannot handle combined connections, as it tries to sort all connections alphabetically while some connections are lists.
The function refers to self.layout, although PulseSequences don't have direct access to the layout typically.
This gives an error when the axes are a list, not an np.ndarray
@maij any idea if this has been fixed? I can try out later on
It looks like it's been changed since I made this, after testing we can delete this.
