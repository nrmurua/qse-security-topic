Hello,
thank you so much for the amazing library. I am using one Red pitaya board with PYRPL to lock a cavity with PDH. I would like to know if it is possible to use the slow analog inputs and outputs in a PID to control the temperature. I couldn't find a way to configure the PID input for this.
I am currently using the "max_hold_no_iir" branch.
Thank you

Thanks for the feedback. This is definitely possible. I think, the trick is to configure the input of a Pwm module to be the pid that you want to use (and then setting output_direct of the said pid to off)...
Something like (excerpt from the file https://github.com/lneuhaus/pyrpl/blob/master/pyrpl/hardware_modules/pwm.py)
Let me know if this is solving your problem
Thank you for the answer.
I understood that this code will associate the output of the PID0 to the output pwm0. How can I feed the input of a slow analog signal into the PID module?
Thanks again
I am not sure there is currently support for slow analog inputs...
The slow analog inputs are only supported tor querying, though the signals are available in the FPGA. It would be straightforward to connect them to a PID when changing the verilog code. The reason this isn't done in the main image right now is because we have too few free "input signal" slots.
