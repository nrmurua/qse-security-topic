See the lines: 
These lines remove the method from the backend options. From now on, all the tests run only the automatic simulation method. This affects:
Add a debug print
in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/test/terra/backends/qasm_simulator/qasm_standard_gates.py and other tests.
Also compare the fluent execution of
with the never-ending execution of a specific test:
Only in the second execution the test runs with the MPS simulator.
I've added .copy() at the end of the problematic lines, but now that I run the tests, three tests are failing (these tests should have failed before, but passed since they were wrongly executed with the automatic simulation method), and eventually get stuck in test_unitary_gate. I'm fixing them now.
Opened #1022 about test_unitary_gate, which runs forever.
Fixed by #1026
