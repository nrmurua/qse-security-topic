This might be a bbndb issue as well.  Seems like the notes attribute of the data base isn't getting set.  Here's a minimal working example:
The database does have a notes attribute but it seems to not be initialized.
I did a pip install of develop on QGL, Auspex and master of bbndb.

This issued also breaks The Example-Channel-Lib notebook (Example-Q2).
It works for me when creating a new database from :memory:. Have you tried restarting the notebook?
It would fail with an example.sqlite predating BBN-Q/bbndb@84cd5d4 because it was created without the notes attribute.
hmm I couldn't get :memory: to work for me yesterday.  Let me try on another computer.
You're right...  A fresh install on a different computer works...  Okay I'll try to figure this out.  Closing for now.
