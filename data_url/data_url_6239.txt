Seems like the packages we are distributing via PyPi don't work as expected on Minicionda3 AND Python 3.7
Everything seems to be working with Python 3.5 and 3.6
This is quite important as the default conda Python version is 3.7.  It is also important given that we have tutorials coming up in countries that use Windows almost exclusively.
Ok, I have found the problem. As the Windows version we provide via Pypi is not statically linked, it requires some libraries to be previously installed in the system, and seems like Miniconda3 with Python 3.6 doesn't come with these libraries installed by default :(
In order to make it work, install mkl libraries:
I'm closing this issue and creating a new one to address this issue in a proper way
How does installing the mkl libs correct things when we are using openblas?
We are not using OpenBLAS with Windows builds on Aer 0.1.1. But we will on 0.2.0, and it won't require any other external BLAS .dll installed, as I'm linking it statically.
Then why is openblas.dll in the wheel for Aer 0.1.1?
woops, seems like Python 3.5/3.6 builds are linked with openblas.dll but the Python 3.7 wheel is using mkl. That's definetely not intended.
For next release, all versions will be statically linked with openblas.
