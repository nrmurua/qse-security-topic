#In quantum data tutorial
#Under philosophy that less code is better code, in opening MNIST loading
#could strike use of np.newaxis
#replace this line
#x_train, x_test = x_train[..., np.newaxis]/255.0, x_test[..., np.newaxis]/255.0
#with
#x_train, x_test = x_train[...]/255.0, x_test[...]/255.0
#and just replace  plt.imshow(x_train[0, :, :, 0])
#with plt.imshow(x_train[0, :, :])
#(the tf.reshape returns same form in both configurations)
#Further down a typo Choose misspelled as Chooe
Thanks for raising the issue. Would you be interested in opening a PR with a fix ?
Sure happy to. Will be my first PR on someone elseâ€™s library. To follow.
