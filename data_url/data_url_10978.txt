Test for the non-asymptotic, unconstrained, least-squares quantum process tomography fail intermittently.  This isn't entirely unexpected since we're in the middle of reworking and developing the process tomography code.
Probably has to do with the amount of noise the Binomial distribution is inserting...  Will update soon.  Test on the Qlab.jl code base have hinted that you might need to relax error tolerances for non-asymptotic data.
This is now fixed as of 020b6ed
