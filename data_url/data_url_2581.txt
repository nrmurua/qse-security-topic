When embedding latex into a docstring, it's common to use backslashes. Python interprets those as character escapes, so e.g. \begin{bmatrix} ends up turning into a bad character followed by egin{bmatrix}. We should automatically detect when this happens, and raise an error saying the user needs to prefix the docstring with r.
I think pylint might have a rule for this.
