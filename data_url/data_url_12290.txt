Trying to run this code in the Jupyter notebook superposition_and_entanglement:
Gives the following error:
Already added these code following the Readme before the cell where the error occurs:
The first two code cells run successfully, however the last one gives me a permission-denied error to write:
And Qconfig is still not found.
I don't know if this is the "right way" to resolve this issue or not, but I usually use a Qconfig.py from my qiskit-sdk-py folder.  If you don't have that file, you'll need modify Qconfig.py.default from the qiskit-sdk-py repository with your API Token from the Quantum Experience and copy as Qconfig.py to your qiskit-tutorial folder.
It seems like there should be a better way to do this, but that's how I do it.
@AshleyZhao, do you have a Qconfig.py on the root folder of your repository? After reading the description of the issue, I'm still not sure it is the case - as @hellmersjl3ds mentioned, the right way is indeed to create a Qconfig.py file that contains your details from Quantum Experience. Could you please check step 4 of https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial#1-install-the-qiskit-sdk ?
Already added these code following the Readme before the cell where the error occurs:
As a side note, the README assumes the commands are executed in a regular prompt (ie. not inside a notebook) unless otherwise noted - this way you do not need to modify the notebooks themselves, and reduces the chances of running into permission issues as the one you described. If the problems persists, could you try running the installation steps on a shell?
Hi,
I have added the steps to install Qconfig.py here:
https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/stable/README.rst
Also, you can find an example of the config file here:
https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/stable/1_introduction/example_Qconfig.py
Hope this helps.
I am working in Anaconda in spyder editor .
Can anyone tell me how to install qiskit in spyder?
Thanks for your question. Someone will be happy to help, but it will be best to take your query to either the Qiskit Slack or the Quantum Computing Stack Exchange.
