10 MHz is a more common output of reference oscillators (GPSDO, Rb).
Currently a 100 MHz source is needed.
Support 10 MHz reference frequency Si5324 configurations.
Will affect #1172
I'd be happy to also add some configurations for 10 MHz, but wouldn't really have a reason to test it/measure its performance right now.
