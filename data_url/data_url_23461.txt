Currently a new run gets a captured_run_id inserted based on the following logic
Consider a database with 10 runs where a dataset is added via ds = load_from_netcdf(...) and ds.write_metadata_to_db()
If that dataset has captured_run_id==100 the next dataset created as part of a measurement would have
run_id ==12 and captured_run_id==101 breaking the expectation that the run_id == captured_run_id for any new dataset.
Suggested fix replace max(captured_run_id) with max(run_id) in the above code and check once the row has been written that run_id == captured_run_id for new  runs.
Suggested fix replace max(captured_run_id) with max(run_id) in the above code
oh totally! Good catch!
