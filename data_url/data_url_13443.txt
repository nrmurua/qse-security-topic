Currently CI runs all tests in a development environment (where all 3rd party packages packages in dev_requirements.txt are installed).
It would be good to test some basic functionality of Mitiq without some/all 3rd party packages.
Define a new command, make test-basic, which runs some basic tests that are supposed to work in a non-dev environment e.g.:
Once we have this command, we could run  make test-basic in our CI workflows before installing the dev requirements. After this, the existing workflows can follow as usual: dev requirements installation followed by make test  or make test-all.
Updated title / description to make this a little more precise. We still need dev requirements for testing, e.g., pytest, it's really about testing without Qiskit, pyQuil, etc.
