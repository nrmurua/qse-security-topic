Which config file is meant to be updated for Travis to succeed.
I see .travis.yml on my local disk.
Modifying .travis.yml should be enough: you have to add the missing dependencies in the matrix (see addons).
Also, make sure that travis builds with the different GCC's. In master, the env variable CC_OQS allows this, but this could obviously be replaced by other options.
Can someone point me in the right direction to install autotools and autoconf packages on Travis.
For e.g.
I did something like this in .travis.yml, seems like it didn't work and sudo doesn't work either.
Closing issue: Travis now working on PR #20.
