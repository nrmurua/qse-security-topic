The current merging process has a bottleneck explained on #927. One of the solutions involves targeting only one Python version for only one platform during regular merges and complete with a periodic build for testing the complete environment matrix.
For implementing this, we want some way to highlight when the cron build is failing for some reason. We opted for instructing the CI to open an issue in the repository. The following format is provided as a reference and open for dicussi√≥n:
Well, this is what I propose:
Title: Master is failing
Body: Master is failing in commit <hash>. Check the logs at: <link to CI logs>.
Labels: "master failing"
Master is failing in commit <hash>. Check the logs at: <link to CI logs>.
@delapuente I'm personally not necessarily convinced of the value of something like this. While I agree it could definitely highlight something real that needs our attention, like a new version of dependency package broke something or we introduced a bug causing non-deterministic failures, it is equally as likely that the travis infrastructure just fell apart. I've seen many times where the container they use for testing just fails to deploy, or a network issue fails an early setup stage and the job errors before even installing the project under test. Do we want an issue automatically opened if that kind of thing happens?
Thanks for pointing out that case! Fortunately, that's something we could detect for instance, by setting an environment variable at the end of our testing. This is part of a greater effort focusing on reducing the number of tests we are running and probably it will get disabled until we implement other parts of the epic at #927.
I this this was closed via #1071.
