When using the compose method within a ControlFlow context builder the composed element is inserted at the top level scope.
yields,
The composed circuit should appear inside the for-loop as an appended instruction currently does.

If you just want the decomposed CCX gate 3 times, you can can use a for loop like so:
from qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates.x import CCXGate
from qiskit import *
qreg = QuantumRegister(3)
creg = ClassicalRegister(3)
circ = QuantumCircuit(qreg, creg)
for i in (range(3)):
circ.x(qreg)
circ.compose(CCXGate().definition, inplace=True)
print(circ)
Thanks for the report, Erick.  The issue is that QuantumCircuit.compose manipulates .data directly, or calls QuantumCircuit._append without doing the requisite checks on the control-flow scoping (noted in its docstring).  It certainly needs a fix - I'll have a look when I've finished combing through my backlog.
