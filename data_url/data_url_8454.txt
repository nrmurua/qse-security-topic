Hi,
I have been trying to use qutip.floquet.floquet_master_equation_steadystate method to get the steadystate of my system, but the docstring is not super useful.
From the docstring, I guess I should call it as qutip.floquet.floquet_master_equation_steadystate(H, A) where
I think I missed something as I am getting an error
from https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/steadystate.py#L224.
Additionnally, I think there is a much easier way to find the steadystate of such a system, using something like (not really well written nor optimised):
which basically looks for the eigenvector associated with 0 eigenvalue of a matrix derived from A, which is basically coming directly from equation 251 of Gri98.
Thank you, I will try to pass the word to users using Floquet.
The Floquet solver was heavily rewritten in QuTiP 5, so closing this for now.
