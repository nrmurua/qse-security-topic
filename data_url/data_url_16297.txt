This only occurs for Qiskit modules:


I assume jupyter (well actually more likely ipython) is using jedi for tab completion. Which version of jedi do you have installed? Although there hasn't been a recent release of jedi in a while so it might not be that.
I'm thinking this might be an issue with jupyter. At least for me locally with jedi-vim and ipython I'm not able to reproduce this:

but I see the same behavior in jupyter as you are.
Yeah I have the latest Jedi. There is a definite level of compatibility with jedi. Ipython great, notebooks good, lab iffy.
This seems to be specifically when tab completing modules in import statements, such as from qiskit.<tab> - I can't reproduce with qiskit.compiler.<tab>, and similarly to Matthew, it only happens in Jupyter.
Actually, it's just a Jupyter Notebook issue as best as I can tell - I made a simple package with no content at all other than submodules called a and b, and was able to reproduce the duplication, but only in jupyter notebook and not in jupyter lab.  So this is an old notebook issue, and since Jupyter are generally moving towards deprecation of that in favour of JupyterLab, I'll close this.
