Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Currently you have to create an intermediate list just to pass it to Circuit.zip.
Describe the solution you'd like
This would make it analogous to how the built-in zip works
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
[optional] Additional context (e.g. screenshots)
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
I don't think this works for builtin zip:
In other words, passing one iterator converts each element in the iterator into a single-element tuple, rather than treating each element as a separate argument to be zipped over.
Oh, that's interesting. I guess I got confused by the internal sweeps.Zip which does what I first described.
Closing the issue since this looks like a confusion.
