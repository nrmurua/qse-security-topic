From https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/8694/is-there-a-mistake-in-the-vqe-ansatz-in-cirqs-tutorial
This is the final circuit in the notebook ( https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#background-variational-quantum-algorithms ):
All phasing operations preceding the measurements have no effect. This leaves only the layer of X gates. So the whole optimization example collapses to "what's the best probability for each bit to be 1?".
The strange thing is the example output shows the output probabilities varying with gamma (the CZ parameter).
Is this bug still reproducible? I mean "The strange thing that the output probabilities varying with gamma (the CZ parameter)".  My code seems fine when changing the gamma with the example on https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/variational_algorithm.html.
If there is only one layer the code won't change with the Z phases.  I'll update this to look a little more like QAOA, by adding an initial step that initializes the system to all |+> states and then reverse the cost and mixing steps.
