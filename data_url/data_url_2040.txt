Are there plans to support classically controlled gates? Would this be of interest?
#887 is needed in Cirq. is this related?
Thank you. It is related.  My question started without considering classical registers, although results would need to be stored somewhere.
I was asking because would like to design. optimize and verify teleported-like implementations of circuits consisting entirely of single qubit initialisations, CNOTs and a final round of measurements that control controlled gate/operations (I call this ICM in https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02004)
Should I close this issue or keep it?
Keep it.
The answer is yes, this is coming next quarter. See the roadmap item #3234.
