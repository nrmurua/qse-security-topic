In https://qiskit.org/documentation/deprecation_policy.html, the code block seems broken:

would you like to give  some suggestion/hint on this issue
The aim of the issue is to fix the file docs/deprecation_policy.rst so the pictured code block appears properly.  It looks likely to me that there might be a :: at the end of the previous paragraph instead of a :, but I haven't looked in detail.
Closing as fixed per #11186
