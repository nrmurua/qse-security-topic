Creating kernels from QASM 1.0 files is very useful for:
Kernel can then be created as following:
kernel k("file.qasm")
Is there already a way to create a kernel from a cqasm file?
Just leaving a reminder here, since this is really important.
This basically means that there's no way of storing circuits for later use within OpenQL, or using circuits generated in other programs.
