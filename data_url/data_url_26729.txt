Dear all,
when install libxsmm1.14 using toolchain for CP2K, in the "make.log" file--"Makefile:220: *** No Python interpreter found"
I use CENTOS 8.2  and MKL.
./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh -j 24 --no-check-certificate --with-openmpi --math-mode=mkl
output:
`WARNING: (./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh, line 327) No MPI installation detected on your system. Ignore this message if you are using Cray Linux Environment

just because CENTOS is not python cmdï¼Œ
and use the cmd, can solve:
ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
