I discovered this issue because some PointOptimizers output non-device specific gates.  These gates are not decomposed to device specific gates when inserted into the circuit using insert_at_frontier().  Later, if the circuit is copied with Circuit.copy(), a ValueError is thrown when copy() tries to validate the gates.
Circuit.insert() does decompose gates to the device's gate set and validates them.  insert_into_range() and insert_at_frontier() should do the same thing.
Here is a failing example:
Exception: ValueError: Unsupported gate type: Z
That example runs on my machine without throwing that Exception. Has this issue been fixed?
Suitably updated (no more from_ops) this still throws an exception.
I believe this is still a bug.
There is some validation in these methods, but apparently not enough.
We have dropped some validation in favor of performance as of late. Is this still an issue @cduck ?
Believe this is not longer an issues since device validation was removed from circuit.
