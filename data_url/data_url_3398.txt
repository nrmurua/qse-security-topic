It is useful to be able to merge TomographyExperiments with compatible settings so that experiments can be run in parallel on the same call to the QPU.
This functionality exists in forest-benchmarking and will be copied over as part of the effort to unify the two implementations.
@kylegulshen can this be two issues or are they super coupled?
