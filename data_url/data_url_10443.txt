Thought it was a misc failure in #84 , but now the same error came up again.

Have not looked into the cause at all.
Check here and there.
Got it, I was more curious why it showed up on the same config, though could be a coincidence. We can always lower the threshold again.
Or switch to CircleCI. ðŸ˜„
Fixed with #99 (drop appveyor) and #103 (drop py36).
