Basic gates are basic elements in a quantum circuit, the following definitions is from PHYS4071
However, we will implement a more general phase gates with a theta as its parameter, S and T gates will be a specific instance of such phase gate.
Blocks are conbination of multiple gates on multiple qubits.
I willl leave Controlled gates to other issues, since this can implemented in a more efficient way. And now I will implement controlled by a straight forward sparse matrix in v0.1. QFT and Time evolutaion blocks will be leave to other issues two.
