Enabling a basic validation that runs all examples on the GPU backends, the qaoa_maxcut.cpp example throws a runtime error due to lack of progress. Locally, everything works fine, but on the GH runners I am getting:
The qaoa_maxcut_builder.cpp example works fine, but that one is using a different optimizer.
In .github/workflows/publishing.yml enable the /home/cudaq/examples/cpp/other/gradients.cpp example in the validation job, then manually run the workflow for a recent deployment. It would be good to find a local repro, but I don't have one right now.
The example should succeed.
Not a regression
No response
Claims to be fixed.
QAOA Maxcut GPU test has been reenabled and passed. Closing.
