Hello projectq team, you do amazing work.
The following teleport script runs on the simulator but encounters an error on the real IBM QE backend. The IBM QE job runtime error states that this script is using a 'u2' gate, but it for sure is not. If this script runs on the simulator, why does this error occur on the real IBM QE? What should I change to make it run on the real IBM QE, like the simulator?

To run this script, set the following variables:
IBM_QE
message
device
token
When viewing the job status on IBM QE via a browser, the 'Status Description' of the job states:
Here is the full local python console error:

Thank you for taking a look at this.
Could you try to add a CommandPrinter engine in the engine list when running the code? This would print any gates to the console.
I would modify your script and add one line just after this one:
Line to add:
NB: you might need to import CommandPrinter from projectq.backends
The issue might arise because some other gates get decomposed down to U2 when executing your code.
Thank you @Takishima. After making those changes, the below UnsupportedEngineError is raised. Would you advise I use one of the setups that includes an AutoReplacer in the following link? I started testing some, but have not yet been successful.

Ah, my bad... my suggestion was missing the () after CommandPrinter:
But otherwise, yes, you could use an AutoReplacer coupled to an InstructionFilter in order to remove the u2 gates.
It's ok, thanks for clarifying. After adding the "()",  the Status Description for the Job still shows:
The Qobj uses gates (['u2']) that are not among the basis gates (['id', 'rz', 'sx', 'x', 'cx', 'reset']) [1106] 
I'm going to start researching how to make the AutoReplacer coupled to an InstructionFilter work. I appreciate your guidance.
But when you ran the code, did you not see any printouts of commands being executed ?
A code like this
would generate output like this on the console:
Yes, here is a link to the command printouts from the console:

Also, the script link has been updated to include the CommandPrinter() logic:

I realize now this is not really an issue, but the engine just needs to be built correctly. I will close out this issue. Thank you for your direction @Takishima, I sent you an email.
