Today, when you do ct.dispatch(), there is a pickle file created on the client side and then uploaded to the queuer. But when the dispatcher updates the results, that happens in the results service and the client side results file is not updated, thus causing a divergence problem.
The solution is to not create the results pickle file on the client side and instead send bytes to the queuer.
There should also be a ct.get_results() function that returns the result file as bytes.
