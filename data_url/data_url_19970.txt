What is this? Why I cannot use, configure, make, make install and have the headers to the /usr directory, so the headers can be found by C program?
Please no changes, source code install on Linux should always be?
./configure
make
sudo make install
Can you provide instructions for traditional compilation?
autoconf is just one way to configure Linux software. This project has decided to use cmake instead -- also easing integration beyond Linux.
To spell it out if you're unfamiliar with cmake just replace autoconf's "./configure" with cmake -S . -B _build && cd _build and use the rest of the commands you're familiar with. I would recommend reading up on cmake though as it provides a few more capabilities than autoconf.
Cool, thanks
