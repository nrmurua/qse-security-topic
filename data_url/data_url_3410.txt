We migrated pyQuil to Python 3 some time ago, but still haven't gotten around to adding typing to all the modules. This issue is for doing so in the gates.py module, which is one of the most critical components of the library.
If no one beats me to it, I can tackle this one. Per @stylewarning's request, not assigning myself until I actually start on it though.
Had some time on the flight, so went ahead and started on this. Draft PR is up, but still a WIP.
