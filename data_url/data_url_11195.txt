Hi @davidzsoltmanrique, thanks for flagging this.  Could you provide a bit more information about this issue?  maybe a code snippet you are using to test the effect?

Hello,
I came across this problem also.
Here's a snippet:
Output:
It eliminated the 1 [1^ 0] term as expected, but renumbered the 2,3 orbitals as 0,1, even though I set prune=False. So now the 0.5 [3^ 2] term reads 0.5 [1^ 0], which is not what I wanted.
I took a look at the source code for freeze_orbitals and at no point is the prune flag used.
