Pulled from current head and found issues with building under Centos with Gcc 8 and openmp using the makefile (as opposed to make.sh).  Simple fix to the makefile made things buildable to pass all tests, but wanted to suppress the bogus warnings about uninitialized variables as well.  Patch file attached.

As noted in the PR, tests previously relied on the top-level definition of CXXFLAGS to build correctly. It feels a little awkward to redefine those flags, but this has been an issue for enough users that I agree we should make the change.
Submitted in PR #79.
