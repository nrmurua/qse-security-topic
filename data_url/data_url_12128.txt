Hi @JonHill24.
The command
from qiskit import IBMQ
is python code. You should be using it in your Python editor, not in the terminal directly.
The solution is to start python first by typing
python
in your terminal.
Then, once you see the three arrows >>>, you can type the qiskit import code that you have shown above.
Closing as the the answer from @aasfaw is indeed correct.
