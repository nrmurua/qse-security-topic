Installed in Debian container as per single-user instructions on https://nixos.org/download.html.
Packages are still building locally despite binary substituter settings in the flake.
Running it again, same problem with the saved settings:
I think I just saw the same problem, but either adding the user to trusted-users or the substitutors globally, both in /etc/nix/nix.conf fixed it.
Edit: Just saw that this was in single-user mode, so presumably that's not it.
binaryCaches (flake.nix#L508) has been deprecated (as mentioned by Nix manual) - replacing it with substittuters seem to work fine (almost) as intended.
Now the problem lies in public keys - binary-cache-public-keys has been also replaced (with trusted-public-keys), but I can't get that to stick - seems like public keys need to be added manually to make use of the substituter.
