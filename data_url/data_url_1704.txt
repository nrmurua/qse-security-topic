See https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/16636/
Seems pretty self-explanatory: cirq.qis.to_valid_density_matrix assumes inputs are either rank-2 (and therefore density matrices) or rank-1 (and therefore state vectors, which must be converted to density matrices).

Since either num_qubits or qid_shape is required, it should always be possible to tell whether density_matrix_rep is a state vector or density matrix, but we'll need to break the existing assumptions about input tensor rank.
Also doesn't allow specifying initial state as a state vector, e.g. a vector of shape (2**len(qubits),):
