Running an invalid job does not raise an error. Instead the error appears when you try job.result() and it is some convoluted Marshmallow message about an invalid Result object.
Try running a non-Clifford circuit with the stabilizer method.
Nothing to actually say what the error is.
I can't reproduce this with your example. If I run a non-clifford circuit the job will return a result which will raise the invalid gate exception when you try and access the results:
Then calling result.data(0) raises
As I mentioned in the other issue, the fact it says partial completed when there is only a single circuit that failed is a bug that needs to be fixed.
That could have changed with recent Aer updates?
I'm closing this, @ajavadia please re-open it if you face this error again.
