currently renderer.open_ansys() only knows how to launch Ansys 2020 R2 by default, and requires user input to launch another version. We want it to search for all of the versions, starting from the most recent one (while still allowing users to overrule that)
Same script will run irrespective of the version of the tool. Part of a bigger generalization of the renderer
This becomes obsolete after the update, because the update launches Ansys without specifying the versions. not sure which version will be compatible with that way of working, but we shall see in the real world.
