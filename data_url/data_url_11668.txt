Qiskit allows to add linear equality constraint to the objective as quadratic penalty terms, multiplied by a large constant, the penalty factor.
Currently, not all optimizers allow to manually set this factor upfront.
This needs to be adjusted accordingly.
I might be interested in looking into this. Is this change intended to be made to the base optimizer class or to specific optimizers only? Can you give more details?
In the previous version, docplex translator can compute the minimum penalty factor automatically. It would be nice to import the logic to the new optimization stack.

Created PR #1043 for this issue.
