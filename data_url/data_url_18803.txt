Clarification of a peculiarity of equalityExpression in branchingStatement in OpenQASM 3.
The qasm statement if(c==1) x q[0] results (partially, on the left) in if ( expression -> ... -> equalityExpression ) where equalityExpression has 3 children, the leftmost of which is again an equalityExpression. This requires some handstands in the listener function enterEqualityExpression or laborious analysis of a stack of nested expression entries.
Is there a clarification here?
