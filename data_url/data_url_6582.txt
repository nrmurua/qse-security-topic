Related to #39. See also #63, which adds support for sampling to core qsim.
#68 added a sampler method to simulator_avx, which should be available in the latest release (v0.0.3). Samplers for other simulator types are still forthcoming.
Samplers for all simulator types (including the new SSE simulator) should now be available in the C++ libraries; leaving this open to continue tracking support in the qsim-Cirq Python interface.
Cirq has an inconvenient requirement that sampled circuits must have a measurement. Until qsim supports measurements (or at least doesn't reject them outright), this is blocked.
