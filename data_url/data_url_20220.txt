While doing some OQS development today on my Mac, I started getting tons of segmentation faults (see below for one output; it's not just MamaBear that's failing, I get failures for almost all our KEMs and SIGs, regardless of whether they are coming from PQClean or not).
I thought it was maybe the changes I was making, but went back into commits from months ago, and still got segmentation faults.
So that suggested to me that there's some weird configuration change on my system.  The only thing that came to mind is that there was a recent (March 24, 2020) release of Xcode (version 11.4), that upgraded clang to version 11.0.3 and llvm to version 9, compared to previously using clang version 11.0.0 and llvm version 8.
I tried building liboqs with gcc-9, and the errors went away.  I tried building with clang+llvm 8 from brew, and the errors went away.
Anyone else experiencing this?
I don't know whether it is a bug introduced in this new version of clang, or it is a bug in our code (possibly our RNG code, since that's one of the few things common to so many algorithms?) that wasn't exercised before this new version of clang.
Here's the failure under Xcode 11.4's clang:
Here's the success under brew clang+llvm:
Working for me after I updated to Xcode 11.4.1.  Closing.
