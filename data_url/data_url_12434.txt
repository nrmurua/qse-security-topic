This is a low priority issue and not a huge rush.
Some of the C++ op code in particular the ones for the parametershift has some kind of ugly C++ code in it. It would be nice if we could clean that up at some point. Especially if Cirq keeps adding new gates, we may need to make sure it's easy to add them in here.
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
