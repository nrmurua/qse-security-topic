Current master
When running on current master when running anything that calls the validate_qobj_against_schema() function will fail if installing the code outside of the repo. This is because the json file isn't included in the sdist. (because it's not a python file) So when the function tries to load the schema file it will fail.
I've been installing qiskit from master with pip in a venv to reproduce this. Just do:
$ virtualenv3 test
$ test/bin/python $repo_path/setup.py build
$ test/bin/python -m pip install $repo_path
$ run_code that uses qiskit and calls qobj_validation (I've been running the performance benchmarks)
The qobj validation finds the schema and works.
There are 2 possible solutions, leverage data files to include the json file in the sdist: https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/non-code-files.html
Or alternatively encapsulate the json schema in a python file. Basically just make the json a string (or a native jsonschema object) in a python file.
