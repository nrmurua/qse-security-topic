For some simulation experiments, it would be handy to be able to track both the X and Z logical observables without having to set up an EPR pair on the side. These Pauli targets could be used to artificially adjust the simulated observable. They would of course be totally incompatible with physical experiments (you can't do the conversion from measurements to detection events).
Example:
