Currently, the ECR Gate does not have a parameter:
An ECR Gate that depends on a parameter Î¸ has the following circuit representation
and would allow the implementation of continuous-parameter echoed cross-resonance gates.
For this, the class ECRGate(Gate) would have to be adapted.
In principle this is the right thing to do but it changes the compiler (compiling to theta=pi/2 is easier and done now). Perhaps related to #6551.
What would be the pragmatic thing to do if we want an ECR gate with a theta dependency?
I think the compiler needs to be able to compile to it. If it's continuous and your KAK decomposer works in Qiskit then great, if it's discrete then I think #6551 is needed.
And then for a backend that has a particular angle tuned up then we need a way for that to be reported. Unfortunately right now basis gates are reported by name. But that can be changed as part of #5629
