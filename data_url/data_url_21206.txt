In some configurations Vivado fails to build gateware.
Configuration builds without any errors
Fails with this error:
ARTIQ-7 on NixOS
I believe the affected BUFH is the one in the ethernet controller https://github.com/m-labs/misoc/blob/master/misoc/cores/liteeth_mini/phy/a7_1000basex.py#L694
explaining why standalone build would fail, and a satellite would build properly.
