CI takes a long time now, about 20 minutes. We should really try to speed this up and emphasize unit test timing going forward.
Runtime for every unit test (except those in mitiq_pyquil) longer than 0.5 seconds on my computer are shown below, ordered from longest to shortest. (Note that the total runtime here was 7 minutes 30 seconds... I don't know why CI is almost three times as long.)
From Mitiq meeting: Maybe we can split up unit tests into basic/full categories?
