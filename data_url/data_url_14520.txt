If *Gate..inverse != *dgGate, then InverseCancellation raises. For example:
The behavior here is I believe correct, though the documentation of the gates_to_cancel argument in the class docstring should be updated to explain this more clearly. InverseCancellation accepts a list of either a) single self-inverse gates, or b) 2-tuples of gates which are inverse of one another. If you are trying to run with one gate-inverse pair, the syntax would be InverseCancellation([(SGate(), SdgGate())]).
This does seem like a case where we could be providing a more informative error message. If an arg_to_cancel is not self-inverse, but it does make an inverse pair with the next item in the list, raise with a message clarifying the above.
