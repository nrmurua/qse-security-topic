Hi,
In the python binding example, the cell
results in a function signature mismatch error
I also tried to pass a numpy array by:
But the signture still does not match.
I looked into resources/python/src/nuSQUIDSpy.cpp, and there is a struct of marray_from_python, but I haven't figured out how to use it yet.
Any hints for initialing nuSQUIDS in the multiple energy mode?  Or is it possible to construct an nusquids::marray<double, 1u, std::allocator<double> >  object from numpy array?
Hi,
I'm afraid that example is badly out of date. We are looking into modernizing it; in the meantime the thing you want is to replace several of the parameters in that constructor call (E_min, E_max, E_nodes, and logscale) with a single 1D array of energies to be used (which is much more flexible than our old approach anyway, since it allows you to choose any ordered set of energies you want, not just linear and logarithmic spacings):
nsq.nuSQUIDS(numpy.linspace(E_min, E_max, E_nodes), neutrino_flavors,nsq.NeutrinoType.neutrino,interactions)
Your guess was very close, you just also needed to remove the now useless logscale. marray is quite analogous to numpy.array, and can indeed be constructed from it. You may find the C++ headers, which have documentation comments, a better guide on how to use things than the python binding code. In general, I would encourage using the C++ interface directly; the python interface is much less capable on the whole.
@heroxbd If you still have this problem, please send the issue again with the updated code version.
