array_to_latex() does not emit consistent latex depending on the sign of a numpy array element
For example: -5.664 gets emitted as the fraction -708/125 while 5.664 is not converted to a fraction
In a Jupyter notebook:
b = np.array(
[
[-5.664 - 3.623j, 7.672 - 4.470j, 1.864 - 7.149j],
[0.766 - 4.821j, -4.413 - 0.228j, 9.759 + 4.256j],
[1.0335 - 3.672j, 3.890 - 5.741j, 7.760 + 3.812j],
]
)
display(array_to_latex(b, prefix=r"\mathbf{B}="))
-5.664 is displayed as -705/125 but if the value is negated (to 5.664) it appears as 5.664 (not as a fraction)
The function _proc_value(val) at line 60 in array.py should return the same latex output
for the floating point parameter val, independent of the sign of val
In qiskit-terra\qiskit\visualization\array.py in function _proc_value(val)
Line #77 currently written as
if num + denom < 20:
Line #77 should be written as
if abs(num) + abs(denom) < 20:
Existing code causes -5.664 to get displayed as -708/125 because num = -708, denom = 125,
thus num + denom is (-708 + 125) = -583 which is less than 20,
therefore -5.664 gets converted to the fraction -708/125
Whereas 5.664 is left as 5.664 in the returned latex string
Proposed fix uses the sum of the absolute values of num and denom, to avoid the inconsistency when val is negative
This seems like an oversight, thanks for the report!
Can I work on this issue?
Sure, I'll assign you.  Let us know if you've got any questions.
Hi @deeksha-singh030 - Any success yet on implementing this fix? I'm teaching a QIS course starting January 4th - was just wondering as I am creating the slides for the class using screen shots from Qiskit. Thanks!
Hello @dbiersach - I'm sorry for being this late, I've had a medical emergency. I'm continuously trying to install qiskit-terra from source but while installing developer-requirements there is an error(exit status -1 while installing scikit-learn) occurring. I've tried to update everything and all versions as per qiskit are fine in my system but not able to install. Please help me with it.
@dbiersach without testing, I think bug is probably this line, should be abs(num) + abs(denom). If you have a local fork, you could try changing it and see if that fixes your problem.

@deeksha-singh030 sounds like a problem with scikit-learn, do you have more information?
@frankharkins error that I was getting:
@deeksha-singh030 Sorry I'm not really sure what's causing that. You could try up/downgrading python version?
@frankharkins  I'm working with python 3.9.7.
Can you show the full install command for scikit-learn, or whatever you're installing right now?  It seems to indicate that you're trying to build scikit-learn from source, but that shouldn't be necessary at all - you should be able to install it by wheel.
@jakelishman I was installing qiskit-terra  from source as per the commands given the qiskit documentation.
@deeksha-singh030 are you still working on this?
@frankharkins I've made the required changes as suggested by @dbiersach in the issue. Please take a look on it.
Sorry for being so late. I was trying to do this after installing qiskit-terra from source and I'm still not able to do it from source.  It would be very helpful if you could help me how to work on issues from source.
