Hi @caryan, thanks for reminding about this.
Right now the semaphore build is still under our private semaphore organization and I'm looking into how to make public.
This will make it easier to see builds on submitted PRs.  Currently, the badge on the github readme is accurately and publicaly updated based on the master build.
Ok great! The settings should be fixed.  Do re-open if there are still difficulties.
