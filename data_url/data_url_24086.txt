Currently, the result of convergence of LOM Analysis' Q3D renderer  is not exposed to the end user.
Exposing the result of convergence to the user would give feedback to the user on whether the results obtained is reliable. Users can also programatically increase the number of passes and rerun the simulation to achieve convergence.
