When qiskit-terra is installed, seaborn is not listed as required. In ./qiskit/visualization/state_visualization.py, plot_state_qsphere tries to import the module seaborn and throws an ImportException as it fails.
Create a new virtual environment, install qiskit, and make a  call to plot_state_qsphere to visualize any state vector.
seaborn gets installed as a requirement of qiskit-terra.
Include seaborn in the requirements list.
seaborn (along with other visualization requirements) are not installed by default. They are viewed as optional features and there is setuptools extras  target pip install qiskit-terra[visualization] to install everything needed for all visualization functions. This is documented in the release notes when seaborn was added: https://qiskit.org/documentation/release_notes.html#upgrade-notes and more generally in the installation documentation: https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html#install
