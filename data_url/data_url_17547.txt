The tool for automatizing build failures is reporting the same error in two different issues.
The automatic report of master failures ensures the uniqueness based on a label called master failing but creating issues with labels is only allowed for users with push access. It seems the user for creating these issues did not have the correct permissions.
Solved by fixing permissions.
