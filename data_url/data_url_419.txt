Here is the test case oracle.zip
./staq -S -O2 -o output.qasm oracle.qasm
Use the qpp qasm2 (you may modify to discard some qubits) to execute the output.qasm
Observe the wrong final state and the measurements.
The oracle is a simple function to simulate a periodic function producing something like this:
0000 -> 0001
0001 -> 1011
0010 -> 0001
0011 -> 1011
...
1111 -> 1011
The test case uses the input value 0000, but the execution of the output.qasm will fail to produce 0001.
I believe this is fixed with the last round of bug fixes. I'm getting the correct measurement result of 0001 now.
Could you try again sometime and let me know if the issue persists? Thanks!
I tested it. Fixed indeed. Amazing!
Thanks.
