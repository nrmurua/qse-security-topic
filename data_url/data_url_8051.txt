Right now, if you pass a pathlib.Path to any of two functions above, an error will raise because it is not possible to add the suffix .qu to a Path object.
Moreover, if you already have the fullpath of the file (including the extension), QuTip will also raise because it appends the extension internally, no matter if it is already there or not.
The solution would be similar to numpy.save method.

Pd: I'll be happy to make my first contribution and create a pull request for this.
A pull request would be most welcome. There are also two other functions in qutip.fileio that should probably be updated at the same time. Instead of using an if statement, I would write code like:
Nice, I will do it in the following days.
On a side note, I'd propose to make the printing optional in qload with a debug flag for instance. As it is a bit messy when you are loading a lot of objects.
+1 on getting rid of the print statements. I think we can just drop them entirely -- users can just print their object if they want to see what was loaded.
Fixed #1813 and released in QuTiP 4.7.
