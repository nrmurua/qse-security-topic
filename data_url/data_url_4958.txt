Hi there,
That's an interesting question about simulation of quantum circuits (QC) in general, but QuEST specifically uses "full state" or "brute force" simulation. There are many many methods of QC simulation in the literature, with different runtime and memory trade-offs and optimality for different families of circuits. I'm unsure, but it sounds like you're describing simulation via tensor network contraction.
This is off-topic for QuEST, so I'll close this issue, but I hope the link helps!
