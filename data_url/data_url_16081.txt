after transpilation (levels 1,2,3) on a backend with reset support.
This means that I do not get correct answers using init_qubits=False.
Is there a backend property that indicates that the backend start in ground state? We could do the transpilation process depending on that.
If one sets init_qubits=False in execute then the backend does not initialize qubits.  This is a Qobj thing not a transpile thing, so perhaps the correct thing to do is to remove reset only when they are not supported on the device.  Indeed, a reset at the beginning will not do much to a state if initialized anyway.
