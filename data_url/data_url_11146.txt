arXiv:1502.04698 describes a method for "folding" correlations from Hamiltonians in larger basis sets into Hamiltonians in smaller basis sets. Thus, this is a method for obtaining minimal basis sets with accuracy much higher than something like STO-6G. The technique essentially seeks an effective Hamiltonian which describes ground states with more accuracy than would be possible with the usual Galerkin formulation. This technique seems especially important for quantum computers since most experiments are limited to a very small numbers of qubits.
