Not sure whether there is a better way of doing this, but it seems like an easy/natural way to allow classical control would be to allow a ControlledGate to accept measurement labels in place of qubits for the first num_control parameters. Would this work?
(If something else has already been done, feel free to bin this suggestion.)
