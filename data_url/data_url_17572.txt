When the StochasticSwap mapper fails, it raises a TranspilerError and passes the Layout to the DAG layer to show the qasm where the error is occurring:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/186f3bf4fdd2bdcd9d18b2e059aea76209ddda0b/qiskit/transpiler/passes/mapping/stochastic_swap.py#L460
Because the Layout includes values that are integers, the DAGcircuit.qasm routine fails with a TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable
I will have a look. In the meanwhile, would you mind to post an example of what aliases suppose to do? It seems that there are no test for that parameter. Did you try using layout.get_physical_bits() or layout.get_virtual_bits()?
There is no usage example, or test for it.  However from the docstrings:
If the swap mapper fails then the layer that fails is passed to the error along with the initial_layout.  The aliases is building up registers from the Layout values, but has no idea what to do with the int values, and fails.  So just using the Layout values that are tuples of registers is really the fix.
The PR #1759 fixes this issue.
After #1781, the dag does not have a qasm method (see https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/1781/files#diff-d2039341ad623e4c82f0beeec0ad1f87L772) so I'm closing this bug, since it makes sense I think.
