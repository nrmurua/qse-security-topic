I'm trying to build the toolchain from CP2K 7.1 with GCC + OpenMPI on our RHEL 7.x cluster but I'm running into a weird issue where it's running out of environment space just after the step where it runs scripts/install_parmetis.
I've tried removing various optional packages but it doesn't really help as lots of environment variables are still set as things progress.
Looking at install/toolchain.env it's quite large:
In the middle is a massive blob of termcap data with ^A repeated endlessly.
I'm starting to think this may be GNU screen related - I'm going to update this ticket as I investigate.
Outside of GNU screen the toolchain proceeds as designed.
@owainkenwayucl can you identify the name of the variable with the huge content?
We likely have improve the naive way of preserving the environment and do something more elaborate, like the Gentoo package managers portage or paludis.
The toolchain stores its environment variables in toolchain/install/toolchain.env.
@dev-zero The variable is TERMCAP.
Unfortunately, I can not reproduce this. I tried the following:
While TERMCAP is present within the screen and gets stored in the toolchain.env things don't blow up.
So, my guess is that you have some kind of special setup for your shell or screen?
I'm closing this as it appears to be a one-off problem.
as cited: distributions filter variables in (bash) environment preservation scripts for a good reason
I also encounter this issue with TERM=xterm-256color, screen 4.01.00devel, and zsh 5.7.1, while zsh 5.0.2 is successful on the same machine. In my case the kb field (Backspace key) is messed.
On a different machine (TERM=xterm-256color, screen 4.06.02, and zsh 5.7.1), TERM is not overwritten in screen, i.e., $TERM != screen, and TERMCAP is fine.
I don't know the details but ^A is the default escape character for screen, which possibly causes the issue.
Workaround:
most likely the same issue appeared again: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/cp2k/4iwvz2cuh80/X0fEdPdxAgAJ
