Supporting this seems like it would be much harder than #59 since we are so memory restricted on some GPU devices. Along with the high communication bandwidth we would need to send things over from main memory to GPU memory, making this provide a meaningful speedup might take a lot of experimentation to get working.
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
