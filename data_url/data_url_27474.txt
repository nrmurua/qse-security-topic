All files in your config directories will attempt to be parsed as if they were json. This becomes an issue if you have temporary or swap files.
I guess the solution is to always check if a file has extension .json and ignore otherwise. @maij what do you think?
Sounds good, is there any use of non-json files?
Maybe make a config-parsing dump each time you initialise (can just overwrite each time), just to show parsed and skipped files.
Fixed with #155
