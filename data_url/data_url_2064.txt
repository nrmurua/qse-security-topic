We should add some documentation on how to use cirq.Simulator.compute_amplitudes . There is no documentation in https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/cirq.Simulator.html , or in the simulator tutorial https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/simulation.html
The method is documented at https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/cirq.Simulator.html: it's listed under "Methods", and clicking on it links to the full method documentation. Though it does look like that documentation could be expanded a bit.
As for adding it to the tutorial, I think it would make a much more compelling example once Cirq has a tensor network simulator that does not explicitly store the entire wavefunction.
We've moved to new docs infra and this appears to have more complete docs now.
