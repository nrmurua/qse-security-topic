RTM side
@sbourdeauducq is it worth putting a bigger/faster FPGA on the RTM for Sayma v2.0? Obviously, it's best to use the cheapest FPGA we can, but I wonder if a bit more money on FPGAs will save us a lot of development time in the future?
I don't think so, in any case something like serwb ought to be simple and meet timing at 125MHz there.
This is, above all, about keeping high-quality FPGA code in ARTIQ, not shaving a few dollars from the board.
This timing error appeared with new version of Vivado. I haven't done any specifc optimization on the RTM side before since Vivado < 2018.1 was not complaining. I'm looking at that.
Ah, thanks @sbourdeauducq, i was just also looking at that.
