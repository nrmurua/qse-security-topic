Description of the issue
There are two places in  https://quantumai.google/cirq/start/basics where sentences end abruptly, as if something cut them off or the writer was interrupted.


How to reproduce the issue
This is a documentation issue. The relevant source file is https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/docs/start/basics.ipynb
Cirq version
The page at https://quantumai.google/cirq/start/basics shows a last-updated date of 2022-06-23 UTC.
Also, I would offer a PR instead of a bug report for something this trivial, except that I'm not sure what was intended to be the rest of the sentences above â€¦
