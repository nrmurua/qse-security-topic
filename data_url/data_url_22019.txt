I'm trying to build gateware bitstream from artiq 2.5 following manual-release-2/installing_from_source and got these errors when I'm running python3.5 -m artiq.gateware.targets.kc705 -H nist_clock
It looks like something is wrong with misoc.
using pip list I found it seems installed misoc0.1, but after git checkout tags/0.3 I check the /misoc/setup.py file and found the version of misoc is 0.1
Any suggestions?
Please follow closely the versions specified in the conda recipe in 2.5, and address your python packaging/pip problems.
This seems like the wrong compiler is used to build the firmware. Are you sure your PATH is correct?
The versions of the packaging is checked by comparing /artiq/conda/artiq-dev/meta.yaml and pip list.
Only misoc is version 0.1 while the requirement is 0.3. Other packages seems fine.
But I found in misoc/tag/0.4 the version in setup.py changed directly from 0.1 to 0.4, so this seems not the problem.
I checked the $PATH using echo $PATH and the /usr/local/llvm-or1k/bin is the first one.
Perhaps "the wrong compiler" means that Vivado is not installed correctly?

Vivado is not involved in compiling the part of the firmware where you have the error.
@KaifengC Is that resolved?
