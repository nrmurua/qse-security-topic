Cannot move Applets GUI Window in WSL2
WSL2 now natively supports GUI Apps: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps
However, applets cannot be moved or re-sized. They remain in the top-left corner.

We should be able to move and re-size the applet as is possible in native Linux systems.
The applet is stuck in the top left corner of the screen and cannot be moved or re-sized:
The following message appears when launching an applet:
print:qt.qpa.xcb: internal error:  void QXcbWindow::setNetWmStateOnUnmappedWindow() called on mapped window

+1 - this also happens on Windows 11 which introduced extra support for WSL GUIs.
FWIW I think the setNetWmStateOnUnmappedWindow error is a red herring. We also get that from our Ubuntu systems which don't have this problem.
Does this persist on ARTIQ-7 and ARTIQ-8 (beta)?
The ARTIQ-6 is unlikely to be fixed anyway
@thomasfire I just tested this with Artiq-7 and saw the same behavior. I don't have a system set up with Artiq-8
ARTIQ dashboard 7.8179.928ca50
@thomasfire Please study the situation before making random guesses. It's the same code on all versions so:
Are there any updates on this issue? Figuring this out would be very helpful for allowing remote operation across different platforms.
Can you use one of the supported installation methods? They already give us more than enough work to be honest.
At the time of writing, I was having issues with conda-forge failing due to an invalid OpenSSL certificate. I re-tested this week, and that seems to have resolved and I am able to use the Conda installation method.
In the future, I do think WSL support would be valuable. But I know that takes more resources to achieve.
