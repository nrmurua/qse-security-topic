It's getting annoying seeing (format nil "X 1~%X 2~%X 3"). It's also annoying to not be able to write valid snippets of Quil on one line.
I propose introducing <X>\s*;\s*<Y> to mean <X> is its own line (with particular indentation), and Y is its own line with indentation inherited from <X>.
Tricky parts of implementing this: Tracking source locations, getting indentation right, etc.
What is NOT needed is a printer that reproduces ;. Newlines can just be put in there.
Got it ; Done
@kilimanjaro Can you add a pyQuil issue too? And a rigetti/quil issue to update the spec?
