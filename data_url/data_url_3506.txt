If you declare a memory region of insufficient size it seems that
both of these are bad and it's bad that they're different
Do you have an example program to demonstrate what you mean?
Great find! This is definitely a bug in the QVM (it will now error with a useful message). A fix has been made internally, and it should be deployed in the next SDK release.
Thanks @tarballs-are-good !
@mpharrigan The QVM side of this is fixed. What about QPU? Can we close this?
I don't think so? I'd have to check
Both now raise IndexError: MemoryReference index out of range.
