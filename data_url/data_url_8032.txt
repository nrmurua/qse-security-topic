In QuTiP 4, option for solvers used a class named Options but in QuTiP 5 this class is named SolverOptions. Having to import different classes in QuTiP 4 and 5 makes it awkward to support both versions of QuTiP.
To make things easier for our users we could:
I would prefer the second option, but deprecate the Options alias for removal in 5.2.

Can we close this?
We now use simple dict for options and Options exist for backward compatibility.
Yep, we can close!
