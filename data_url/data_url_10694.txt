I have a three-qubit frustrated loop problem, in which 2 of the qubits get embedded into a single chain.
If I use a very weak chain strength, my results look like this:
1619 and 1623 are the chain. The last line is the chain break frequency.
It appears that chain_break_frequency isn't weighted by num_occurrences. It seems like it should be.
