Description
BinaryPolynomial.normalize enables asymmetric ranges, which is good, but silently ignores shifts left or right from the zero, and crashes with a ZeroDivisionError if the range includes zero.
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
If normalize should only support ranges [-eps1, +eps2], we should enforce and document that; if users can set ranges wholly above or wholly below zero, we should define behavior.
