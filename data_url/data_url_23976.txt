Please be as descriptive as possible, including: what is expected, why is this feature needed, what is the objective, etc.
Add the functionality to draw wirebonds automatically in Gmsh for more accurate results from capacitance and eigenmode simulations. The issue is referenced in the code where the change is needed to be made. Just search for #841  in renderers/renderer_gmsh/gmsh_renderer.py
Enhancement to PR --> #815
To make it as close as possible to the current implementation of QAnsysRenderer and to increase the accuracy of the simulations done.
