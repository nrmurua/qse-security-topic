In the part of the tutorial for calculating the energy as a function of interatomic distance the ExactEigensolver fails, probably because more properties (optimizer, variational_form) are set than allowed for the ExactEigensolver.
Resulting output:
Run the tutorial with qiskit 0.10.5.
No error message and plot nice curves for the energy level as a function of interatomic distance.
I just did a quick and dirty test by modifying the code and this worked. I removed the optimizer and variational_form properties from the first dictionary definition, and I put the whole dictionary definition in the "elif algo == 'VQE':" part. Something similar needs to be done to make the LiH case work.
See this code for H2:
