When trying to setup cp2k I get the following error:
can you please post the output of the following commands?
and is this a fresh run of install_cp2k_toolchain.sh (so, no build/ or install/ directory in tools/toolchain/) or did you run it before already?
Yes it is a fresh run.
I suppose the locale warning is probably unrelated to the actual error.
can you post the toolchain.env? But you might want to check it first for sensitive content.
Ok thanks, looking deeper into the toolchain.env I found that an old cp2k-5.2 was still in the PATH variable as it was loaded as module, after removing that it seems to work now. Therefore closing this bug. ^.^
I had this problem when compiling within screen session.
$TERMCAP value spans over several lines which fails upon cleaning.
export -p
So, simply unset TERMCAP solves the issue in this situation for me.
ok, that explains it: we're filtering env variables (like the TERMCAP) but in our testing those vars did not contain line breaks.
Maybe the easiest would be to replace our environment variable filtering by python -c 'import os; print(*(f"export {key}={value}" for key, value in os.environ.items() if key not in ["TERMCAP", ]), sep="\n")'.
Or if we want to stay in the shell, doing in a subshell the following:
I think I was also using screen before, so this could really be the explanation. :)
