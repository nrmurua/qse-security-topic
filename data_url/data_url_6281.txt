QCircuit is effectively performing circuit optimization while its gates are being specified. The optimization process takes a significant amount of execution time overhead. It'd be great to be able to reuse a fully-constructed QCircuit by saving it to and loading it from a file. This requires that QCircuit can be serialized.
The goal of this issue is to implement a serialization and deserialization process for QCircuit so that it can be saved to and loaded from a file. Boost serialization is one possible library to use, or the serialization code could be made bespoke from pure language standard. (We'd prefer not to take on any new library dependency, while we already use Boost, though ask @WrathfulSpatula if you think you have a justifiable reason to add a new dependency to Qrack for this purpose.)
