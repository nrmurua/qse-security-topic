The addresser enables the use of "1Q queues" to delay processing of 1Q instructions (this is mostly of value for the temporal cost, and is not recommended for the fidelity cost). When 1Q queues are enabled, local mixed classical/quantum operations (namely, MEASURE <q> and RESET <q>) force a naive flush of queues in dequeue-classical-instruction, which may be sub-optimal with respect to the choice of performing a measure or reset before vs after a swap. See the comment and TODO item in dequeue-classical-instruction.
