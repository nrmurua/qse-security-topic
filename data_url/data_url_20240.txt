When enabling clang's UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer using the build sequence
there are several undefined behaviours identified in the qTesla code.  The log is below:
I'm trying to see if the recent update to qtesla took care of some of these. Trying the cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-9 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DUSE_SANITIZER=Undefined -GNinja .. command doesn't work for me: I don't have clang-9 (so I removed the option), and then it said:  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project: USE_SANITIZER.
@dstebila, can you rerun the sanitizer and let me know of the reported log? Thanks.
Running now, will post output when it's done.  FYI the way I generate these is using CircleCI's local execution:
circleci local execute --job ubuntu-bionic-x86_64-ubsan
Edited to add: the Python test framework outputs weirdly abbreviated stdout dumps for the examples above.  So to get the full debug log, I have to use Docker to load our Ubuntu image, then run the build and test commands above manually.
Looks like there are no more qtesla warnings. We can close this issue.
Sorry, I got confused about the issue.  I was running AddressSanitizer, not UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.  Will re-run.
Ok, thanks, we'll take a look.
One issue is left to investigate; but it's hard to reproduce. Let's deal with this after qtesla is updated with the April 15th release, after our next OQS snapshot.
Yes, still have undefined behaviour warnings with qTesla:
Won't fix, as qtesla didn't make it in round 3.
