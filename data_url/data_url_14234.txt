Trying to serialize with qpy a circuit with a pulse gate which includes an Acquire instruction with a Discriminator or Kernel fails. The error is:
and similar for Kernel.
Note this means that with qiskit-ibm-provider pulse gates with discriminators or kernels are not currently supported since circuits must be serialized with qpy.
Here are reproducers for Discriminator:
and Kernel:
Discriminator and Kernel should be serializable with qpy. Since they are part of the circuit, they are already JSON serializable to support the old qobj path.
No response
Thanks Will. As we discussed offline, we tend to remove them from acquire instruction arguments unless we receive user request.

Keeping them in the acquire instruction indicates we can write a single quantum circuit including different kernels and discriminators, e.g. mid-circuit measurement, which is likely unrealistic. Instead of adding QPY support, we should deprecate them and define alternative path to describe kernel and descriminator.
In OpenPulse grammar, capture instruction is sort of arbitrary, but they show nice example of defining descriminator.

Hello 👋 If currently no one is working on this issue, may I try it?
Yes, please go ahead! I talked again with @wshanks , and decided to add QPY support of kernel and discriminator rather than dropping them from the acquire instruction. Do you think you can still handle this issue? Feel free to reach me out if you need any help :)
I implemented QPY support of another instruction with this PR. Just FYI
#9890
@nkanazawa1989 Thank you so much! 🙇
Do you think you can still handle this issue?
I will see in more detail if I can do so 😄
@nkanazawa1989
Hello 👋
The problem seems resolved from the observation that the error no longer raises in #10327
I would like to know whether this approach of mine appropriately follows the convention and/or the rule of qpy or not, before I update docs and add the release note. Could you please briefly check it and give me comments back? 🙏
Thank you so much in advance! 🙇
