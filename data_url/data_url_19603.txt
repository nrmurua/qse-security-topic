This part of the documentation is slightly unclear regarding boundary nodes: https://pymatching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#Loading-from-NetworkX-graphs. This can be made clearer by first defining which nodes are stabilisers, before connecting edges to a single boundary node (or multiple boundary nodes).
