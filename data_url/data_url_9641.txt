Add a device class that is not tied down to an existing or near-future device, thus giving the user the option to create and test currently unfeasible sequences freely.
This device's specs should have some connection to reality but be very permissive, to the point of being unrealistic for a near-term device but potentially achievable in the somewhat distant future.
