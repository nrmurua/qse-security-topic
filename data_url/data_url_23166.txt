I suggest to evaluate pid lock performance from a triggered scope trace instead of the way its done now to increase reproducibility
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\nose\case.py", line 197, in runTest
self.test(*self.arg)
File "W:\pyrpl\pyrpl\test\test_lockbox.py", line 144, in test_real_lock
assert (mean > 0.5), mean  # since out1 should start at 1 V
AssertionError: 0.424646058121
need to rewrite lock unit tests now
