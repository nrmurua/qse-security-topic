I'm one of the developers of quantify and our package heavily depends on qcodes. The latest pyqtgraph release (0.13.1) brought a few changes that we needed to address and unfortunately one issue actually stems from within qcodes.
I don't have nice minimal working example, but I think the issue should be clear. We have a PlotMonitor class that launches multiple instances of QtPlot which right after running update_plot raises an AttributeError with the following traceback
(secondary_QtPlot is assigned to an instance of QtPlot)
Looking at the documentation of pyqtgraph, the "new" way of applying transforms is via QtGui.QTransform(). The example they give is
I think the issue is resolved when we replace all lines containing img.translate and img.scale with img.setTransform.
The issue arose with qcodes==0.33.0 and pyqtgraph==0.13.1.
@rsokolewicz thanks for reaching out. Honestly that code sees very little use for us internally. I am happy to merge a pr that fixes this but it might take a bit of time before we get to it otherwise
