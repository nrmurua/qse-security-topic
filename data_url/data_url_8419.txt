Hello everyone, I tried to install qutip via pip on windows 10. I got an error stating that building the wheel failed because I didn't have Virtual Studio. I don't want to install that, so I just downloaded the wheel from this site: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#qutip
It installed fine, I thought.
If I start a python interpreter in the command line, I can import qutip, and its functions work fine as far as I can tell.
Now the problem: when I try to run a .py script, I get the error AttributeError: module 'qutip' has no attribute 'states'.
So for some reason, python can't always locate the package correctly. Other packages work fine though. Does anyone know how to solve this?
Nevermind, I'm such a dumbass! I named my .py file "qutip.py". Changing that obviously solved it. Huge facepalm.
