Yao 0.7.0 requires YaoAPI 0.3 but the latest version on gihub is only 0.1.0
The latest version of YaoAPI is not 0.1, check the one in Yao.jl, folder lib/YaoAPI. Maybe you are refereing to repo YaoAPI.jl, this one has been archived.

I wonder how should I fix this, thank you!
Have you updated your registry? You can update the registry via Pkg.update()

I don't think it is working.

There should be something wrong with your registry. Maybe try removing YaoAPI and related packages first.
I'll convert this to a discussion since I don't think this is related to Yao itself. But please feel free to provide more information to let us help you if you it still not working
