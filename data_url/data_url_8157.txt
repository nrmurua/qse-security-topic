Describe the bug
I am trying to find the fidelity of the maximally mixed two qubit state. I got fidelity as one where it should be zero. I am attaching the file and the results.
To Reproduce
I created a maximally mixed state as 1/2*|00> + 1/2*|01> + 1/2*|10> + 1/2*|11> . I want to check the relation between Concurrence and Fidelity. Concurrence is working correctly, but in case of Fidelity I am facing the issue. I calculated Fidelity using partial trace. Partial traces are giving the same results for both basis (0 and 1) and hence Fidelity is coming as one.
Partially tracing either system out of a maximally mixed state should be the same matrix (and is, in QuTiP), so the fidelity being 1 is correct from a matrix view.  QuTiP doesn't track what systems used to exist before a partial trace, so a partial trace from 2 qubits to 1 qubit appears to live in the same Hilbert space no matter which qubit is traced out.  This is the expected behaviour - it's generally the most convenient, rather than doing something odd like giving back the remaining systems tensored with a maximally mixed state on the parts we just traced out.
I'm not sure of the relation between quantum state fidelity and concurrence that you're referring to, so I can't really comment on that.
By the way, your code doesn't actually use a maximally mixed state, but the result is the same anyway. Being able to write (|00> + |01> + |10> + |11>)/2 in ket form like that shows it's pure over the basis you've defined.  The maximally mixed state over this complete basis would be (|00><00| + |01><01| + |10><10| + |11><11|)/4, which isn't the same as the projector onto your state (which also has crossterms like |00><11| and so on).
