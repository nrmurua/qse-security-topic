The damping_after_dephasing noise model seems to give the incorrect Kraus map.
For example, the snippet below should apply pure dephasing to a single qubit in the |+> state with a gate time equal to T2.
The resulting density matrix is
Eq. 144 of Nielsen and Chuang however indicates that the off-diagonal entries should be 1/2e = 0.18394.
It seems that the problem is the factor of two in the exponent here:
