There's a new and obscure gate in Cirq! The PhasedXZGate. We should add support for this gate inside of TensorFlow Quantum. Like all gates this means:
Do @jaeyoo or @zaqqwerty have any interest in taking this on ?
I am interested in 1 & 3.
Sounds good. I can help with 2 and 4 :)
Thanks. Let me open a PR for 1 in this week
After talking with the people working on qsim it looks like this may be looked after for us already. This should come for free when we switch over to using the OSS version of qsim
Thanks a lot, then I will not work on it :)
This gate is in now.
