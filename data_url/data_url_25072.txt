It might be nice to have the assets available in ISO 216 paper sizes, as used outside of the US. I think it should be reasonably easy to resize to A4 and A2.

I found the game very hard to print with A4 paper.
Hi Frankie/Aleksander,
We should be able to create the assets for A4. I'll look into that today.

These two versions are for A4 but I don't have A4 paper to test them. Please do a test print and let me know if they look fine. Then I can publish them in a new release. Thanks!
Alrightie, Entanglion v1.3 has just been released with a version for A4 paper. Enjoy!

I tested the new PDFs and it looks good. See the pictures:
