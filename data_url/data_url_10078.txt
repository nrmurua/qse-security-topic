This would affect .linear and .quadratic, possibly .adj as well.
I see the benefit for OrderedDicts, but if we're going to allow general mapping types it would be good to have another example, otherwise bqm = dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel(linear, quadratic, offset, vartype, ordered=True) would work just as well.
For instance, defaultdict would not work well, we would need to be able to specify different defaultdicts for .linear and .quadratic
Or, even to create an OrderedBinaryQuadraticModel subclass a la https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/classes/ordered.html
I like the subclass approach too. And it looks like one would have to override just __init__, because linear and quadratic are initialized only there.
Hooks approach would make more sense in case instances of the mapping are created on fly, not just once.
OrderedBQMs were removed in #323 but it seems there might still be a use case for them.
Creating a new issue #397
