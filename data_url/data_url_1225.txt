We want to launch Cirq-FT soon. This task is to create a new empty sub-package for cirq-ft that depends on cirq-core and is compatible with all the Cirq packaging infrastructure.
Once the package has been added, we can start moving files from internal private repository to Cirq open source.
cirq-ft
What is it?
cirq-fault-tolerance?
cirq-fourier-transform?
cirq-full-time?
cirq-feet?
Yeah, Cirq for Fault-Tolerant algorithms. We've been working on a prototype internally and we are targeting a launch by June 12th
Remaining TODO items:
Can this be closed now?
Yes, this can be closed
