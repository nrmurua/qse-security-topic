It depends on docplex package which depends on proprietary CPLEX
Try to install qiskit-aqua
No proprietary dependencies.
Is this a bug in your opinion or an enhancement? If it is a bug could you please attach the error message?
I have set up pip not to install packages without my approval. So I analyze each dependency. Analysing this dependency I saw an advertisment of proprietary paid tools and a proprietary cloud. So this dependency has no use for me. And all the stuff depending on this dependency too. To fix that either that dependency should be replaced by something FOSS, or CPLEX should be made FOSS itself.
If this stuff is non-mandatotry, it should also be declared as such.
I mean I don't need my PC to be full of useless libs.
DOcplex is a requirement for Qiskit Aqua and it is available under Apache License. DOcplex provides a convenient modelling language for optimization problems and Qiskit Aqua utilizes this functionality. In the same time Aqua does not require additional paid/cloud tools to be installed. Having said that, CPLEX which indeed has a proprietary license and can be used for solving optimization problems is not a mandatory requirement by Qiskit Aqua.
Thanks for the info. Can the description in pypi be fixed and a github repo with sources and bug tracker and pull requests tab active created?
Unfortunately we are not in charge of DOcplex. The sources of DOcplex are available on pypi site in the "Download files" section. Documentation, support, forum, etc are here: https://ibmdecisionoptimization.github.io/

Probably colleagues of ones who are in charge of this repo are.
