NumPyEigensolver and by extension NumPyMinimumEigensolver do not support all BaseOperator instances, in particular SparsePauliOp. This is because it requires the data attribute, which Operator exposes but e.g. SparsePauliOp does not.
Output:
The code should compute the eigenvalues without error, similarly to:
or:
Generalize the computation inside NumPyEigensolver to avoid the data attribute, perhaps via to_matrix() or, if possible, a sparse implementation that works for BaseOperator instances.
I'm happy to work on this issue myself.
