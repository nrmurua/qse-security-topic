I see that DRTIO switch support for Sayma RTM #619 is slated to be part of Release 5.0. I understand that involves more RTM FPGA infrastructure. That's fine.
What is the plan for exposing slower control of BaseMod (Allaki) in ARTIQ Python? I see that digital attenuation is accessible from Rust. Here's what would be helpful for near term experiments. Baseline would be configuring BaseMod at outset of an experiment. Better would be slow control within experiments with "whatever is easy" timing resolution.
This Issue is now obsolete.
