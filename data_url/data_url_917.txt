The notebooks-stable CI test checks notebooks against the last official release of Cirq.  If some notebooks require cirq update to pass their test, we need to skip them to unblock CI tests and then re-enable after the next Cirq release is out.
This issues is to track such notebooks and any other tasks that should be done after the next regular release.
