A failed PYON encoding when making an RPC call via pc_rpc.AutoTarget will fail silently (or show as disconnection). No easy way to trace bug back to PYON.
See #1218 for details. Warning copied below
Message makes it look like issue is with network connection, not ARTIQ.
@drewrisinger please test this patch:
including all cases: attempting to send non-PYON-serializable data, receiving garbage data, connection breaking, first connection vs. connection that has been retried, close_rpc() called.
@drewrisinger ping
I'm unsure how to do such a test. Are there pre-existing unit tests that will test those? I don't have the knowledge of all the dependencies needed to write such a test.
