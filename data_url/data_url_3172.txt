I am able to run a parametric program on a QVM where I assign the parameter the integer value 0; however, when running the same code on a QPU I get
RPCError: Parameter was declared as a float but its value was 0.
Casting the 0 to a float fixes the problem so that it runs on both QVM and QPU.
It would be nice if the QVM and QPU matched behavior in the first instance.
Hey, Kyle. Can you share the code snippet for testing.
Sure. Hopefully I've captured all of the relevant detail. I actually saw the error when running
estimate_joint_confusion_in_set from forest.benchmarking.readout.py, which is where I confirmed that casting to a float in the memory_map fixes the problem on the QPU.
