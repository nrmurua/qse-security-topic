Discussing about the PR #667, we thought the best way to implement the parameter shift rule is to pass the index of the variational parameter as input of the parameter_shift function.
In this way the procedure becomes:
To do this, we thought it might be useful to define a generator_eigenvalue function in qibo/gates.
This issue was created to discuss about the best way to implement this function.
