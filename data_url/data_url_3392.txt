The name meyer_penny_game.py should be meyer_penney_game.py as the namesake for Penney comes from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penney%27s_game
Line 29 in meyer_penny_game.py states that:
however, no such file exists.
Thanks for reporting!
Regarding (1), I am no expert here (had to google it!), but it looks like the "name of the game" is actually the PQ PENNY FLIP game. From (what I think is) the original paper:
PQ PENNY FLIP: The starship Enterprise is facing some imminent--and apparently inescapable--calamity when Q appears on the bridge and offers to help, provided Captain
Picard can beat him at penny flipping
Perhaps the choice of a penny as the coin to flip was an intentional hat-tip to Penney's game on Meyer's part?
Regarding (2), the file was moved to docs/source/exercises.rst. I will update the path. Thanks for pointing this out.
Regarding point (1), my apologies. I learned something new!
Me too!
For (2), thanks for updating that path! I hope to contribute less trivial things in the future!
No problem. Gotta start somewhere! Thanks for contributing.
