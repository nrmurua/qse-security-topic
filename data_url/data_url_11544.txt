The Credit Risk Analysis is indexing badly the CDF and PDF, using variables meant for values (losses or exact_var) instead of indexes (like i_var). This gives an IndexError mostly on prints, when executing the bisection search, or when getting certain cdf values.
Simply change lgd = [2,2] at the beggining and it will fail when computing the GCI model (the cell number 6)
The expected behaviour is to being able to index correctly the possible loss values. This does not happen due to only indexing those values that are encountered in the simulation plus indexing with the values (example: cdf[exact_var] at cell number 6).
If the asset given values (lgd) are not consequent, like lgd = [2,3], the value 4 is not computed nor included in the losses array. What if I would like to know the CDF value for $P(L \lte 4)$? The solution I'd propose is:
I have an alternative version of the tutorial in which those cells do work given rarer lgd values, so I would not mind being contacted for sharing it.
The tutorials have not been migrated yet to Qiskit Aqua 0.8, but this will happen soon.
Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#1054 should fix this once merged.
I can confirm the above, in the PR @stefan-woerner mentioned this error does not occur anymore.
Since the tutorials have been updated this issue should be solved. Feel free to reopen if I'm missing something or the error occurs again!
