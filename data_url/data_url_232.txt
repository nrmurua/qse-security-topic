The project cannot be built against newer versions of LLVM and requires version 16. (16.0.6 to be exact.) This does not appear to be called out in the documentation.
We currently only describe the build process in Building.md, which is only linked to by our docs, so I think we only need to update Building.md to properly address this issue. @schweitzpgi @bettinaheim please let me know if you disagree.
