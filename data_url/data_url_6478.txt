The QSimSimulator.simulate_expectation_values simply just returns one for the identity operators, which is correct as long as there is no coefficient. When the observable has a coefficient the expectation value should be equal to the coefficient and not one.
The following example calculates the expectation value of an observable in three different ways.
which returns:
As can be seen qsimcirq returns 1 regardless of the coefficient which I think is related to #565 and #566. I'm using 0.14.1.dev20220804.
