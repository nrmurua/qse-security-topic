When we apply exponentiation to PauliSumOp and evolve it using LieTrotter class, we get incorrect quantum circuit. The problem happens only with two-qubit Pauli operator.
The correct quantum circuit is:
Change the first line of _two_qubit_evolution method to:
labels_as_array = np.array(list(reversed(pauli.to_label()))) 
May I give it a shot ?
Hi @Dibyaprakash, since it was a tiny fix on code that I was very familiar with I just went ahead and implemented it. If you're interested in finding a PR to work on I can help you find one that suits you!
@Cryoris I will be happy to work. Please let me know if you come across something interesting.
