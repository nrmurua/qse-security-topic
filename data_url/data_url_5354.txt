Lightning currently uses GCC 10 for all released wheels to PyPI. Since adopting more C++20 features, we require support for newer compilers.
We aim to build all releases using GCC 11 (g++-11) for future releases.
This will involves several steps to https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/blob/master/.github/workflows/wheel_linux_x86_64.yml:
Installing GCC11 onto the building container here using:
Updating references from gcc-10 to gcc-11 throughout
Updating references from g++-10 to g++-11 throughout
Ensuring all tests pass in the CI
