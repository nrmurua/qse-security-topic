Hi, I am now using QISKit to realize quantum fourier transform. I run the code provided by you in this link.
The input state is set to 000 by default. Is there any methods to change the input, for example to 001?
Could you please answer my question? Thank you so much!
Hi @yangjy0826
To change the initial qubit from 0 to 1 you can apply the X gate.
In the 4th cell of the notebook the statement q = QuantumRegister(3) creates a quantum register with 3 qubits all in state 0.
To change one qubit from 0 to 1 you can apply X to that particular qubit (using the qubit index) right after you create the circuit. The 4th cell becomes:
Note: The original tutorial "creates a state from which a QFT will return 1"
Oh I understand! That's smart. Thank you so much! But I still have a question: when you designed this package, why didn't you consider to design a function to set the initial input value?
because that is really user code to make the state to have the Fourier transform applied to.  I think this should be left to the user but the user can use the initializer method to make the state they want.
I am going to close this as its not really a bug but if you want more methods for making initial inputs please open another issue and we can discuss how.
OK, thanks!
