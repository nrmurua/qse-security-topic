This is raised five times for every execution on the 20q devices.
talked to @pacomf as this is doing the same to me he is going to look into it.
After talking to @diego-plan9 and @pacomf this needs to be a patch to Qiskit-terra as assemble is using backend.defaults for circuits and this endpoint is only present for pulse backends.
So this error only occurs on the 20q devices that actually support pulse (but the flag still looks to be False).  Running on smaller devices does not return this error.
this seems to be fixed now.
