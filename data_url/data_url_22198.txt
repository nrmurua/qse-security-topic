(From #630)
@r-srinivas Please a print into the dashboard (here: https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/dashboard/applets_ccb.py#L190) to check that it correctly receives the applet deletion request.
Or better, dump all calls to ccb_notify, so you can see the applet creation request as well which confirms you have modified the file correctly.
I'm using artiq 3.0.dev py_252+git5b7e068 so it should have the fix for #629, and indeed it can create new groups now.
Adding print(service) to ccb_notify, on the dashboard I see,
So it looks like it's getting the command. Just to clarify, create_applet doesn't enable the applet. While the code_applet.py is running, I check it to see the countdown. Then at the end it should disable it and the applet should disappear, right? I'm wondering if the errors in between affect the disabling?
On the virtual machine (3.0.dev+252.g5b7e068),
Doesn't disable either.
Stupid question, does right click -> global/group CCB policy -> Create and enable applets fix the problem?
it should disable it and the applet should disappear, right?
Yes.

Looks like that works, plus the #630 error message. Modifying the global CCB policy doesn't change the command entry for a particular group though.
Is having the create+enable on required for disabling to work how it's intended to work?
That's how it's intended to work. "Enable" could be changed to a term that means "mess with the user's windows", if we can find a good one.
Okay, thanks. Maybe modify? User customisable?
It is user customizable already: ARTIQ is open source, you can patch your local installation :)
And this is a terrible idea. The purpose of a better name is to teach first-time users, asking them to customize it right away actually makes things worse.
I went for "enable/disable". "Modify" is too vague, as it can also mean that the applet list is being modified.
I should clarify that I meant user customisable as a name, as in the user can customise how the applets appear. Enable/disable seems fine, though slightly confusing with also being able to enable/disable applets, but is to enable/disable ccb? Maybe something along the lines of experiment controlled as more descriptive?
Edit: I see you made it enable/disable applets. That seems sufficiently clear to me.
