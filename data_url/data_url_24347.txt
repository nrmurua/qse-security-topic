Review Ansys Q3D analysis and HFSS eigenmode analysis and find paint points, missing improvements, things to smooth, revise, features needed
Document as features in issues.
@marcolincs  you can go over this with Dennis and Thomas and over the tutorial we are making with Dennis now for Thursday.
We need to smooth and automate the flow
Goal of this is to mark issues to do for a next scrum
Several issues created. Last but not least #255 . We shall close this case, and just make it a habit for us to loop on this stuff periodically.
Cheers
