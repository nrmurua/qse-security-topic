We need to catch errors. Right now one can get
Unhandled erros in Deferred
which is very hard to debug.
The most simple solution is to make a try/except block around anything that yields a Deferred as follows:
then the error is at least printed.
@LeonWubben is this also done in virtNode/virtual.py?
We also need to check if there is a function that returns deferred then we should add an error-callback as:
I haven't checked virtual.py yet.
Any other files we should check?
There are three usages of addCallback; in startCQC, serverTest (this file is duplicated btw), and in virtual.py
