When two QobjEvo objects are added up that have time dependence with the same parameter names but with different values in the arg dictionary, the combined QObjEvo merges the dictionaries, resulting in the wrong time dependence for some of the Hamiltonians.

A QobjEvo contain only one args dictionary, thus it cannot handle overlapping names.
There are plans to change this in the next major release (already changed in dev.major), but not in v4.
