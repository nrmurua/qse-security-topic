The current issue which can be seen from the file is that measuring q1 gives a broader arrow of 1 line instead of conventional 2 line narrower arrow.
It can be seen in the file
Checking the qiskit-terra file and looking for some bug in the matplot library section.

If this unintentional can someone assign it to me?
If you have the source, this has been fixed in the current master and the fix should also be in the next release.
ok thanks for informing.
