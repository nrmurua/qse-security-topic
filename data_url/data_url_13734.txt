It would be good to settle on a terminology convention for these that can be used throughout the library.
The following is proposed:
In zero-noise extrapolation the noise of a quantum program is scaled by a scale_factor using a noise_scaling method. An example class of a noise scaling methods are folding_methods.
Thoughts? Suggestions?

I agree with this terminology.
In my previous comment(s), I wasn't accounting for the fact that not all noise scaling methods will be local/global unitary folding methods.
I agree.  I would also propose to use scale_factors (with a final s) instead of the scalars argument  used in most  Factory objects.
I support this suggestion @andreamari
