Describe the bug
docker pull has been flaky in both CircleCI and GitHub Actions, sometimes failing with a 503 status code.
To Reproduce
See https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/actions/runs/6343943016 and https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/2854/workflows/18e3969f-ba5e-4aaf-b29b-e6b19634608a.
Expected behavior
docker pull should complete successfully, as it usually does.
Additional context
As of now, this is a very low urgency issue, and workflows usually pass when re-run. (Maybe a one-day problem? We'll see.) That said, if it persists, it will get in the way of our development work, so it's worth tracking.
This indeed looks like a --hopefully very rare-- infrastructure problem -- I do not see what we can do at liboqs level to fix this -- short of moving off docker hub with the CI images: Is that the proposal? If so, where to?
Since docker pull hasn't (at least as far as I've seen) been a problem other than that one day last week, I think this issue can safely be closed.
