DRTIO satellites hang on sending TSC if there's a further satellite connected.
If there's another satellite connected to a satellite (master -> sat1 -> sat2), it (sat1) will ping the other (sat2) and hang at https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/firmware/satman/repeater.rs#L200 - master will not be able to get a response out of sat1.
Release-7 has no such problems, thus probably it was related to clocking changes. Will need further investigation.
Repeaters working fine.
Hangs after this. Master has 'ping failed'.
