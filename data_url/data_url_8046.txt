QuTiP Qobj has a tinyup() method that sets to 0 all values lower than a certain threshold defined by settings.auto_tidyup_atol:

As explained in here, the user should be able to change this value.
Playing with this options I realized that changing the qutip.settings.auto_tidyup to False works, but changing the qutip.settings.auto_tidyup_atol value doesn't.
The first print should have been:
When multiplying a * 1e-15, QuTiP calls the __mul__ magic method, where out.tidyup() is called:

Tidyup contains one argument set to settings.auto_tidyup_atol by default. This value should change to 1e-30 when running qutip.settings.auto_tidyup_atol = 1e-30, but this never happens. Consequently, the output value is set to 0.
