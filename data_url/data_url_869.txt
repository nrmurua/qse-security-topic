Describe the bug
When using a rotate gate (such as RZ), if by mistake the user swaps the order of the parameters, no error flag is risen. This is a potential issue because in QISKIT, the order of the parameters is the opposite (i.e., first the angle and then the qubit).
To reproduce
qc.rz(np.pi/2,1)
This is interpreted as a rotation of $1$ radian on the second qubit, i.e. $floor(np.pi/2)=1$.
Instead, it should be interpreted as an error, to avoid potential mistakes.
Expected behavior
The gate should check that the first parameter (i.e. the gate index) is an integer. If a float is sent, the gate should given an error.
