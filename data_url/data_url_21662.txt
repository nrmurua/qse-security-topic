When generating a device_db.py from a sinara-systems JSON description files using artiq_ddb_template, aliases and network devices are not supported.
Are there known problems associated with describing aliases and network devices in the JSON files?
Support aliases and network devices in JSON descriptions and artiq_ddb_template.
Also requires modifying minimally other Kasli generic tooling.
It's a device database template.
I would like to keep the JSON descriptions simple (i.e. stick to Sinara hardware, which is where the difficulty is for writing device databases with the correct RTIO channels) and not include support for whatever can be done in the device database.
Note that device databases are Python, and you can rename the template to device_db_template.py and then have a device_db.py file like this:
Thanks, makes sense. From the end-user point of view, it's just very attractive to have one single file describing all the hardware. But I also see the potential escalation with adding more and more extra features to the JSON file / ddb_template generator.
Those template files are generated on our server (nixbld.m-labs.hk) and it doesn't seem convenient to have users somehow send their whole lab hardware description to the build server.
