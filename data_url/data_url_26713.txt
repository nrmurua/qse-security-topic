The Intel regression test fails because of a floating point exception FE_INVALID in grid_collocate_unittest.
Yes, I've added a check for some floating point exceptions in 4ce1476.
To investigate this further we'd have to trap the SIGFPE signal and print the backtrace.
Alternatively, we could just remove the check for FE_INVALID - it's probably caused by some compiler optimization anyways.
We should ignore that exception or downgrade it to a warning unless you think that is a serious issue. The Intel compiler did not print any notification. It seems that issue is compiler dependent, since it does not appear with GNU compiler.
Yes, I think icc -O2 implies -fp-model=fast, for which the docs explicitly state that floating point exception might occur.
I think FE_DIVBYZERO and FE_OVERFLOW are the important ones and grid_collocate_unittest is only meant as a smoke test anyways.
I added -fp-model precise also to the CFLAGS (in addition to the FFLAGS) , but there is still one FE_INVALID in the printout. So, it is indeed better to drop that check.
