Suggestion by @nathanshammah:
the print message during the optimization, instead of having start and end date and time, could just report the total running time.
I find absolute time stamps important, but having the duration reported in addition sounds like a good idea. Example output:
where  (1 day, 1:37:44) is the total running time (delta of "end" timestamp and "start" timestamp).
