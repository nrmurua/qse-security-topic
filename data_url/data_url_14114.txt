TheHoareOptimizer pass in Qiskit's transpiler incorrectly removes Hadamard gates from a circuit. This behavior persists even with the fix #11175 for the issue #11174.
The following Python code shows the bug:
This results in incorrect optimization:
Since the conditional (c==1) is false, the Hadamard gates should not cancel each other out.
I think the correct optimization can only remove the second Hadamard gate:
No response
I imagine that the HoareOptimizer pass has no handling at all for classical conditions and is silently ignoring them, but I have little-to-no knowledge of it.  @ajavadia or @ewinston, please could you look?
