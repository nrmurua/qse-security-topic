The Kernel.for_loop only allows for iterators wherein the start < stop index. Example
We should also support the opposite case -- or at least temporarily throw an explicit error. This currently results in a JIT error.
Tentatively adding this to 0.5 - P2, so tbd if it will make it or be included in the next one.
I think you need an extra bit of information here someplace. As specified, it could be interpreted that
steps from size-1 to size ... up to MAX_INT and does a two-complement wrap in 64 bits (possibly?) then does the entire negative range of integers until incrementing up to 0.
So perhaps we need a for_loop_decrement or something like that?
