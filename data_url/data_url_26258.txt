There currently exists a function is_product_vector.py. Given a vector, the function determines if it qualifies as a bipartite product vector. It also provides the vector decomposition of the input vector.
Ideally, this function should be renamed to is_product.py and should include the ability to detect not just whether a vector is a product vector, but also whether a density matrix living in a bipartite space is a product state as well.
Completed in d341459.
