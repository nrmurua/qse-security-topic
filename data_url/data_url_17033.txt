The default transpilation method uses TrivialLayout that always starts at qubit 0.  It is often times better to select a different line of qubits elsewhere on the device.  TrivialLayout should go through the device and select the linear chain of qubits with best noise properties.
I'm closing this as wont fix based on:

But for the trivial_layout let's not do noise-aware [...], because trivial layout has explicitly been defined as an i->i mapping of qubits and this is something many people want. What #3102 proposes can be a NoiseAwareLinearLayout or something, but i'm not sure how useful that is so I'd recommend not doing it before a need arises.
