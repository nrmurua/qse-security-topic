In my branch I extended the EnumerationEngine class to accept an additional argument print_format (-> screenshot). It defaults to text but when specifying HTML it produces a joint distribution table as shown in the attached screen-shot.
If you agree that this is a nice feature to have, I will incorporate this as I go along for all other print output that could be wrapped into a HTML table.

I added 99% of the changes in your jupyter_output_enhancements branch, including your notebook for the meetup you held in Toronto on Dec-19-2016
