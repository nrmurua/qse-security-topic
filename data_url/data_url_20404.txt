We should add a page in the Wiki with some examples of using liboqs in C programs.  This would include conventions on how to request parameters, how to do set up the RNG, what arguments to pass in to functions, who is responsible for freeing variables (and which functions to use to free them - OQS_KEX_alice_priv_free, OQS_MEM_secure_free).
Minimal example is in the wiki now
Thanks Vlad!!
What is the #include <../src/common/common.h> for?  Should it use #include <oqs/common.h> instead?
Also, what would you think about putting this example inside the test folder of liboqs and building it alongside everything else in Travis to ensure it stays functional and up-to-date?
@dstebila Will do. I'll use <oqs/common.h>, the previous one was used in test_kex.c which was the initial code I stripped down.
@dstebila Minimal example with a pq signature is now added on the Wiki page.
@smashra Hi Shravan, can you please give me a hand with adding those 2 minimal examples (minimal_kex_oqs and minimal_sig_oqs) in the test suite? I'm not entirely familiar with how the whole "autoconf" stuff works...
