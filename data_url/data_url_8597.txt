The installation seems to succeed, but there seems to be a problem when the tests are run (or when I go into python, trying to load anything like from qutip import * gives an error.
The script gives the following error (which can be reproduced by just running import qutip.testing as qt in python):
Yes, there is is some issue where the Cython compiler can not find the NumPy array header file.  This occurs only with HomeBrew and I am looking into it.
I don't know if this is helpful, but I can get a different error if I first import numpy:
I can not reproduce the second error that you mention.  In addition, it seems that the error with homebrew is not a QuTiP issue, but rather some issue with the build_ext command used there. I am not 100% what the error is, but the include file directory does not seem to be passed to the compiler.
Installation using MacPorts and Anaconda (without the Fortran mcsolver) both work fine on OSX.  I would recommend using one of those.
As this is not a QuTiP issue, I will close this.  However, it seems that we should not include the Home Brew installation scripts in the next release.  In principle, there is nothing that prevents the user from obtaining the same packages as the script manually if they still wanted to use Home Brew.
I am not so sure about it not being a QuTIP issues, this doesn't seem to happen with other modules (also installed with homebrew) requiring numpy/arrayobject.h....
I have just had the same problem, (I installed additional stuff with home-brew and it broke qutip).
As a complete hack workaround I noticed that DistUtil was passing to the qutip cython builder only (in my case)
/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7
whereas numpy was returning
np.get_include() ->  /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include
For some reason this is not being passed in properly by qutip's setup.py.
Rather than dig any further I just did..
ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include/numpy /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/numpy
So I could get on with things.
Hi @nonhermitian, I spent some time struggling with this as I recently shifted to macOS. This problem affects other Python installations too. I found a solution to this and if you could update it in the docs instead of the default macOS installation script, then it would be very helpful for new users. I will post the solution first and explain it below.
brew install python
Change the default Python interpreter from the one supplied by macOS in usr/bin/python to the user installed version in /usr/local/bin/python. This is explained in this post. Edit the file /etc/paths using sudo vi etc/paths and move the line /usr/local/bin to the top. This makes the user installed Python default and the packages installed by pip or brew are imported instead of the ones supplied by apple. Restart the terminal. You may need to update numpy and scipy using pip install numpy or pip install numpy -U
Install qutip using python setup.py install
Apple has its own Python version and a few modules such as numpy and scipy come along with it which are at /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7. These modules are difficult to manage and update due to issues with permission. Hence, even if you update numpy or scipy using pip or brew, it is not detected by Python. This also raises an issue later error: could not create 'build/src.macosx-10.12-x86_64-2.7': Permission denied
This solution seems better since it does not mess with the system default.
Edit 1 : sudo -H is needed to install using sudo -H python setup.py install. The -H tag sets the home directory as the default for installing configuration files.
I am now trying to setup a developement environment using python setup.py develop and python setup.py build_ext --inplace but getting the error
I have gcc and gfortran installed and I suspect this might also be due to some issue with the file paths. I will try to get a workaround and post soon.
