After #1689 is resolved, the return type of both sim.run and sim.run_sweep will be identical. The only difference between them is that one takes a sweep and one takes a parameter resolver. But we can use a common parameter for both cases, so that a sweep is called in exactly the same way as a non-sweep, just with parameters = a sweep instead of parameters = a dict.
I also think that sample is less ambiguous than run.
Need to remember to update documentation on rename of sample and run.
Should there be a similar refactoring for the simulate method?
Yes, simulate should become e.g. final_wavefunction or sample_wavefunction.
Sampler ended up being a different concept, with run being reserved to return the TrialResult while sample returns the dataframe.  TrailResult also gives access to the dataframe via data.
