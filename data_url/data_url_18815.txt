How about restricting feasible operations among lengths, stretches and numbers?
I personally think the followings would be sufficient (at least for use cases mentioned in :
BTW, so far, I don't find any use case when backtracking operations is necessary. For example, the case described in the current spec sheet, we can write it simpler without - as below. We might not need to allow -.
I think the operations are a fair point to clarify (as we defined operations for the other types, see https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm/blob/master/source/language/classical.rst#integers and later in page).
I would argue that one should be allowed any of the same operations as for floating point numbers (as that is what the length/stretch types get resolved to at compile time).
