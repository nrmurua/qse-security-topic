Only build_waveform is called by the AtomicPTs build_sequence method.
Solution: Overwrite MeasurementDefiner methods in AtomicPT?
IMHO, a proper fix requires better handling of atomicity. As a workaround I suggest raising a warning if an AtomicPT is constructed with subtemplates that define measurements.
