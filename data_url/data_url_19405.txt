Describe the bug
I believe this is a bug of the new Qibo version. When you use the circuit.set_parameters(params) you receive as well some prints, so if you use it inside a loop you are basically receiving prints from circuit.set_parameters constantly.

Do you have a minimal example to reproduce this issue?
There are several leftover prints in the RZ gate here, so I suspect this is the issue.
By the way, it would be a good idea if we could check that unwanted messages are not printed during testing. This way we could avoid such problems in the future.
Yes, here it is:
I believe this should reproduce the error
