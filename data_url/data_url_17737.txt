The plot_state() function exposes a wigner method when running in mpl mode, but this not a valid method when using interactive mode.
Try to run plot_state() in jupyter with mode='interactive' and method='wigner'.
plot_state() exposes the same plotting methods between interactive and local mpl mode.
Either add it to interactive or remove it from plot_state. Depends on the result of #1106
@filemaster is this something you can support?
I will take a look... It will require to generate a new interactive visualization mode.
@ajavadia, I was taking a look to the Wigner method. It seems to work only with Tomography module and I tried to generate data from this module to populate the figure, but the Tomography module  seems to be broken.
closing as we are not supporting the standard version.
