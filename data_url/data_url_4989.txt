Gcc  throws a compile error for me when building with OpenMP support after commit f8c0e7f
gcc -x c -O2 -std=c99 -mavx -Wall -DQuEST_PREC=2 -fopenmp -fpic -I ../../QuEST/QuEST/src/../include -I ../../QuEST/QuEST/src/CPU -I../../QuEST/QuEST/src -c  ../../QuEST/QuEST/src/CPU/QuEST_cpu.c ../../QuEST/QuEST/src/CPU/QuEST_cpu.c: In function ‘statevec_multiControlledMultiQubitUnitaryLocal’:  ../../QuEST/QuEST/src/CPU/QuEST_cpu.c:1856:62: error: ‘g’ undeclared (first use in this function) private (thisTask,thisInd00,thisGlobalInd00,ind,i,t,r,c,g,reElem,imElem, ampInds,reAmps,imAmps) ^  ../../QuEST/QuEST/src/CPU/QuEST_cpu.c:1856:62: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
(I also commented on the commit itself but later realised that github doesn't send notifications for commit comments by default)
That's a leftover OpenMP var g from this patch. Patched with two backspaces. Cheers!
