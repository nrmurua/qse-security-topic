That coupling_map is None implies all-to-all connectivity is codified in CheckMap https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/a8a0d1be26b5df097e7a21016fa21550a3c4efce/qiskit/transpiler/passes/utils/check_map.py#L46 , which functionally means that routing passes wouldn't need to know how to handle coupling_map is None in their run() method, since CheckMap would reliably skip running a routing pass if coupling_map is None.
However, SabreSwap makes some modifications to self.coupling_map (likely for sake of performance) in it's __init__ https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/a8a0d1be26b5df097e7a21016fa21550a3c4efce/qiskit/transpiler/passes/routing/sabre_swap.py#L126 . Likely, this should be updated to if coupling_map.is_symmetric or coupling_map is None:.
Hi, I have reproduced this issue with the following minimal example.
I would like to attempt to resolve this.
@mcbennet: sure, I can assign it to you, so others know you're working on it.
