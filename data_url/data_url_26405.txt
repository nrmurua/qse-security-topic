Hello ðŸ‘‹ . I'm a maintainer for the Homebrew project. While packaging v2024.1 of cp2k, we are encountering a failure with only our Linux build. It appears to be trying to download libgrpp despite us not enabling that feature.
Of note: wget isn't found because it is not installed unless actually required as a dependency. In this case, since we are not using libgrpp features, I would think that this wouldn't download at all. Any assistance here would be greatly appreciated.
Relates to Homebrew/homebrew-core#158906
By default, the libgrpp library is installed with the toolchain in the newest release. To actively disable the feature, you should run the toolchain script with --with-libgrpp=no. Was that the case for you?
@p-linnane, thanks a lot for taking care of the Homebrew package!
This might be a good time to try out our new CMake build system. We're planning to phase out the Makefile and the toolchain this year.
Adding --with-libgrpp=no worked. Thank you both for your help. I will look into moving over to CMake now that this version bump is unblocked.
