Hey pyEPR team,
I've recently updated my pyEPR from the 2015 version to the most recent version. I've noticed you've removed the capability to define a lumped inductor to be linear if you don't want to perform an EPR analysis on it. Is there still a way to deal with linear lumped element inductors?
👏👏👏 You are awesome! Thank you for making your first issue to pyEPR ' first issue
