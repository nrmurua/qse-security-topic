The tensor of two pauli_error gates after a two qubit gate is different from previous versions. Applying the gate
to a circuit with only a cx gate. (essentially identity circuit) results in the dictionary
In previous versions, it results in something close to what I would expect given my understanding of the pauli_error which would be.
Revert to the old behavior or explain in the documentation what a tensored pauli_error is supposed to do in practice.
It looks like a bug in the QuantumError.to_dict method, which is flatting all instructions to qubits [0, ..., n-1]. I will put in a fix for this
