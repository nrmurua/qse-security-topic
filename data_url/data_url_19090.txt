When the optimize_pulses routine is called e.g. with iter_stop=0 (or anything that leads to the optimization ending after the initial forward propagation), the optimized_pulses variable is never set. As a result, there is a crash when trying to set the optimized_controls attribute of the result object.
The correct behavior is for optimized_controls to be equal to guess_controls.
Moreover, with store_all_pulses=True in combination with iter_stop=0, the guess pulses in result.all_pulses are not discretized correctly to the intervals of the time grid.
