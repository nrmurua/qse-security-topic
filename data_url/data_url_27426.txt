This may only apply to VISA instrument parameters, the error that arises is below.
This is a minimal working example from the Keithley SMU, in this case the get command fails but the set command is fine.
In Jupyter I run
What's also strange is that instrument initialisation takes a lot longer (~ 30s, usually its < 1s) when I include the second sense_mode parameter.
I've thought about this more and I don't think this is a bug, it's the expected behaviour because a Parameter created in an arbitrary context doesn't know about it's instrument or parent.
Well hold your horses, I think this is a bug and should be resolved.
I understand that at the start the instantiated parameter does not have a parent and consequently get/set shouldn't work.
However, once you attach it to a ParameterNode, its parent is set and so it shouldn't fail anymore.
I think the way to resolve this is by having the get/set cmd access the parameter parent. If this isn't defined it raises an error, but only once the get/set is called. This way, the parent can be defined later. What do you think?
