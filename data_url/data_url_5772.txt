when a quantum circuit has cswap gates, then using aer_simulator_density_matrix backend the code breaks with a qiskit error
QiskitError: 'ERROR:  [Experiment 0] Circuit circuit-16 contains invalid instructions {"gates": {cswap}} for "density_matrix" method. ,  ERROR: Circuit circuit-16 contains invalid instructions {"gates": {cswap}} for "density_matrix" method.'
Please run this code with necessary imports
It should execute & return the experiment count example like this when I run in statevector simulator

Not every simulation method supports all gates, they each have different basis gates they support. You can just call transpile() to have qiskit compile the circuit for the specified aer backend with the simulation method set. So in your code example above calling: transpile(qc_qsp, sim_density) prior to the sim_density.run() line will do this. That will compile the input circuit to something that can be run with the density matrix simulation method.
Thank you @mtreinish
thats correct and hence closing this issue
