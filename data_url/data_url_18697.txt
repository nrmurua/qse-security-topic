In certain highly favorable cases, the optimal 2Q compilation routines may be robust enough to support parametric decomposition of continuously-specified parametric gates. This would enable a host of very advanced fast-feedback features.
Some purely algebraic results about this can be found at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07345.pdf .
I think we have done as good a job as possible in implementing this via ... AS PAULI-SUM.
