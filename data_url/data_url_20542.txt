Hello, When I am running below command for openssl smime, getting an error as captured in the screenshot:
command :
/home/jiten/oqs/openssl/apps/openssl smime -sign -in governance_pqc_dl3.xml -text -out governance.smime -signer maincacert_pqc_dl3.pem -inkey maincakey_pqc_dl3.pem
Error message :

required_files.zip
Could you please try to reproduce this error using the more well-supported OpenSSL3+oqsprovider? Simplest probably would be by using the docker Image 'openquantumsafe/oqs-ossl3' for this.
Thanks. This worked.
