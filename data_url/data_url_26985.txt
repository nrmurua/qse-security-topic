Current version of QUICK doesn't write output files readable by visualization software (eg. Avogadro, VMD, molden and etc.). This is an important feature and should be added to QUICK ASAP. As a first step, exporting coordinates, charges, orbitals, energies, electron densities and potentials into molden and QCSchema/JSON formats  can be done. @agoetz Please add if you have any thoughts.
Output of Molden files has been implemented. QCSchema still to be added.
