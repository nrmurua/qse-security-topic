When running the Bloch sphere visualization function, the following warning message appears:
No warning message
Refactor mathplotlib related codes not to use deprecated feature.
This is something we tried to fix recently in #6087 (since the deprecation warnings broke CI). It looks like the only way we'll be able to fix all the deprecation warnings is if we bump the minimum matplotlib version to 3.4. I think we're likely going to wait to do this until the matplotlib 3.5 release forces us to.
