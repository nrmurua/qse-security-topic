In simulators/2_device_noise_simulation.ipynb tutorial, the FakeVigo backend is referred to as ibmq_vigo (here and here) however when running device_backend.backend_name what is returned is fake_vigo.
In the code this name is explicitly indicated (on this line), but it is also true the configuration file that is assigned here, in which it continues to say ibmq_vigo (here). Although in this case, I think what backend_name returns should be the way this backend is referenced to in the tutorial.
Hi, can I work on this issue?
Hi @saktar-unr - pardon our delay. If you're still interested, yes, this would help! I'm transferring this issue to qiskit-aer because the tutorial now lives there.
