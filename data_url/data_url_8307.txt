With the Google Summer of Code 2019 project by @BoxiLi on noise models, we are making some big changes to update the QIP module. One of the things that came up is having a DeviceProcessor or Device``ï¿½ class which interfaces with hardware implementations directly and runs quantum circuits on models such as SpinChain, cQED. We will also work towards linking the OptPulseProcessor to find optimal pulses to implement a circuit and add a noise` module.
I am opening this issue to discuss the restructuring of the QIP module and also adding a measure function/module (later) to get samples and expectation values from a circuit. We c can use this thread to discuss other issues too regarding the QIP module and how we can interface it better to QuTiP core functionalities.

@BoxiLi please feel free to suggest, change or discuss more on this issue as you continue working on it. Thanks.
It seems more natural for me to put gates, qft, measurement all under a module called operations. From the view of quantum information theory, measurement no different than a non-unitary operation.
On the other hand, functions in gate.py seem to be used quite a lot (also inside qutip, like swap). I'm not sure if from qutip.qip.operations import swap is too cumbersome?
I think this has been addressed by #1042 (GSoC project on noise in quantum circuit). Feel free to reopen if this is not the case or it only partially addresses this.
