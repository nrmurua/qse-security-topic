Attempting to add a .pylintrc such as is used in Terra and Aer results in several hundred linter errors.
These errors need to be fixed so we can enable proper linting and improve future code quality.
What is the intended .pylintrc file? Exactly the one currently present in Terra?
I think that should be the goal (and we use pylint: disable in code when needed to override).
I added part of it in #336, but couldn't add the full file due to a lot of other inter errors. I believe a lot of them were related to the doc strings.
