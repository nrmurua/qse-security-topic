In the DAGCircuit api there are 2 methods to get the quantum predecessors and successors of a node in the DAG. However, there are not matching methods available to follow the classical wires. There are some cases where it's good to be able to traverse the graph on classical bits (see: 1575b8a#diff-df5e0c6b04d9ea56420653f11b66b75d78856b979e1e43abe8cf4e1b78ed9a4aR2446 for one such example). So we should add matching DAGCircuit.classical_predecessors and DAGCircuit.classical_successors methods to enable doing this without having to go to the inner graph object directly.
I'd like to work on this, could I be assigned please?
Sure np, thanks for volunteering. You are assigned now
@javabster are you still working on the issue? Let me know if I can help you in any way.
Hi @yusharth sorry for the slow reply, I am still working on this with someone else already, but thank-you for the offer
