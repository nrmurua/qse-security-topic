When I tried to construct a parameterized quantum circuit with multiple-controlled quantum gates with RYGate(theta).control(num_ctrl_qubits=5, ctrl_state='01101'), [0,1,2,3,4,5]) in ubuntu OS, it turns to be a warning that TypeError: ParameterExpression with unbound parameters ({ParameterVectorElement(Î¸[0])}) cannot be cast to a float.. If I applied this controlled gate with fewer control qubits, the warning would not occur. By contrast, as I ran the codes in windows OS, nothing unexpected happened, in the case of the same version of qiskit.
I don't know what is wrong with that and I wonder whether ubuntu OS triggers this bug.
Run the below codes, especially in ubuntu
The program crash should not happen like that in windows OS.
No response
Please refer to issue #10697 .
I'm experiencing this exact issue.
I'm experiencing this exact issue.
My temporary solution is to give up the parameterized circuit and directly bind parameters when applying the rotation gates.
This is related to issue #10311.
