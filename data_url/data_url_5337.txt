Currently the design of the namespace packages requires all 0.0.Y releases to match in version to lightning.qubit. In the instance of a bug-fix release of lightning.kokkos or lightning.gpu, this requires lightning.qubit also be incremented.
We can ensure  lightning.kokkos and lightning.gpu only depend on the 0.X version of lightning.qubit to allow it to remain stationary, during development and under bug-fix releases.
Hello, is this issue still open? If yes please let me know and any additional information to solve this one would be appreciated.
