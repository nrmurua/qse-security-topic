Transferred from smoltcp-rs/smoltcp#96.
We have an experiment which runs in a loop, updating some datasets and running scheduler.check_pause() on each iteration. Every few minutes, it terminates with the error message
It seems to be caused by a timeout when the ARP entry for the host is invalidated and a new request needs to be sent out on the first of the RPCs. See core log, around 439s. Stripping the code to a minimal example for this isn't as straightforward as I hoped, however. Let me know if you need more information or testing.
I believe that this bug is already fixed in the artiq-3 branch (see commit smoltcp-rs/smoltcp@42c93b9).
