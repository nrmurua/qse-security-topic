The notebook community/optimization/grover.ipynb gives an error after the command
an error message appears that ends with:
AquaError: "Unable to instantiate 'LogicalExpressionOracle', pyeda is not installed. Please look at https://pyeda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html."
Run the grover.ipynb notebook
This command should not give an error
Arrange the pyeda library included as prereq as well.
The pydea library cannot be included in the pre-reqs for Windows as there is not an install package that the author provides to do this. The link provided does however have an install section for Windows.
This is also noted in the Aqua readme in the installation section:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/master/README.md
Suggestion: perhaps add a statement in notebooks where required to warn the user about this pyeda problem
pyeda is no longer required.
