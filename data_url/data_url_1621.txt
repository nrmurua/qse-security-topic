Description of the issue
circuit.insert_at_frontier fails when trying to insert GlobalPhaseOperation because the operation does not have any qubits. As a result, PointOptimizer also fails when the new_operations contain a GlobalPhaseOperation.
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
0.12.0.dev
I just ran into this bug earlier today (and added a one-line fix for it in #4224).
