This is a broad library design topic open for discussion. It can relate to other more specific issues and pull requests, such as #117.
One specific issue is that the name of some test functions is very long and it is not properly formatted in the documentation, both in html and pdf.
From the user perspective, I think that in general remembering as little function and class name as possible helps the usage and with the impression that "wow, that function is magic, it does all that things". From the developer perspective, it may be
So a balance needs to be struck. It also depends on the nature of the library. A library on a consolidated set of tools can be more educational and aim at the former mechanism. A library dealing with evolving concepts, such as mitiq is, may require a more "custom" approach, also as code may evolve in time and keeping things partitioned may be preferable.
At the same time, there is always a user behind all this, that we want to reach, so some thought, discussion and tentative harmonization of structures, after production, may help.
On top of this, there are best practices in coding and software design (many of which I ignore, and I am happy to be lectured about).
@nathanshammah Should this be closed or are there additional topics that you're planning for this milestone?
We could make specific issues for other specific improvements that you have in mind
