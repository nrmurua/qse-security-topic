X90 pulses to qubit via DriveChannel become miscalibrated when a waveform is introduced on ControlChannel tied to same qubit. This occurs even when the waveform is valued at 0 amplitude everywhere, but does not occur when Delay instructions are used on the ControlChannel instead.
See the notebook attached (and read comments for context). This notebook can also be run independently.

Observe that the first zigzag plot is well-calibrated but the second one is not.
Since there is no physical difference between 0-valued pulse and no pulse on ControlChannel, we want to see exact same perfect zigzag behavior in both cases.
Could be something happening on the backend where pulses on different channels tied to the same qubit are mixed. Possible that secondary effect is arising from this?
