Summary: when adding two Programs together, like p1 + p2, the first program p1 gets mutated — p1.calibrations will as a result contain the combined calibrations. But I would have expected both p1 and p2 to remain unchanged.
I believe the reason for issue is that in the source code, it uses p.calibrations.extend(other.calibrations)
which mutates the original’s list
