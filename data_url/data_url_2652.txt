Due to #833
I'll take this.
Not sure what I need to update. The tutorial says GridQubits implement the QubitId class, which just means that they are equatable and hashable. This hasn't changed, right? I mean QubitId still contains those methods. Do i need to add a blurb about howQubitId sorts?
QubitId now has an abstract _comparison_key method that must be implemented by child types, in order to ensure there's a reasonable sorting order for diagrams and that this matches what happens when you call sorted(qubits).
