I have the following code:
where the resource part is only to check the memory usage.
As the loop goes on, the memory usage increases. Why?
For this kind of circuit we still talk about few bytes, but I have this problem also for larger circuits, and, in that context, the script terminates.
As far as I know, the memory usage should remain constant
The reported issue was originally posted here https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/34949/increasing-memory-usage-of-simulation-of-quantum-circuits-in-a-for-loop I had tried it quickly and noted the same behavior but the versions I was using were the latest - well it was Aer 0.13.0 before 0.13.1 shipped.
@simonecantori  Could you test using the latest Aer 0.13.1 and QIskit 0.45 ?
I observed increasing the resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss value, but I did not observe memory shortage even I tested with 27 qubits.
Also could you use psutil.virtual_memory().used to check the memory usage?

@doichanj Thanks for your answer. Using qiskit-aer 0.13.1 and qiskit 0.45 solved the problem.
