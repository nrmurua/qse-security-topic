"High-accuracy" DFT calculation with large number of KPs and high cutoff. Occurs for both Li and Na MOLOPT-PBE-GTH basis sets (for all number of valence electrons). Input for Li is attached.
Running with: OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 mpirun -np 96 cp2k.psmp ....
Seems independent of number of ranks or number of kpoints. Reducing cutoff makes the segfault go away, as does disabling the calculation of Hirshfeld charges. With master from b48b44a.
GDB backtrace and function argument info for the last frame:

If someone wants to investigate on the Hutter group infra:
Very interesting! My first guess would be an integer overflow.
Could you try to capture a reproducer .task file by uncommenting this line? You'll also have to move up the call to record_collocate() in order to finish writing before the segfault. Then we could easily replay the crash via the grid_miniapp.
