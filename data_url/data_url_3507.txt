Hi,
I am trying to simulate 8Q-Agave QC using the qvm. However, my get_qc('8Q-Agave') command is producing an error, am I doing something wrong?

Unfortunately, the 8Q-Agave device is not available. With that said, you can still use a QVM with the number of qubits of your choosing:
qvm = get.qc('9q-square-noisy-qvm')
Basically, the rule of thumb for the string you provide to get_qc is (1) number of qubits, (2-optional) topology, (3-optional) noise, (4) QVM or QPU (no qvm when you're running on the QPU, which you'll need QCS for- rigetti.com/qcs).
