Dear Jens and others,
I already sent an email about this. Now I tried more and have it opened as issue
1.Having a Tektronix TPS 2012B scope
2.can connect to it with pyvisa
3. cannot connect to it with qcodes which is based on pyvisa
I expect to connect to TPS 2012B
I cannot connect best to see this video:
https://www.dropbox.com/t/NLpXHO8Sz4Alc9E3
It would be helpful to provide such information:
operating system
Windows 10
If you are using a released version of qcodes (recommended):
qcodes 0.32.0
@gztony1227
It looks like you can connect with pyvisa but get a time out when connecting via QCoDeS.
Could you try to log what is going on
E.g. something like
And print the output here. That should help us figure out when the timeout happens
Dear Jens @jenshnielsen ,
Thank you for looking into this. I appreciate it.
I'm not sure why I'm even having issue to make the logger or logging work:
Following:
https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/logging/logging_example.html#
Combinations/variations I tried so far:
import logging
import qcodes.logger as logger
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.TPS2012 import TPS2012
log = logging.getLogger('example_logger')
log.debug('This message will not be visible as the logging level is set to DEBUG')
with logger.console_level(logging.DEBUG):
log.debug('This message is visible as the logging level is temporarily elevated to DEBUG')
with logger.console_level(level=logging.DEBUG):
scope = TPS2012('tek', 'ASRL5::INSTR')
I get error in the logging:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\Users\gzton\anaconda3\envs\Qcodes\lib\site-packages\IPython\core\interactiveshell.py", line 3444, in run_code
exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
File "", line 8, in 
with logger.console_level(logging.DEBUG):

raise RuntimeError("Console handler is None. Cannot set the level"
RuntimeError: Console handler is None. Cannot set the level on it
Sorry you probably need to enable the logger first

Hi Jens @jenshnielsen ,
Here is the printed output:
any idea what went wrong? If it's not obvious, maybe we can zoom? I sent you my calendar for available times in the email.
best,
Tony
You see above here
2022-06-01 12:54:07,376 ¦ qcodes.instrument.base ¦ DEBUG ¦ base ¦ get_idn ¦ 599 ¦ [tek(TPS2012)] Error getting or interpreting *IDN?: ''
That when we are asking *IDN? to the instrument we are not getting the expected result back.
If open the instrument with pyvisa directly. Could you try sending the same command with
where inst is the instrument created from open_resource
and see if that returns anything
I have added a pr here #4215 to fix the (unrelated) warnings that you are seeing and improve the debug information. If you are comfortable with running code from git you could try running that branch
Hi Jens @jenshnielsen ,
Yeah, with pyvisa, using following codes:
I get correct output:
I have connected numerous instruments with qcodes. This is a very strange case. Do you have a local instrument with exactly model to try?
I wonder if the terminator is set wrong. Looking at this manual it seems like the read terminator can be configured by put the instrument should take any terminator
https://download.tek.com/manual/071144104web.pdf page 90
we don’t set any terminator so you could check what the instrument is set to and then pass terminator=“\n” or whatever makes sense
I unfortunately no longer have access to a tps 2012
I suspect that the issue is caused by qcodes setting the termination char to "" by default where as pyvisa sets it to \r for rs232 instruments. This is fixex by #4219
Dear Jens @jenshnielsen ,
Yes you're right. It's the terminator setting on qcodes. once I use the following codes, then it worked. for now i pass down terminator by locally changing TPS2012 class. I'm not a developer of qcodes and it might take a while to get this modified. If you can plan on a issuing a new pip version anyway, then this might be good to incorporate so I will just update qcodes version with pip in environment.
Please note that "\n" is for EOL string setting Line Feed (LF) on TPS2012B, which is also the default setting for RS232.
Thank you for the help. I learned a lot.
best,
Tony
In #4219 I changed the logic so that we use the same terminator by default as pyvisa will normally. It would be great if you could test the master branch of QCoDeS to see if this is enough or if we also need to explicitly set the terminator for the TPS2012.
Let me know if you need help installing qcodes from source
Closed by #4219
