The calibration information is lost when using process_tomography_circuits in ignis
qc = QuantumCircuit(2,1)
qc.cx(0,1)
qc.p(np.pi/16, 1)
qc.cx(0,1)
pass_ = TemplateOptimization(**rzx_templates(['zz2']))
qc_cz = PassManager(pass_).run(qc)
pass_ = RZXCalibrationBuilder(backend)
cal_qc = PassManager(pass_).run(qc_cz)
cal_qct = transpile(cal_qc, backend)
qct = transpile(qc, backend)
print('Duration of schedule with the calibration:')
print(schedule(cal_qct, backend).duration)
print('Duration of standard with two CNOT gates:')
print(schedule(qct, backend).duration)
default_qpt_circ = process_tomography_circuits(qct,measured_qubits=[0,1])
parametric_qpt_circ = process_tomography_circuits(cal_qct,measured_qubits=[0,1])
print('Duration of QPT schedule with the calibration:')
print (schedule(transpile(parametric_qpt_circ,backend),backend)[0].duration)
print('Duration of QPT schedule with two CNOT gates:')
schedule(transpile(default_qpt_circ,backend),backend)[0].duration
That the "parametric_qpt_circ" would have a shorter duration than the "default_qpt_circs", that matches up with the same reduction seen in the schedule duration of cal_qct vs qct.
The issues arising due to how process_tomography_circuits combines preparation and measure circuits with the calibrated circuit:
"prep_circ+=calibrated_circ"

Closing issue and reopening issue in terra, as the problem ultimately is "+=" terra functionality.
