When you right click the experiment explorer and click "open file outside repository" the default folder is "/" after artiq_gui is opened for the first time. After navigating to a new folder the gui will remember this value until until you quit and reopen artiq-gui.
Is it possible to have the last opened folder location for "open file outside repository" to persist when the gui is closed and reopened?
