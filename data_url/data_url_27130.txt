This is actually noise I think and intended behaviour (I am explicitly forcing it to build the generator source). The actual problem seems to be Cmake trying to find CheMPS2 and getting 1.14.1-2 as a package name instead of a version or something like this. I am looking into it 👍
The problem is in the CMake expression of either HDF5 or CheMPS2 somehow. In share/cmake/CheMPS2/CheMPS2Version.cmake there is 1.14.1-2 written as the minimum HDF5 version. This version string is not a valid cmake identifier for versions (it does not accept dashes, only dots). So the issue is just the hd5 1.14.1 -> 1.14.1-2 update upstream and that this version string breaks CMake.
