If somebody downloads the code in a zip file and does not have git installed, the installer does not work. The install.md document should mention that git is prerequisite.
autoconf script should also check this, because git is necessary for preparing the compilation of the pypi package.

Agreed. Before this I think we assumed that the user had git installed (how else would they have cloned the repo?) but with the PyPI package we need to double-check.

I used to download zip files of the repo from github
git is not strictly required to run qflex, but some scripts like check_format.sh require it. I'm ok to either remove the check from configure.ac add it to the list of required software.
git is required to compile qflexcirq because the code includes a submodule. compilation is almost always required each time the user downloads qflexcirq from pypi. for this reason there I had to add two lines that invoke git in the setup.py file.

Got it. I didn't know about this. Let's add it to install.md (configure already checks for its installation).
There is also a docopt in requirements.txt. Should we treat docopt like pybind and not use submodules but pypi package instead? This could also speed-up compilation of python wheels.
