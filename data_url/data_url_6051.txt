 Refactor the fusion transpilation pass to use the unitary_state simulator (or superoperator_state simulator) to allow fusion of arbitrary sized unitary blocks.
 Allow setting different default fusion parameters for different simulation methods if it provides an advantage (eg for cpu vs gpu, or statevector vs density matrix etc)
 Related to above, investigate if it is beneficial to run fusion on GPU unitary / superoperator simulator
 Allow fusion of Kraus and instructions for backends that support them. This will combine a bunch of gates with the more general Kraus instruction to be applied in a single case and should give performance improvements for noisy simulations.
 Allow fusion of reset and SuperOp instruction on density matrix simulations. As above may provide significant performance improvements for noisy simulation.
