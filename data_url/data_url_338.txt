Our CI currently enforces C++ formatting via clang-format. We should do the same for python formatting with yapf. The formatting script will likely only contain yapf --style=google <python/dir> -r -i, to recursively format the python folder in-place. There are also python examples in docs/sphinx/examples/python that should be checked. This will then need to be added to our current github action for formatting.
