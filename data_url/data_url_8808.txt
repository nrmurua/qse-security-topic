@LeonWubben What's the status of this?
@AckslD Not implemented yet. the qubit_id in the cmd.qubit_id is not used in cmd_new
We do however start assigning from 1, skipping 0. So if we do implement this we can check if cmd.qubit_id is not zero.
Implementing this requires some logic and errors if the requested id is already in use. How to handle that?
This is a CQC issue and should be taken into account for CQC3
