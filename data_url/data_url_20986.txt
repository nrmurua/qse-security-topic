I am running v0.63.0 and I started noticing some addresses had mismatching quanta when comparing my local block explorer vs. the explorer.theqrl.org block explorer.  My local node appeared to be in-sync with the remote in that they both agreed on the most recent block number and time.
I wrote a script to retrieve an address_state and then attempt to retrieve each transaction from the address_state to see if I could account for the differences.  I found two issues:
I have more if needed but below is one concrete example for address Q010600a69e0eb760fbeb9ca69508f66b0b305ff6ad452214bcde8ffcebf122cf9e4cb7d405b242.
Can you rerun the same command and also let us know the exact blockheight of your node?
My node's last block as reported in the log at 12:04 CT:
Here is a rerun of my script making the api calls at 12:04 CT (the output looks the same as the first run):
That script connecting to the remote takes awhile, now my node reports:
@som-dev Can you run following command on your local node
qrl state
Please paste the output of the above command here. This will let us know your current chain state.
~/dev/som-dev/qrl-audit$ date; qrl state

I see the block explorer have the correct value. As I started another node that synced from block number 0 and that node shows the same value. I will need the qrl.log file from you, so that I can further look into what happened with your localnode.
I uploaded all qrl logs to https://transfer.sh/t6Sny/qrl_logs_issue1324.zip
I noticed my local node was receiving data from 104.237.3.185 this morning.
When I ran my custom tool to pull every transaction in the address_state it reported no issues.  So as you mention, there are definitely good nodes out there.
Is this possible for you to share your leveldb data?
Sure, no problem!  What is the best way to do that?  Stop the node and zip up the entire ~/.qrl/data folder?
yes stop the node and zip up entire ~/.qrl/data folder
also share your node config
After multiple failed attempts at uploading a 600MB+ file to various file sharing services, I finally recalled the "split" command which brings me back...
I have 6 parts:

Here's the md5sum to know you've got them all reconstructed properly:
Here is my config:
Thanks for reporting. Issue has been fixed in PR #1334 .
Fix will be included in the next release of QRL node.
