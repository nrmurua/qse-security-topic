At line 158 in utilities/Microsoft.Quantum.Katas/KataMagic.cs, the documentation of Simulate function describes calling FindRawAnswer function. But in the implementation of Simulate function FindRawAnswer hasn't been used; instead FindSkeltonAnswer is used.
There is a discrepancy indeed - I suspect FindSkeletonAnswer used to be called FindRawAnswer at some point in the past. Would you be willing to send a PR with this fix? If not, I'll get to it at some point.
Thank you!
@tcNickolas I would be willing to work on the issue
