I am trying to write a small program to encrypt and decrypt using Kyber1024.
However, I have discovered an issue. Despite issuing the same input (11111111111111111111111111111111), and using the same key, the output is different each time. By printing out values, I have deduced that OQS_KEM_encaps, when using Kyber1024, somehow turns the input into garbage.
Replication:
Expected output:
pre encaps inp
11111111111111111111111111111111
post encaps inp
11111111111111111111111111111111
Actual output:
pre encaps inp
11111111111111111111111111111111
post encaps inp

It should be noted that the exact string of garbage is different each time.
You seem to have misunderstood the difference between key encapsulation mechanism and public key encryption scheme.  Please read up on the differences between them: Kyber is a KEM, and does not allow for encryption of a user-chosen message.
So an arbitrary key cannot be used?

A KEM API does not allow to encrypt chosen messages, the message gets created for you.
I see. I suppose I must go rewrite my things then.
Cheers!
