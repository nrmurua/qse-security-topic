There's a lot of unused space with default Schedule drawing.

Changing the scaling option helps, but this still isn't great. We should try to automatically adjust the plotting range, or the scale, or at least not show negative values by default (it looks like the space for neg values leaves a large gap between channels, and I haven't seen it used)

Hi @lcapelluto, i'm working on this.
I think the problem come from the method _count_valid_waveforms()  of qiskit.visualization.pulse_visualization module, and when the scaling=1(by default in the draw method) the maximum amplitude v_max=0.5*scaling is low.

However we can specify scaling=None  like this to have a better visualization:

So my recommendation is to change the  default value from 1 to None but also adjust the scaling for this last.
Thank you! That is definitely already an improvement. Would it be possible to also check if the pulse envelope has negative values, and if not, set the range for the drawn channel to go from 0 up? For many cases, including our examples, this would remove a lot of unused space. (Note that we can't assume the envelope won't have negative values)
I tried two values of v_max for scaling=None:

And for a DriveChannel with negative values


With negative value:

As you said, if i don't have negative values, could i use the case 2, otherwise the case 1?
I think the scaling=None solution you found handles the scaling issue well. I was hoping we could make the best use of the space by also changing the y-axis range that is displayed for each channel. If there are no negative values, I was hoping we could get an output something like this:

Do you think that would be possible?
