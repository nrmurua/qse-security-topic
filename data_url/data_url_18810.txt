https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14722.pdf (pp. 25) allows any instruction to take a bracketed duration (including stretch). For instance, x[30ns] q[1]. A defcal x[30ns] qubit q would be required in this case to match the requested duration. If a matching defcal is not provided, the instruction may not be executable on HW.
We need to update the specification and grammar to allow for this option.
Questions
What does "any instruction" mean? I assume this should be "any quantum operation"? (Including measure/reset in addition to unitary operations...)
I think so. unitaries plus built-in quantum instructions.
I think we will need assign this issue and other similar issues (not volunteering myself for all ðŸ˜„ ). Otherwise, these may sit stagnant. Perhaps we should raise this as a topic at the next TSC meeting?
I'm not sure what everything referenced means (defcal and HW, I'll poke around the codebase some) but if I could get some guidance, I would love to start helping out!
@InfamousPlatypus did you read the ArXiv paper in the issue description?
And have you read the OpenQASM Live Specification?
If you have question come discuss in the open-qasm channel on Qiskit Slack.
@jwoehr I'm working through both.
Will do, thank you.
