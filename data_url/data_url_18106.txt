What is the current behavior?
The cu3 gate simulated with the local_unitary_simulator does not produce the expected matrix for a cu3 gate.

What is the expected behavior?
The two printed matrices should be equal.
Suggested solutions
The problem might be in:
I don't have any solution for the moment.
It appears there that the definition of cu3 in the standard header is actually implementing the a controlled-U where U = exp( -1j * (phi + lam)/2) * U3(theta, phi, lam).  So there is a local phase which wouldn't matter for a single u3 (in this case it would be a global phase), but is important when implementing the controlled gate.
(Less important but you swapped the target and control qubits between the two cases,  the "standard" cnot in qiskit is CX(0, 1) = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]] since qubit 0 is to the right of the tensor product).
This is in the tutorial and i have not decided what we should do.

i am leaning towards deleting this gate and making a new one that we call cU which is a four parameter gate that has the three phases in cU3 and a relative phase. I would also like to change the name of cU1(theta) to cphase(theta)
I am aware of the difference of u3 in the formula with what we have.
I wrote a note emphasizing the importance of global phase in control-U and its difference with just U. But that part is now missing. I will try to recover that part.
Okey so the c-U3 is false in the current implementation. I corrected the phase shift with a c-RZZ:
About the representation of quantum gates, I think there should be a huge warning somewhere that the representation used by QISKit is not the one used in the literature.
Moreover, I think that a warning should be present in each method/function that expose the matrix representation of a gate. For the moment I found:
cU3 is ambiguous and i agree we need to make it clearer. A real cU should have 4 variables not 3. The tensor order has been described in many places (see the tutorials) and it will be clearer in the documentation when we redo it.
