I am working on porting some sample programs from qiskit to pyquil
I have a couple of questions
I haven't been able to found any equivalent of this statement in pyquil qc.h(q[0]).c_if(c,0)
here we are applying hadamart on qubit(0) when our classical bit is 0 (controlled_if)
I need to measure the qubit before and after qc.h(q[0]).c_if(c,0), so am i doing it right in my pyquil implementation or i need to change something there.
Here is my qiskit program
Here is my pyquil program
