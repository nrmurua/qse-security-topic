Happy to withdraw if misguided.
To clarify, an implementation of cirq.eigen_projectors/vectors/values would be something that is fast for EigenGates (using its eigencomponents method) but it falls back to numpy's linear algebra methods in the general case.
This looks like it's in now. Going to close.
