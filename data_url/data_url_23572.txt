While setting up Qcodes for a colleague we ran into the issue that running the unit tests locally fails with ModuleNotFoundError (websockets).
This was probably introduced as part of #1407 . The fix is easy, by adding websockets to the test_requirements.txt file.
But the real issue I think is that there are several places where dependencies are defined (setup.py, requirements.txt, test_requirements.txt, docs_requirements.txt). I am wondering why the CI didn't catch that? does it execute the unit tests in the same env as where it install Qcodes?
If you encounter a bug use the following template.
If you have a feature request feel free to freestyle.
Tests should all pass
Tests throw:
operating system: OSX & Windows
qcodes branch: master
qcodes commit: 023d418
@StefanD986, you should also install QCoDeS itself in order to be able to run the tests.
For reference, this is what Travis does:
https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/023d4189fbe762d6532c18b95447171a5ab3569f/.travis.yml#L25-L30
Looks like a lot of steps and duplication to run some tests.
As far as I can see it the current state is:
May I suggest the following:
I am indifferent about keeping docs_requirements.txt separate. Doesn't hurt for me to keep them separate, especially since jupyter is a bit of a heavy-weight dependency.
the proposed changes would condense the install in travis.yml to:
I'll create a PR with the proposed changes. PR in #1425
Closing because #1425 has been closed. Also, websockets are used for qcodes Monitor which we have tests for, so there should be no issue (see William's comment).
