Hello
I am running Makefile on Vivado 2015.4 but i encounter a problem with the bin file as attached, and seen here:
invalid command name "FPGA_BIN=out/red_pitaya.bin"
while executing
"FPGA_BIN=out/red_pitaya.bin"
(file "Makefile" line 10)
also if you can send a sequence of how to make the full vivado project from the github location.
once trying to open the tcl it says it is missing the wrapper file, maybe because the Makefile didn't succeed.
Thank you
Meir
