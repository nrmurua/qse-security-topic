Dear developers,
The restart of the EMD from an external file fails when using geometry constraints. It is working OK when there are no such constraints or a small number of atoms is fixed (1 or 2 fixed atoms didn't lead to the error). Here is the input file I used for restarting:

The error is :

I attach the archive with two tests, without constraints -- working, with constraints -- failing.

Hi
The problem is not EMD.
You have fixed 6 atoms over 8
That means that only 2 atoms are free, in principle, however once the global translational and rotational DoFs the system are removed, no degrees of freedom remain. Hence the MD stops

Dear Marcella,
But this happens only during restart, during normal run the number of degrees of freedom is also "zero", however, the MD runs. Why number of degrees of freedom would depend on restart option? Besides, if there are mobile atoms, even if only one, the number of degrees of freedom should not be zero.
