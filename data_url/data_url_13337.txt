Error message on master CI build (macos-latest, py 3.8):
The test is about Cirq, whose version was bumped just before on PR #915. The tests on the PR were run only on Ubuntu (py 3.7 and 3.8).
It's not clear to me if this is a random bug, as reported in #1014. I am rerunning the CI jobs to check if this is a random fail.
If useful, provide a numbered list of the steps that result in the error.
Otherwise, just fill out the "Code Snippet" and "Error Output" sections below.
Here the full message that at the end raises a RuntimeError:
circ_type = 'cirq'
E           RuntimeError: The search for an optimal representation failed.
mitiq/pec/representations/optimal.py:92: RuntimeError
See the link above. The specifics are macos-py38 on master. The macos-py37 tests succeed.
Update: the tests now pass also on macos-latest with py38.
Renamed to a more specific title
