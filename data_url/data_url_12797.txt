Hello,
My Visual Studio can't find the tests for the katas (I first tried with BasicGates).
I have an error in the ouput pane - Tests (message in attachment). The basic "Hello world" application works great and the build of Basic Gates is successful.
I have VS2019 Pro with .NET Core 3.1 and I cloned the git repository without any modification.
Thanks for your help!

Hi @TTeschitsch,
Could you try adding
<PlatformTarget>x64</PlatformTarget>
to the test project file? It shouldn't be needed, but it's a quick thing to try.
This is already set to x64 :(
Could you please provide more details on your setup?
The version of .NET Core (can be obtained using dotnet --version)
=> Unfortunately, this command line return : "Unhandled exception. System.BadImageFormatException: Tentative de chargement d'un programme de format incorrect. (0x8007000B)". But, in the control panel, I see the installed version is "Microsoft .NET Core SDK 3.1.201 (x64)".
The version of VS (Help -> About Microsoft Visual Studio)
=> Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2019
Version 16.5.2
The last commit in the katas? (last entry in git log - is it "Update QDK to version 0.11.2003.3107" or an earlier commit?)
=> "[Measurements] Create workbook for part II tasks (Mbu measurementsÂ #305)" right after the one quoted.
It looks like your dotnet version is not installed properly. The BadImageFormatException is usually related to a discrepancy between x64 and x86. Could you uninstall the 3.1.201 version using the control panel, then click on the "Download .NET Core Sdk" button here, and install the downloaded dotnet by double clicking it? The dotnet --version command should hopefully succeed after that.
Now, the dotnet --version command returns "2.2.203" :( I think this is because I have sdks installed here : C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\sdk.
I renamed "dotnet" to "dotnet-old" (in the x86 folder) and, this time, the command line returns : "3.1.201" ! And the unit tests work :)
Thanks for the help !
