Currently there's a bit of a tricky thing where users need to understand the ordering of qubits within the circuit they simulated in order to understand the ordering of bits within bitstrings being returned by the simulator. This is not ideal, because users are unlikely to be thinking about the measurements as necessarily being in some qubit order.
One of the things we could do is to include the measurement's target qubit as part of its key.
We've moved to having unique keys and having multi-qubit measurements in #247 .  This makes the ordering not related to the ordering in moments or across the circuit/schedule.
