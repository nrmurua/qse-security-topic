Describe the bug
When executing an emulation that has too many atoms (in my case more than 16!!) the stacktrace on the error thrown for having too many qubits is excessively long, especially with line wraps, so that it becomes more or less incomprehensible.
To Reproduce
The Hamiltonian is piecewise linear, with piecewise linear detuning terms as a list per atom.
The error message: (TRUNCATED TO FIT GITHUB MAX OF 65536 CHARACTERS)
Can you create a minimal example that reproduces this bug? there is not enough information to go off of here.
