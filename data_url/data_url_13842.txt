I'm executing the following program in a shell context.
The second plot displays in a window, but the first plot does not. I tried executing on a Mac M2 with Python version 3.11.2 and matplotlib version 3.7.0 with the latest version of pyzx.

By default, PyZX uses a javascript drawing backend, which doesn't work in shell mode. It might work if you set the backend to matplotlib after importing pyzx:

I see. Thanks!
