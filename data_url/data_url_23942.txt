These two for loops severely slow down compile time of long sequences (e.g. seconds to tens of minutes for GST)
This, and many of our other performance issues, would probably be helped by reactivating Pulse caching.
@dieris out of curiosity how big are the -code.py files?
400 kB at most
@caryan why would caching pulses help with "string-ifying" code? I guess we could also cache the string representation...
