For bigger molecules batch_mode = true causes memory crash. Proposed enhancement is to control the number of circuits created. @pistoia @chunfuchen @liupibm
proposed a fix.
waiting for @tanvipg to check how the fix works.
Checked the fix, memory crash does not happen anymore. Performance of the functionality needs to be tested with the new fix. @liupibm working on it.
The memory issue was fixed and performance has been investigated and reported.
