When Fermionic operators 'aux_operators' is passed to GroundStateEigensolver.solve, on return it doesn't keep the original operators.
just run this with arbitrary aux_operators to see if it keeps the original Fermionic operators
GroundStateEigensolver.solve(driver, aux_operators)
Fermionic operators 'aux_operators' should not be altered within GroundStateEigensolver.solve.
Use different variable name for the translated operators in this statement:
operator, aux_operators = self.transformation.transform(driver, aux_operators)
Hi @HNK-coder! Just to clarify: do you want this change because
a) you want to be able to pass aux_operators which do not need to be transformed and therefore should not be changed or
b) you want the aux_operators list to be untouched in order to be able to reuse it? (Because the way it is implemented now, the list is changed in place due to Python's "pass-by-assignment" strategy)
Fixing b) is quite straight forward fix (as you suggested) but fixing a) would require a little bit more thought.
