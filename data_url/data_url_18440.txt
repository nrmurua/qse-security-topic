Hey!
quilc does not start (not even quilc -V) when executed in an ubuntu 18.04 wsl on windows 10; it appears it is linked against glibc 2.28, whereas that ubuntu version has glibc 2.27. Including a "fat binary" might be an option to solve this, maybe?
Thanks,
best,
Johannes

Hi @rumschuettel, thanks for reporting this. The issue should be resolved now. Could you try upgrading to the latest release and see if that solves the issue?
