After a bit of investigation, it seems like a hidapi bug.
I can reproduce it even by using the hidapi-libusb library from C, see over there: https://gist.github.com/fallen/b8af26da2e98e51a99b5
Also, I just found it is listed in the library's issues: signal11/hidapi#185
We could either try to work around this bug, for instance by always passing NULL as hid_open's 3rd argument. But that would mean we would not be able to use several devices on the same machine.
The bug is already fixed upstream: signal11/hidapi@ac6120b but I guess not packaged/released yet.
we could provide a conda packaged version of hidapi with this fix maybe?
I think we need to keep the possibility to use several devices on the same machine.
Shipping hidapi for all platforms sounds like a mess and it will potentially conflict with system versions. Let's not work around this in ARTIQ - it's minor and the proper fix is to release/package the lib through the upstream channels.
Fixed for Nix users, others should live with the problem or compile hidapi from source using the latest git version.
