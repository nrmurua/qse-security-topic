One of the most common things I do with det+obs data is split it into separated det data and obs data. This is important to do if you're going to send the data to a decoder, e.g. if you want to be certain the decoder can't accidentally cheat instead of trusting it not to look at the obs data that it should be predicting. Fusing the data just to split it creates unnecessary work, and this unnecessary work tends to happen in python; it's just overhead that's not needed.
Instead, at least when writing results to files, I should be able to specify a secondary file to write the observable data to.
