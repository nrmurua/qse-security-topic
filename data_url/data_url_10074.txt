Right now the biases in BinaryQuadraticModels can be arbitrary types which is convenient in many cases, however there are times that it would be nice to be able to specify a consistent type for biases.
Proposed solution
Add a dtype kwarg to the bqm construction methods.
The default value would be dtype = object which would be the current behaviour. In general we would assume that it is a callable (e.g. float, int, np.int8).
It would be nice if we also allowed numpy data type syntax so
would be valid.
Subsequent .add_variable or .add_interaction calls would coerce to the specified datatype if possible.
