The attached pulse works in commit 629f733 but not in ee97581. The error message is that evalute numeric did not return a numeric type but something of type object. I can reproduce the exact message if needed.

This pulse works (but it has other issues so that I would like to use the version uploaded above). I guess it has something to do with the Max function, which I remember gave a similar error a while ago (I think when I used max instead of Max).
