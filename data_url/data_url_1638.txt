Is your design idea/issue related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
@Strilanc pointed out that the term "channel matrix" can be given a fairly broad interpretation. This makes it fairly ambiguous, potentially confusing and invites name collisions. Filing the issue to record a discussion and suggestions for a better name.
The term "channel matrix" is intended for one of the matrix representations of quantum channels. Consider a linear map E: L(H1) -> L(H2) from the space L(H1) of linear operators on the Hilbert space H1 to the space L(H2) of linear operators on the Hilbert space H2 (N.B. this two-tier structure is why E is sometimes called a "superoperator"). Note that L(H1) and L(H2) are both vector spaces. They do have more structure than that since their elements are linear operators themselves, but suppose we disregard that additional structure and just treat L(H1) and L(H2) as vector spaces. Then E is simply a linear operator and has a matrix representation M(E). This is what "channel matrix" refers to. In John Watrous' book "The Theory of Quantum Information" M(E) is referred to as "the natural representation".
Note that M(E) is distinct from the Choi matrix J(E) of E. In particular, if dim H1 = d1 and dim H2 = d2 then M(E) is a (d1^2)x(d2^2) matrix while J(E) is a (d1*d2)x(d1*d2) matrix.
Also note that cirq.channel_matrix has not yet been introduced into cirq. All we have is a function to compute it from Kraus operators, see #4146. Down the road cirq.channel_matrix or an alternative name proposed here will refer to a protocol that will use the utility introduced in #4146 to compute the matrix of channels that do not know their matrix.

Related names worth keeping in mind that refer to other representations of quantum channels that already exist or may be introduced in future:

If Watrous' description of the "natural representation" of channels is original, I would suggest using cirq.watrous or cirq.watrous_natural to specify this representation. Watrous' book is conveniently available on the UWaterloo website, and it comes up as the first hit when Googling Watrous quantum channel. In my mind, this makes using "Watrous" preferable to the other options listed, which are somewhat more difficult to find clear definitions for online.
This is also consistent with the other representation methods listed, which use the names of their creators.

From @dabacon: Liouville-superoperator (ref https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6950)
For reference: I didn't really know what y'all were talking about until I figured out it's what I call the superoperator representation. I think we follow the Chris Wood paper in the rest of the qis package, so Liouville-superoperator sounds ideal to me
SGTM. We still need to decide how to turn that term into a python name. Below is the full and updated list of options for ease of comparison:
The list is now probably long enough to commence voting...
To make absolutely sure we are all on the same page about which representation we're discussing, here is a fun fact about it: the natural (or whatever you wanna call it) representation of a unitary channel with unitary U is
$$U \otimes \overline{U}$$
where overline denotes complex conjugation (no transpose!). Proof is left as an exercise for the reader. This fact is fun because it leads to interesting observations:
Vote results:
Will go with cirq.superoperator.
has this been done?
Yes, (modulo deprecation, but no need to gate closing on that).
