Here is a concrete benchmark result for #562, where I found the hybrid Python-C++ code (~40 LOC of the Python code) in that PR to be ~2x faster than the full C++ code for adjoint Jacobian. I think this means that there could be a room for improvement for the C++ implementation.
I'm raising this issue because I had spent time figuring out about speeding up the adjoint code. I think it would be a missed opportunity if this were not examined. A review of this issue would be appreciated!
The elapsed times to consider are the "elapsed grad final version" and "Elapsed diagonal observable grad only".
Code to reproduce the benchmark result.
Thanks @rht. This is useful info and squeezing the most performance out of the lightning suite is a top priority!
For the 0.35 release (end of Feb), we're planning to move towards lightning.gpu tapping into our new JVP/VJP pipeline by default. At that point, I'd be curious to compare these numbers again. We'll keep you posted as we make progress on this.
