just setAmps for density matrices
Commit 70c020b contains function
void setDensityAmps(Qureg qureg, qreal* reals, qreal* imags)
Which currently only sets the entire statevector. Should be extended to set a slice of the statevector (potentially take a 2d slice of the density matrix?)
It was added only as a debug function (exposed through QuEST_debug.h) based on the fact that the user would need to know the underlying representation used for density matrices to use this function.
