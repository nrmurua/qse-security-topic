Github actions are currently deprecating the MacOS 10.15 runners (actions/runner-images#5583). We currently use these runners to build backwards compatible wheels for MacOS machines targeting both 10.15 and above. With the minimum version of MacOS 11 we may lose the ability to easily build support for older versions of MacOS due in large to the structural differences between the major OS versions.
An upgrade to MacOS 11 runners on x86 is currently being assessed in PR #319 as part of a reduction in CI redundant tests.
Resolved by #319
