rem.execute_with_rem expects an executor of type Union[Executor, Callable[[QPROGRAM], MeasurementResult]] as parameter. When called with some Callable, everything works as expected, when called with an Executor the function raises an UnboundLocalError exception.
Minimal example to reproduce:
When passing the execute function directly, everything works as expected. The error is caused in mitiq/rem/rem.py lines 41-46.
When an Executor object is passed, executor_obj never gets initialized. For comparison, mitigate_executor got this case covered:
Both, passing an Executor and a Callable should work.

Hello @d3rhans, thank you for your interest in Mitiq!
If this is a bug report, please provide screenshots and/or minimum viable code to reproduce your issue, so we can do our best to help get it fixed. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can also ask us on the Unitary Fund Discord.
Thanks @d3rhans for your clear bug report! We'll try to fix it soon.
This is now fixed in the Mitiq source code. You can try it by installing Mitiq from source. Otherwise, you can just wait for the next release that will likely happen in roughly 2 weeks.
