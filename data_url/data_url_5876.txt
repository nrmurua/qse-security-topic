Trying to build + install the package from source using scikit-build 0.10 resulted in an error.
Run pip install . or python setup.py bdist_wheel
Installing the repo should update python dependencies to required version to build.
Manually updating to scikit-build 0.11.1 fixed this, so probably we need a minimum version of 0.11 in setup.py.
