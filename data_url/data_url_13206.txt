It's supposed to arrive in 5 days (schedule). There are some serious speed improvements.
+1 for supporting this, and indeed it's been released.
This seems to be blocked until oqpy loosens dependency requirements, which they are planning to release this week: openqasm/oqpy#19 (comment)
@natestemen OQpy v0.1.2 has been released: https://pypi.org/project/oqpy/
Thanks Peter for letting us know! I've opened a PR on braket to loosen the oqpy dependency requirement so we don't have to do this tango so often. Hopefully we can work something out. Once that (or something similar) is merged, we can move forward on this.
I doubt they'll elect to fully unpin OQpy as it's such a critical dependency for the Braket SDK. There shouldn't need to be much of a tango after this though? Supporting a new Python version only happens once a year

Yeah, that makes sense. I'll see what they recommend. Maybe there's an acceptable range. If not, it's not a problem, but 2 weeks ago I bumped the oqpy version in braket (PR) after the numpy and openpulse versions were loosed (in oqpy) as that was blocking us from upgrading to the latest version of braket.
This is the "tango" of dependency resolution that I referred to. You're right, hopefully this will be smoother going forward.
#1626 has been merged, and this should be ready to test.
