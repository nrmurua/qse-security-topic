Hello Dr. Christine, and here we are go...  :)
Following the tests suggested in the Full User Guide from IBM (https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qstage/#/user-guide), I'm in Section IV, Quantum Algorithms, specifically in Phase estimation algorithm.
The "Example circuit" demonstrates quantum phase estimation, setting qubit Q2 as target and qubit Q3 as a pointer.


This is the result from IBM Simulator:

The result expected is |01000> (in 43210 order) or |00010> (in 01234 order) where the pointer qubit Q3 has always the value |1> that must refer to phase -1 of target qubit Q2.
But, this same test executed under the QuantumComputer.py, results from different way:

The used source code below has a Toffoli sample just to demonstrate the position of qubit Q4, that it actually is in order 01234.
Phase.txt
I commented the "measure" to let me see the bloch values:

And the result is this:

Phase is working if Pointer qubit is LESS THAN Target qubit ! . . . . . . . ( 01234 order )

Phase_Pointer gt Target.txt

Well ... this issue is very away from my math knowledge, or Python, or about the construction of QuantumComputer.py...   :(
I hope you, the Mrs. Matrix Architect  :) , have some insight about how to address this and can match the results to those that IBM Simulator has.
Best Regards.
