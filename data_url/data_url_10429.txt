You should call close() on Client instance (ex. Connection) as soon as you're done using the client, i.e. as soon as you obtain the result (samples) from SAPI.
Calling close() will release all allocated resources (several thread pools) which would not be garbage collected otherwise, but released to system only on program exit. Not following this rule becomes an issue if multiple (as in dozens) clients are instantiated, each one having its own thread pool.
The preferred way of using the Client is via context manager (refer to examples for details):
Note that future returned by sampling method on Solver must be resolved before closing the client (and killing thread pool workers), otherwise you will not be able to obtain the results.
