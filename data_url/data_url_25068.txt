Some minor feedback about the gamecrafter rule book. I didn't see anything in the repo to offer direct edits to, so I'll just try to describe the issues in english below:
I hope to play and discuss with the local paperswelove chapter soon, will let you know if we have further feedback. Thanks!
Hey Wesley,
Thanks for catching these! I just fixed the rulebook on GameCrafter. I agree, I wish they were offering a direct edit access! :-/
Sounds good, thanks!
