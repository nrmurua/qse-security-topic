When my datasets get bigger (e.g. 400x40 points) somewhere halfway in the measurement, the synchronization becomes very slow. There is no error message, but the synchronization basically stops.
It is not possible to stop the measurement as also
does not get executed. The only way to get back to work is to quit the kernel which is impractical to do.
We really need to have DataSet.sync only pull changes... at the moment it pulls ALL the data, hence your problem. @MerlinSmiles also noted this in QCoDeS/Qcodes_loop#14 and we've discussed a little there. The big question is how generic we want the sync to be - if we're comfortable restricting the updates to sequentially filling each DataArray then it will be fairly straightforward, the sync command can just ask for everything after the last point it has in each array.
That sounds fairly reasonable to me, the problem with this would only arise with independent measurements, which could then be run on different stations even. If parallelization is an issue, there will be some synchronization there anyway.
