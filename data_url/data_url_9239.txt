Would allow for calls which pass arguments on to the gate creating functions:
POC in branch program_args which only allows a single argument to be passed. Argument lists would increase complexity significantly.
For use case see #31
First iteration done in 02db6cc and 32044a5. Only single arg currently allowed.
Invalidated with #39
