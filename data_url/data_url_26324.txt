Dear all,
Recently I have tried to install cp2k-v2023.1 on HPC cluster, with gcc-v8.3.1, ifort-v2021.6.0. After I ./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh --with-sirius=no --with-openmpi=install --with-plumed=install , it showed this error:

I cannot figure out what it problem is.  Does it have issue with complier or other?
Hope someone could help me. It would thanks a lot.
Sincerely
Sorry, it should be after ./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh --with-sirius=no --with-openmpi=install --with-plumed=install and then I followed instruction, finally  make -j 48 ARCH=local VERSION="ssmp sdbg psmp pdbg", then showed the error above.
Can you provide a full output? The visible warning can be turned off by removing -wd279 from the FCFLAGS variable in your arch file(s).
Hi, sorry for my late respones, here is my output:
The gcc version is irrelevant here because you obviously compile with Intel (ifort). I am not expert with that compiler but I do remember we haven't tested the Intel compiler with Libint or at least had decent issues compiling CP2K with ifort and Libint support. Maybe @mkrack can give some advice.
The suggested installation procedure for CP2K release v2023.1 using the Intel classic compiler is (bash):
Might be related to #1999.
