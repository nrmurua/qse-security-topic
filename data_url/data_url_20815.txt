When enabling clang's UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer in liboqs, the follow warnings were detected in code copied from PQClean:
Same error(s) in Kyber{768,1024,512-90s,768-90s,1024-90s}, Saber, FireSaber.
All the errors seem to in places where some int16_t values are multiplied and overflow.
It's weird that we're not seeing these issues in our CI...
it turns out that -fsanitize=undefined only prints problems, and doesn't set exitcode=1.
We need -fno-sanitize-recover=undefined
