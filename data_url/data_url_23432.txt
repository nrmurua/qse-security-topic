Decisions will be taken, unless somebody voices their opinions before this is written.
As for drivers, I can give my opinion on a few things.
Instrument naming Manufacturer directory should be lower case according to python convention, for example QuTech should be changed to qutech for consistency.
Parameter/function documentation I think docstrings should only be included if either the name or functionality of a parameter or function deviates significantly from it's corresponding command in the manual, or is composed of multiple commands. We shouldn't be copying manuals.
Parameter/function names Lower case everywhere corresponding to python naming conventions. Probably also when acronyms are present such as high frequency (HF).
Parameter values
Strings Lower case everywhere except for acronyms (AC, TTL, etc).
Numbers As actual python numbers, so no string types.
Booleans After writing a few drivers I am of the opinion that instrument parameters where something is either running/enabled/on/off/etc should be represented as booleans, with the meaning of True/False clear from the parameter name. For example; an awg.output() could be 'on' or 'off', but awg.output_enabled() being True or False is much clearer to a user.
