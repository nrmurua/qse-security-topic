On PR #1250, the "Docs and Tutorial / tutorials (3.7) (pull_request)" job is failing with the following error. It's unrelated to the contents of that PR.
I guess the constraints for sphinx or sphinx-tabs will need to be tightened to prevent incompatible versions being installed.
This should be temporary, b/c sphinx-tabs has already been updated with support, and this pin could be removed on the next release. executablebooks/sphinx-tabs#110
Ugh, yeah it looks like sphinx tabs is incompatible with the latest sphinx release. I think the short term workaround here is to just put a cap on sphinx in requirements-dev. The new pip depsolver should have been able to resolve this conflict, I'm not sure why it couldn't, but a manual pin should workd.
Oh actually I was mistaken the issue is we're unnecessarily installing sphinx again in the tutorial job and that's ignoring the constraint from the already installed sphinx-tabs and causing pip check to fail at the end. That's even easier to fix.
