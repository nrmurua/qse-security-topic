Error:
Version: 9.1.0
FreeBSD 13.1
For whatever reason -fallow-argument-mismatch needs to be passed gfortran for versions >=10, but FCFLAGS aren't passed to DBCSR subproject.
Could you attach the arch file and the log of the compilation? Yes, the parameters are not passed to DBCSR, but we do test that, so I'm a bit surprised of this error...
