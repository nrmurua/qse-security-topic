The use of visa_handle.clear on the instantiation of a VISA instrument causes some instruments to lock up. In particular I've noticed for SERIAL instruments, this command spews some garbage on the serial port that requires the instrument to be reset before it is possible to use it again.

@WilliamHPNielsen ever noticed the same ?
To expand on this issue, some versions of the VISA library automatically send *CLS; on receiving a viClear. This sequence seems to crash older versions of the decaDac. See: http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/allkb/4A8D61E759174E7F86256E20005A8ABC
A couple of options we could choose between:
@spauka I am not sure I understand the issue, or I guess there's two part:
@giulioungaretti For each of your two points above:
I committed a new change that maintains the existing behavior of clearing the IO buffers for other instrument types, but uses viFlush for serial ports, which is a specific method for clearing buffers that only seems to exist for Serial instruments.
