When users do not specify an executor in a lattice decorator, the lattice's executor is intended to be automatically set as follows:
Consider the following simple lattice consisting of a single sublattice. The top-level lattice's executor is set to "dask", whereas the sublattice's executor is unspecified.
Since the sublattice does not specify an executor, it should inherit its parent lattice's executor. However, this is not what happens; the sublattice's executor is set to "local", the default executor:
