The Kasli Error LED does not light up on an error, aka when the rust firmware panics.
EDIT: This is only the case for Master variants, for Standalone variants the Error LED lights up as usual.
E.g. don't feed a clock to a  Kasli which expects an external reference at startup.
The LED should light up.
Error LED doesn't turn on.
Note that this is a regression from a very useful behavior in release 6.
It's not a regression, it doesn't work on any ARTIQ version when DRTIO is enabled.
thanks!
