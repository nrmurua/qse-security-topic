Computing a suzuki decomposition of a Hamiltonian for a given time t. If t is a float, everything works fine. If t is a Parameter object the value gets squared when it is bound.
which outputs on my device
What should happen is when the time value is bound to the Parameter object, it should show 11.0 inside the exponential, not 121.0.

I think we need to add
after getting coeff.

Thanks for reporting this @ajrazander!
You can also use the PauliEvolutionGate instead, which we will shift to in the future ðŸ™‚

I tried coeff = 1 instead of operator.coeff = 1. This solution works in my local qiskit terra. I will try to make with this solution my first contribution.
1 ComposedOp([ e^(-i*11.0 * XXX), e^(-i*11.0 * ZZZ) ]) 1 ComposedOp([ e^(-i*11.0 * ( 1.0 * XXX )), e^(-i*11.0 * ( 1.0 * ZZZ )) ])
Excellent. Thank you everyone! Glad to see the fix as well as an example of what functions to use in the future :) I'll let someone else close the issue
I think we can keep this open until we fixed the issue ðŸ™‚
@BramDo are you still working on this or can I unassign you and let someone else pick it up? ðŸ˜„
I was busy with other projects but now I have some more time and I could start working on this again. A far as I can remember the fix was already working, but there were some tests needed. So I can pick it up myself if that is OK. It could be that I have to merge latest files because the fix was already done many months ago. I will look into this and report the status.
