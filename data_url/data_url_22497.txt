Fail the build, or issue a warning. (Sometimes failed-timing bitstreams are still usable)
Is there a reliable way to detect one?
Grep ISE logs for "All constraints were met", which means timing passed. I'm not sure about Vivado, nor if there is a better way than grepping the ISE log. One would have to read the Xilinx docs and experiment.
for vivado if the stdout contains a line that looks like WARNING: [Route \d+-\d+] Router estimated timing not met.. For ISE, \d+ constraint not met..
Should I extract some block from stdout for ease of analysis? If yes, how is it delimited?
You could look at the xml files vivado and ise leave behind. Maybe they are easier to parse.
Yes but is it helpful if I give you the xml output? (I have no idea how do people debug timing failures.)
Simply having timing pass/fail information on IRC and in the global build logs e.g. with colors (all similar to build pass/fail) would already be helpful.
Sure, but since the extraction techniques for pass/fail and some extended report info are nearly same, I can do the latter also.
The useful information would be the names of the top-3 signals with the worst negative slack in each failed clock domain.
The xml is not helpful for a human. Just if you want to extract stuff it is sometimes easier than plain text. This is in top_timing.rpt (vivado) and top.twr (ise). But they look painful to extract. On ISE we have top.twx with the same info in xml. I think vivado can be made to generate that timing report in xml as well.
I don't need XML, if there is consistent stdout output, then it is far easier to extract. XML is a pain to parse anyway. I can grab top_timing.rpt from the builder if you want, sure.
Let's keep it simple and grep the log as in #310 (comment)
Ping
Done
This fails the build, let me know if you'd rather get a warning.
