Setting the clock source in ATS9870 to external should pass the correct parameters to self.api.set_capture_clock in ATS.py.
Instead it does not recognize that the clock source is set to external because the if statement checks for a value that does not exist in ATS9870. This leads to sending incompatible parameters to self.api.set_capture_clock in ATS.py.
