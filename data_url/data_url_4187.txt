Hi,
I have a hamiltonian which I am trying to calculate the expected value of through the IBM simulator. Since there is no get_expectation function for the ibm engine, I am using get_probabilities and will then calculate the expected value manually.
I first generate a wavefunction and initialize the registers, then I build the circuit and act it on the wavefunction. Finally, I flush my circuit.
When I call get_probabilities on my backend, I get the error
Could somebody help me debug this? The example that I am working off of can be found here
#218
Could you post the whole code you are running?
From looking at the error message, it seems like there is no mapper present in the compiler engine list, which is why you get the assertion error.
Closing inactive issue. Please reopen if required.
