I think the reason #1514 was reported as a bug is because the current error that results from this mistake is so bad that it looks like a bug in cirq. Both cirq.Simulator and cirq.google.XmonSimulator should check if cirq.is_parameterized(circuit) before continuing into the numerical simulation, and if so then raise an exception describing the problem.
This error should raise both when attempting to run a parameterized circuit (e.g. you forgot to use run_sweep) and when sweeping and you forget a parameter.
Here is a repro:
Errors with this:
But should actually error with this:
Thanks very much for the context @Strilanc.  I would be more than happy to give this one a try.
It's all yours!
