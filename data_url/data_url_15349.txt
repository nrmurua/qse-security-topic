Preset pass manager with optimization level 3 fails when passed multiple circuits.
It should work.
Passing circuits individually works, so the issue seems to be with parallelization. Lower optimization levels seem to work fine.
I think this was fixed by #7333.  At any rate, I can't reproduce it any more, so I'll close it but feel free to re-open if it's still an issue.
