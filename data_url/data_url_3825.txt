Hi, I am wondering why their was this error for the Circle CI regarding requirements needed for deployment?
Is there a way one should just manually bump or upgrade the dependency version, or this isn't something to worry about?
@Mentors4EDU, is still an error you're seeing, and if yes, in which build?
Closing as stale.
