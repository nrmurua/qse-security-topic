try to options.update() giving a new pin to the options
should allow to update those options (thus create a new pin) after the component was created
Am guessing that  design.overwrite_enabled = True is in your notebook.  When one re-runs a cell, the component is deleted from QDesign and new one is generated.  So the name of qcomponent (q1) could be changed, if the names are auto-generated.  Am guessing that you re-ran the cell earlier.  Then the name of the component has been changed.
To better understand the issue, need to know what was before this and if you re-ran any cells.
q1.options is probably pointing to the previous qcomponent.
Of course....,
yes, that line is there, but does not matter here because I am not re-running the cell, I am running options.update(). You can recreate this error by creating the component with X pins and then trying to add one additional pin (in my case, it was a qubit with zero pins, and then tried to add 4 pins through the options.update().
.....and yes, I know I can just rerun the cell and get the qubit to show up without issues, but I want to use the update() method.
To be clear, since this has a work-around (Re-run cell), it should not be considered high-priority.
