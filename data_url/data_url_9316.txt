Describe the bug
Currently the Schema parsing function can not handle lists of type Any.
To Reproduce
Expected behavior
This is a valid Hamiltonian that can be converted into a schema so this should pass and return a json string.
Additional context
related to #412 but not completely fixed
No longer and issue as it is not supported by current Schema
