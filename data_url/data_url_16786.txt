Hey guys! I would like to give it a try. Just to be sure I understood it correctly, the second entry of the list which is 0 seems to be the problem right? Maybe the if case in Line 59 only checks the first entry, therefore no error is raised?
hey can I have a shot at this
There's an old PR that should fix this, #4375. It has some merge conflicts, maybe you can check with @ewinston if you can brush it up, or create a new one based on that ðŸ™‚
