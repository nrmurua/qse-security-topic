Serial and MPI versions of old QUICK were capable of running on OS X. However, this is no longer possible with new build systems. Please check and fix this.
CMake serial and MPI build works on macOS 11.4 (Big Sur) using GNU compilers and OpenMPI. There is an issue with newer GNU compilers (version 10, 11).
Results for CMake build serial and MPI on macOS 11.4 (Big Sur):
With gcc 10 and gcc 11 the first two MPI tests pass, the third test (ene_psb3_blyp_631g) segfaults. It might be a gcc issue or something with the MPI DFT code in QUICK.
Both serial and MPI tests pass on macOS 13.2 (Ventura) with gcc 12.2.0.
