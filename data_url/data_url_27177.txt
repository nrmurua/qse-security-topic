If I understand correctly, closed-shell MP2 gradients are available in the latest release, so the README should be updated to reflect this capability. Right now it says
It is currently capable of energy, analytical gradient, and geometry optimization calculations of Hartree-Fock theory and Density Functional Theory (DFT), and energy calculations of Second-order Moller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory.
README was updated.
