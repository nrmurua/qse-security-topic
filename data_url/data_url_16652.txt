We make use of a lot of np.random.RandomState generators, however these are now legacy code.  It has been replaced with np.random.default_rng that generates different values.  We should move to this new generator. Ideally before the circuit library comes out because the seed values, and the offset, can be (should be) used to uniquely identify the circuits.  This makes that identification a bit more future proof.
