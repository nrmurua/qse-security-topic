If one has copied the github version of mitiq, it is simple to run the tests. However, if one is using a pip version of the library, it is a bit more intricate to run them, as one would have to go to the relevant source directory, e.g.,
and then run
having checked that all development dependencies are installed.
It may be nice to make the task simple for the user. I am unaware of ways to call pytest without specifying the path.
The Makefile is not included in the Manifest, so one cannot run make test, but even if it were, I am not sure of how it would be packaged by conda or pip, e.g., if put in a folder such as mitiq-0.1a2.dist-info, since requirements.txt, which is in Manifest, is not present in the mitiq/mitiq folder but no top mitiq folder is present .
Add a testing.py module that would call pytest. The bottleneck I find would be in pyquil testing, which would require the qvm. We could have two layers of testing, one minimal, which would exclude mitiq_pyquil, and one more thorough.
A way to go could be to implement something similar to qutip.testing, which has a testing.run() function.
