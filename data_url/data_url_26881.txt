The cubecruncher is a very useful tool that is completely independent from the CP2K code base. Hence, with a bit of love (tests and docu) it could be made available to a larger audience. Eventually, it might even get included in Debian / Fedora.
This would also make for a good intern or GSOC project.
in principal I agree, @marci73 what do you think?
@oschuett last year we were not even accepted as a mentoring organization for GSOC
There are already other tools of this type, i.e., handling cube files for analysis or visualisation.
The cubecruncher is neither more general nor better. I would rather say that it is clearly oriented to what is available as cp2k output.
I have the feeling that the effort to make it a meaningful standalone tool is not worth, and would make it less flexible for ad hoc modifications.
Ok, makes sense. Then let's leave it as is.
