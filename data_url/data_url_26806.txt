Remove deprecated API cufftSetCompatibilityMode used in src/pw/cuda/fft_cuda_z.cu
So sorry, this is not relevant anymore. Closing issue.
I believe this is very relevant because cufftSetCompatibilityMode actually got removed in CUDA 9.1.
You're right. I wrote

because I couldn't find the occurrences of cufftSetCompatibilityMode while browsing CP2K's code on Github. Turns out I was looking in the wrong file.
cufftSetCompatibilityMode is to be found in:
All the occurrences of cufftSetCompatibilityMode are actually already in an #if (__CUDACC_VER_MAJOR__<8), so this shouldn't cause any problems.
Since CP2K doesn't seem to have a clear requirement on the CUDA version, I think it is okay to leave these lines as they are now.
In the future though, if CUDA versions inferior to 8.0 are dropped, these lines should be removed.
Closing this issue for now.
