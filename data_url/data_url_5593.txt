The custom noise is not applied when the circuit contains dynamic instructions. The output of the following example is {'0 0': 1024}, i.e. the result without noise.
However, when commenting out the lines containing dynamic instructions:
the output is {'0 0': 730, '1 1': 294}, as expected.
I think this script always returns 0 at mid-measure and always skips x gate.
Following circuit works well.
In my original script, since the only noise is attached to the id gate, and from the results of the example without the dynamic instruction, the expected result would be {'0 0': 730, '0 1': 294}. I.e., because the id gate is noisy and flips the qubit with prob 0.3 to 1, you would expect that with probability 0.3, the dynamic X gate acts and the final result is with prob. 0.3 0 1, because measurements are noiseless in this example.
I found id gate is removed by qiskit.compiler.transpile called from here
