Application
There are many cases when combining groups of samples (from different samplers say) is useful, however most of the naive approaches are inefficient. We also want to handle edge-cases like differently-ordered labels.
Proposed Solution
One of:
Pattern A:
Pattern B:
@conta877
Feedback on names for pattern B is appreciated
dimod.concat([sampleset0, sampleset1, sampleset2])
sampleset0.append(sampleset1)
merge
join
I like concatenate, following numpy
I don't like append because that would imply to me that it's acting in-place, which due to storing the samples in numpy arrays is not the case.
taking from pandas, append creates a new dataframe. so it is not universal that append means in place.
Gross. I think pandas is in the wrong here.... But fair point. I like merge, join and concatenate. I think that since order is preserved concatenate is least ambiguous.
my fav here is concat too.
