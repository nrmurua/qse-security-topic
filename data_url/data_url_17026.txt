BUG TEMPLATE 
Even though I can successfully run:
import graphviz, pydot
calling the draw method on a pass manager object returns the below error:

It seems to me that the error is raised from this portion of qiskit-terra/pass_manager_visualization.py

The comment # this is raised when the dot command cannot be found, which means GraphViz isn't installed contradicts the fact that I can successfully run graph = pydot.Dot() (just like at line 96 of the visualization script), which implies that the _PROC.returncode value is setting HAS_GRAPHVIZ = False, but at this point I do not know what the expected behavior is.
On Windows 10, in an Anaconda environment with qiskit installed:
pip install pydot
conda install python-graphviz
<my_pass_manager_object>.draw()
No error, or instructions geared towards Windows users regarding graphviz
My understanding is that conda install python-graphviz does the same thing as conda install graphviz and then also provides an interface between the graphviz libraries and Python, which, to me, seems sufficient for running the drawer, but I could be mistaken.
Hi @joeybarreto , I agree this is a bug in that we should be returning more detailed information about what went wrong when we're unable to load graphviz.
For you're specific case, are you able to run dot -V from your shell?
Hi @kdk, thanks for your reply.  The output of dot -V for me is dot - graphviz version 2.38.0 (20140413.2041)
I think this is duplicated with #3099
