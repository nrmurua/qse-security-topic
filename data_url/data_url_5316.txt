When using hybrid Schrödinger-Feynman backend (hybrid_qasm_simulator​), there is a nthreads option that you can set to specify the number of threads to use. This option does not work for the circuit simulator (qasm_simulator) and path simulator (path_sim_qasm_simulator). Also, when using ddsim_simple, the --nthreads arg option is specified to be for the hybrid simulation. I just want to confirm if the other backends/simulators do not have multi-threading/multi-processing options.
[Meta Question] Would it be better to ask ddsim-related question via email or by creating a GitHub issue? I may have other ddsim-related questions but I don't know if it's too "spammy" if I create lots of GitHub issues for my questions. But the advantage of using GitHub issues for questions is that the questions (and answers) are publicly document so they might be useful to others and one can always go back to these issues and use them as references.
Thank you!

[Question] Is the Hybrid Schrödinger-Feynman backend the only one that has a multi-processing/multi-threading option?
