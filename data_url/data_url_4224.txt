I'm just wondering why the file setups/decompositions/ry2rz.py only registers a decomposition for rotations without control qubits:
What are the "efficiency reasons"? I think it's desirable to have controlled-Ry and -Rx rotations to be decomposed to controlled-Rz first so we can use the dedicated controlled-Rz decomposition rather than the one for controlled- arbitrary rotation.
Efficiency reason means less gates:
If I am not mistaken, then going first to Rz results in
C(Ry) = Rx C(Rz) Rx
And C(Rz) requires 2 CNOTs and 2 Rz (using our implemented rule) so in total 6 gates, whereas using the controlled arbitrary single qubit decomposition gives Ry CNOT Ry CNOT, so only 4 gates in total.
Also it helps avoiding potential/future circular loops in decompositions
I agree that for Rx, it depends if your hardware has a native Hadamard gate or not. Using the controlled arbitrary single qubit decomposition requires 3 Rz, 2 Ry and 2 CNOTs... Your proposal requires 2 Hadamard, 2 Rz, and 2 CNOT gates (hadamard gates require two rotation gates if they are not native)...
I see, that makes sense. Thanks!
You are welcome
