Description of the issue
Sorry if this isn't the appropriate location to open this issue.
I am trying to load the QAOA Sycamore data from here:
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Sycamore_QAOA_experimental_data/12597590
I encounter the following error:

How to reproduce the issue
The versions of cirq, pd, nx are listed in the screenshot
put long logs in details blocks like this
Cirq version
You can get the cirq version by printing cirq.__version__. From the command line:
I have tried with 0.8.0, 0.8.1, 0.9.0, and current, all with the same error output
AttributeError: 'LineQubit' object has no attribute '_x'
Need more info? This seems like an easy fix...
This is a consequence of #2756
You can use a pre-Feb 10 release of Cirq or patch a local checkout of cirq by reverting the linked PR / commit 926751d
I'll try to see if there's another way to fix it. This is a prime example of why pickl is bad for long-term storage
@mpharrigan  that seems to have worked!
