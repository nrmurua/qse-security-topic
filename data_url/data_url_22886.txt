Sometime people would like to lock the signal to a given set point (not the one entered from the GUI).
For example, to stabilize the intensity of a laser, one could connect "In 1" to a detector for the laser intensity and "In 2" to another detector for the background light. In this case, using In1 - In2 as the input would be very useful.
Is there a way to implement this in the current version of PyRPL that I just missed?
In the max_hold_no_iir branch there is something called differential mode which does what you need.  Not sure exactly how it works but i vaguely recall in the code (pid.py?) there was a comment explaining that it takes the difference between the pid0 and pid1 inputs.
