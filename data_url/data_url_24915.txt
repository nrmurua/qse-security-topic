Pytests for scqubits in test_hilbertspace.py fail with a segmentation fault 11. This bug is limited to macOS. There is some evidence that fixing scipy to version 1.1.0 is a possible workaround.
To Reproduce
Install scqubits, run pytest -v --pyargs scqubits
The test module involved in the segfault is test_hilbertspace.py.
When switching from running the entire test suite (as indicated above) to running only the specific module via pytest -v test_hilbertspace.py, the segmentation fault disappears and all tests in this module pass.
Tests pass on macOS without modifications if run from within jupyter (using the provided example notebook testing.ipynb)
This appears to have been fixed - no more segfaults observed on Azure Pipelines.
