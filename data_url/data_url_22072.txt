New install of anaconda. New environment.
Why not include asyncserial in conda package artiq-dev?
conda install asyncserial
asyncserial (and pythonparser, which setup.py is also installing itself, albeit successfully) are already dependencies of conda-dev. Please look at the source before proposing a solution. Likely you are using conda wrong, or there is a conda bug.
I reported the Issue because I had seen the message 'Couldn't find index page for 'asyncserial' (maybe misspelled?)' for several weeks. I upgraded conda to 4.3.22 and now the error message is gone. So you're right, it was a conda bug.
