Fails due to TLS missing in python. See log.
The reason:
CircleCI's stock osx image upgraded and left the cached python 3.6.5 binary hanging looking for an ancient libssl.
Two ways forward (I see): a) clear pyenv cache, forcing all python rebuild; or b) upgrade pythons to latest patch version.
I'll go with (b), but to keep cache lean, will reset it, so do (a) as well.
