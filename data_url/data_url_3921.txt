Several software frameworks for quantum programming support backends capable of quantum resource estimation. These tools keep track of all gates and the maximal circuit width for any quantum circuit. Support for such functionality in OpenQL would be desirable.
The features described in issue #266, related to compilation chain modularity, could further extend the usefulness of these tools by providing a means to keep track of resource estimations at different points of the compilation chain.
