This is a reminder and a bookmark that parsing is not mega-efficient.
It might be worth optimizing parsing (especially lexing) if it becomes a bottleneck. It takes non-negligible time in some of the QASM benchmark tests, as can be seen above. However, also note that the above benchmark file is 390,000 lines long.
