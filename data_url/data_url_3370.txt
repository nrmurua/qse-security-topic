A vestigal SDK download link appears twice in pyQuil's docs: once in the docs home page and again in the "Downloading the QVM and Compiler" section.
I also found broken QCS access request links, so I'll update those as well.
Also, the docs say
Request the Forest SDK here. Youâ€™ll receive an email right away with the download links for macOS, Linux (.deb), Linux (.rpm), and Linux (bare-bones).
You don't have to request the SDK, and you won't receive an email.
