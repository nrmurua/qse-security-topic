If we are going to call the sequence of pulses a schedule then I think we need to rename the module schedule as this is the main way the user uses it and pulse is like a gate that is used by the module.
I am open to renaming, I'm just not positive it is pulse->schedule that we wish to do.
I am relatively certain at some point in the future we will define a clock cycle for both quantum gates and classical instructions (mirroring classical computer architectures). This is almost a given in the distant future of on-chip implemented quantum gates, but also a useful abstraction for non-pulse devices. This would allow scheduling of quantum circuits with id (or nop) instructions.
If we rename the pulse module to schedule it will be a headache down the line as we will have conflicting concepts of schedules, one for circuits and one for pulse. I think renaming Schedule -> PulseSchedule may be more appropriate, although given that it exists in the pulse module currently if proper namespacing is implemented with imports, ie.
it should be evident.
A large refactor is coming to the pulse module, it will likely end up with a PulseControlFlowGraph and PulseBlock being implemented as the underlying components of the Schedule, so now is an appropriate time to consider renaming.
Ideally this would wait till after 0.9 is out.
yeah not before but I want to see how it all fits with circuit and transpiler and future extensions. We can talk more just when doing the documentation noted this did not fit so wanted to make an issue.
the documentation is here https://qiskit.org/documentation/the_elements.html#terra
I think if it has to be a Pulse Schedule the Circuit should be a Quantum Circuit since semantically it is the same differentiation 😄 .
Also Github #3000 🎆 🍾 💯 !
feel free to update the documentation :-) and I think quantum is a bit more special than pulse :-). But I agree 3000 is cool.
I'm not sure calling it schedule is a good idea, because we will be adding a scheduler module which also has a schedule method (and later also a rescheduler). I see how the other modules match object to module name better than pulse. I also like how it is now, I think pulse.Schedule has a nice clarity to it. Not sure if there is another naming scheme that wouldn't cause name conflicts.
Closing as stale. Feel free to reopen.
