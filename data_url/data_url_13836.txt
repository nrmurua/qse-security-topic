The qubit_count method in graph_s.py is implement as the following where its output is based on the max value of qubit information stored in the _qindex dictionary.
Since qubit is same as the y coordinate of a node, it is not always an integer. This makes the above method return a floating point number which breaks methods like extract_circuit.
I don't believe extract_circuit uses any positioning information, only the g.inputs() and g.outputs() information. The reason this function returns the maximum value is so that you can get the 'height' of the diagram. That's maybe not intuitive, but changing this would require possibly other changes in the drawing code that check for the size of the diagram.
I get the error on line 510 in the clean_frontier method that's called by extract_circuit on line 636. The error is due to qubit_count returning a floating point.
You can probably reproduce it in ZXLive by clicking extract_circuit in the simplify menu for a diagram that has been dragged around with the mouse.
Ah right, that function was implemented by someone else, who probably didn't know about this special behaviour.
That function really should be using len(outputs) instead, that's what the other functions use.
Now it fails at line 98 in graphparser.py for the same reason
when trying to convert the extracted circuit back to graph
What error does it give there? c should be a Circuit, not a graph, so I don't see how this same bug could apply.
I get the following error.
This is circuit I used:

Does that fix it?
Now I get error even earlier.
I am attaching the graph, if that helps you with the debugging (had to zip because github doesn't support json files).

Okay, another try.
It seems to work now üëç
