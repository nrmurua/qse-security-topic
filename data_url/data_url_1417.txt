Summarize the task
After #4722, all optimizers in cirq-core have been migrated to the new transformer API #4483, re-implemented using new moment-preserving transformer primitives and support no-compile tags.
This issue is to track the migration of all optimizers in cirq's vendor packages to the new transformer infrastructure.
Acceptance criteria - when is the task considered done?
When the following optimizers have been migrated to new transformer infrastructure.
Note that most of the Convert* type optimizers can be replaced with the newly added cirq.optimize_for_target_gateset transformer. To do the migration, user would just need to create a new target gateset that can be used as an argument to the above transformer. The new gateset can be simply created by deriving from cirq.TwoQubitCompilationTargetGateset. See #5007 for a sample migration PR.
Part of roadmap: #3238
I updated Pasqal and neutral atoms, which are now converted.
@tanujkhattar Can you update this list?  optimize_for_xmon is now replaced by optimize_for_target_gateset, right?  Are any of the other optimizers completed?
This is now complete.
