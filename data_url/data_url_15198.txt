When a circuit has a parameterized MCRY gate and noancilla mode is selected by the gate, the gate parameter is not bound after calling assign_parameters(). This causes Aer simulator to fail when such a circuit is executed. Since the mode is chosen automatically when it is not set explicitly, the bug appears not in every circuit where mcry is applied. This problem may be overcome by setting use_basis_gates to True. I guess, the same issue is valid for MCRX and MCRZ gates.
Run the snippet:
The output:
If I set use_basis_gate="True" in the snippet above everything is fine. But this is just a workaround.
I think #8301 is a similar same issue. Also #9514 seems related
This particular issue was fixed by #11032.
