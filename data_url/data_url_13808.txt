As it has been recently introduced the call to to_clifford_normal_form_graph(g)
(Thanks a lot for that!)
I just run (4-July-2023) the command pip install pyzx.
However, the new function seems not to be part of the pyzx.simplify package.
Error on screen: module 'pyzx.simplify' has no attribute 'to_clifford_normal_form_graph'
That's because I have not yet pushed a new version of PyZX to pip (I should do this sooner rather than later I think), so it is not available yet. You can get the latest source release by doing pip install git+https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx.git.
Amazing!
