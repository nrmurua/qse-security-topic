If Dask was previously used, and we use covalent start --no-cluster, dispatching a workflow with LocalExecutor seems to fail.  Getting the result afterwards seems to throw the error:
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 503 Server Error: Service Unavailable for url: http://localhost:48008/api/result/SOME_DISPATCH_ID?wait=True&status_only=False
Output from workflow should be: Hello, World!
No response
from @cjao:
covalent tries to assign dask as the default executor and dask info isn't automatically cleared from the config
so covalent purge && covalent start --no-cluster seems to be the steps to resolve issue

Hi @AlejandroEsquivel, #1020 addresses #1019 , not this one (which is still unsolved AFAIK).
Ah gotcha, thanks @cjao
