We have LLVM 3.5 and we need at least LLVM 3.6 for, at least, !nonnull metadata on loads.
I've upgraded to LLVM 3.6. Unfortunately this broke debug info (i.e. backtraces) as LLVM 3.6 has changed format; since the format changes again in 3.7 and 3.7 is what upstream llvmlite uses, we should just upgrade to LLVM 3.7.
3.5→3.6 took a day, 3.6→3.7 shouldn't take longer. I might even consider 3.7→3.8 with accompanying llvmlite changes if that's profitable.
This is done, isn't it? Maybe merge into release-1 and close this?
