Hello, thank you for this awesome library. I am using it for my master thesis at Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid (Spain) and find it really useful. While learning I have found an error in the documentation.
I am using qcodes v0.1.11 (last version I have been able to install with pip using your instructions (http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/start/index.html#installing-the-latest-qcodes-release). When I check the documentation of this version I can see there is a function load_or_create_experiment (http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/api/generated/qcodes.dataset.experiment_container.load_or_create_experiment.html) However, I cannot import it in qcodes.
I am still a novice with github and qcodes but I have been able to find that this function was introduced last summer while the last release of qcodes dates from April. Thus, I would expect not to see this function in the documentation of v0.1.11. This might be happening also for other new features, but I haven't explored further.
If I want to use these new features, would you recommend me to clone the github repo and install it from source or are you planning to make a new release soon?
Thanks for your feedback! :)
Yes, we haven't been doing pip releases because of a ton of work lately. So, for now, just follow http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/start/index.html#installing-qcodes-from-github to have the latest qcodes with all the latest updates.
