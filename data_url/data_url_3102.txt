N/A
qcs-api-client v0.8.0 doesn't have a poetry.lock file in its sdist on PyPi, and the source is not available elsewhere.
This is an issue when trying to reproducibly build pyquil, because qcs-api-client is a dependency. qcs-api-client doesn't seem to have a separate GitHub page, so posting this issue here for lack of other options.
When trying to reproducibly repackage pyquil for redistribution (e.g. Ubuntu apt repos, nixpkgs, etc), a poetry.lock file is necessary.

Nvm -- I see the issue is not with installing, but with packaging. Ignore the below.
Hey @drewrisinger. Thanks for the report. I've tried reproducing but with no success. I was able to both
in fresh environments.
How are you installing pyquil?
@drewrisinger if you're trying to create a locked build of pyquil for reproducibility, I'd recommend using the poetry.lock file for this project since that will contain the versions of all dependencies that we test with (including those that qcs-api-client depends on).
You can also clone this repo and do something like poetry export -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt to get a pip freeze-esque output which will likely mesh better with whatever tooling you're using for packaging.
@dbanty that's a good point, thanks. I'll give that a shot.
