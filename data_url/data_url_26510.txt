I am getting these errors:
What might be causing these errors?
Version: 9.1.0
gcc-12
FreeBSD 13.1
This is CP2K 9.1, but then you are using a new DBCSR (which version?)... Just use the right submodule as part of CP2K 9.1
@alazzaro
I use git submodule for DBCSR with hash=910c210 like the repository says.
As far I can see here https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/tree/support/v9.1/exts the hash is f4df17b for v9.1. Please check the DBCSR version too (exts/dbcsr/VERSION). The correct version is 2.2 for CP2K v9.1.
I see now, 910c210 hash is the current CP2K master, so you are mixing the versions...
This helped.
Thank you!
