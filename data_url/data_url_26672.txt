Hello. Morning.
I tried to install cp2k 8.1 using toolchain method.
in this method, ELPA-2020.05.001 could not  be make sucessful.
the environements are gnu with devtool-gcc-9.3.1 , intelmpi 19.1.1 and mkl 2020.4 preinstalled on redhat 7.9 with non-root.
cmake with 3.18.5 is binary executable download from the website of https://cmake.org/download/.
it seems that devtooset-9 could not support ompi
make.log
thanks.
another prerequisite, quip, reported an error. i don't know how to correct it.
configure.log
install_quip.sh.txt
it seems very hard to compile quip with intel fortran.
the third error is that the download link of sirius 7.0.0 reads a 404 error.
https://github.com/electronic-structure/SIRIUS/archive/v${sirius_ver}.tar.gz
the right location on github is https://github.com/electronic-structure/SIRIUS/tree/v7.0.0
without quip , it fails at the step of making local version of psmp with intel fortran
the log write the errors about the omp of the intel parallel xe studio 2020.4.
and the arch folder generated has no the file of local.popt
make.log
print.log
ELPA-2020.05.001 support gcc-9.3 but not for gcc-10. while in the script of install_gcc.sh, the default value is gcc-10.2
Hi It seems that you are using GNU Fortran compiler flags with the Intel Fortran compiler ifort which indicates that something went wrong during the configure phase.

ok, I think some of the errors in your print.log are legit and probably due to a newer compiler version and/or strictler flags. I will try to reproduce them with our Intel compiler, see issue #1282
In the meantime it would help us a lot if you could file separate issues for the different problems: the original title for this issue was about ELPA, gcc-9, Intel MPI and MKL. I've now opened #1282 for the Intel compilation and #1283 for the SIRIUS Toolchain issue.
I tried to install cp2k-8.1 on serveral OS like centos 7.9, 8.3 & feodra 33. when installing through toolchain method with gcc 8.3.1 or 10.2.1 and openmpi4.0.5, superlu-6.1 reports the same error.
cosma is compiled without error.
the make.log and module load openmpi file are uploaded. could you debug it ?
cmake.log
make.log
openmpi-4.0.5.txt
Since there have been a lot of changes to install_elpa.sh lately, this report is most likely outdated.
Thanks a lot for your attention. I am focusing on some chemical and materials experiments. So the calculations via cp2k does much less work. Later or some time, I will get back to reinstall the version of 8.2 or 9.0.
Best wishes!
