I think the folder hello world should be a place where the community puts their hello quantum programs. We have a few of them in there but it would be good to think about the structure of this.
@quantumjim can you think about this. The goal should be to be the simplest hello quantum program.
the landing from the main file is
3.1 Hello, Quantum World with Qiskit
Learn from the community how to write your first quantum program.
@quantumjim should we close this now and then you can open another one later for changes or make a project for it if there is lots of planning remaining.
I agree that it is closable, so I'll do it.
