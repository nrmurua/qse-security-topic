An example QASM 2 output of the QuantumVolume circuit with 3 qubits (only the snippet, not the whole circuit):
The same circuit but here is the snippet of it in QASM 3
Notice that the QASM 3 version has only 5 digits. This is because it is the default number for pi_check argument: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/007cc25bc44ad39955ff5ea8bfb988dff38c044b/qiskit/circuit/tools/pi_check.py#L28.
The relevant problematic line: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/007cc25bc44ad39955ff5ea8bfb988dff38c044b/qiskit/qasm3/exporter.py#L957
Whereas pi_check is set to 8 digits in the QASM 2 output as seen in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/007cc25bc44ad39955ff5ea8bfb988dff38c044b/qiskit/circuit/instruction.py#L458.
This causes them to have slightly different probability distributions when simulated.
See above.

No response
I have confirmed that setting the ndigits to 8 in the QASM 3 exporter fixes the probability distribution discrepancy.
