In ctlmgr.py, there are two nearly-identical classes (Controllers and ControllerDB). What is the point of having both, and the usage difference between them? Is there any reason that Controllers and ControllerDB can't be merged?
I'm trying to write docstrings for this module right now (drewrisinger@4a387be), and got confused about these.
ControllerDB is just a small adaptation layer on top of Controllers, that provides sync_struct_init() to use Subscriber.
ControllerDB doesn't really need to be a class though, set_host_filter can be inlined and sync_struct_init implemented as a bare function.
