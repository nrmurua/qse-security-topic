This used to run but now always fails. I have restarted from scratch and it happens again. The files needed to quickly reproduce are too large to attach. Here they are in the link:

Thank you for your attention. Happy New Year!

I have this same problem with
Intel(R) Fortran Intel(R) 64 Compiler for applications running on Intel(R) 64, Version 19.1.1.217 Build 20200306
and with
oneapi
I recompiled with -check pointers and it gives an error:
forrtl: severe (408): fort: (7): Attempt to use pointer LB_GLOBAL when it is not associated with a target

Please excuse the slow answer. Thank you for your report? Can you reproduce this error also with a smaller system or a reduced setup? This might help to pin down the actual culprit. I will have a look at it tomorrow.
If I make the following changes the TMS example runs. (Bold just for tracing)
Note I also have to make this change for anything to run!
HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT SATISFACTORY AS THE ref_COUNT KEEPS GOING UP AND FINALLY FAILS IN CLOSING WITH
___                                                                       *

Did you use Intel in all cases?
Your whole update is not portable as it targets the Intel compiler only. But I will check it on GCC.
I can reproduce the issue with GCC locally.
I have meanwhile narrowed it down to #2382 . I am currently bisecting to find the erroneous commit.
