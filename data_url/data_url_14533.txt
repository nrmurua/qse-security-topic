Tests do not run subsequent unittest.subTest blocks if one fails, and do not report the parameterisations in use at the time of the failure.
An example test file, called test_subtests.py:
and run with either python -munittest or stestr run gives an example output:
The test_subtests.Full case should also report two failures, and display the message "failure1" or "failure2" on a fail.
Likely a problem with testtools or the code we've imported from there into FullQiskitTestCase, similar to #7307, but I didn't want to put them in the same issue in case one part is much easier to solve than the other.
I believe this is a bug in testtools result handler (especially after #7311) that we use primarily so we can get attachments of stdout, stderr, and pylogging when running in parallel with stestr (without this they just print all at the same time making it hard to debug). We'll have to investigate and report upstream I think to try and fix this.
It's more than just the results handler - the tests actually fail out and stop running on the first failure.  I made a simple test that leaked its run state out by touching some files:
and the result is that t2.txt isn't created.  I've opened testing-cabal/testtools#317 to track.
