It is hard to maintain the gradle buildfiles when new Java versions are released, and I often have issues in NetBeans and IntelliJ with it.
I don't want to lose the setup, but the IDE's look at the root directory and when gradle files are detected, the maven files are ignored. As a consequence, I don't have code completion in my IDE's.
