Description of the issue
A classically controlled op causes moment printing to fail. The op itself renders correctly, and a circuit containing the moment renders correctly. Just the moment itself fails to render.
How to reproduce the issue
v0.15
The root cause is label_map is not passed in by Moment.to_text_diagram. Thus ClassicallyControlledOperation._circuit_diagram_info_ needs to handle args.label_map is None in a couple places. In particular control_count should be zero if there's no label map, and the condition labels should always be added if there's no label map.
