Currently, in Qiskit-Pulse arbitrary pulse channels are of type ControlChannel. Typically these are used for two-qubit interactions so the name InteractionChannel is hopefully more descriptive.
Thoughts @ajavadia @lcapelluto?
I had discussed the name at length with @dcmckayibm once (can't say if he is still of the same opinion now, though), and we had thought "derived channel" was a good name for them, since there is that u_channel_lo list which gives the control channels their definition in terms of drive channel frequencies. Is this feature of the control channel going to be removed?
I also have to bring up that drive channels also interact with qubits. DriveChannel and InteractionChannel seem even more like synonyms than Drive and Control
I really do not like the name derived channel as it is possible someday we will want to disconnect certain properties (say the frequency) of these channels dynamically.
so, the ControlChannel is really just a second DriveChannel. I don't think we will be able to come up with a good name if there's nothing distinguishing about it
MultiQubitDriveChannel ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ :(  its hard to think of a name that also applies to all quantum implementations that works better than Control
The problem is the channel could represent anything that changes a term in the Hamiltonian, so it could have nothing to do with multiple qubits or interactions (e.g. a fast flux control knob).
Ok, so we shall remain with ControlChannel until the right name smacks us in the head üòÑ.
