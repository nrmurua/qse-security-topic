I am new to quantum computing and I want to use  Qutip to calculate the entanglement entropy on my M1 MacBook Pro. However, I cannot import the Qutip library into either Jupyter notebook or Python3.9. The error message as shown in follow. May I ask how to solve this problem? Thank you.
Hi which version of qutip are you running ? This seems to be fixed on the current master.
Thank you for your reply. I used pip to download the qutip and the version of qutip is 4.5.3
QuTiP 4.5.3 doesn't support M1 Macs, sorry. None of us has access to one to test, and our CI didn't support them for quite a while.
This will be fixed in the next release of QuTiP. In the meantime, you can either build the package from the current source code here, or you can go into your QuTiP installation folder and comment out lines 48 and 49 of qutip/hardware_info.py to work around it.
Thank you for your reply, jakelishman. Now I can run Qutip code on my M1 Mac.
@rickypang0219 That's great!
