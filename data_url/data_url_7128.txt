Hello,
First, thanks for this nice project. I'm interesting in using the library behind this project, but is there a way to perform interactive mesurements, i.e. just measure one qubit without measuring everything, so that I can, after receiving the measurement, eventually apply other gates, measure other qubits... Since I want an actual user to provide the measurements to do in real time, gates controlled by measurement outcomes are not enough for my need.
Thanks.
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Tobias. The short answer is noâ€”and this is because of entanglement. Once qubits are entangled there is no meaningful separation to be made between them; the state of the system is the state of the system and not is de-composable. (This is part of what makes quantum computation so powerfulâ€”and so intensive to simulate.)
However, a longer and more open-ended answerâ€¦ We could step-through the circuit, one moment at a time, and show the system state at each moment. And there are some other aspects we could measure per-registerâ€¦ Perhaps this is a good time for me to raise a hand âœ‹ and ask for a physicistâ€™s input! (Bueller? Anyone?!)
