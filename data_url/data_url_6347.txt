I will be giving an overview talk on Qrack with Sarah Kaiser of the Unitary Fund! The event will be on https://www.twitch.tv/unitaryfund, on November 12th at 12 PM EST.
I plan to explain the engineering and design of Qrack for the software developer, as well as the physicist writing quantum computing ("QC") simulation algorithms. I will include a "roadmap" to our layer stack, CPU/GPU, ket/stabilizer, with QUnit, all "hybridized" and operating together. I will also give a brief explanation of the core "novel optimization method" of QUnit, in terms of rules for QC gate tensor replacements based on symmetries coupled to the active logical states in time of qubit registers. I hope to present preliminary updated benchmarks, and I will take questions from attendees to the live stream.
I look forward to speaking with you all! The Unitary Fund also has a Discord: https://discord.com/invite/JqVGmpkP96
The talk was fun! The permanent home of the recording is here on YouTube, (on the Unitary Fund channel, with many thanks)!
