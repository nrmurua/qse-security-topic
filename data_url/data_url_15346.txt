qpy appends an extra "_o{ctrl_state}" to the name of qiskit.circuit.ControlledGate instances with non-default values for ctrl_state (so after one serialization+deserialization round the gate.name becomes "{name}_o{ctrl_state}_o{ctrl_state}", and after a second round becomes "{name}_o{ctrl_state}_o{ctrl_state}_o{ctrl_state}", etc)
every print statement above should print "cs_o0"

Thanks for the report - the problem, as with a lot of parts of ControlledGate, is that various things are calculated dynamically rather than stored, so QPY was storing the data with the dynamic additions, rather than the base data.  #8571 should hopefully fix your issues.
