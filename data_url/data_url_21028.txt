The ip addresses for qrl nodes keep on failing. I will attach the specification below. *Currently running on Ubuntu OS via windows 10 WSL. Apparently the first ip address stated '104.237.3.185' is the only one with the successful connections and furthermore when I attempted to create a slaves.json file, it makes an error.
The error is displayed like this:
ksangsu95@4ghzM1:~$ qrl -r --host 104.237.3.185 slave_tx_generate

The nping sends a different kind of data, which is not understood by gRPC this is why your connection was refused. You faced error validating argument while generating slave txn because you entered the wallet address into src instead of wallet index. Make sure you have wallet.qrl in the current working directory while you generate slave_tx
and instead of providing address into src, provide the wallet index.
You can check your wallet index, by using command
qrl wallet_ls
Okay thanks!
