Hai
I have developed my iOS application in swift language and I like to integrate liboqs in my application. Let me know the possibility and process to integrate this in my application
Sorry, but we don't have any SDKs or examples specifically for iOS.  However you should be able to compile liboqs for Apple A-series chips without a problem, as we have tested liboqs compilation for Apple M1 chips.  If you come up with any working example code that you'd like to share, we'd be happy to receive it as a pull request.
@BTManiKandan FYI, a swift Google search (pardon the pun) returns this: https://theswiftdev.com/how-to-call-c-code-from-swift . Seems pretty straightforward.
