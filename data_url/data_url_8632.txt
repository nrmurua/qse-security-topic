It is really great to use qutip 3.0 in iPython notebook with the HTMLProgressbar, especially when using mesolve or essolve. Unfortunately there is no progressbar when using the propagator function.
Would it be possible to implement this, for propagator (and/or possible other functions), since it calls mesolve, which already has it implemented?
Thanks
Thanks for the suggestion. This is a good idea, and should be relatively simple to implement.
