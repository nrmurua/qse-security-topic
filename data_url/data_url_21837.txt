I've seen this same behavior loading four times.
For one thing, the amplitude needs to be set between 0-1 and not 100MHz
Ah right. With sawg.amplitude1.set(0.5) this works as startup kernel as in the past. Glad this is a typo and not a regression. :)
@sbourdeauducq   Shouldn't there be a bound checking for amplitude?
