Add a CR Pulse into https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/terra/calibrating_a_qubit.ipynb
@dcmckayibm do you still want this -- if so what is the status?
Yes, I think it's important to show how to do a schedule on a U channel. @nkanazawa1989 said he can do it asap.
I added the experiment. but CR pulse is not perfectly calibrated. the purpose is just showing the use case of U channels.
