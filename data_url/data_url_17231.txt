If additional kwargs/args are supplied to cmd_def.get no error is raised and a result is still returned if the required parameters are present.
An error should be raised if unnecessary args/kwargs are supplied. Similarly for an insufficient number of args/kwargs if partial binding is not supported.
Add error checks. @nkanazawa1989 could you check if your PR #2493 fixes this?
No problem, this will raise an error in PR #2493 .
