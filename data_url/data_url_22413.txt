I'm testing out the transport code and have 4 pdqs hooked up. I closed the terminal of one of the pdq_controllers and got this error,
From the traceback I can see it's due to the electrodes entry in device_db
But it would be useful if the error message specified that, along with which specific pdq failed.
Modifying the exception (which is generated by Python) sounds inappropriate. What can be done is adding logger.debug calls that trace what devices are requested and what connections are attempted, and then, when you get the error, you can run the experiment again in debug mode to determine where it failed. Sounds OK?
Having the device manager rethrow exceptions with added information would be fine here IMHO.
