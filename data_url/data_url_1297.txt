Is this expected?
How to reproduce the issue
put long logs in details blocks like this
Cirq version
v1.15.0
The original intent of allowing exponent on operation was so that one could write cirq.X(q)**p and have it be the same as (cirq.X**p)(q). This was added long before tags were a thing, but I think it'd make sense to preserve tags when exponentiating.
