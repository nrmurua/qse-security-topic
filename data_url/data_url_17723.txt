Setting width and height in the options to the interactive visual iplot_cities returns an empty figure, with just the controls.

It seems to be working fine. @nonhermitian, please show an example where the visualisation fails to try to understand the problem.


Figures arrangement depends on their own width and the page width.
I think the problem is you're trying to use inches (I don't know why) to define the size of the images. You have to use pixels instead.
So, the issue is that originally the interactive tools were supposed to be as close to drop in replacements for the original Matplotlib versions.  Matplotlib figsize is the figure size in inches.  The docs for the interactive visualizations do not mention the need for pixels as the size.  So one would expect the figure size units to be the same.  In addition, setting figure size values of (5,5), for example, returns a normal sized figure, and not a 5x5 pixel image.
