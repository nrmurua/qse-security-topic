Building liboqs with clang on an Apple M1 Mac yields build failures related to the new Picnic code.
Reproduce by checking out 4479f50 and then running cmake -GNinja ...
I have a potential fix for that issue lined up for Picnic 3.0.9.
Do we want to disable Picnic on M1 until then? I see @sebastinas that you have a work in progress PR #1167 for Picnic 3.0.9; when do you think this will be ready?
The PR is ready.
I just re-ran commit 202b2be from #1167 and still get build failures with clang on Apple M1.  I didn't check all the output, but the first few failures seem to be the same as in my output above.
@sebastinas If you need access to an Apple M1 machine to test, I can give you access to our test machine.
