I created a pass manager as follows:
to mimic the default set of passes.  However, when running a circuit through it I get the following error (for a width 5 circuit) in the StochasticSwap:
It seems that this is because the coupling map (in this case a 20q machine) has edges that are outside of the default initial_layout that is generated if no layout is given to the mapper.  This is leading to a KeyError because the register is smaller than the full number of qubits. Indeed, if I run a width 20 circuit, it works without error.
The PR #1737 should solve this.
