Here is a simple test case to crash the function FixedEmbeddingComposite. The QUBO info is in this file
q96.zip, which is used to construct a 96x96 QUBO numpy matrix.
The strange thing is that the find_embedding actually succeeds, but the FixedEmbeddingComposite crashes with this error:
ValueError: no embedding found
Hello @DevelopDaily, I am not finding an embedding for this Q matrix, using find_embedding. Could you please capture the embedding that you found, as a JSON object, and attach it here? find_embedding, for me, is returning an empty set, indicating that it didn't find an embedding.
find_embedding returns an empty dictionary when it cannot find an embedding. FixedEmbeddingComposite then raises an exception to indicate that to the user.
When you say that "find_embedding actually succeeds" do you mean that it returns an embedding or an empty dict?
The find_embedding returns an empty dictionary. I expect the find_embedding would also throw an exception if it cannot find an embedding as the FixedEmbeddingComposite does. Anyway, that is my wrong assumption.
Now that I understand the empty dictionary return actually means "failed to find an embedding", what should I do to make it find one?
Mind you, my QUBO matrix is quite simple. It is populated with random numbers between -10 and 10.
First you should make sure that you're targeting an advantage system rather than a QPU.
If your QUBO is dense, you should try to use DWaveCliqueSampler with an advantage system. I believe 96 variables should fit.
An alternative would be to tune the running of minorminer, to see if a longer run will result in it finding an embedding.
An intermediate solution is to use the clique embedder (this is done under the hood with DWaveCliqueSampler)
Good suggestion, @arcondello. Just a minor typo, it should say topology__type='pegasus'.
Thank's @randomir, fixed above.
@arcondello Thanks. Your advice works perfectly.
@boothby Your code does not work for me. Could you please elaborate more on your code? When running it, I got these arcane errors:
Ah, my apologies, I swapped the arguments to find_clique_embedding.  I've edited my comment.
@boothby Thanks. It works beautifully now.
