It seems like I could change or remove the option if I could find it. Here is a dump of my issue with  setup.py:

That particular flag is causing trouble as ARM cpus do not have the SSE extensions.  Instead ARM v7+ use the NEON extensions.  As such, the build is failing.  However, this flag is really only useful for x86 (32-bit) systems where the fpmath is not set to use SSE by default.  On x64 it is.  In reality, I am not even sure if that flag does any good for our particular code as it is not written to directly use SSE anyway.  If you want to remove this flag yourself, it is in the setup.py files in the 'cy' and 'control' directories inside the qutip directory.
Given that their are no commercially available ARM systems outside of the Raspberry PI and MS Surface.  I am not sure if adding support for ARM extensions is really necessary at the moment.
This is addressed in #311.
Out of curiosity, which ARM hardware are you trying to use QuTiP on?
Closing this issue since it has been addressed, and no response to the final question.
