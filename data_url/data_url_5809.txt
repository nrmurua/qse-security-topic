When executing noise simulations on some circuits, I get this error:
I do not know all of the conditions that cause this problem. The problem seems to occur for larger circuits (in the 100's of gates and about 15 qubits). It also has occurred across at least a dozen different circuits for me  so far.
However, it seems to also occur when using the cloud ibmq_qasm_simulator (error 5204 for certain circuits)
This code reproduces the error consistently on my machine:
Using this circuit: bug_qasm_circuit.txt
I  have found that this error is incredibly specific; if p=0, the error does not occur and if shots is anything large (e.g.  1000) the error does not occur.
I believe #1384 will fix this issue.
In the latest version of qiskit-aer==0.10.0 I am still getting a similar error for a small number of shots:
Thank you for your confirmation. 0.10.0 is not released yet but I guess @epelofske-LANL tested with your custom build from the main branch.
Recently, I added #1392. I hope it works this issue.
@hhorii That is correct - I tested 0.10.0 by installing from the main branch.
I just tried again with the current version on github, and I got this error again:
It looks like the latest installation of qiskit-aer==0.10.0 from source works with no malloc errors in my code. Closing the issue.
I am still having an issue when trying the lines of code, I am using the latest released qiskit version. I get IBMQJobApiError: "Unable to retrieve result for job 61e6cb8cd1eb078c364951a5: 'results'" when trying on the ibmq_qasm_simulator.
