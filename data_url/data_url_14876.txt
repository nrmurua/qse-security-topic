The code is working on colab with the same versions of the libraries.
But on M1 Mac and OS: Ventura 13.5.1
The code is private. If possible to help from error kindly do so. I am sorry for the inconvenience.
I guess numpy is the issue here but do not have any concrete evidence against it.
If you want help from us, I'm sorry, but you're going to need to put the effort in to make a minimal reproducer that we're allowed to see.
sure, kindly allow me sometime to get the relevant permission
This shouldn't be a question of permissions; a minimal reproducer should not use any of your research code, and we don't want to see your research code.  What's helpful to us is the absolute smallest possible code block that reproduces the problem you're seeing.  Ideally, that's less than 20 lines in total, including imports.

Closing as can't repro
Hello,
The error is produced while using vqc.fit() with COBYLA optimiser.
That is not a complete and minimal reproducing example.  Please read the materials attached to the issue template and also linked in the comment chain above about how to interact when asking for help.
