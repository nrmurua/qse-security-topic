An issue raised during #1254:
Also Is it possible in the template to show the subsection when that section is viewed.
The new fancy design currently does not show subsections in the left-side TOC pane (except for the autodocs). Ideally it should show the subsections, allowing collapsing with sensible defaults and usability.
