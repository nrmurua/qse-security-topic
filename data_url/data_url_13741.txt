There's a very easy bug that could happen in a few folding methods -- e.g., mitiq.folding.fold_moments and mitiq.folding.fold_gates -- if moments are not retained in the conversion. (For example, converting from a qiskit.QuantumCircuit to a cirq.Circuit.)
Specifying the moment indices and gate indices for the qiskit.QuantumCircuit would thus lead to unexpected behavior in the folded circuit.
One option is to make such functions private.
Note that the change to _fold_gate_at_index_in_moment in Pull #88 fixes one bug in this issue. Namely, conversions can introduce empty moments into the circuit, which would cause Cirq to throw an IndexError when it tried to fold a gate in an empty moment.
After our discussion this can be closed. @rmlarose @andreamari @nathanshammah Re-open if there's more to discuss on this one
