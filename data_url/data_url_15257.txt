The VQE is most commonly used with SPSA or gradient descent, which require 2 or (up to) 2 * num_parameters circuit evaluations per iterations, respectively. Since the new execution model is shifting from using the runtime VQE program to the primitive-based VQE in Terra, we should also enable batching as many circuits per default as possible. Otherwise the standard usage of the VQE will be much slower than necessary (~2 or 2 * num_parameters to slow ðŸ˜…).
This is something the runtime VQE also did, maybe we can use the same defaults?
Actually, maybe we can consider this as performance bug and put it in the 0.22.1 release for November ðŸ¤”
As long as we don't add any new flags or change the api I think it's fine to backport and include this in 0.22.1 as a performance fix.
