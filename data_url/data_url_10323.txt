Current Problem
While the dwave install CLI command allows us to install contributor Ocean tools such as the Problem Inspector, it does not let us entirely upgrade this tool. For example, when upgrading dwave-ocean-sdk, the dwave-inspectorapp package does not get automatically upgraded to the latest version, because dwave-inspectorapp is installed by dwave install.
Proposed Solution
Add an upgrade option to dwave install, such as dwave install -u and dwave install --upgrade
