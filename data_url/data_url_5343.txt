Hi there,
while I was working on a Spack recipe for PennyLane and PennyLane-Lightning, I have noticed two small issues:
For reference my Spack PR: spack/spack#34838
Thank you for reporting this issue @marcodelapierre.
We will definitely look into this.
Hi @marcodelapierre thanks for reporting this. Just an FYI, there was some prior work started on adding Spack support back last year, but we never opened a PR due to additional commitments needed to complete this (https://github.com/mlxd/spack/tree/pennylane_lightning)
I'll try to take a look at your PR later this week, and see if we need to combine anything from my branch onto yours for this.
