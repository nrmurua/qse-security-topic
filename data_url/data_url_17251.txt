When attempting to condition a measure on the register containing the target bit:

The drawer also has difficulty with them:
Conditioning a measure on a separate register seems to work okay

TIL that conditional measurements are a thing.
This is actually probably not a bug, save for in the random testing.  There is no causality defined in this situation, so you get the cyclic graph.
I don't see the lack of causality here. qc.measure(1,0).c_if(qc.cregs[0], 0) to me decomposes as "Check the value of creg0; if 0, trigger a measure of qubit 1 into clbit 0" which should be well defined. The presence or absence of the measure is dependent on the value of clbit 0 is at the start of the operation, not what it will be at the end.
That said, I don't know of an algorithm or use case that requires a conditional measure, I wouldn't be opposed to not supporting them (this is the first time I came across them as well) but then we should raise early when building them, rather than throwing not a DAG down the road. We also allow conditional barriers, by the way, which seems more obviously a bug.
Actually I agree with you.  I was wrong, there is an order.
