I'm asserting that two operators are almost equal, and implementing a round method for Qobj would be useful in this regard.
Qobj equality has a tolerance option in qutip's settings:
The other features of such a function might be already taken care of by Qobj.tidyup(), which similarly can be called with Qobj.tidyup(atol=1).
