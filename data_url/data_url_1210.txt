Description of the issue
Notebook tests are failing on master with ImportError: Numba needs NumPy 1.24 or less.
This is probably caused by the recent Python 3.11 upgrade?
How to reproduce the issue
See https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/actions/runs/5617237054/job/15221015891?pr=6095 for example
Cirq version
I have tracked this down to interference between tested notebooks, they all shared a temporary directory for packages pip-installed from notebooks.  #6218 isolates tests by using a new pip-target directory for each test.
