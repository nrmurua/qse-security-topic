Add support to QubitVector for the multi-plexer gate.
This is an N+M qubit gate, where the first N qubits are control qubits, and the last M qubits are the target qubits. For each possible state of the control qubits (2^N total), a different M-qubit matrix U_j should be applied to the target qubits.
This implements matrix multiplication by a M+N qubit matrix: U = sum_{i=0}^{2^N-1}  U_i⊗|i⟩⟨i| where i index the computational basis states on the N control qubits.
Controlled gates are a special case of this. Eg
The qobj for this gate generated by Terra should be:
where each Uj is a 2^M x 2^M matrices.
