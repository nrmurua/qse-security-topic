The root cause of dwavesystems/dwave-tabu#86 is the behavior of Initialized.parse_initial_states, where as_samples is used with copy=False default, and then vartype converted in place, modifying the input initial_states -- but only partially. Raw sample data is converted, but SampleSet's vartype is not.

There seems to be a bug in as_samples as well, where the copy argument is ignored for certain cases (ie. the one mentioned in dwavesystems/dwave-tabu#86)

It seems like the fix for this issue is to address the as_samples bug and then call as_samples with copy=True in parse_initial_states.
