parse_if.py depends the command python being in $PATH, but some distros may not provide that symlink anymore (and have only python3). Only a warning is shown while the build should actually abort:
Fixed via #927 and #1334.
I should have stated it more clearly from the start what the issue is here, sorry.
We are not catching errors when running parse_if.py, so until we notice it due to a package also requiring python that Python is not available we may already have built some of the packages with a possibly invalid configuration (due to silent fail of parse_if.py).
We should therefore either correctly fail if parse_if.py fails or at least make sure that a suitable Python version is available.
While being at it, we should also ensure that all packages we build use the same Python version, in case the user overrides it in some way (or document on how the user can override it in a way such that all packages pick it up correctly).
