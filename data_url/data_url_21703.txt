Instructions covered in "Developing ARTIQ" are outdated as nix-scripts repository does not exist anymore. Additinally there is a typo in link to the Conda installation script in "Installing ARTIQ" (in manual).
That repository is moved to https://git.m-labs.hk/m-labs/nix-scripts.
As for the conda script location, for now use the links on https://m-labs.hk/artiq/resources.html for the latest documentation version.
That's fine for me, however googling artiq manual points to the reasonable looking location https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-master/installing.html what may be misleading for newbies.
