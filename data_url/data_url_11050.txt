When I run the sample code on the VQE page
vqe_inst.expectation(small_ansatz([angle]), hamiltonian, 10000, qvm)
There is an error shown as below


I just fixed this on PyQuil master. We will release a new version of PyQuil and Grove tomorrow. In the meantime you can use pip install git+git://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyquil.git to install the fixed version.
