Description of the issue
Numpy does not currently have an override for the case when the type is of the form operator, indices, operator, indices, etc.
numpy/numpy#21978
When this is added to numpy and we are upgraded to a version that captures this, we should fix the places where we have had ignore mypy errors.
Cirq version
v0.15
Wow numpy already has submitted a fix, will need to wait for our numpy version to catch up.
