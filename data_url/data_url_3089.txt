In Zendesk #1739 a user suggested that it would be useful to clarify in the documentation why the output is different and what the meaning of the different output is in the second example at:
https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/compiler.html
if the QVM in the example is replaced with a QPU.
Add a QPU version of the example to the documentation and have the new documentation explain why the output is different.
Existing example with QVM:
Example with QPU:
Please note that the examples have been modified in order to obtain output as referred to in the following documentation issue:
#1396
Output from each of the two examples is attached.
QVM Example Output.txt
QPU Example Output.txt
In the QPU example the output returned for the executable starts off with "EncryptedProgram". It has been requested that the reason for/meaning of this be clarified in the documentation.
