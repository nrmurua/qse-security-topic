This issue keeps track of the items that have been marked as deprecated in 0.7+, in order to remove them before 0.8:
I'm not sure we actually ever deprecated QISKitError we just setup the alias for backwards compat. If we do plan to remove it we should mark it as deprecated (a warning will be difficult to emit because it's the base exception). That being said it's not like it's a lot of debt to keep around (only a couple lines) I'm not sure if it's worth the large breaking change to remove just that.
For tracking, related PRs: #1664, #1659, #1666, #1680, #1681
Thanks @max-reuter for taking care of most of the deprecations! The final one is QISKitError - while we did not emit a warning for practical reasons indeed, I think we actually did conceptually deprecate it, as it is marked not for use. With that in mind, and seeing that it is the last stronghold where we use the old capitalization (started at #1382) and we embarked into more breaking changes in the past, I'll submit a PR.
Seems the deprecations for 0.7 are completed - please reopen if needed.
