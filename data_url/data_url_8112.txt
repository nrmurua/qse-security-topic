Describe the bug
Providing seed as an integer to rand_dm does not fixate the seed but randomizes it for each run. In the documentation of rand_dm a description of seed is missing.
To Reproduce
The terminal out put is different for each run
Expected behavior
This gives the correct expected behavior
Additional context
Please add a description of seed in rand_dm that specifies that the seed parameter should be given as np.random.seed
The seed is ignored when pure=True.
Thank you for catching this.
