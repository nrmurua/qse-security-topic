I am attempting to rerun a notebook that worked back in Dec. of 2022: https://quantum-enablement.org/events/skku-2022/Runtime-3.html
For Aer version 12, the VQE problem on the simulator repeatedly converges to an incorrect value hovering in the range of ~-0.57, whereas the true value is ~-0.70.  Downgrading Aer to the previous version, e.g 0.11.2, once again returns values consistent with previous results, eg. -0.698, and expectation of using a noise-less simulator.
Re-run notebook section using Aer Estimator
The Estimator in version 12 should yield results inline with the previous version and the known result.
