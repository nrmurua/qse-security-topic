Following the pulse gate tutorial, I can add the following pulse sequence as the definition for a Hadamard gate with no errors:
This should fail at circ.add_calibration('h', [0], h_q0) because there is only one drive channel per qubit, and the circuit only has two qubits.  It also does not raise an error at transpilation even if targeting a 5Q device that has drive channels 0->4 only.
Do safety checks.
I am certainly in favor of doing additional checks in the transpiler during compilation.
One workaround is that if the backend were supplied to the pulse builder + the usage of builder channel accessor methods rather than constructing the IR objects directly, this would have been caught during the construction of the program.
>>> BackendConfigurationError: 'Invalid index for 5-qubit system.'
This should be accompanied by validation passes in the transpiler.
See documentation I've added encouraging usage of pulse.build(backend) here Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#1134.
