Description of the issue
assert_circuits_with_terminal_measurements_are_equivalent throws an error when a QasmUGate uses a Symbol parameter.
How to reproduce the issue
put long logs in details blocks like this
Cirq version
You can get the cirq version by printing cirq.__version__. From the command line:
This issue is stale because it has been open 30 days with no activity. Remove stale label or comment or this will be closed in 30 days
This happens because cirq.resolve_parameters only performs simple symbol substitution, not full evaluation of symbolic expressions. The circuit is
both before and after the call to cirq.resolve_parameters. Unfortunately, QasmUGate manipulates the angles you pass in (by doing modulo), so replacing p_96fafa / np.pi with an instance of sympy.Symbol will not help.
I think what needs to be done here is:
We could also revisit the question of performing some symbolic evaluations in cirq.resolve_parameters.
Did a quick search to see whether we ourselves pass symbolic values into QasmUGate and it turns out we do, so it's not as simple as adding type annotations. For example, we use QasmUGate to implement PhasedXZGate._qasm_.
Marked it as accepted and updated the title to reflect that we need to update QasmUGate to correctly support symbols for its parameters.
I can try this as well. Please assign it to me.
Thank you!
