If a target has ideal gates with all error rates of 0 reported the output from the pass will translate from one gate to another unecessarily.
The output should remain as h because it's in the target and has the same error rate and gate count as UGate. While both outputs are valid and the transpiler is doing it's job, in this situation it's a bit unexpected for the pass to translate the gate when the input was still valid and by the error heuristics no better or worse than the translated output.
I think we probably need to add a condition to fallback to the input in the substitution checks if the output of all the synthesis routines are of equal weight.
Following up on the discussion in #10592.
I'd like to work on this. I can't yet guarantee that I'll have the necessary bandwidth in the coming days, but I'll see what I can do!
I hope you don't mind I was hitting this more frequently now that qiskit-aer is using BackendV2 so I pushed up: #11351 to fix this issue.

Not at all. Many thanks for the fix and sorry that I didn't manage to get to it sooner ðŸ¥²
