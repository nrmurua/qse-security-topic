Could not reproduce.
That function is itself defined in the same file, ASTBridge.cpp, near line 355. It's not clear why the linker can't resolve a relocation in an object file to a symbol that should be defined in the same object file. Was the object file somehow truncated?
I fooled with the #ifdefs to get it to build.  It wasn't clear why these weren't unconditional.
I see it now. Thanks.
