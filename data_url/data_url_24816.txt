Issue #20 resulted in a (prototype of a) PulseHardwareUploadInterface which enables the implementation of the upload_waveform(..) method of the PulseTemplate class hierarchy.
Implement and test upload_waveform(..) for BranchPulseTemplate and LoopPulseTemplate.
Requires #25 (and #22) .
Part of #13.
Afflicted by #27 . This issue then refers to the implementation of build_sequence().
BranchPulseTemplate still needs to be implemented.
