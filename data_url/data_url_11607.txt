Grover supplies a parameter called number of iterations. Construct_circuit builds a circuit based on some internal iteration count to Grover. So construct circuit before grover is run returns it will a circuit per iteration 1, and after it is run it returns a circuit with the number of iterations it ran to.
The enhancement would be to have a num_iterations parameter on the construct_circuit so a caller can build one as they see fit. Internally the algorithm could use this too rather than how its done today.

Hey! May I work on this issue ?
Yes, sure! And you can also refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md here that has information that may be of help.
