Hello,
I am packaging quantum-blackbird 0.2.4 on openSUSE, but I noticed the version 0.2.4 on pypi does not have test suite.
The github release does have test suite, would you mind release 0.2.4 with test?
Thank you very much.
Hi @kevinsmia1939, unfortunately the packaging structure we have chosen to use does not package up the tests for PyPI release. however, feel free to use the GitHub release, which does have access to the tests!
