In order to set the (client-communicated) default groups in OpenSSL-based applications that do not utilize/expose the SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list API, it would be sensible to allow setting this value by way of an environment variable along the lines of other such OpenSSL environment variables. It would be a (run-time/dynamic) extension of the already existing OQS_DEFAULT_GROUPS build variable.
Suggested name is TLS_DEFAULT_GROUPS. Syntax is comma-separated KEM group names (as consumed by SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list).
Implementing this will immediately resolve the remaining group-setting hurdle in #351.
