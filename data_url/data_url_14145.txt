#10915 (and #10871) highlighted the potential for issues with pickle serialization to go unnoticed in testing and only be noticed after release. The reason this can happen is that qiskit only (or most importantly at least) uses pickle implicitly as part of Python's multiprocessing module which uses pickle to send objects between processes. When BasePassManager.run() is called on multiple circuits on Linux (by default), it uses multiprocessing to transpile the circuits in parallel. When adding a new circuit related class, it may seem sufficient to write tests in process using the class or to add the class to individual circuits that are transpiled, but such tests will not test pickle behavior.
Generally, it is only necessary to test pickling when adding a __new__ since pickle can handle a "normal" class object without problems. It may be helpful to maintain a set of integration tests for serialization. One possible approach would be to generalize the tests in test_circuit_load_from_qpy to do round trip tests on any serialization/deserialization process and allow them to run on either qpy or pickle.
