The README file refers to https://benchmarks.mitiq.dev/ which is 404ing.

Hello @1ucian0, thank you for your interest in Mitiq!
If this is a bug report, please provide screenshots and/or minimum viable code to reproduce your issue, so we can do our best to help get it fixed. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can also ask us on the Unitary Fund Discord.
Maybe it should point to https://metriq.info/Submission/18 ?
Thanks Luciano. The site is live at https://unitaryfund.github.io/mitiq-bench/, and refers to a different type of benchmark than what metriq does. We do have unitaryfund/mitiq-bench#1 open to fix this issue because it should be live at benchmarks.mitiq.dev, but I just haven't gotten around to it yet. Since we have the other issue, I'll close this for now.
