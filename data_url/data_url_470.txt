At line 173 in vqe.cpp, the 'exp-val-z' for the Pauli kernel 'I' is hard coded to the value 1.0. While this is sensible behavior for noise simulations of vqe, this behavior does not make sense for noisy execution.
This request is to remove the hard coding of 'exp-val-z' for 'I' and replace with functionality that estimates the expectation value of 'I' using the prepared quantum state.
Hi, I would like to be assigned to this issue (if possible).
It might take me a while to submit a PR since I have only contributed to Python based projects so far.
Hey @purva-thakre thanks for offering to take this one.
Just in case you came here from the unitaryHACK, this Issue is not part of the unitaryHACK, so there will be no bounty associated with it.
Hi @amccaskey ! Thanks ! I am not taking part in unitaryHACK i.e no bounties expected.
