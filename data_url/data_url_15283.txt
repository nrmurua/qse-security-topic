Right now the target class doesn't have proper support for modelling instructions that have variable width. If you have a gate that can use more than a single number of qubits and the backend supports all variants of that instruction (or at least more than one). We don't have a way to express that. The target currently requires a 1:1 mapping of operation name to a Operation instance and that instance is used for type checking and parameter checking at different points in the transpiler. However this requirement won't work for variable width instructions because a single instance of the instructions can only have a single number of qubits.
To be able to accurately model these instructions being supported on a target backend we need to come up with an interface to model this in the target, which might mean introducing a TargetV2.
