Currently, Cirq's pdf output is in contrib because it's not particularly good. The margins are messed up, there's no boxing of multiqubit gates, etc, etc. Someone needs to go over this functionality and polish polish polish polish.
For example, we could directly use TIKZ (or some other library) instead of qcircuit (which has serious limitations). We could add boxing information to the diagram info emitted by gates. Etc Etc. This is a very open ended issue.

I might pick this up.
Are there any specifications or requirements of the pdf output? If you could provide some examples of how you would like certain algorithms to be rendered, that would be helpful.
I don't have any hard concrete specifications, which is part of why I labelled this a "project". Part of it is to decide on a good tradeoff between what is achievable and what looks good.
That being said, here are some specific points that I thought of:
Let's track this here and close #1290
