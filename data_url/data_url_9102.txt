Install the stim package as required and import it. But it cannot run properly on PyCharm. The result is "ImportError: PauliString: PyType_Ready failed (UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode bytes in position 46-47: invalid continuation byte)!"

Whoah, that's really strange. I need more information to debug this. Most likely something to do with using a unicode character in a __doc__ string, which should be fine.
What version of python are you using?
What operating system are you using?
How did you install stim? Just pip install stim from pycharm's terminal?
Also, does this only fail in stim version 1.2.*? Did it work in 1.0 and 1.1?
Yeahï¼Œit's really strange.
The Python version I'm using is 3.8.1 and I use Window10.
I install stim just pip install stim from pycharm's terminal.
Excuse me, what's wrong with that?
Also, does this only fail in stim version 1.2.*? Did it work in 1.0 and 1.1?
I tried all versions of stim on pycharm, and only version 1.0 was successful.
I seem to know what the problem is. I successfully import Stim under Ubuntu system. Can PyCharm use Stim in a Windows 10
I think the issue is that I'm not declaring the docstrings in C++ as being UTF8, but I use unicode characters. I'll put together a test version with the docstrings annotated appropriately and hand it along to you to try.
That would be great. Thank you very much.
@Oblak13 Here is a package with hopefully fixed encoding. Let me know if it works. You should be able to run pip install file_location from pycharm's terminal to install it.
stim-1.2.dev0.tar.gz
@Strilanc I ran a test. The stim package was successfully installed on PyCharm and passed. Now I can compile the quantum stabilizer circuits normally. I really appreciate your help.
Thanks for the fast test! (Sorry I took so long; have been on vacation.)
I'll make a release with this fix in the next few days.
