I found that the TensorNetwork.contract_compressed method works on a TensorNetwork with two Tensors but does not work on a TensorNetwork with more than two Tensors.
I expect the method to return a Tensor object.
The chi variable is None, which resulted in the error.
I'm using Quimb version 1.4.0.
If I set max_bond when calling the function, the error goes away. Is this the expected behavior? Is it possible that the user calls contract_compressed without setting max_bond, i.e. without intending to compress the tensor network?
Hi @snsunx, yes currently one needs to supply either max_bond or cutoff. Probably it would be useful for debugging purposes to support neither being supplied.
Cleaning up the interface and writing some docs is on my to-do list, but it is a tricky task, as this is quite an advanced function, where there is a trade-off between 'just working' with no settings, and explicitly forcing the user to engage in understanding the algorithm at some level and choosing the settings, since there is a large affect in terms of both complexity and accuracy.
I suppose I'm saying the interface is not quite finalized yet!
That answers my question. Thank you for the clarification!
