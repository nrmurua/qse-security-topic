Phaser init() underflows on RISC-V.
The JSON file below describes a simple system with some TTLs and a Phaser module on a Kasli v2.0 coredevice. Similar observations are valid for Kasli 1.1. When built against the latest master, Phaser init() underflows (in the artiq_sinara_tester and in very simple experiments doing a core reset, a seconds-long delay, and a phaser init).
@jordens Can you reproduce this? Could it be a case of "Vivado non-reproducibility" addressed e.g. at sinara-systems/52f15e1? (I tried to change the Phaser EEM port but it doesn't help).
@sbourdeauducq Can this be related to the RISC-V cores? or is this pure coincidence?
With variant.json:
artiq_sinara_tester executes properly.
artiq_sinara_tester fails with an RTIO underflow on the phaser channel:
@sbourdeauducq Can this be related to the RISC-V cores?
Yes, it can be related.
Thanks for the feedback. Do you expect difficulties fixing this? Any hints where this may come from?
Try increasing some of the delays?
@airwoodix Gateware issues like that Vivado non-reproducibility show up as spurious failures, not as a reproducible RTIOUnderflow. That regression feels like compiler/cpu architecture/cpu implementation area. I'd propose two things: (1) work around it for now by adding a bit more slack in phaser init or in the tester script (happy to accept PRs) and (2) identify/reduce what code pattern exhibits that regression. vexrisc and mor1kx are quite different, not least in their endianess.
Thanks!
