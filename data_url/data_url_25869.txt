Currently when the covalent servers have been started, running covalent purge will delete the corresponding server pid files without actually stopping the servers. This creates a discrepancy in the server status. Furthermore, we can do endless loops of covalent start and covalent purge and start more and more servers this way. The fix is to ensure that the server is stopped before the pid files are deleted.
Tests will be added later in issue #37
