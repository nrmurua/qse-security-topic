I've stopped pushing images to Dockerhub, because I lost track of our dependencies and was afraid to violate the GPL. We should track GPL compatibility as metadata in the toolchain. Then we could add a flag --gpl-compliant which limits the installation such that the resulting binaries can be freely shared.
I've looked up the license of all the packages that the toolchain currently installs. It seems the only package that is not GPL compatible is ParMETIS.
I'd propose that we treat ParMETIS just like our other non-gpl-compatible dependencies (MKL, ACML, Cuda) and leave it's installation up to the user. Basically, the policy should be that the toolchain only downloads and installs GPL compatible software.
Resolved via #859. Turns our we don't need ParMETIS because PT-Scotch can offer that functionality.
Now the toolchain only downloads and installs packages that are compatible with the GPL, and we should keep it that way. See also this new section in the toolchain's readme.
