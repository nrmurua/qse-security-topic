We have a custom parameter class whose value is always the current time, basically it just returns time.time() (similar to ElapsedTimeParameter). When trying to use this parameter in dond, we noticed the following strange behavior: if the parameter is called "current_time", the result of get_parameter_data will be just strings, which appears to be the completed timestamp of the measurement.
Run the following code:
The loaded data should be whatever the get() method of the parameter returned. In the above dummy example, it should print
The code prints
The values of the array are strings.
I have no idea where this is coming from. I tried to grep "current_time" in the qcodes codebase but couldn't find anything. The timestamp is always constant, if I add delay=2 to the ArrayParameter, the value is still the same for all three points, and it's the same as ds.completed_timestamp(). The data in the SQLite database is  actually correct, so this is maybe some getattr issue when loading the data?
operating system: Happens both on Windows and Ubuntu
qcodes commit: e66f001 (current master). Also happens at least with qcodes 0.35.
Aha, it's probably coming from SQLite, from what I can tell (see e.g. here), SELECT current_time FROM ... will return the current wall clock time as a string, instead of a column named current_time.
The SQLite documentation mentions that current_time is a keyword and needs to be quoted.
@mgunyho Thanks for reporting and finding the clue! This will be fixed in #5233.
