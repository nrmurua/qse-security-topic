We are currently getting frequent (a couple per day) random panics from a Kasli 2.0 while running experiments that have been running successfully for a few months. The UART output is as follows:
This is normally fixed by rebooting the kasli. It doesn't seem deterministic as it has been caused by different experiments, including very trivial ones, e.g. switching on an Urukul channel.
Did your gateware meet timing?
Yes, the timing passed
Is this still happening with ARTIQ-7?
Closing this as effectively non-reproducible on RISC-V (how would one know it's the same crash?).
Of course, please open a new issue for any panics still occurring (with the runtime.elf for the gateware attached, or the backtrace symbolized).
