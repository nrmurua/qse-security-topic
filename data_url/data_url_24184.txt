If I use an old conda env when running ./__compile_ui_to_py.shell , then the _ui.py files are generated from the .ui files as expected, with external imports and retranslations
However, if I make a new conda env by following the instructions in the READMe and then run ./__compile_ui_to_py.shell the generated _ui.py will be missing necessary imports (such as from .widgets.qlibrary_display.tree_view_qlibrary import TreeViewQLibrary) and will not have a retranslations
Create a new conda env and run  ./__compile_ui_to_py.shell
./__compile_ui_to_py.shell  should generated usable _ui.py files
Perhaps certain libraries we use have been upgraded without our knowledge
The conda env has been updated many times.  This can be closed.
