Describe the bug
qibo.set_device() does not have the expected behavior when used in the same script with qibo.set_backend().
To Reproduce
will print "/GPU:0" if executed in a machine with GPU enabled, as if the qibo.set_device instruction is ignored. If set_backend is not used then set_device works as intended.
I can reproduce this issue, and this sounds like the _CONSTRUCTED_BACKENDS and K are not in sync.
A simpler approach could be this: https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#id11
But probably will break many things, including user custom code.
Here some short version of the "singleton" approach we discussed today.
We place the following code in the __init__.py where my_backend_object is one of our backend inherited classes (e.g. TensorflowBackend):
Then we can import K as usual and get the right object. @stavros11 what do you think?
Thanks for the details on this. I actually just pushed an update in #370 which I think is very close to this idea, excluding the __new__ method which I think can be easily added. Please have a look and if you agree I can continue with this approach.
