Hi I am having the same error message, I edited the Device_db.py file to use the external clock on the AD9910 clk_sel =1, refclk= 10000000.0,

That's not the same error message and likely a user error, please use the forum https://forum.m-labs.hk
Please provide the full error message and your device_db file.
I am currently not able to start discussions on forum, I will get on fixing that soon. Meanwhile,
This is my edited device-dp.py file and full error message



Please see the AD9910 datasheet on how to configure the PLL.
Also please don't hijack issues. It's not helpful. Your problem is unrelated.
