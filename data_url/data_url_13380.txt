I tried to install the current development version of Mitiq as per Github, in a fresh and empty Miniconda environment with only Python 3.9.7 on Mac (Catalina 10.15.7)
typing
everything runs fine until there is an error seemingly related to immutables.
I may have recently changed something in the system so that the Developer tools of Xcode give an issue (I'm thinking that could be an issue given the string CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sd in the erro message at some point).
However Mitiq downloaded from pip installs correctly.
Can't reproduce. Probably an issue with your setup.
@rmlarose you're right. After updating OS to Big Sur and downloading again the command line tools for Xcode it works fine for me.
