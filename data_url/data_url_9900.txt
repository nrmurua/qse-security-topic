Description
Cannot add the constraint for integer variables via list of terms. Why doing this? Indeed this can be easily done via symbolic addition. Issue is that for large problems adding through list of terms is less expensive.
The issue is that the bounds of the variables are not matching between the quadratic model created for the constraint and for the objective. See below for the code.
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
The CQM should get a constraint i0 <= 8
Environment
Additional Context
To be clear, the error you're getting is ValueError: variable 'i0' has already been added with a different lower bound? Definitely need to fix that error, just double checking that there isn't another error ðŸ˜„
Yes, that's correct! Sorry forgot to add the error..
