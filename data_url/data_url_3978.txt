When the hardware config.json file contains an instruction that is not valid the following error is raised:
TypeError: [x] error : ql::eqasm_compiler::compile() : error while reading hardware settings : invalid 'cc_light_instr_type' for instruction !
This error makes it impossible to find out what the offending instruction is as it does not say which instruction is the problem or on which line the error occurs.
