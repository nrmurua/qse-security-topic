Hi, I am relatively new to programming and some of the conventions are not as clear to me.
I understand that
X qs
applies an X gate to the first qubit in the list, also that
X >< qs
applies an X to all the qubits in the list. I am unsure how to apply an X to only the second qubit, or to a specific selection of qubits (e.g. 3,5,8). What would be the best way to do this?
Thank you!
EDIT: I think I might have solved it- I did
X qs.[1..]
is this good practice?
Your solution is perfectly reasonable. Since what you want to do is create a list of qubits from another list, LIQUi|> provides a helper function !! (called: bangband) that extracts qubits in the way you asked. For example:
There are several variations described in the Operations.BangBang documentation (sorry, the help system won't let me call it !! directly). Here are all the variants listed there:
Also, if you look in the *.fsx files in the samples directory, you'll find all sorts of uses of !!.
Thanks for the reply! Really helpful
