When dispatching workflows that involve loops in Python 3.9, the workflows fail. Logs show an asyncio error.
The workflow should be dispatched successfully and show green in the dashboard. Logs should show no errors.
This appears to be limited to Python 3.9. The workflow successfully dispatches on Python 3.8.
On Linux (centos8), python=3.9, covalent version =0.110.2.post1 when running the posted example I get

I got it to work by modifying the append electron as follows
@santoshkumarradha is this acceptable ux?
This would cause a sequence of append operations to have O(n^2) complexity because each append() electron would make a deep copy of the list.
@venkatBala we need to figure out the cause of your error. Is append being invoked on NoneType because l wasn't computed correctly?
@scottwn do you still see the error with the line uvloop.install() commented out and after pip uninstall uvloop? This would switch asyncio from uvloop back to the built-in event loop implementation.

Nvmd: the problem is in Dask, not in core Covalent/Python
