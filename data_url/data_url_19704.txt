Generation of circuit seeds for two-qubit randomized benchmarking is not yielding the expected results.
I expect a list of lists with n_seeds x len(n_cliffs) number of elements. Instead, I am only getting a list of length n_seeds.
@ShellyGarion @taalexander may have some ideas. ignis/verification/randomized_benchmarking/circuits.py
I think that I understood the problem:
print (np.logspace(0,2.3,9).astype(int)
gives the output:
[  1   1   3   7  14  27  53 102 199]
So, length=1 appears twice!
If you will try providing explicitly:
n_cliffs = [1,  3,   7,  14,  27,  53, 102, 199]
then this should be OK.
Indeed:
outputs:
In the documentation it says:
(but the code does not check that you actually provide the lengths in ascending order)
Thanks @ShellyGarion ! Indeed that was my issue.
