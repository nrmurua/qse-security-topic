The circuit shown below  executed on ibmq_16_melbourne gives incorrect answer by a lot.
The requested circuit is:
Incorrect result is computed on ibmq_16_melbourne ,
'job_id': '5bb9958f4c87740053b27e2d',
{'counts': {'00': 3185, '01': 12, '10': 891, '11': 8},
'date': '2018-10-07T05:12:37.199Z',
The correct  most probable base is '10', as computed by the simulator:
'counts': {'10': 4096},
'date': '2018-10-07T05:12:02.309Z',
Run this code:
I'd hope the correct base is the winner for such small circuit. Now  ibmq_16_melbourne gives the wrong answer with probability 3:1 with marginal statistical error.
This is a performance of the device. I would suggest asking this in the slack in the ibmq provider channel. It is not an bug of qiskit. I hope someone there can help you.  I am surprised it is so bad
