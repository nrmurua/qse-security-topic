I was wondering if configuring a bot might be beneficial for some tasks. For example, checking that the code is well formatted with black. Examples are given by Sympy and Cirq (although there they use it for CLAs).

This could also be a fun project for a student (or coder in general) willing to contribute to QuTiP on the software side instead of the physics side.
Maybe though, any interesting feature of a bot can be put in place by a given specific API.
Yes, configuring a bot is beneficial for several tasks. However, the scope would be broad then. Narrowing down seems reasonable. What do you think about opening a new issue, mentioning several examples that can be worked on?
