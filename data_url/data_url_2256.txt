I guess we really care about this near identity, but still the protocol explicitly says "Underestimates are not permitted.", so we should fix it in case it's relied on in future.
Other exponents in [1.0029..2.9971] also fail the check.
In error I added a special case that doesn't apply to ISWAP gate. If the _trace_distance_bound_ method of the ISwapPowGate class is removed then the EigenGate version will be used instead which should return accurate results.
