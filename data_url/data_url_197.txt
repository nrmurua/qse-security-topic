If no explicit target is set, then CUDA Quantum makes a default choice for the simulator. The Next Steps section in the Getting Started guide mentions the default simulator. I suggest to add a section about what happens if no target is specified, and how to use the environment variable to define the default, to the Simulators page and link it from the Getting Started guide.
