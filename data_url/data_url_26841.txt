@hfp fyi
@dev-zero Thank you!
I have somewhere a statement like: performance is mostly derived with libraries (-O2 optimizations for CP2K's source code are sufficient in almost all cases), more important for performance are target-flags e.g., -march=native or -mavx2 -mfma.
since I already answered I extended my answer a bit more and added it here:

@hfp can you please give a quick look?
Sounds good and helpful.
Just for our note, -march=native works with Intel Compiler as well.
Intel compiler only enables support for SSE2 by default
That's basically what you get with GCC also. Note that the SSE2 definition is part of x86's 64-bit ABI (no matter if it's called x86-64 or AMD64).
Sounds good and helpful.
Thanks :)

... but only on Linux, which is why I opted to use -xHost instead, where there is a corresponding /QxHost

Good to know, thanks! Added another entry for GNU Compilers.
