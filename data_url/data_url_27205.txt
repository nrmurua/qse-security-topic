Hello Sir,
Not sure it is the right question to ask on this forum. I am not able to understand the depth value in the paper. The formula for finding the volumetric background is as below:


If I put d = 8 and w=12, the formula is not satisfied.
I think, I am not understanding the depth concept. It would be great if you explain the depth concept?
