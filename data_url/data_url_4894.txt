Hi,
I'd like to checkpoint a statevec/DM in QuEST in a single node configuration. (I think MPI isn't implemented yet?)
Is saving the qReg to disk and then later reading it back and using setAmps the way to do it?
Thanks!
Hi there,
Yep, you could use reportState() to save even an MPI-distributed state-vector to (shared) disk, then later process the files yourself and re-initialise the state using setAmps().
It would be a lot nicer to have a seamless checkpointing function in QuESTlink; we'll consider adding this in the next version!
Thanks,
Tyson
