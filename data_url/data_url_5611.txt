Some circuit types, regardless of their size return the following error:
When executed with the the extended_stabilizer simulator option.
This suggests that this error is not actually being thrown because of the size of the circuit, since these circuits can be simulated very easily on for example the qasm_simulator.
ex.txt is a circuit with 5 qubits which throws this error.
Note that issue #1921 also mentions this error; this error occurs for circuits without classical control instructions. This qasm file gives an example circuit (with 36 active qubits) where this happens: example.txt
I think this should be fixed by PR 1933 and option commented in issue #1921
