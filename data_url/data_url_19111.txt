In addition to value_below, there should also be a value_above in krotov.convergence. The documentation should make it clear that evaluating functionals (errors or fidelities) and deciding convergence based on the calculated values is not inherent to the optimization, but entirely up to whatever convention the user chooses via the info_hook the pass.
Also: de-emphasize the use of glom (too technical).
