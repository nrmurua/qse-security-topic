When debugging qvm:measure, I find that qvm yields the incorrect result.
Here are the source code of qvm:measure:
The following is the flowchart drawn according to the above code snippet.

According to the above flowchart, if we set excited-probablity = 0.0d0  and r=0.0d0, the value of cbit is 1, while in fact the correct value of cbit is 0 because the probability of |1> is 0.0d0.
This exception can be triggered as the following steps:
Step 1ï¼šReplace the statement (let* ((r (random 1.0d0)) on line 7 with the statement (let* ((r (random 1)) to ensure the value of r to be 0;
Step 2: Run the following test case:
Note that gate I is used to make sure the value of excited-probability to be 0.0d0.
We think it is likely to be a logical problem of qvm.
