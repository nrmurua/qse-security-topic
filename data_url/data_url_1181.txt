Description of the issue
Sphinx version update caused a CI error with the build_docs.sh job. This job is no longer used since we instead use the quantumai website. Remove this job and it's dependencies (i.e Sphinx)
Cirq version
1.4.0.dev20231221183905
https://cirq.readthedocs.io/ is no longer used and can be removed. It redirects to the quantumai website.

This should be presumably doable at https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/Cirq/edit.
@dstrain115 or someone else who has admin access to Cirq RTD - can you please take a look?
