To replicate:
(Using clang / Mac Catalina)
run scripts/build-android.sh /Users/ryandeschamps/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/21.3.6528147/ -a arm64-v8a  -b build-arm64-v8a
Results in:

Changing the return type of USING_TIME_RATHER_THAN_CYCLES to uint64_t resolves the build.
PR Upcoming!
Also possible that _bench_init_perfcounters values should be unsigned for consistency.
