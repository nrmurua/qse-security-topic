Google is not happy with our idea lists.
If you want to be selected this year I strongly suggest you make sure your Project Ideas list meets the above requirements ASAP.
@henrykironde Eep. Thank you for wrangling all the projects.
Our ideas list already lists sizes for all project ideas, so 1 & 2 are covered. I am double checking 3 now. I'll check update the numfocus issue and close this one once I'm done.
All done!
