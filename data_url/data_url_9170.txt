Functions to switch the ordering of the vector of means and covariance matrix from xxpp to xpxp should be provided in the quantum.conversions module. These functions should operate by permuting the elements of the array using fancy indexing and not by multiplying by permutation matrices.
using fancy indexing and not by multiplying by permutation matrices.
depending how many times the changebasis function was called, this might actually cause a huge saving!
