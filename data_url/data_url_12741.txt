I am not able to see additional output when tests in RandomGenerationTutorial fail. I am testing this in Visual Studio 2019.
I think that is because ResetOracleCallsCount() function is defined in CounterSimulator and is used by CheckFlatDistribution(), CheckFlatDistributionRange() and CheckXPercentZero()
Because tests pass majority of the time after switching to CounterSimulator from QuantumSimulator because sometimes numbers aren't very random :D . Please refer to #557.
On digging utilities/Common/CounterSimulator.cs I found this line :
public class ResetOracleCallsImpl : ResetOracleCallsCount at Line 84
and in utilities/Common/Utils.qs
operation ResetOracleCallsCount () : Unit { body intrinsic; } at line 21
The file Tests.qs should definitely use @Test("Microsoft.Quantum.Katas.CounterSimulator") instead of @Test("QuantumSimulator") - otherwise the tests will fail when running from VS or VS Code because of undefined operation, as you correctly pointed out. Nice catch!
However, when this tutorial is executed as a Jupyter Notebook (which is the main use case scenario, as it is a tutorial, not a kata), the %kata magic runs all tests on CounterSimulator (see #580). (This is also why the tests can pass that way regardless of incorrect setting in the VS project.) so the switch from QuantumSimulator to CounterSimulator should have no impact on randomness of tests executed via Jupyter Notebook...
I was thinking of doing this in PR related to #557 since it's a small change. Or do you want me to raise a separate PR for easy review?
Yes, combining these two changes in one PR will be fine.
