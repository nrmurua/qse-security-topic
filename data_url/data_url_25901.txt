The directories covalent/executor/executor_plugins and covalent_dispatcher/_service are not being properly included.  This is because neither has an __init__.py file inside, so they are "data" directories.  From my understanding, the MANIFEST.in as well as package_data_dirs in setup.py will control what's included.
Run pip install cova and examine what's installed into the site-packages directory.  Also look at the tarball hosted on PyPI.
Those directories should be included.
