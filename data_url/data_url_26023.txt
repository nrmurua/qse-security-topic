To make the SDK more light weight we should separate out core dependencies. E.g. if someone wants to use the SDK just to transpile circuits between two packages, they shouldn't have to install all of the other packages that they will never use.
Core dependencies right now are
and optional dependencies would be
For house keeping, we would need to make updates to the install_requires, extras_require, requirements.txt and tox setup.
For code, we will need to make sure that each module of the SDK can be imported and work properly without all packages installed at once. This will likely mean lazy imports, or other approaches. Can take inspiration from mitiq
