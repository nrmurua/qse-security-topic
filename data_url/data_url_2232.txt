This should be fixed now, see contrib/quantum_volume. Can someone with permissions close it, please?
Note to anyone: Remove that TODO line when possible.
Thanks! That TODO should be gone: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/contrib/quantum_volume/quantum_volume.py and https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/examples/advanced/quantum_volume.py
