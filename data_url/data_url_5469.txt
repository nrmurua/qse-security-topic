As noted in #141, there's still at least one place where we hard-code the maximum tensor rank (in that case, 7). We should use the results from ordering_data_to_contraction_ordering to use the real max rank instead.
See #115 - this scratch space is used exclusively during grid creation, so its size is limited by the rank of the largest single-qubit tensor. However, we may need to update this if and when we move away from a square grid assumption - e.g., hexagonal grids would require pow(super_dim, 6) * 2 space.
Issue #162 presents a more complete solution to this problem.
