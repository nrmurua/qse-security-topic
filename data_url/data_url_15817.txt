Provide an implementation of Shor's algorithm for the discrete logarithm problem similar to the implementation of Shor's algorithm for prime factorization in qiskit/algorithms/factorizers/shor.py.
I have already implemented the Algorithm based on: https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9903071
(see https://github.com/mhinkie/ShorDiscreteLog for the code)
There still are some details to discuss before implementation can begin:
@Cryoris Hi, I hope I found the right username in Github. I wrote on Slack yesterday about implementing an algorithm for the DLP and I've created this issue to discuss the details.
