Description of the issue
Circuits with symbols are determined to be unequal by cirq.approx_eq when they should be approximately equal.
How to reproduce the issue
First output is True, second output is False
Cirq version
0.8.2
Thank you for filing this @zaqqwerty - this should work. Either approx_eq should throw an error if the arguments are parametrized that it's not supported or support it properly. This behavior is a silent failure. Marked it as a bug.
It also seems like a self contained issue, perfect for contributors to pick up!
Is help still needed on this? I am looking for a good first issue.
Thanks for offering to help!  Of the options Balint listed, most helpful would be to figure out how to make:
output True.
It's all yours @tonybruguier-google - thanks for volunteering!

Note that I changed the test case. It seems that it compares 5e-3*s/pi which can be big if s is large. Happy to change the PR, of course.
