The following Quil program from tests/good-test-files/good-defgate-with-param.quil fails to print.

The failure occurs in print-instruction-generic when attempting to print the matrix-gate-definition, which expects all gate-definition-entries to be of type number or list, and chokes on the bare #:|alpha| symbol.
Another example that fails similarly can be found in tests/good-test-files/good-general-defgate.quil:
