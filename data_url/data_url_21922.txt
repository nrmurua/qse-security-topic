Calling core.reset() resets the direction of all InOut TTLs to inputs - previously the phy state has been untouched by core.reset().
Observed using a Kasli and Artiq 1553fc8
To be clear, those are SERDES TTLs? Or simple TTLs?
@jordens I observe this on SERDES TTLs, I have not tried this on simple TTLs
