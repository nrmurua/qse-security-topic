TF optimizer module has a breaking change and even the basic API is changed (opt.apply_gradients gone). irresponsible and chaotic, but it is typical tensorflow ~~
Possible bug for tc.backend.optimizer and negative effect on many example scripts and tutorials, to be validate when available, contribution welcome. The possible fix should be compatible with both older and newer version of tensorflow and contribution is welcome
tf >= 2.11
tf2.11 optimizer doesn't support deepcopy.... for users please use legacy optimizer instead
fixed
