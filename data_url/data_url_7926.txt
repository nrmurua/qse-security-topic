At present the only known working option that works with the runtime compile features (e.g. string type time-dependence) requires Visual Studio 2015 with C++ options. The community edition is fine, which has no monetary cost, but it does come with a considerable install time and disk space (11GB) cost.
According to the Python wiki on Windows compilers These build tools are supposed to work, but so far I did not succeed. Not tried in a while, as I don't have very easy access to a Windows machine I can play with. So if someone else wants to give a try, then that would be just great.
This issue would ideally be closed after a merging of a PR updating the installation instructions in https://github.com/qutip/qutip-doc
This builds fine except for the cqobjevo_omp module that uses unsigned variables for the openmp for loop which is not allowed on windows. It will work fine after that is fixed
I believe the answer is somewhere in here:

If someone (Windows user) could try this out and summarise, that would be just great.
