get processor and list calibrations are done.  But all in first batch are not currently supported.
List programs, List jobs under a program, list all active or running jobs are done.
--- these are the only ones missing now:
Cancel all jobs under a program - we could implement this by the cancel_job() one by one
Cancel all jobs - in a project? we could also implement this by running cancel_job() one by one
@wcourtney is there a plan for "cancel call for multiple job_ids" in the service?
Pinging @wcourtney - is this still necessary? Or close if it's done.
We don't have any plans for bulk cancellation in the API. We could provide a "kill switch" helper for this if we think it's common - list jobs filtered by state (RUNNING or READY) and cancel each. I expect that the issue with doing this today is that we use a blocking API interface, but we're looking into migrating to an asyncio format that should make this more bearable.
The semantics of "cancelling a program" are strange and I think it would be a low priority until at least one user other than Dave thinks about "programs" :-).
Closing as Won't Fix - let's rely on asyncio support. Feel free to re-open if you this is a higher priority than I suspect.
