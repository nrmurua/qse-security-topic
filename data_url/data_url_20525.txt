On AmazonLinux2, running sudo make install results in
@crockeea
That is just a warning, right?
This should not happen anyway, because these two options are skipped by default when reading the config file.
@crockeea
Can you provide me with the result of this, please:
$cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Thanks.
@himsen Not clear what the severity is. Those are the last two lines of output from sudo make install, so it's not reporting any sort of failure. Here's my sshd_config file:
Note that sudo make install detects that sshd_config is already present, so it does not overwrite it. I think that means the config file pasted above is the default one shipped with AL2 (PAM is enabled by default).
@crockeea There is no severity. The reason you get warnings, as you also say, is that the build is checking the AL2 sshd_config, and this build is not configured to support any GSS authentication methods (i.e. unsupported).
I have an idea why it is picking up the AL2 sshd_config, but I would need to know the exact commands you used when building, to confirm. Could you add them here, please? The likely reason is that you haven't supplied the sysconfdir flag (and value) when configuring. The build will then install in the standard system directory, where there already is a config file. I believe it is not possible to over-write this specific behaviour.
@himsen
@crockeea Thanks. You can choose another directory (e.g.  /usr/local/etc/ssh) for the config files by passing that directory to the sysconfdir option.
No further discussion needed, closing ticket.
