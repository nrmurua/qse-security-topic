I will characterize the problem as this:
If the last line of a QASM file is a comment line that is not followed by a new line/line feed, the staq will hang. See the attached file weird.zip, which looks like this:
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
//
Now, run this and it will never end.
./staq weird.qasm
Thanks for pointing this out. It looks to be a bug in the parser. I can't test it at the moment, but I'll push a fix in the next day or two.
Fixed, closing this now.
