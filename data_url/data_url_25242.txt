I have run "python3 covalent start" und when I open another terminal to run "python3 covalent status" it says: "Covalent server is running at http://localhost:48008.".
However, when i open this link it says unable to connect (Firefox).
use ubuntu on a virtual machine (Virtualbox)
run "python3 covalent start"
I should be able to open the website
I have also tried 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost
I did not activate the python env
