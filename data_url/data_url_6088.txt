As suggested by @chriseclectic , qubit_list should be renamed to something more general/abstract, such as subsystemlist or qargs, the latter of whcih is used in QuantumCircuit and Operator classes for specifying subsystems.
This requires some thought though in terms of what the right way to do this right now with what is currently supported.
This is minor but will affect several existing PRs now, so I will leave this until those are resolved.
Is this issue resolve @DanPuzzuoli ?
Ah I had forgotten about this. I'll do this now.
