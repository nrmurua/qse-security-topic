Any example code that uses TFQ and demos qGANs?
@YZNIU
@zohimchandani Sorry, I confused with QCNN. We don't have QGAN example yet.
Do you think this would be manageable for a newbie? If so, I would be happy to take it on. Also, is there any good reading you would recommend to get up to speed with QGAN?
@oliverob Thank you for your interest. Here is TF-GAN lightweight library for implementing GAN in TF and there are several materials about QGAN : Lloyd et al., Zoufal et al., Hu et al.
I have made a first stab at my example, but I can't get the network to actually work. I have linked it in the pull request - if anyone could give me any pointers that would be much appreciated!
Thank you @oliverob  for your contribution! Please let me look at it for the next week. üëç
@oliverob I cant see the code, could you please link the github page
@zohimchandani #339
We do have a qgan tutorial featured now in /research branch.
