For the autodiff capabilities, we are still exploring as to what is the ideal way to write wrappers for existing autodiff libraries. Currently, we are starting off to write wrappers for JAX's grad function to be compatible with Qobj. At the moment, however, Qobj does not work well with JAX's numpy array. Something like
returns an empty Qobj. @quantshah recommends two ways to go about it:
In either case, we will have to decide what is the best way to make the Hamiltonians grad-compatible because JAX's grad only supports pure Python functions that return a scalar value, and we will primarily be working with matrices.
I have summarized the issue in this wiki
