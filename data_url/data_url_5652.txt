Running parametrized circuits using Sampler or Estimator with noise model fails. Although it works when the noise model is built using certain fakebackends like FakeCambridge.
The following code works when backend2 is passed to the noise model but fails with backend1.
Same for Estimator as well.
It should work consistently regardless of what fakebackend is used for noise model.
Thank you for your reporting. This is from the same reason of #1795.
Your parameterized circuit is transpiled with basis gates of noise. The transpiled circuit is as follows:
Its global phase includes parameter expressions, which are not correctly handled by the current implementation as reported #1795.
