Currently I see the following in the dashboard logs for daint-gpu:
It would be really useful to have the dashboard showing a correct/up-to-date arch file as not everyone has rebased their branch to latest master and can use arch/CRAY-XC50_gnu.psmp, hence relying on those dashboard logs to obtain an arch-file to build their own versions of CP2K on daint and using the module commands noted in there. But as of May 2021 those commands are not working anymore as shown and are obviously not used to load the environment.
I try to keep the arch file CRAY-XC50_gnu.psmp up-to-date with the current module settings at CSCS for building my own CP2K binaries from the CP2K trunk on Piz Daint. It seems that the CRAY_XC50-gfortran_gpu.psmp regression tester employs a kind of tailored (legacy?) arch file.
@alazzaro would it be possible to use also the arch file CRAY-XC50_gnu.psmp for the CRAY_XC50-gfortran_gpu.psmp regression tester?
@mkrack thanks a lot for that work, unfortunately:
Btw, to make it easier for maintenance and usage, it is possible to make the arch-file sourceable (by bash):
https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/95ce09f698a59dd5f5deeb752a41a99f49e04193/arch/Eiger-gfortran.psmp
With that one the user can do:
@dev-zero I have updated the access rights. There is a sourecable script to set the proper module environment. I prefer that two-step procedure instead of a sourceable arch file. Please, could you try
The workflow for daint-mc is similar
@mkrack thanks a lot, seems to work!
Wrt sourceable arch file: I still kept it as a two-step procedure (e.g. the user still has to run make -j ... after sourcing it), only difference is that they source the arch file so everything is in one place. No worries, I will not touch your arch files ;-)
This issue seems to be resolve, especially since we now have two new tests for Daint:
