I'm seeing the following rcpq error when attempting to run pyquil's test_quil_to_native_quil (and others).
At first I was worried the failure was related to my recent rpcq PR, but it reproduces on my linux laptop as well, which doesn't have those changes.
Steps to reproduce:
Here is the pytest error:
The error appears to be coming from CL-QUIL:LOAD-SPECS-LAYER which is choking on a call to (GETHASH ... SPEC) where SPEC is NIL.
