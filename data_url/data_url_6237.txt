Qiskit Aer: 0.1.1
Python 3.6
Ubuntu 18.04
When the qasm_simulator executable has an error it returns a 0 exit code, which traditionally means success.
Download and unzip the following test file (or any other file that causes a failure) -
fail.json.gz
run: ./qasm_simulator fail.json
echo $?
The return code will be 0, even though you'll get "success": false, and "status": "ERROR: ..."
exit code that is not 0
At the moment I believe the standalone simulator only returns the exit code 1 if it crashes and does not return any result output (typically because the cmd arguments or input file was invalid).
If it returns a valid result output json (according to schema spec) it is returning exit code 0, even if that output has "success": false. The cases with success: false could be changed to a different exit code though, maybe 2?
exit with 2 would be fine. Any non zero return code is good to know that there was a failure. Otherwise right now we're filtering output which is pretty error prone.
Thanks!
What's the expected behavior if we run a list of experiments, but only one or some of them fail? Are we losing the ones that have sucessfully run? Shall we return something different than 0?
We could do
