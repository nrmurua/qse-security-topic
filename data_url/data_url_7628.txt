Interlin-q and QuNetSim are two separate projects. This bug is only related to Interlin-q so I removed your comment from the QuNetSim issue you reference.
I'll look into this issue and will provide feedback.
yes, it starts to run but the thread stops it from running.
still no solution?
No not yet, I didn't get a chance to look into this. Probably it will take some weeks before I can investigate this given the ongoing Unitary Hack and work schedule.
I'm not sure what you mean exactly... Is this issue for the Interlin-q project or the QuNetSim project? They are two completely separate projects, so I'm not sure if you're trying to do QKD in Interlin-q or QuNetSim.
Do any of these work for you? https://github.com/tqsd/QuNetSim/tree/master/examples/QKD
I think though in general it would make a lot more sense to work on quantum networking protocols in QuNetSim. Interlin-q is not designed to be used for QKD but QuNetSim is exactly designed for it. I'll close this issue since it seems it's related to QuNetSim only.
