Right now, quilc will make its best guess for a good rewiring, even when the identity mapping requires no swaps at all. This can sometimes cause unnecessary swaps.
@ecpeterson do you have an example of when this happens?
Yes: have a look at benchmarking/quil-available/0020q-0000143-3f7b88e4-sampling_quinoa.quil on Acorn (a/k/a (build-skew-rectangular-chip 0 4 5)). If you run it with PRAGMA INITIAL_REWIRING "NAIVE" prefixed, it'll compile with no SWAPs. If you run it with the supposedly more intelligent PRAGMA INITIAL_REWIRING "PARTIAL", it'll compile with plenty of SWAPs.
I'm not sure how to solve this. My initial thought was to test that the adjacent qubits to each used logical qubit were in the set of used logical qubits: if yes, use the identity rewiring. But that's not quite right.
Hints @ecpeterson?
There's more than one way to skin this cat, but I was imagining a check in prog-initial-rewiring along the following lines:
There might be some fuss in that disjunction about dead qubits.
I think this is closed by #380.
