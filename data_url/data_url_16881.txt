For crz and cry it is not possible to use the simplified syntax in which qubits are passed by index. For example
Instead, the more old-fashioned notation must be used
See this notebook
For crz this should work. Looking at the notebook, the error is raised by the call to cry and not crz.
As for cry: this gate is currently still part of Aqua (it will be moved to Terra) and this issue was fixed by a recent PR. If you update Aqua, the cry should also work with indices.
Thanks. I'll close, then.
