Every qubit wire is given a list stores the gates operated on it in order. It will help DAGCircuit manipulation.
@maddy-tod can you take a crack at this one? I agree that it would be nice to have an iterator to all the nodes for a given wire (qubit or clbit), as sort of a schedule of things that happen on that qubit/clbit.
