Before raising this issue, I have already checked that I am:
Upon creating an instance of the NumberPartition problem with a 0 entry in the list, the problem is created with redundant qubit and terms. These terms then manifest as extra cost gates with angle=0.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
The problem class should catch 0 in the list and raise a warning while removing the zero from the list, and create a problem with the remaining qubits.
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
Add any other context about the problem here.
