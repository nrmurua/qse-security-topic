Since the PR merge of Ben's (@bcriger) code for Efficient Application of CPTP Maps to Subsystems, there has been a number of failing unit tests. I have fixed some of the tests and ported Ben's code to be python3 compatible, but there are still two remaining errors, which I have traced to the fact that subsystem_apply(..., reference=True) does not give the expected results (some normalization problem? perhaps with the eigenvectors?)
Probably @bcriger would be the best person to fix this issue.
These tests are now skipped with the skipif decorator, but should be looked at again before next release.
Hi all,
First off, sorry for the tardy reply.
Second, I think the problem is actually the permutation used in super_to_choi. I've changed the permutation, and pushed to my clone of QuTiP. I'm creating a pull request now.
Cheers,
Ben
