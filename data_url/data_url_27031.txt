After the most recent merge, the OPTIMIZE keyword is not properly read. The following fails:
But this one doesn't fail.
@Altaimorin The only difference between the two OPTIMIZE keywords is that the latter have =5  Please fix this ASAP. QUICK must be able to read OPTIMIZE keyword without user specified maximum number of optimization cycles.
Good catch - this needs to be fixed asap. Perhaps the best would be to have an additional optional argument to the parser functions that defaults to .true. and can be used as
and then only throw an error if an equal sign is found after the keyword but reading a value fails.
This will require more advanced parsing, because then you need to know how to inform a user that he should not use a space after OPTIMIZE, e.g. "optimize =25".
Instead of requiring that no space is used, it might be better to actually allow blanks (including space and tab characters) and you just scan for the next non-blank character. If it is an equal sign, then you have an assignment, and you scan again to find the value field which must terminate with a blank space.
