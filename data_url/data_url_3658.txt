I modified run_quil.py so that it could run quil code on the QPU: https://github.com/vtomole/qchackers/blob/master/software/pyquil/run_quil_qpu.py
Output:

pyquil.api.errors.QPUError: COMPILATION ERROR: WARNING:
Couldn't re-execute SBCL with proper personality flags (/proc isn't mounted? setuid?)
Trying to continue anyway.
! ! ! Error: There is no applicable method for the generic function

when called with arguments
(#<CL-QUIL:MEASURE {1004791653}>).
The QPU returned the above error. This could be due to a bug in the server or a
bug in your code. If you suspect this to be a bug in pyQuil or Rigetti Forest,
then please describe the problem in a GitHub issue at:
https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyquil/issues

This error message is really awful, but I think the problem is that you have measure instructions in your program. Calling run_and_measure does a measurement at the end only and adding your own measure instructions is not supported.
