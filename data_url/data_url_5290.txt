Even though g++ is installed and updated, cmake cannot recognise it as a legitimate gnu compiler and I am getting the error message saying that my compiler environment is unsupported
Hi @shreyasdhole ,
I have never compiled it on mac OS, but I have a few colleagues and collaborators who successfully did.
I will ask them to help you with the issue, if you were not able to solve it by now.
Sorry for the late reply!

@shreyasdhole Have you tried with flags -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<PATH_TO_G++> -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<PATH_TO_GCC>?
I'm compiling it correctly in macOS Catalina.
I assume that the compilation issue has been solved and will close the issue.
