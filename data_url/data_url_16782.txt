If a user forgets the () for their gate, they'll see the following error message:
because instruction will be an Instruction subclass, and not an instance. (broadcast_arguments will be called as a static method on the class, instead of an instance method so self will be missing. Thus the TypeError for missing cargs)
In QuantumCircuit.append, we already check if not isinstance(instruction, Instruction) before checking hasattr(instruction, 'to_instruction').
This should be restructured so that if instruction is not an Instruction instance, and does not have a to_instruction, we raise. (Optionally, we can check if issubclass(instruction, Instruction) and if so, suggest adding ()).
@1ucian0 could I try and implement this one? I am new to Qiskit, and this looks like a good first issue!
Go for it! Let me know if you need any assistance!
