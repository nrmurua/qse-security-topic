When trying to perform the installation of Simulaqron I received the following errors:
Collecting qutip Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/02/fa/c815ed3f060ed96a56843dfdd1b9b68dd4d9924f7e255845c71d9f62d7d1/qutip-4.3.1.tar.gz (5.5MB) 100% |████████████████████████████████| 5.5MB 269kB/s  Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info: Traceback (most recent call last): File "<string>", line 1, in <module> File "/tmp/pip-build-mghqg70i/qutip/setup.py", line 54, in <module> from Cython.Build import cythonize ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Cython'
I remedied this by pip install cython, after which I received a different error from installing qutip:

Which I resolved by pip install scipy.  I believe that the cython and scipy packages need to be added to the installation section to allow for successful setup of the dependencies.
