cmd_def was updated to include fcs in u-channels related to the drive channels for phase synchronization with target qubit. when u-channel drive followed by primitive (u1, u2, u3) drives is added, schedule adds unwanted time shift due to channel overlap on the u-channels.
In the above example, start time of hgate is 600.
this behavior is very much tricky.
+300 time shift is added in the above example.
Closing as this is the correct desired behaviour. Users should use union instead of append in this situation.
