Description of the issue
Calling EngineProcessor.list_calibrations gives an error.
How to reproduce the issue
Output:
Cirq version
0.9.0.dev
I reproduced this - it is pretty serious, so we should fix this as soon as we can.
Based on internal discussions we need to prepare that sometimes the id comes in q<int>_<int> format.
