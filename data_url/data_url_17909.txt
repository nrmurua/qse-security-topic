Using circuit_drawer on a circuit with a barrier fails:
giving the following log report:
You need to update your version of the qcircuit latex package to the latest version, 2.6.0 (which added the \barrier command). You can find the latest version on CTAN: https://ctan.org/pkg/qcircuit if the version of texlive packaged on osx doesn't include that version yet.
Hopefully this is documented somewhere.
Yes, this is fixed when updating to 2.6.0.  However, this was only released a little over a month ago.  Therefore we really need to document this requirement somewhere because most peoples TeX installation will need to be updated.
Sure, I'll gladly update the documentation to outline the new requirement. Do you have any pointers to the best place to do that?
