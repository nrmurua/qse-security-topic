Some codes in the optimization stack still use legacy operator, for example, WeightedPauliOperator is used by QuadraticProgramToIsing. Shall we replace them with opflow?

Apart from optimization/applications, this is addressed in #1059.
Thanks. I missed the change. look into it.
The pr solves this issue. So, I close it. Thanks.
