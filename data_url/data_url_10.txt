The tests are currently disabled (FIXME linking to this issue at the bottom of assets.Dockerfile) and should be re-enabled.
Unfortunately, the test only seems to fail in the pipeline - running it locally works fine for me, which is even more odd given that this is all inside a Docker image and hence should be pretty reproducible.
