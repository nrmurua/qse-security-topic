load_interactive_backend(self) should create a self.display for non-inline/non-interactive mpl backends (such as Qt5Agg).
Hi!
Qt5Agg is not a non-interactive backend, but that is a plus. It seems that the code for interactive plotting using the Tkinter backend is compatible with Qt5Agg, since we used matplotlib tools instead of native Tkinter. I've setup a new branch that targets Qt5Agg support. Please test it and report for any errors, since currently there are no tests setup for the plotting gui's.
Best, Mark
