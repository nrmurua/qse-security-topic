The following matrix cannot be decomposed even though it is unitary.
In fact running np.linalg.norm(U.getH()*U - np.eye(2)) returns 5.462198399343198e-16.
Reducing TOLERANCE in  arb1qubit2rzandry.py from 1e-12 to 1e-10 removes the exception, so I assume this is caused by cancellation effects, similar to what happens when solving the quadratic equation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_significance#Instability_of_the_quadratic_equation
Thanks for pointing this out! I will try to make the current implementation more robust as soon as I find time.
