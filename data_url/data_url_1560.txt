Description of the issue
Isolated notebook test fails on operators_and_observables.ipynb after upgrading notebook to 6.4.1 (due to security vulnerability).
How to reproduce the issue
Could not reproduce locally, but CI failed on #4468 with the following complaint:
Cirq version
0.13.0.dev
This looks like it was caused by #4009. I removed the nest-asyncio import because it's no longer needed by duet, but if the notebook is running with an older version of cirq before that change, e.g. the last release version, then we still need to install nest-asyncio. I will put up a PR to fix.
