In order to check the stability of the emulator, it could be useful to be able to input a random initial state with a simple caracterisation (say a product state were each atom is in , with r_0 an input from the user)
Hi  ! I think it's already possible to provide an initial_state in the run method. By the way, I feel it would be good to clarify (in the docstring?) that this feature is only possible for emulation's purposes.
