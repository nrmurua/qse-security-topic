Aliases add complexity and bugs. Does anyone use them anyway?
The CI system uses them but could do without.
Note: Replacing them with multiple copies of the same description should not be done because:
They are used quite a bit. What complexity and bugs are you referring to?
@sbourdeauducq we also find aliases handy, and use them quite a lot.
I agree with @cjbe -- we use aliases within the device database to abstract physical channels (ex: digital channel 3) with their functional names (ex: line trigger input), while maintaining the ability to use either.
What complexity and bugs are you referring to?
Nothing unfixable, but generally the alias special-case is something that is easily forgotten during development and poorly tested. If it weren't used, it would have been better to just scrap that feature.
ACK. Let's file a new issue for those.
