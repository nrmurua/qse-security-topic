I noticed this "fork behavior" at least 3 times.
From the log provided by @FL-Riko, it is clear that he had an internet issue for more than 2 minutes.

As these 2 logs line shows, that after 16:46:39, he received next data at 16:48:47. This must be because of some internet issue, due to which some blocks were missed resulting into fork. 
I will add some codes to handle such issues.
This is the final piece of the POS protocol to be completed with the latest POS algorithm update.
Solid reliable fork recovery and chain block buffer reorganisation is critical to a stable release.
A fix is coming soon.
After looking into log provided by @randomusergenerator . I found that same problem happen with his Raspberry PI. Further investigating into logs, I found its taking around 2 minutes, to create the ST TXN, which freezes the node for 2 minutes.
Reason, during ST txn, slave XMSS is being created with tree height 10, which must be taking around 2 minutes.
I released a new qrllib with a feature that may help here. We will be integrating this into QRL today/tomorrow.
created new node with codebase based on 5.10.2017 19:05
forked again shortly after synced status reached
PR #337 is likely to fix this problem. We will keep the issue open a few more days until this can be confirmed
Forking due to slow tree generation has been fixed and integrated. Other fork related issues should be opened as new issues. Closing this one.
