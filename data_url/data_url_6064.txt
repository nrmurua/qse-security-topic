Compilation failure occurs on (only?) Power + RedHat environment because of Numpy's function "PyDataMem_NEW_ZEROED", maybe it is not implemented on this environment.
The error message is as follow (same 7 errors occur while compiling OpenPulse)
/gpfs/wscgpfs01/doichan/Q/test/qiskit-aer/_skbuild/linux-ppc64le-3.7/cmake-build/qiskit/providers/aer/pulse/qutip_lite/cy/spmath.cxx:3677:52: error: ‘PyDataMem_NEW_ZEROED’ was not declared in this scope __pyx_v_mat->data = ((__pyx_t_double_complex *)PyDataMem_NEW_ZEROED(__pyx_v_nnz, (sizeof(__pyx_t_double_complex)))); ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ /gpfs/wscgpfs01/doichan/Q/test/qiskit-aer/_skbuild/linux-ppc64le-3.7/cmake-build/qiskit/providers/aer/pulse/qutip_lite/cy/spmath.cxx:3677:52: note: suggested alternative: ‘PyDataMem_NEW’ __pyx_v_mat->data = ((__pyx_t_double_complex *)PyDataMem_NEW_ZEROED(__pyx_v_nnz, (sizeof(__pyx_t_double_complex)))); ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ PyDataMem_NEW 
Could you please replace PyDataMem_NEW_ZEROED to PyDataMem_NEW that maybe supported on the Power + RedHat environment.
I googled PyDataMem_NEW_ZEROED, but it seems very few people uses this function, so I think using PyDataMem_NEW is a common way.
One has to be a bit careful as some routines might be expecting a zeroed memory.
