The master branch CI failed upon merging #1028, which updated scipy from 1.7.2 to 1.7.3. Since Windows CI are tested only on master, no issue arose on the PR. The issue is with Python 3.8 on Windows.
The failing test is test_inference for the mitiq.zne.inference.LinearFactory. Somehow the error seems to arise during plotting
for test_plot_fit(factory), and arises due to an incorrect installation of tkinter.
I wonder if for the time being, we should just revert the merge.

============================== warnings summary ===============================
Reverted in #1033
This has popped up before, I don't think it's caused by scipy. In the future you can rerun the action to check.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
