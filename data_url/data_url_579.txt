Hi,
How do we pass a large number of arguments (if possible, dynamically variable) to a XASM function ? On a related note, is it possible to clear the compiled database of xasm functions so that xasm functions with same name can be repeatedly generated (in a dynamic and automated way) with different parameters ?
Thanks

You can treat a single incoming parameter as a vector:
does that help?
As for clearing the compiled functions, not right now. But I can add one and you can pull and rebuild.
