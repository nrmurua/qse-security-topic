I was trying to work with density matrices and realised that the fidelity function uses matrix square root from scipy sqrtm which is not jax compatible. Jax has not yet implemented sqrtm so we cannot work with density matrices yet. This is a problem for us which need to be fixed either by implementing the sqrtm function ourself/finding other ways to compute fidelity between two density matrices.
Would pushing a PR with these feature requests to JAX be an option? That would be a smart way to deal with these sort of shortcomings.
Jax is implementing it now I suppose:
