SampleSet.from_samples_bqm accepts any object that has a .energies method and a vartype attribute instead of just BQMs, most notably BinaryPolynomial.

The docstring should mention this and tests should be added to check for backwards compatibility. I don't think the name of the method should be generalised, as this is just using python's duck typing.
