Drawing a particular circuit is throwing a KeyError:
example.txt
No response
I can't reproduce this with either Terra 0.20.2 or main-branch Terra, also on Python 3.9 and macOS.  Does the error happen every time for you, or is it sporadic?  If possible, could you provide the full error traceback as well?
It is not sporadic for me, it consistently happens. I double checked the specific version numbers from pip freeze:
qiskit-terra==0.20.2
qiskit==0.36.2
Here is the full traceback:
I could not recreate this either. This is a snippet of output from prints during a run of your circuit.
The top part is some of the printout of _wire_map and the bottom part is the iteration over some of the qargs in the circuit. The bottom section comes from the barrier qargs. Clearly Qubit 20 appears in both places, so not sure what's happening in your case.
