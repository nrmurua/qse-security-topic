The global phase of some circuits generated by SolovayKitaev seems wrong.
Given Operator(dc).data aprroximately equals to [[0, 1j], [-1j, 0]] which equals to -Operator(c).data, dc's global phase should be Ï€ rather than 3Ï€/4, I believe.
No response
That could probably be quick-fixed by checking the phases of the input and output matrix, but this might be a deeper bug since I think the SK algorithm should come up with the right phase in the end ðŸ¤”
