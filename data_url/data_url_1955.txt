Currently cirq.vis.Heatmap supports plotting of single-qubit to float maps.
It would be very useful to be able to plot a two-qubit interaction between qubits on a grid, for example like the plot on Fig. S40 a) (page 43) of the supremacy supplementary paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11333
Direct application of this could be a visualization of cirq.google.Calibration data (each parameter could just have a plot() method for example).
Thank you @mrwojtek for the suggestion!
For the record this is the image:

Example test data from cirq.CalibrationData['two_qubit_sycamore_gate_xeb_cycle_total_error'] which returns the metric for a given edge on a chip.
The solution would convert the data in cirq.Calibration.heatmap to the plot.

The prototype produced the following figure:

That looks awesome! Thank you for picking this up!
This is closed now, thanks @crystalzhaizhai!
Ah I haven't realized that #3351 was merged into a branch - @crystalzhaizhai, this is really not something we typically do. Reopening the issue.
I realized that there are a couple of issues with the current printing:

in case of the sycamore connectivity graph (cirq.google.Sycamore) there is a shift in the position of the annotations - they are not on the boundaries of the qubits anymore:

I'm actively looking at these issues and will sort them out.
The feature branch has been deleted and I'm going to open a PR based on my fork that is based on @crystalzhaizhai's initial work.
xref #3642
