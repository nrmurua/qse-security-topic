Can we add versions to the schemas, to keep track of them?
Right now we just have schemas, and a directory for "deprecated" ones.
Is there some sort of standard?
Otherwise just add a version field I guess
Can we go for both a version field and for making use of the URIs? When the schemas are hosted and have a URI, the documents can use the $schema keyword for uniquely identify which json schema they should be validated against ... but in the meantime, just a version field at the root structure would be a practical way to support versioning.
Addressed with #668
I think this can be closed.
Closing after David's merge PR #668.
