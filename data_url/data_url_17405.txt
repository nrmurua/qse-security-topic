The PassManager.run() method was added in #2134 that takes a circuit and runs the passes defined within the pass manager on it, and returns a circuit.
This method should be updated to accept a list of circuits, and parallelize over them. Similar to how the transpile function is parallelized.
(As decided in #1887, transpile(circuits, coupling_map, basis_gates, ...) is for transforming the circuit according to some desired criteria; Qiskit chooses the underlying pass manager. While if you have the exact pass manager, you simply invoke pass_manager.run().)
Parallelizing at this point might not be the best idea.
The PassManager instance has a lot of state that is hard control access to. I made some obvious experiments here: master...1ucian0:2156
Additionally, it is hard to handle the lambda functions that we use for control flow in the Pool queue.
If transpile() is in charge of the creation of the pass manager instance, it also should take care of creating multiple instances for parallelization porpoisesâ€¦ but given that task to the instance itself seems hard, if not impossible.
After #3286 gets merged, I have new hopes to have this feature. So, reopening!
