This tutorial should fill the space between the Superposition kata and the Measurements kata: assuming that the learner is already familiar with the previous topic (i.e., is comfortable with the Dirac notation, the concept of superposition and using quantum gates), introduce the necessary concepts and Q# constructs to use measurements.
Here is the tutorial structure I have in mind (we could frame them as two separate tutorials, similar to SingleQubitGates and MultiQubitGates).
Part 1. Measuring single-qubit systems
Part 2. Measuring multi-qubit systems
This is an ambitious issue, so feel free to start in increments: the first portion can be the first part up to the programming exercise on distinguishing |0⟩ from |1⟩.
(I think I know somebody who is interested, putting this on hold until I can confirm)
I will work on this.
