The documentation of the QUBO file format of the "p" line says that the third token may be either "0" or "unconstrained" to represent a QUBO.  The current version does not accept "unconstrained".
From QUBO.pdf, which is not on the Github//qbsolv site but probably should be, with emphasis added
"
One program line, which starts with “p” in the first column. The program line must be the first non-comment line in the file. The program line has six required fields (separated by space(s)), as follows:
p qubo target maxDiagonals nDiagonals nElements
where
p                          the problem line sentinel qubo the file type
target                  the topology of the problem and the specific problem type, identified by a string. For an unconstrained problem, target may be “0” or “unconstrained.” For constrained problems, valid strings could include “chimera128” or “chimera512” (among others).
maxDiagonals     number of diagonals in the topology.
