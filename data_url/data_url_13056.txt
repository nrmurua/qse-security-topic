My Binder is not very reliable. Still, during coding sessions, for example hands-on sessions with students at research centers, one would like to avoid risking installation.
One alternative to My Binder is Google Colab, that is much more stable, although it requires a Google account, login, and Mitiq installation (which is actually quick). I suggest adding a Colab badge to the readme, and then consider more integration in the documentation, as it is in the aim of Switch theme to export notebooksÂ #1637.
Another option is to set up a BinderHub on a UF-managed dedicated server. This would still require logins but should make things very quick. Costs would need to be evaluated especially if the cloud is hosted.
Some details here for BinderHub, https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/. Note that we set up a BinderHub in the past for a Mitiq workshop.
One could look if https://qbraid.com/ has interesting options too.
