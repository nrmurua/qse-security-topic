This kind of functionality makes explicit that SOME state is being prepared, but we don't care about what it is.  This kind of functionality is helpful when iterating over preparations, like in direct fidelity estimation and similar algorithms.
As for the terminology, see this.
@blakejohnson is that a fair description?
Right, in particular we want to have something other than None to use when iterating over multi-qubit state prep.
We this to be very careful with this -- if you look at how DFE is implemented using None, using a DontCare would greatly complicate things.  For example, a DontCare preparation may want to prepare some random state, but when converted to a PauliTerm (as is done in DFE), it should yield an identity.
The design of this will be tricky.
I originally had this but y'all made me take it out. You can use TensorProductState([]) iirc
Indeed, using TensorProductState() in some appropriate way would've been my solution as well, though I haven't had a chance to think too deeply or work on this yet.
