This would help clarify some of the "half angle" confusions.
What's the update on this?
We couldn't find this because Jupyter is misspelled (juptyer).  @dabacon what's the context on this? Could be a two birds one stone with: #1564
A possible documentation page to think about @karlunho a notebook or page with all of the gates (gate zoo)
Is this still in flight @dabacon ? Is this relevant : https://quantumai.google/cirq/gates ?
Still in flight, doing two qubit gates next.
Fixed in #5344
