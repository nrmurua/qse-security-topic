Minimal code
There is a second issue that is probably related, which is FusedGate.asmatrix(backend) returns a numpy.ndarray when backend=CupyBackend(). E.g.
@scarrazza the issue seems to come from the fact that the cupy backend does not have a matrices class (e.g. NumpyMatrices and TensorflowMatrices). In fact, any matrix coming from
is of type numpy.ndarray instead of cupy.ndarray.
Thanks @renatomello, @andrea-pasquale could you please have look?
