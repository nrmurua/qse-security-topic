Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
@mpharrigan did an amazing job working on adding the SVG representation for a Cirq.Circuit. He left some TODOs in his Issue (#2313). In this issue, I plan to address them and open them for further discussion.
Describe the solution you'd like
Listing the tasks from #2313,
Bugs
Design (A detailed RFC will be opened for this)
Testing
Ideally, once this issue is fixed, we can think of moving the SVG representation under cirq.Circuit itself.
This would require moving the code out from contrib.

Current Implementation

What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters

Awesome!
@freyam Thanks for opening up the issue and taking this up!
Our Cirq roadmap item on adding a verbose logging mode to Transformers for easier inspection and understanding will definitely make use of the improved SVGCircuit framework. cc #4483
Hi, I'm interested and would like to work on this as well!
The bugs have been taken care of (#4535)
Now, the next step is to figure out a nice way to represent custom gates. Currently, it just shows a ? in a box for every instance of MatrixGate class. It has the following attributes:

@tanujkhattar how do you want me to go forward with it? Would you like me to prepare an RFC and bring this up in the next Cirq Cync?
I have created a demo PR (#4630) for this.
@freyam Left a comment on #4630 regarding options for visualizing the MatrixGate -- let's continue the discussion there. Thanks for working on this!
