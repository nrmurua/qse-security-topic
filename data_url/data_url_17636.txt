Follow on from #1615 we need to
If I understand correctly, the first two items ("Remove the c++" code and "Travis cleanup") are done. I'm not sure of "Fix the documentation". If it's still pending, the issue should be moved to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit. Maybe @jaygambetta can answer this question?
yeah i see no reason for this to open. The documentation was referring to the contributing file
