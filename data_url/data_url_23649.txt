I have found several problems with the RTO scope driver.
Observe the following difference and not the (spurious) staircase due to digitization in the left figure.

Both are the same trace measured. The one on the right is measured by a little hack in the driver.
The second trace contains a scaling error on the y-axis but I'm sure that can be fixed quite easilty.

I added a screenshot from the scope itself as reference.

When using this workaround it is important to also use the following change for the rescaling of the data.

Hi @AdriaanRol, thanks for catching this one. I don't have access to an instrument right now, but let's see if I can make sense of what is going on.
From how I understood the manual, one can not acquire in 16 bit unless the instrument is in high definition mode. Is you left figure really 16 bit with the high definition mode off? (nevermind the data format, are there really 2^16 unique values?) If so, then we might remove the high_definition_state paramater. If not, I think a real solution is to make the high definition mode not limit the bandwidth. Could you try using the HDEFinition:BWIDth command to see if you can set the high definition mode bandwidth?
I am sorry that I did not realise that the high definition mode comes with a bandwidth of its own.
I just figured out how to increase the bandwidth when using HD mode.
I think this should also be implemented when addressing this issue.
Tested using :

Where rto is an instance of the RTO instrument driver.
Below is an excerpt of the manual (page 1059)

Yes, that's what I tried to hint at above. Glad that we agree ðŸ˜„
Do you want to make a PR adding this parameter? I can also do it, but it will not happen this week.
Or actually, an RTO 1044 just landed on my desk for an entirely different reason. Let me seize the opportunity to fix this.
Awesome, looking forward to the PR!
