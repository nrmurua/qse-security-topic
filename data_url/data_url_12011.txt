https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/11/qiskit-for-multiple-architectures/ blog post points to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/advanced/terra/7_different_qubit_technologies.ipynb for the code related to the tutorial. However, the second link returns a 404 not found error.
The link on the original blog post should be updated. I'm also not able to find the different_qubit_technologies.ipynb  tutorial in the repository. Does the tutorial still exist?
