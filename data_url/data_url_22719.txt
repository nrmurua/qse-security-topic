Setting phase doesn't work. I expect the following program to jump the phase of ddsB relative to ddsA. The phase is not touched at all. I can change the frequency of ddsB.
If you have the "prepare DDS" stage only, does it phase-sync them or not?
Please try to have the minimum amount of code necessary to reproduce a problem.
Actually, you should test that with a single DDS and sync a phase jump with a TTL (as done before).
Using external trigger... try again. Still not working. See comments at outset of each @kernel.
Reproduced+fixed on 9914.
Still not out of the woods on this one.
Using phase locked external references for FPGA and DDSs...
When end_delay = 50_us the the 0 -> 0.5 and 0.5 -> 0 phase jumps are correct and aligned with ttl0.
When end_delay = 53.123_us the RF is not phase aligned with ttl0. Rolling.
You need to be very precise and provide more details. Are you 100% sure that:
If you are sure about those two, use a logic analyzer or the scope to check that the FUD pulse is still emitted in the second case.
I can't test now. Next testing opportunity will be Monday.
Testing OK.
