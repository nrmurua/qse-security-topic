Crashes on all language wrappers (c++/go/python), e.g. https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vsoftco/liboqs-python Most likely another stack issue...
Rainbow 3/5 were not supported on Windows. The test was disabling them on windows (see here), but the rainbow names changed so we need to update the test guard.
Fixed on liboqs-python commit eef9c6.
