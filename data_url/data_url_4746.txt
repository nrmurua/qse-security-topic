Hi @sassan72! Can I ask for some additional information in diagnosing this issue. In particular,
What operating system are you using?
What version of Python are you using? This can be checked by running python --version in the terminal.
In particular, this error message indicates that your combination of Python version/operating system is one that doesn't support our binary builds of The Walrus.
python 3.7, Mac OS Sierra.
Hmm, that should be a supported version of Python ðŸ¤”
Are your using the built-in Python that ships with MacOS, or are you using Anaconda?
actually, I installed python with pip install python. i have also Anaconda. do you think the problem is related to my Python library.
Potentially, could you try installing it using Anaconda?
Thanks Josh for helping. you mean by conda install
Hi @sassan72!
One way you could have Python be installed with Anaconda is to create a new environment with Anaconda.
For example, you could create a new Anaconda environment the following way:
conda create --name py36 python=3.6
After that, you could activate this environment on macOS by:
source activate py36
At this step, you will have an environment that has a few basic packages installed. You could then use pip to install TheWalrus.
Let us know how this goes!
Hi @sassan72, any updates here?
I could install it. thanks.
