I am using the function low_rank_two_body_decomposition (
I do not get the symmetries stated in equation 5 of the same paper (except pq <--> rs), mostly because one_body_squares = g_{pql} is not symmetric in p and q. Probably there is some theory point I am missing here, but what is it?
Thanks in advance!
Actually the g_{pql} are symmetric within the precision of the calculation, so I am just using (g + g.T)/2 for each value of l and that works.
