ntp sources are blocked on my network. Is it possible to change the default ntp.ubuntu.com/pool.ntp.org by another one?
It seems synchronizing doesn't start because of this
PR #985 allows for ntp server configuration. You will be able to add other servers in config.yml
The issue has been fixed and will be released soon.
