The current implementation of the rewriting rule for eigenvalues in the AQVM looks at each individual instruction and tests whether the state vector is an eigenvector for that particular instruction. However, some state vectors will only be eigenvectors for sequences of instructions, and not for any individual instruction, and this rewriting rule will miss these cases.
If we are willing to suffer some extra time complexity (ideally controllable by a parameter), we can look at short product sequences as well as individual instructions and test for eigenvalue elimination in them as well.
