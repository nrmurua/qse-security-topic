The loop unrolling pass is best-effort, i.e., it will try to unroll all loops but won't complain if that is not possible. Normally this is the desired behavior, however, when JIT compiling kernel to a backend it would be best if the pass fails when a loop can't be unrolled. This new behavior would allows better error reporting to the user, since the alternative would be a failure when trying to lower generic CFG to QIR---at point at which we might not be able to easily identify the unrolling as being the culprit.
I would change the title from "forcing loop unrolling" to "have the pass raise an error if it cannot unroll a loop." I think that reflects what the description says.
(There will be situations were a loop simply cannot be unrolled fully. "Forcing" the unrolling just would not be possible.)
