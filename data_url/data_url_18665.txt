The current implementation of gate-matrix on UCR-application instruction types uses ucr-explode-instr as its source of truth, so that compilation is always trivially correct. This should be rigidified by providing a separate definition of gate-matrix as a block-diagonal matrix.
Likely to be handled in #210.
Since there is no ucr-application type now, is this considered closed?
Yes, thanks!
