Hi @scarrazza, I am creating a docker container for Qibo and up to now the container has all the requirements for Qibo. This is the dockfile
Now when I try to install qibo I get an error
I have been  looking at the setup file but I do not get the problem. Any idea about what is wrong?
I believe this is due to an old setuptools version. You can try to upgrade before installing with pip3 install setuptools -U.
I would also suggest to remove python2 and simply use the command python as equivalence to python3.
I got the same error. I am trying different solution but if you come up with another idea let me know.
Then I would propose to try FROM ubuntu:18.04.
Finally I built a container with Qibo (from the pip installation and the last release). The container could be useful for sharing the DGX server (if needed) or in the development of an interactive web for qibo. We will see.
Implemented in #482.
