Many unit tests are currently failing due to what appears to be broken paths, where the paths that are failing are all converted to lowercase (while the paths in the git repo are rooted at 'QGL', so basically nothing works at all).
Maybe this was a step taken to get things to working on Windows, but the result is that it doesn't work on Linux.
This issue was incorrectly reported.
The error messages from the h5 libraries convert paths to lowercase (for unknown reasons) which made it look like they were complaining about bogus paths, but it was really opening the correct files and finding that they had bogus contents.  The reason for the bogus contents was use of git-lfs, which I will raise in another ticket.
