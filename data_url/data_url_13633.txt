Since QuTiP's qutip.QubitCircuit class is now connected to OpenQASM's standard import and export format (PR 1318 and 1291 that will be included in QuTiP's 4.5.3+ version release), it may be nice to add some integration with it on mitiq's side.
@nathanshammah Is this issue still under discussion? I'm reading through some of the QuTiP QIP docs but it looks like I could follow the mitiq_qiskit/ example and start on a mitiq_qutip/ folder, testing, and docs here.
Hi @Aaron-Robertson, thanks it is. I do have some code already on a private repository. I think this may require some discussion first.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
