I wanted to check the contributing.md file by adding a new submission, but the submission does not include rng.c. We need to provide a way to deal with that.
We've got the global OQS_randombytes function in src/common/rand.h so I would use that.  I think we would use symbol renaming on the submission's binary to map its call to randombytes on to OQS_randombytes?
Ok good. We probably should, including for the existing implementations which are using an apparently uninitialized randombytes right now?
Yes, we should make all algorithms in NIST branch use our OQS_randombytes function.
Depends on #260
Fixed by #260. I had a hard time renaming calls to randombytes in compiles libraries, so I added a global randombytes function which immediately calls OQS_randombytes.
