It appears as though the wallet already existed and an attempt to overwrite the index wallet 0 happened.
I say because an O/S error is IO error, so it could not write to the directory or overwrite the already-existing file data. Wallet would not exist in the case of IO error (when I got this error no wallet was outputted into home ~)
slaves are not necessary anymore. closing
