How can we prove something is Quantum Safe, are there any tests that can be performed.
Quantum-safe means that a cryptosystem is believed to be resistant to attacks by quantum computers. All currently studied schemes are only conjecturally quantum-safe. See the NIST competition and each algorithm's documentation for details.
