I just rebuilt my virtualenv and noticed an error about inconsistent requirements:
It seems that our contrib requirements explicitly call for ply 3.4 while dev requirements call for qiskit 0.6.* and thus implicitly for ply >=3.10.
I checked whether the tests in qasm_import (the contrib package that uses ply) pass with 3.10 and they do. Time to bump ply to 3.10?
If i recall, we decided on 3.4 in order to be compatible with google3.

Steps to reproduce, including tests sensitive to ply version:
We chatted with @dstrain115 about this back in May: #1613 (comment)
What do you think about ply>=3.4?
On the long run someone could take on upgrading the google3 ply version...
Yeah, I think we should change to "ply>=3.4" unless there's a good reason to pin to that exact version.
SGTM. And just to be a bit more specific: in cirq/contrib/qasm_import only the qiskit tests fail as latest qiskit requires latest ply. All the other functionality is compatible with latest ply versions.
