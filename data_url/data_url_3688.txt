To validate the cost of a bit string on a Hamiltonian the only way to do this currently is to use the tensor_up operation from the referenceqvm:
where cost_ham is a PauliSum of Z-operations. This operation does not scale very nicely if you have to evaluate this function several thousand times.
I tried to use a memoization technique with and lru_cache
but got
