We should have 4 separate codecov reports instead of 1. 1 report each for SDK unit tests, dispatcher unit tests, UI unit tests, and functional tests. This task should also include cleaning up the tests folder structure, like for example electron_return_value_test.py should not be in the root of tests. The tests workflow will have to be enhanced to upload different reports for the different domains. Consider using the paths-filter action to check for paths to test as is done elsewhere in our CI.

We may want to report "core" coverage vs "beta" coverage. Feature flags are probably the way to do that.

@scottwn  please could you provide a bit more context on what components of Covalent should be flagged as core vs beta when generating the coverage reports.
I think the "core" vs "beta" is out of scope for now until we implement feature flags. The breakdown should follow the original issue description.

Okay, thanks!
