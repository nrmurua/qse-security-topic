Update Classical Simulator to use #5417
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters
Hi @NoureldinYosri, I'm interested in working on this issue and have been looking through the related information.
Started work on class based on the ComputationalBasisState and ComputationalBasisSimState classes shown in custom_state_simulator_test.py from #5417.
@shef4 The classical simulator is already implemented https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-core/cirq/sim/classical_simulator.py
The goal of this issue is align the implementation with that of other simulators using the infrastructure introduced in the linked PR.
@NoureldinYosri Thanks for clarification. The code I sent is on based on example of infrastructure in custom_state_simulator_test.py. (ComputationalBasisSimState)
I changed the _act_on_fallback_ to include the behaviour and gates described in classical_simulator  and comments mentioned in #6124 .
Honestly not sure if using _act_on_fallback_ was  the correct thing to do and based it off of ComputationalBasisSimState.
Hi @NoureldinYosri, I see why the test is failing now. They are based on the abstract method in the SimulatesSamples class, _run(program, repetitions, param_resolver).
There's a formatting mismatch between:
Thanks for the help!
