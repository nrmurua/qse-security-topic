artiq_run not working with basic program on Kasli on Windows 10 after upgrade to artiq 6.7582. On artiq 5.7151 same program works.

Should run.
Seems that the kernel cannot properly connect to the pc: see the following screenshot for what came out on the (USB) serial port:

The core device firmware is slightly out of sync wrt the software version: 6.7267 vs 6.7582. Do you think this is the problem?
Would you suggest flashing the same version on the Kasli to see if the problem disappears?
In particular, if the firmware version you are using still works with the ARTIQ 5 tools, it won't work with the ARTIQ 6 ones.
OK, thank all of you very much! Tomorrow or Monday I'll flash it and, in case it works, I'll close the issue.
@drvolpe Is this resolved?
