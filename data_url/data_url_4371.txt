When we implement sequence unrolling in qibolab, we will have the option to deploy multiple circuits in parallel to speed up execution. We will need a way to expose these to users via qibo. The current approach of
does not work because it is focusing on one circuit at a time.
In contrast
could be extended to backend.execute_circuits.
I am not sure if there is a way to extend the first approach too.
