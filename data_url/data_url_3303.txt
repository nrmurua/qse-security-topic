Engagement is a key-exchange mechanism that allows encrypted connections using rqcq (patching a limitation imposed by the underlying ZeroMQ). Since we're moving away from rpcq for v4, we can get rid of engagements in pyQuil entirely. Supports #1485.
To prevent merging a completely broken branch, this means removing/replacing/refactoring QPUClient, which is currently built on top of rpcq. I think this should be blocked by rigetti/qcs-sdk-rust#208, if not other qcs-sdk-rust work as well -- in short, I think this should wait until we can replace the pieces that need replacing and not removal.
