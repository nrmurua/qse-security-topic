The Rot gates and the Exp gates related to the W gate have a global phase on their matrix that does not match the definition (at least the one given for the Exp gate).
exp(-iXt) = cos(t) + i sin(t) X
but the implementation Rot X has a global phase that depends on t.
I think it is important for out two qubit gates to be in SU(2) not U(2) as that is the standard form.
This is also true for RotZ
This was changed in #261
