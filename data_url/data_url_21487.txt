how to initialize a list of hardware channels with a loop
I am a newbie of python, artiq and github. I have a question about how to initialize a list of hardware channels. For example, I have a channel list chnlist = ["ttl0", "ttl1", "ttl2"], how to set all the three channels to output mode with a loop in the kernel?
'''
from artiq.experiment import *
chnlist = ['ttl0', 'ttl1', 'ttl2']
class test(EnvExperiment):
def build(self):
self.setattr_device("core")
for chn in chnlist:
self.setattr_device(chn)
'''
how to write the "@kernel run(self)" function with a loop?
I think what you're looking for is getattr_device. So in pseudocode something like
get_device?
Hartytp and dnadlinger, thx a lot! The code can work if I replace the getattr_device with get_device.
Thanks @dnadlinger! Should have checked the api rather than posting from memory.
