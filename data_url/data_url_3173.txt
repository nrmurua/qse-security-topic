@notmgsk could you add some color to this issue so we can get it labeled and assigned? :)
Following a class at UCLA, a number of students mentioned that it was not clear how or where timeouts should be configured. From memory, timeouts can be configured: at the command line when invoking the compiler and simulator, and by reaching into QVMCompiler and QPUCompiler objects. It is not clear which of these methods takes preference, and the latter method feels obscure since it is not provided at get_qc time. It's not clear whether the timeout for running on the QPU can be configured, or what it's default timeout is.
The meat of completing this issue would be having a clear story of where timeouts are implemented, which methods override defaults, and how the interface could be improved (be it in documentation or code).
