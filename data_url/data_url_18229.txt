I am working on Mac which has both python 2 & 3 version. I had to install qiskit using the pip3 command; contrary to the docs which have the simple pip command. Shouldn't that be changed to pip3 install qiskit
The installation instructions have you install pip in your QISKitenv python3 conda environment where it should appear as pip. Try typing type pip to see which pip you are executing. What you're describing has happened to me if I forget to activate my conda environment in which case pip is taken from my OS distribution.
