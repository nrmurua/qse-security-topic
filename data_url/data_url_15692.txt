Thanks for the report.  Hopefully this should be fixed by #7260 - if you're able to test that out, it'd be great, because by default I don't have access to any of the problematic machines, and our testing infrastructure is a bit lacking in that area.
By the way (and this has no impact on the bug you're reporting), you may want to check your Jupyter environment is what you expect - you said your Python version is 3.8.10, but your packages are being imported from a Python 3.7 environment.  You may just have had the wrong environment activated, or you may not have Jupyter installed in the environment you meant, so when you run it, it pulls from a different environment.
