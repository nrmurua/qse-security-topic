I found some missing description and features for threshold voltage determination that might be worth adding somewhere:
filter-traces feature can be set only for EPR part of the measurement parameter and not for ESR, etc.
readout_threshold_voltage is used only in SteeredInitialization Pulse. It seems to have the same logic as threshold_voltage. Overall, this pulse might need to be removed as we found out from the discussion that it is not used by anyone.
threshold_method="low:mean+max(0.08,6*std)" is missing some description in the code explaining its full meaning
