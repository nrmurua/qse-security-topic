When the example of strawberryfields quantum_neural_network.py is run, it breaks when calling the Dgate in ops.py. After a git bissect, one finds that the problem comes from the commit:
9403664 Symbolic Operation parameters using SymPy.
It seems that the wrapper around the exp function is not working correctly.

Thanks for the detailed bug report @MichelNowak1
We'll look into it asap
Actually, it's just a problem of having a tensor of type float32 multiplied by 1j, a complex number.
Changing np.exp to tf.exp and adding the line p = tf.cast(p, tf.complex128) in the apply function of the Dgate in ops.py (line 920 at tag 0.12.0) solved the issue.
Not sure if its the way to go though...
Closing this as the demos were all recently tested and this one runs smoothly under the development version of PennyLane (0.14). Please feel free to re-open if this issue persists.
