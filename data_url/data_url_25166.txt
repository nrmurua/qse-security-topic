@ArunPsiog @mpvgithub Please follow this thread closely.
@AlejandroEsquivel Currently we have a couple of endpoints for deletion on the ui-backend.
We have options to delete multiple dispatches at the same time and also an option to delete all dispatches at a single time. We also delete dispatches based on status filters as well.
Please let us know if you need any infornation at any point of time about this.
