Make the following changes for the qubit naming conventions used in QuantumCircuit methods:
ctl -> control_qubit
tgt -> target_qubit
q -> qubit
I looked at this before, and it wasn't actually not something we can do without a backwards compatibility issue. Parameters in python can still be specified by name, that's part of api contract when we have a stable interface. People could call qc.cx(tgt=0, ctrl=1) and if we change the names of the parameters that would break. Python 3.8 added a feature to add positional only parameters (https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#positional-only-parameters ), but it'll be a while before we can use that here.
So we are stuck with a bad choice?  Do we have an example of people setting args by name?
I personally don't have any examples but that doesn't mean there aren't any. The only path forward I can see is to deprecate the old names (without a warning, just in the release notes) for all the parameters we're going to change. This way we can at least have something to point to if people come out of the woodwork when we change the names.
I think this is doable, especially when compared to other changes, e.g. #3455
for context #3455 is changing things that have not been released yet. it's just a follow up to a PR that merged 2 days ago.
But I agree with doing this in release notes and making the names better.
What about making the old names keyword-only args, and warning when they're used. Something like :
