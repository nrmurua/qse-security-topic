Hi,
I received an warning about the force calculations during DFT+U method LOWDIN
`
*** WARNING in dft_plus_u.F:791 :: This is an experimental version of the ***
*** forces calculation for the DFT+U method LOWDIN                        ***
`
So, my question is that should I trust the results from CP2K with this warning? I would like to do some tests, however the DFT+U is really dependent on the implementatin details  (basis sets, project etc), and it is not clear how to make the tests realiably.
Thanks
Best,
Geng
