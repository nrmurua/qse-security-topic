To whom it may concern,

Hello Ou, Cheng-Fu, can you please assign this issue to me, thanks
There is no "assign" settings on my issue page, so I can't assign you because I am not the owner or the collaborator of the repository. If you want to answer this issue, answer directly by reply.
Hi, the optimization tutorial no longer lives in this repository and is now at https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-optimization. For the specific problem of .to_quadratic_program() not existing, it still exists. See the search results in the optimization docs: https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/optimization/search.html?q=to_quadratic&check_keywords=yes&area=default
I suspect you may be using it on the wrong thing.
This repository is being archived very soon as the remaining tutorials are moving to the Qiskit repository. If this is still an issue after trying the above from the search results, feel free to open an issue in the Optimization repo.
Thank you. I changed the codes associating to the variable "tsp" to the source code of "to_quadratic_program" and build a model from it so the problem is solved.
