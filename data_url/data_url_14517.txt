Often, outdated versions of the qiskit documentation rank higher in search engine results than current documentation.  This is especially noticable with Qiskit/qiskit-metapackage#1389, as many of these pages are broken links, currently.
We should try to prevent outdated documentation from appearing in search results.  This can be improved by adding <meta name="robots" content="noindex"> to the <head> of each page in each old documentation build.
As one example, the first hit that comes up when I search Google for "qiskit BasePauli" is to the 0.25 documentation (the Japanese version of it, in fact).
Yes, you are correct @garrison; this occurs frequently and causes a great deal of confusion. When I googled "support vector machine qiskit" the other day, the tutorial for version 0.24.1 was the first result; instead, it should point to the latest tutorials for version 0.34.1.
Related: there is an outdated build of the qiskit-optimization documentation that ranks high in search results at [1], without any indication in the URL that it might not be the latest version.  The actual latest is at [2].
The indexing of old documentation should hopefully sort itself out given a little bit of time now, just by nature of how the algorithm works; paths at qiskit.org/documentation/* will be updated far more frequently than qiskit.org/documentation/stable/*, which will cause them to be promoted to the top.  Now that the deployment to stable should be working correctly, we won't get stuck with the same pages getting hit a lot from search results, because they'll keep getting shifted down by newer versions.
I don't think adding a noindex is the best idea here - that will seriously hinder people from being able to find older versions of the documentation at all, even when they're specifically looking for them, which is important for people using older versions of Qiskit (common in education).  Perhaps a better solution would be to try putting in a banner like Numpy/Scipy/Matplotlib do, which says "this is an older version of the documentation, click here to go to the new documentation".  That will be a bit trickier to set up, but should work in principle.
The two problems mentioned in the comments are slightly different to the original one:
On further investigation, I think I know what the issue with the optimisation (and other) tutorials is that the deployment script effectively does rclone sync --exclude 'optimization/*' <src> <dst> to avoid clobbering the documentation generated by the qiskit-optimization repository actions themselves.  Unfortunately, that also means that the redirects created in tutorials/optimization are also excluded, so the whole directory isn't synced, and we're left with the old version still deployed to production.
Previously I was only looking at the stable/ deploy script, thinking that they had essentially equal rclone commands, but that's not the case.

So it was an HTML issue, @jakelishman ðŸ˜„
This particular part of it wasn't an HTML issue as such - we already had all the right files generated, the problem was we were just excluding some of them from being synced from the build server to the production server, which was leaving old stuff in place.  If you go to https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/optimization now, you should get 301 redirected to https://qiskit.org/documentation/optimization/tutorials (you might need to reload with cache disabled).  Search engines will pick up the permanent redirect in the next few days, so that part should be solved.
The other issue, about the documentation in the stable/0.33 (etc etc) paths showing up in search results, is still there, though I mentioned above why I'm hopeful it should largely sort itself out fairly quickly now.  I do think it would be good to put some sort of notification on the old pages, mentioning that they're not the latest version of the documentation - while I'm open to all suggestions, I am a little worried that noindexing all the old stuff will make it harder for people who need to find old versions, and I think we might be able to get the best of both worlds with a banner and a link.
Before filing this issue, I did a quick survey of some other projects that I admire for having excellent documentation, and I noticed that some have the noindex <meta> tag while others do not.  I think you make a reasonable case that it may not be desirable, so I support taking a "wait and see" approach to see if other changes fix the problem of old docs outranking new ones in the search engines.
I really like the idea of having a banner.  Many other projects (e.g. Julia, Django, and projects hosted on readthedocs) also have a selector on the page where you can easily switch to any other version of the documentation. Of those, Django is the only one that links to the corresponding page of the documentation, rather than the front page of it, when switching to a different version.  I find this especially convenient.  An example of this in action is at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/install/
Since #10611, this should now be done on Terra.
Also, after #10610, this will also apply to the /dev documentation as well.
