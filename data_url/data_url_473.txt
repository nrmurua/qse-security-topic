The constructor of measure gate in xacc/quantum/gate/ir/CommonGates.hpp allows for specifying multiple qubits we want to measure:
One then expects that it would create measure gates for all the qubits specified in the vector, however not all accelerators are implemented so. For example, the qpp visitor  xacc/quantum/qpp/accelerator/QppVisitor.cpp extracts only the first qubit:
Which leads to unexpected, potentially buggy behaviour, if not spotted.
The solution is to either delete such a constructor or to fix the codes of the accelerators.
I suggest fixing the code of the accelerators to allow for multiple-qubit measure gates. Such ability can make the code much cleaner when we need to get for example expectation values of measuring multiple qubits. This could for instance lead to a faster calculation of expectations of observables decomposed into many pauli strings.
