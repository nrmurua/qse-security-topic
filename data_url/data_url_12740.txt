I tried the following steps:
Getting the following error when running simulate
I've never tried calling DumpUnitary from Q# notebooks (it's so old it predates the notebooks support for Q#!), but I think %simulate doesn't like taking a callable as a parameter. I'd suggest writing a wrapper operation without any parameters that would call DumpUnitary with the parameters you want, and %simulate that operation.
Thank you @tcNickolas for the help. Now, I am able to call it through UnitaryPattern notebook
Great!
Just to offer another option, you can use DumpOperation similarly to dump the raw matrix, without conversion to a pattern, if you need more information about the unitary.
Thank you @tcNickolas. Would be glad to try it out.
