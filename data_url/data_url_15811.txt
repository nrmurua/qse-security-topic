In the qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration documentation (link here:https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration.html#qiskit-providers-models-backendconfiguration) under the description for the rep_delay_range parameter is the following:
"2d list defining supported range of repetition delays for backend in μs. First entry is lower end of the range, second entry is higher end of the range. Optional, but will be specified when dynamic_reprate_enabled=True."
Instead of μs, the unit should be s (seconds).
If any other information is needed, I'm happy to provide it.
The source of the documentation is in qiskit-terra: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/providers/models/backendconfiguration.py#L271
Please open this issue in the qiskit-terra repository instead.
@coruscating there's no need to close this we can just transfer it to terra.
Here we just need to make changes in docstrings of qiskit.providers.models.backendconfiguration.py right?
@prathameshbhole, yes this is all that needs to be updated.
hi @prathameshbhole . Did your #6926 addressed this one too?

No
I may be misunderstanding, but I believe this issue should be closed because the elements of the rep_delay_range parameter are multiplied by 1e-6 to convert them from microseconds to seconds, making the documentation correct.

Hmm... I think @towynlin has a point.
@wmurphy-collabstar , do you mind having another look?
I think you're right @towynlin , as long as it says in the description to write the rep delay in seconds because it will be converted to microseconds, then I think it's fine. I think the original confusion was with how to enter rep delay.
I made a mistake in my last comment. Knowing that the parameter should be in microseconds, I think the way the documentation is written is fine. I'll now close this issue. Thanks for the help everyone!
