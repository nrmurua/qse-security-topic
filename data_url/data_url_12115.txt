Include a note similar to that in './qiskit/fundamentals/1_getting_started_with_qiskit.ipynb' with expanded information on how to set a default configuration.
Now that the tutorials are rendered in the main qiskit docs, this is now something that can be addressed there.  Many thanks for bringing it up!
