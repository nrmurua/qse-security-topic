The current error messages for BasisTranslator, Unroll3qOrMore, UnrollCustomDefinitions and Unroller could stand to be a bit better, and attempt to give the user some hints as to what they might need to do to action it.
For example, on a failed translation, the BasisTranslator says "could not map source basis  to target  over library <equivalence_library>".  It would help to explain to users which operations are causing the problem (this might involve a bit more calculation once we know we're in an error condition), and how they can add rules to the equivalence library.
