chimera.find_clique_embedding accepts target_edges, while pegasus.find_clique_embedding accepts target_graph:


The difference is directly propagated in dwave.embedding.chimera/dwave.embedding.pegasus, ultimately making embedding finding topology-specific (see hybrid.SubproblemCliqueEmbedder and this bug).
The fix is to deprecate dwave.embedding.chimera.find_embedding and dwave.embedding.pegasus.find_embedding, in favor of minorminer.busclique.find_embedding.  I'd strongly suggest migrating to busclique immediately, as pegasus.find_embedding is horribly slow.
Blech, my grand deprecation plans have been dashed.  I've updated chimera.find_embedding to accept m=None, target_graph=(not None).
