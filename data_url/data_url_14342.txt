Animation rendering exceeds its size limit resulting a partially rendered visual animation.
I am able to resolve this issue by going specifically to Line 345 and changing the "100" and restarting the jupyter kernal for the example used to reproduce the issue.

Following code is run in jupyter notebook on vscode (but also tried on jupyterlab web environment)
Error message message:
The visual animation should render will fully without error.
Line 345 should not be hard coded to "50", but should allow a user to increase it if needed.
Raising to 100 (in MB) was a quick fix, but perhaps reducing the framerate would be more memory efficient.

I have already done a fix in a forked version and am currently figuring out how to run regression tests and put in a pull request.  Please assign this issue to me.
Hi @fullofentropy how is that PR doing?
