Hi everyone,
In here : https://journals.aps.org/prx/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.021070, one finds in Table 1 values of \Omega_max that  are incompatible with the current limit for the Rabi frequency on the global Rydberg channel.
I changed to the max to 2.5 MHz, but perhaps that's not enough considering the factor of 2*\pi. These values are not set in stone at all though, not until the device is done. I'll leave this open for now.
