It would be good, to allow measurements within other templates than just atomic pulse templates.
Especially RepetitionPT.
(Frederik Wangelik)
Currently measurements are bound to waveforms.
For now I will let the non-atomic pulse templates inject the measurements into the first waveform/EXEC instruction but there has to be a better way...
Does not work as the RepetitionPT currently has no way to access the instructions generated by the body.
Maybe a new MEAS instruction will seal the deal.
This would also be a good oportunity to prepare the comeback of the CHAN instruction and non-atomic multi channel pulse templates.
Implemented with merge #168
I close this now. Please re-open if other PulseTempaltes are desired.
Need measurements in ForLoopPT
Implemented in #172
