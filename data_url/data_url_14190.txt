The Qiskit Transpiler Documentation is missing some images. Specifically, in the section Representing Quantum ComputersÂ¶ the following method is called as an example for the reader: target.build_coupling_map().draw() to show the coupling maps of Target class. However, none of the coupling maps are actually drawn out to the screen. To improve the documentation, the coupling maps should be there.

Scroll down to "Representing Quantum Computer." This section should have coupling maps as example images but they don't exist.

@Eric-Arellano any ideas on this, I'm wondering if it's related to: #10614
Oh, actually I realized what is the issue. The code block ends with .draw() but that needs to be .draw('mpl'). If you update all the draw calls that should fix the image rendering.
