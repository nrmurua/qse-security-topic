The CircuitFactory is used as base type for several components used for Amplitude Estimation algorithms. This type was necessary since the circuits & instructions did not have the required functionality of computing the control/inverse/power.
Most of this functionality exists or could be added to the circuit. To strengthen the concept of circuits as first-class citizens in Aqua we should deprecate the factory in favor of circuits.
