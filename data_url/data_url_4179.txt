When making requests in _ibm_http_client file such as in the method authenticate, it is returning an html file, not a json file which is throwing exceptions. The reason might be that the api links are not working no more.
I just took a look at the Qiskit documentation, it seems indeed that since last month the old API is not working anymore:

Yes and they didn't include a new link for connecting to backend. They describe it only in the case of using qiskit.
