Experiment.load_quick_setup loads a HJSON config file referencing files describing model and generator.
If overal config file (i.e. examples/qiskit.cfg) is not in a current directory, load fails
Move examples/*.cfg to examples/cfg/
change reference to qiskit.cfg to cfg/qiskit.cfg in examples/c3_qiskit.ipynb and try to run.
Not absolute (not starting with /) file names in quick setup file must be treated as relative to the file itself.
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
