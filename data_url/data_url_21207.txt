Kasli panics sometimes when doing repeated DMA calls to a channel on a satellite.
My system has a single satellite. This satellite has a TTLOut that is used to run this function: https://gitlab.com/duke-artiq/dax/-/blob/master/dax/modules/rtio_benchmark.py#L479. This is a benchmark we use to measure performance of the Kasli. Sometimes the Kasli panics when we run that code.
The panic was not observed when running the same test on a TTLOut on the master, though I cannot test that exhaustively.
The panic is visible in the UART logs of the master. The satellite does not report any UART messages when the master panics, except that the link is lost.
No panic.
Panic.
What do the backtrace addresses resolve to? (You can use addr2line with the .elf file corresponding to the gateware build.)
hope this helps!
