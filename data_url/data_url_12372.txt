During the writing of #621 it became apparent that the new version of cirq 0.13.0 had changed the way gates are decomposed. Past quantumlib/Cirq#4167 some gates were decomposed into 3 qubit gates, which are not currently supported. Thus, #621 bypassed Cirq's default decomposition as a work around.
However, the work-around shouldn't say forever. Instead, we should:
Totally agree, one hard part might be dealing with writing down parameter shift rules for 3 qubit gates, but it should still be possible.
Whats are coherence times for qubit graphs?
