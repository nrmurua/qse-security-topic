The toolchain currently builds ELPA without OpenMP on Cray. While this is ok for the current XC40/50 generation, we'll eventually need OpenMP support for EPYC and ARM based machines.
See also #1857.
There have been a number of improvements to ELPA's OpenMP code. @mkrack, perhaps we should revisit this ?
