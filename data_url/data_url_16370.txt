The exposition below is for the matrix representing the Pauli X gate, but the bug probably occurs for most matrices representing  1Q gates.
The parameters for the unitary are computed here:

I we instead do this:
then the matrix is computed correctly.
EDIT: Is there is a fairly efficient algorithm to find the more economical/simpler decomposition of the 1Q unitary as global_phase * U3, in this case, the one with global_phase = 1 ? My guess is that there would be little advantage.
Just encountered this problem. Thank you for fixing it!
