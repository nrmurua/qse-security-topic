Using the old binary package to work around #1472, still no dice...
The correct location seems to be C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\DIA SDK
Are you launching this from withing VsDevCmd.bat or outside?
(or vcvars32.bat, for that matter)
conda build loads such scripts, in addition to way too many VS setup commands...
We have automated and reproducible builds now. Full log: https://nixbld.m-labs.hk/build/69329/nixlog/4
Could be yet another conda bug?
Note that the same vcvarsall.bat error occurs in the llvm-or1k build, where it does not seem to cause such problems. https://nixbld.m-labs.hk/build/69317/nixlog/1
Using the freshly compiled LLVM package fixed this (yeah makes a lot of sense).
