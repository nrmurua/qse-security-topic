When the TTLInOut.gate_rising function is called two times in the kernel, unification error in the first call is shown as error on the second call.
Reproducing example ("pmt" is a TTLInOut channel):
The error message is:
We expect the error message to indicate the time = self.pmt.gate_rising(self.count_1_len) line as the type of time = self.pmt.gate_rising(self.count_1_len) is not correct.
The error message indicates the time = self.pmt.gate_rising(self.count_2_len).
This is a fundamental problem with the type inference algorithm used in the legacy compiler, and one of the main reasons why NAC3 uses a different type system design.
The new design does have the behavior that you expect:
