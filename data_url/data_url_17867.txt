Attempting to use the latex drawer to render a circuit with simulator instructions stack traces in the dagunroller. For example:
It looks like it's trying to treat the snapshot instruction as a gate (which it's not) and that's causing things to crash.
I've been running:
Also replacing snapshot() with save(), load(), and noise()
This should draw a circuit (the barriers won't be drawn for the simulator instructions, that's what I was working on adding when I encountered this) and not stack trace.
Fix the crash.
This is a duplicate of #732.
