On a vanilla conda install of ARTIQ-beta, the misoc python package is missing.
From a command-line prompt with conda:
Similarly, the following produces no information:
Last line should produce no output.
Python command produces ImportError
MiSoC is not required for running ARTIQ, only for building firmware/gateware.
Building it with conda is no longer supported, and never was on Windows anyway.
Supporting conda flows would be expensive (here is a data point: the PSF is offering $220k for some minor improvements to pip) and the results would be poor.
Use Nix, build from source, use our low-cost firmware build service, or offer $220k to build the firmware with conda (which would likely fund a complete conda rewrite, since it's so shitty).
I was just trying to download the package to use some of the modules in it for migen simulations that I'm doing. I was building a new conda environment on my laptop because it's on Windows, so no Nix.
The old system had misoc as a conda package, and it was not clear that it had been removed. This means that MiSoC is no longer available anywhere as an easy-download package (excepting installing from source via GitHub). I wasn't aware that installing one package would require an entire conda rewrite.
Then that issue should have been filed in misoc and not artiq.
For migen there are third-party packages on anaconda.org.
I wasn't aware that installing one package would require an entire conda rewrite.
Try replicating the current build and test system but with a conda-based flow, and we'll talk about that.
And misoc has binary dependencies (LLVM-or1k, Clang, GCC-or1k, ...) to be useful so it's obviously not even "one" package.
