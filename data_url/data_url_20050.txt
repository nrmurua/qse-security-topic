There appeared pytest error:
Can you please state how to reproduce this issue? OS? docker image? command run? etc... Or is this "simply" triggered by python3.10.2? If so, which distro contains this?
After installing Python3.10.2, the error appeared. Thanks for the report. Will be fixed by #1196 .
@baentsch Thank you!
