Due to pandas==0.23.4 not being available for Python 3.4, wheel build/deploy fails on manylinux.
The last version of Pandas built for Python 3.4 is v0.19.2 from 2016.
We should drop dimod wheel building for Python 3.4. Maybe even drop support for 3.4 altogether.
Looks like the failure is for cp27-27mu, it correctly installs for cp27-27m, see docs for distinction.
I have changed the requirements to only install pandas in 3.5+, though agree we should drop 3.4 support (dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk#28). Also I accidentally pushed the change to master so no PR to close this one, oops...
I will close this issue once it's deployed.
Wheels are deployed
@arcondello, are you saying the failure is also for cp27mu? Because that pandas version fails on python 3.4 for sure.
Yes but we skipped the pandas install for python 3.4 already
