The optimized parameters in the "Entangling gate on two coupled qubits" example  are of two Gaussian pulses for 2 qubits. This is not the most general way to guarantee that we will have the solution to the optimization. Were these parameters chosen instead of piece-wise-constant pulses because there are less parameters to optimize in the C2? How do we generalize this? For example, I am trying to optimize a different 2-qubit gate and the optimization doesn't converge.
Hi @vsandinh, can you share a minimal working example or some more technical details and description of the gate you are trying to optimize which doesn't converge? That would help us understand the problem better.
There is now an example showing optimization with piece-wise constant pulses. Closed in #202
