I am seeing unexpected results for a 3-control Toffoli when I have the xacc::getIRTransformation("circuit-optimizer") enabled.  Without the "circuit-optimizer", the correct results are produced.
Here is the CCCX circuit  - it is written as an OpenQASM kernel.  It is based on this paper: Linear-Depth Quantum Circuits for n-qubit Toffoli gates with no Ancilla
Without the "circuit-optimizer", the results are what I expect:
But with the "circuit-optimizer" enabled, here is what I get:
Hey @simon-ty
I've fixed the issue. Please pull and check it out.
Yes - I can confirm that my tests are passing now.  Thanks for your good work!  Closing the issue now.
