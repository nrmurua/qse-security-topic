Although liboqs-rust is written in Rust, but liboqs isn't.
liboqs is meant to be running on as many platforms as possible with as little preconditions as possible while being maintained "economically" (read: with as few people as possible :) -> C then is the natural choice. If you think you could provide the resources to do/maintain a Rust version (for all algorithms), please let us know.

Rust compiler checks the code when developing, debugging in Rust is more economical than C. Pwn2Own is a computer hacking contest that includes contest on virtual machine escape targeting VMware and VirtualBox, debugging C/C++ code is much more expensive, it requires Pwn2Own to find virtual machine escape bugs.

Probably right. But the C code exists (and is being worked on upstream); Rust doesn't/isn't. So unless you (or anyone you know) would volunteer, this won't make our immediate task list.
liboqs-rust is not written in Rust, it is a set of bindings to the C implementations of liboqs.
Closing due to lack of resources. @dotridat feel free to reopen / provide PR if you have the bandwidth to do so.
