It would be convenient to be able to generate QMs/BQMs/Variables with labels that are guaranteed to be unique. E.g.
Should we think along the lines of a globally unique ID? We could generate those on the fly with: https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html
Or do the labels need to be integers themselves?
Yup, exactly like that I think. Are you interested in taking this one on?
Sure, I can start looking into it.
