I notice two issues related to CI as follows.
Fix numpy exact eigensolver for 1 qubit opÂ #5735 fails at CI and the message is as follows. It may be due to Sphinx parallel build.
When Run Docs failed, it did not terminate immediately and seemed to wait for the 1-hour time limit. Should it terminate when it fails?

Yeah this is an occasional failure I've seen in the docs builds. My assumption is it is due to the parallel builds as well, but I haven't had time to debug it to confirm.
This is also caused by the parallel builds, it's a bug in the jupyter sphinx plugin. When the jupyter execute fails the parallel sphinx worker never reports it's status to the parent sphinx process and the parent processs sits waiting for the response from the child process forever (until we hit the 1hr job timeout). This has been a longstanding issue with jupyter execute and I've been meaning to report it upstream (but haven't found the time to create a minimal recreate to report it).
Thank you for your information. I leave this issue for the future fix.
