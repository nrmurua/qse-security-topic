artiq_flash support for flashing NXP microprocessors such as that used on Sayma AMC.
@sbourdeauducq Commented that this is likely to be an expensive and complex project.
Completely different protocol (on UART), which may or may not be documented and may need to be reverse-engineered, existing open implementation is dysfunctional, mapping UART/JTAG may be difficult on multiple platforms, flashing MMC does not fit in existing artiq_flash architecture, problems with packaging and conda, etc. etc. lots of tedious research to do and things to sort out.
@jbqubit Are you still interested in this?
Not sure if this is a new development or not but looks like openocd advertises built-in support for the NXP LPC1776.  I'm looking at Flash Driver: lpc2000.
Yes, we used it before, it needs the internal JTAG connector.
