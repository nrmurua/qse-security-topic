Mapper tests are failing because seed was removed in favor of seed_transpiler.
The saved pickle files are preventing us from seeing the failures.
Run: python -m  test.python.transpiler.test_mappers regenerate
I think we need to re-evaluate using pickles for tests.
I think we can have another test for checking the API changes. Let me explore alternatives.
There's a fix for this in #2337 but the point about more robust testing remains to be discussed.
I do would consider this closed. We can discuss the tests in a different issue.
Closing for now since #2337 resolves the issue. We can discuss mapper testing separately.
