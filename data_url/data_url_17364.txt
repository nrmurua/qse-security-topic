The default transpiler set(s) include CheckMap, but only to determine whether or not to apply the DenseLayout pass.
It should be possible to condition the mapper pass on the value of property_set['is_swap_mapped'] . Likewise for CheckCnotDirection and CheckDirection.
This should give a compile time speed up without changing the generated circuits. Should be implemented after extraction of layout modification from mapper passes.
I will start working on this after #2316 gets merged or rejected, because they overlap.
#2316 merged... removing on hold
I think PR #2852 fixes this issue.
This is fixed by #2852 and #2883 .
#2852 and #2883 still pending... I'm reopening this.
