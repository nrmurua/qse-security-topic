BackendEstimator(backend) with backend a BackendV2 fails in BackendEstimator._transpile due to mismatched transpilation output on the diff_circuits:
Consider a minimal BackendV2 implementation, a circuit definition, transpilation and a call to the BackendEstimator on that backend:
With qiskit-terra==0.24.2, this runs as expected:
With qiskit-terra>=0.25.0 however, the transpiled layout and circuit are different, and an error occurs in BackendEstimator._transpile:
(one can disregard that the transpiler is badly configured and produces two R gates for one in the input)
The code above should execute without errors also for qiskit-terra>=0.25.0.
The issue seems to come from the transpiler filling the transpiled circuit with ancilla qubits up to backend.target.num_qubits. This is not the case in either of the tested versions for BackendV1 instances (e.g. AerSimulator).

Thank you. #10956 will fix this issue.
Great, thanks! Sorry, I had not found this PR prior to posting the issue.
