I'm not sure where this issue should go. If it's the wrong place to post it please direct me to the right one. Thanks!
Since both qiskit and Quantum Composer are stemming "from the same place", it would be nice to get a consolidation of visualizations/behavior. I currently see 3 issues:
qiskit:

composer:

The number of qsphere circumferencial dividers do not agree on both qiskit and composer (you can see that above). qiskit will produce n-1 dividers (where n is the number of qubits). However, composer will show 1 divider for 1 and 2 qubits, 3 for 3 and 4 qubits, 5 for 5  qubits (it can't show more than 5, and why? it doesn't seem to take too long to produce on qiskit).
qiskit will always remove global phase from Statevector.draw('qsphere') while composer won't. So for e.g. -|0> will be colored with 0 phase in qiskit, while in composer it will be colored as Pi phase (note however, that composer will still remove the global phase from the individual phase disc indicators at the end of each qubit wire).
