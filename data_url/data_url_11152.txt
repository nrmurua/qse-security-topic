There are tools such as VMD and Avogadro which are designed to visualize molecular orbitals and charge densities. Thus, one should be able to use these tools to visualize the 1-RDM output from molecular simulations in OpenFermion or its plugins. Such visualizations would steal the show at many of our quantum computing conferences. Imagine how awesome it would be to visualize how the wavefunction of a molecule is changing during the course of variational optimization in a VQE experiment! What is needed them in some plugin or module (together with usage instructions) which allows OpenFermion data structures to be rendered in open source visualization packages.
I think a few more specifics to this might be that one path forward might be to
@jarrodmcc Are the contraction coefficients and exponents already stored in the HDF5 files? In the example files, I see a dataset called 'basis' but it appears to simply store a string like 'sto-3g'.
