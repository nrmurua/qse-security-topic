Our Sabre implementation works by having Python-space pass a stripped-down, minimal version of the data-flow dependencies down to the Rust layer.  This involves a step where wires need to be copied into the new data structures.  For historical reasons, the way this is currently done is not by inspecting the wires of the DAGCircuit data structure, but they are re-inferred from the nodes themselves.
The two passes need updating to ensure that any wires implied by the Expr values are also taken into account.  The work will be almost identical between the two passes.
Rather than having special handling for Expr values, an alternative implementation may be to infer the data-flow dependencies from the wires in the DAG structure, rather than the nodes.
Depends on #10223, #10224, #9419 and #9421.
