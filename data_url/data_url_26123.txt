Right now, the channel_dim.py file lives in helper/ but should most likely live in channel_props/.
Attempt 1 to fix this issue led to some object not callable errors. Fixing this issue will also mean we need to tackle the pytest import issues.
if python test_some_file.py was used, there were no errors. But using pytest does cause problems.

In pytest documentation, following is recommended. This also does not fix the errors. https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/explanation/goodpractices.html#tests-outside-application-code
Need to spend more time understanding PYTHONPATH and pytest issues. Using python -m pytest does not fix the multiple errors.
Trying out a toqito/src/toqito directory with a pytest.ini file also did not fix the errors.
Specifying the full path toqito.some_module.some_file import some_func does fix the errors but this is not recommended considering other functions imported via toqito.some_module import some_func do not lead to errors.
