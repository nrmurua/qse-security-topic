GroundStateEigensolver fails with None operators in aux_operators list. In VQE there is a special check for None operators, while in GroundStateEigensolver (AdaptVQE) they are directly passed to _eval_op().
Please run the gist
In ground_state_eigensolver.py add None check to def evaluate_operators here
@MariaSapova Thanks for raising this issue! Since I am not sure whether you receive notifications when I reference this issue with a commit or PR this is a just a short heads-up that a fix is underway in #1477 👍
