I'm quite new to the package, so please forgive me if this is obvious.  Haven't been able to find anything in docs or previous issues. I'm looking to get images of quantum circuits saved.  My quirks of setup means that I'm not using notebooks.  Therefore the normal qc.png command isn't compatible.
In qutip/qip/circuit.py, the properties png() and svg() directly display in a notebook the compiled LaTeX figure of the cicuit.  I would rather be able to access the compiled image directly.
I've been looking around the codebase to see if there is native functionality for this.  We can get Bloch spheres using the kind of workflow I'm imagining:
Does anyone have any suggestions?
I think that _latex_compile() returns a bytes object, which can be interpreted as an image, but I haven't had a chance to play around with it yet.
Reference to #441.
Dear @Wheest this is more a help group question.
In any case, @quantshah do you know the answer to this?
