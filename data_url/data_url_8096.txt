Describe the bug
Hello, I test my qutip installation state  using qutip.testing.run() after importing import qutip.testing. And the result showed that AttributeError: partially initialized module 'qutip' has no attribute 'settings' (most likely due to a circular import)
To Reproduce
The terminal out put is
Expected behavior
Normally test the installation of qutip.
Your Environment
Also, I run these codes on Jupyter notebook but on my PC's terminal, I could successfully import qubit.testing and qubit.
@RunawayFancy Apologies, I'm not 100% sure which case you said worked and which didn't. Did "import qutip.testing" working in your terminal but fail in your Jupyter notebook?
@hodgestar Yes. I could import qutip.testing in my terminal but fail in Jupyter notebook. But I re-installed the qutip lib and now it could be imported successfully.
@RunawayFancy Thank you for updating & closing the issue. Glad it was sorted out easily.
@hodgestar As a proverb says: re-installing solves 99% of the problem XD.
