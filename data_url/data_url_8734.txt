If I start the network using this method:
Then I can only send qubits in the direction Alice -> Bob. I cannot send qubits in the direction  Bob -> Alice. Alternatively if I run
I can only send qubits in the direction  Bob -> Alice and not the other way.
The error is:
If instead I start  simulaqronfrom command line, this problem doesn't exist.  That is, if I run:
simulaqron start --nodes Alice,Bob --force.
Hi @stephendiadamo ! Thanks for pointing out this bug, I'm not directly sure why this is happening but would have to investigate. What's your version of simulaqron and cqc?
Thanks for the help.
The versions are:
I traced the issue to the add_node function in manage_nodes.py but wasn't sure what was going on from there.
@stephendiadamo Could you try to guard you code with a if __name__ == '__main__': check and see if it makes a difference? See also #220
I'm running the code in a test suite using nose2, so I'm not running the code in a main file. The error in #220 I don't experience, the network does start. For me it's that it's not possible to send qubits from Bob -> Alice depending on if I initialize Alice or Bob first. I see in #220 though that the topology is defined., that's something I didn't do. Maybe if I add that it'll fix the problem. I'll try it and give an update.
Ah.. Setting the topology didn't fix it.
@stephendiadamo I am unable to reproduce this issue. Could you share your full code? If you don't want to do it here you can also email me.
Here's a sample. the function "test_alice_to_bob" will work for me, but the fuction "test_bob_to_alice" will time out. What's funny is that if I change the order in the nodes array, then it works again, but only Bob -> Alice.
Hi @stephendiadamo ! I finally managed to find what was going on here. The issue was that when we start a network, we check to see if it's up and running by connecting to it using the CQCConnection, this then increased the used application IDs (this was a bug) and since the CQCConnections you then open in your example are in the same file and share this class attribute they got assigned a application ID of 3-7 or so. This is why Alice could not recieve the qubit sent from Alice, since Alice sent it to an application on node Bob with application ID 0 but Bob had something higher. You can try that this is the case by adding for example
However, this is probably not what you want but just to check that it works. Anyway the bug is now fixed in cqc version 3.0.4 which is now required by simulaqron version 3.0.8. I tested that your example works as it is in with the new versions.
Let me know if it still does not work for you.
Great thanks! The update fixed it.
I'll close the issue now.
Thanks again.
