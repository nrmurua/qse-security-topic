IBM Result wrapper for batch jobs returns a list of measurement counts, but the plot counts method is only implemented to expect a single dictionary of counts. Need to update the plot counts function to allow a list of dictionary counts as input, and either plot all on the same graph, or plot four separate graphs. Or, allow user to specify which measurement counts dict in list to plot.
