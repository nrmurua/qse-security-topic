https://www.cp2k.org/dev:compiler_support only shows the trunk support
It would be really helpful to have a version of this page for the latest official released version.

That makes sense. I will add this information for the next release. Anyway, I would assume that a compiler version which is valid for the trunk is also valid for the latest CP2K release.
We could make copying the table a task on our release checklist.
I have updated the table, showing the "last commit tested" and highlighting what versions are currently tested in the dashboard. I think this is enough to close the issue (official release can be taken from the github commits). Please reopen if you have comments.
