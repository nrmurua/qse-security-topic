Description
Relabeling can create BQMs that are inconsistent with generated BQMs:
In comparison:
Expected Behavior
Consistent treatment of a variable set in multiple places. For the given example, it's noticeable, but in relabeling large numbers of variables in a big BQM, this might not end well
Environment
dimod version here is 0.10.10
Also {'c': 1, 'c': 2} in your second example is just {'c': 2}. You can get something similar to what you're looking for with bqm.contract_variables('a', 'b').
