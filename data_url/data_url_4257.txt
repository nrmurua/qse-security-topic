The most important condition that hash functions must satisfy is a == b implies hash(a) == hash(b), but the BasicQubit class doesn't meet it:
The existing tests are checking for inequality instead of equality, i.e. that a != b implies hash(a) != hash(b). Which is actually not a requirement of hash functions at all, though it matters for performance.
While the hash would remain inconsistent, we could add support for all cases where id != -1 without any further changes.
Alternatively, we can substitute the MainEngine's WeakSet with some other data structure...
