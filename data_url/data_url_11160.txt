The README says that Dirac is supported, but all examples in OpenFermion-Dirac break: bsenjean/Openfermion-Dirac#6
I've left a comment on the OpenFermion-DIRAC repository (bsenjean/Openfermion-Dirac#6 (comment))
eigenspectrum was moved from utils to linalg.sparse_tools.py. This change needs to occur for almost all examples in OF-DIRAC.
@bsenjean can you make this small change?
This is fixed ;)
Thanks!
