It can be a bit finnicky to trigger this one. It might also only be happening because another error is happening first.
Position the gate like so:
-H--
And carefully drag it just past the left of the circuit and let go.
Error: Bad pos
Details: {"pos": null, "heldGate": Gate(H), "heldGateOffset": (x: 9.5, y: 23.5)}
