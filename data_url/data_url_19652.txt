Let us consider the problem of testing non-locality (and eventually, entanglement),
without making any assumptions on the system (such as what optimal control does).
Within approach [1-2] that's independent of any particular Bell inequalities
and allows to investigate different multipartite and multisetting scenarios.
To perform a typical Bell experiment we'll need:
Executing circuits with measurements provides the quantum correlations ${p(results|measurements)}$.
According to Bell theorem: the correlations of some entangled states can't be described by local realistic models. We can check the feasibility of a classical model by solving LP problem.
Infeasibility means that Bell nonlocality was detected and measured correlations can't be simulated classically. Also the entanglement of a qubit state can be proven that way.
We'd like to implement:
The non-locality strength can be understood as resistance to noise and defined as the amount of
white noise admixture required to completely suppress the nonclassical character of the original quantum correlations.
The calculation of strength is based on visibility parameter v in $\rho(v)= v\rho +(1-v)white noise$.
Solving an optimization problem (LP), in which we maximize the visibility until the set of linear constraints can no longer be satisfied, returns a critical visibility parameter [1-2], while nonlocality strength = 1 - critical visibility.
