Is it possible to build xacc on windows?
Hi @aswanthkrishna,
At the moment, we don't support native Windows build, e.g., using the MSVC compiler.
However, if you are using Windows 10, you can enable WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) feature and you can compile and use XACC within WSL.
The build procedure for WSL is the same as that of the corresponding Linux distro.
If you prefer an IDE environment, you can consider installing Docker WSL backend.
With Docker installed on Windows, you can use built-in Eclipse Theia IDE by clicking the Gitpod icon under XACC QuickStart.
Thank you @tnguyen-ornl
I want to freeze my program as an exe file and run on windows. Is it possible?
Really appreciate all your help!
Unfortunately, we don't support native Windows build, so you cannot create a .exe file from XACC on Windows.
I think the only way to get something like this is to package your application as a docker image with an appropriate entry point defined. You could then provide you application as a script that executes the correct docker commands.
Thank you @amccaskey . I will try to do that.
