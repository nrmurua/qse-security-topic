Hi,
I wanted to try TFQ and I have encountered the following problem: when running even a very simple program involving TFQ (e.g. a sample copied from the Internet), it causes memory allocation errors in the standard C/C++ library. Python interpreter is aborted. A sample program I was using (copied from Issue #284 for example):
When run, I see the following output:
When I use gdb to print the stack at this error, I see:
so indeed, the error is raised during memory allocation inside TFQ. The same error is produced in Windows. Both platforms I use are 64-bit and I have the following library versions (all updated by pip):
python 3.7.7
Tensorflow 2.2.0
Tensorflow Quantum 0.3.0
CirQ 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 (tried both)
SymPy 1.4
I have been looking for a solution but found nothing similar. I would be very grateful for some hints on how to overcome this problem.
Best regards,
Adam
Thanks Adam for the detailed issue, from the GDB stack trace it looks like this might be an ABI issue between TFQ and the version of TensorFlow you have installed (since I can't find much about any TFQ logic in the trace). TensorFlow 2 doesn't have guaranteed ABI stability between versions so we unfortunately need all of our users to have 2.1.0 installed. Could you try downgrading to TensorFlow 2.1.0 and see if that fixes the issue ?
Thanks a lot! ABI incompatibility could indeed be the reason. I will install Tensorflow 2.1.0 and let you know.
Hi,
I have checked that indeed downgrading Tensorflow to 2.1.0 (e.g. with pip install -I tensorflow==2.1.0) solves the problem. Thanks!
Best regards,
Adam
