Motivated by #138, #134 and #135:
Add an example of QBSolv use with EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler()) for subproblems solver. The example could go under the Introduction section and/or the QBSolv.sample() section.
The EmbeddingComposite should not be used by QBSolv, the FixedEmbeddingComposite is preferred. See

Trying to wrap my head around this example...You are using a complete graph for the subproblem so that it can represent any problem. Is that realistic or efficient in production? Is this the only way to split the problem?
