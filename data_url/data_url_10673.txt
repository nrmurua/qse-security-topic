Current Problem
When working with overlap embeddings (embeddings where overlapping chains are permitted), MissingEdgeErrors are being thrown when edges are not missing.
Proposed Solution
Rework dwave.embedding.diagnose_embedding(...):
Alternatives Considered
One can write a function to test the validity of each MissingEdgeErrors if they are working with overlapped embeddings.
