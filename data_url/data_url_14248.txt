Some IBM backends (i.e., ibmq_kolkata but not FakeKolkata) are exposing GaussianSquareDrag pulses for cross resonance (on some qubit pairs) instead of the previously-reported GaussianSquare pulses, which are not recognized by calibration builders that do pulse scaling (i.e., RZXCalibrationBuilder).
yields
an echoed cross resonance GaussianSquareDrag pulse on ControlChannel(10).
When one tries to use the RZXCalibrationBuilder, for example, this pair will fail.
yields
Now trying to attach a pulse fails, because
raises
This is because GaussianSquareDrag is not in valid_types in rzx_builder.py because it scaling it is undefined.
A qubit pair ([0, 1]) with the original GaussianSquare pulses work:
yields
as should the pairs with GaussianSquareDrag.
The area under the curve should scale the same way as for GaussianSquare pulses for the square part of the pulse, the difference being in the risefall of the pulse, which takes a form different than the error function used to calculated the area under the risefall for the GaussianSquare pulse.
