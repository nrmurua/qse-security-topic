We are planning to drop support for Python 2.7 in qutip version 5
Hence the next version, 4.3, will be the last support Python 2.7.
There are many reasons for this.
It is is in line with what Numpy are planning as well, which is one of the main ones.
Please feel free to discuss here.

By the way, here's the pip installs for qutip from PyPI for June 2018, showing Python 2.7 is already dropping off:

Version 4.4.1 does not support Python 2 any more.
