Remove the VariationalAlgorithm base class, since it's not used anywhere but VQE. If we realize that it's needed for typing (see in Qiskit Nature, which currently accesses VariationalAlgorithm.initial_point), reduce it to an interface and not a base-class with functionality.
@Cryoris Is this issue needed anymore - this was done by the Stateless VQE PR was it not?
Yep -- it was reduced to an interface 👍🏻
