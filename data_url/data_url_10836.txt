To Reproduce
With penaltymodel-mip==0.2.2, the above script raises an ImpossiblePenaltyModel exception, while with penaltymodel-maxgap==0.5.2 I get a BQM.
Expected behavior
I would expect to get a BQM equivalent to
or for get_penalty_model to return None, signifying that it cannot be found by mip
Environment:
At the moment, I'm not sure if the issue is with mip or with maxgap. When putting the pmodel into an empty bqm, and then applying the ExactSolver, it seems that the gap produced with maxgap's BQM does not meet the default of 2.
I think it would be easier to see with print(sampleset) but since all 8 configurations of the decision variables have a specified energy, there is not really a notion of "infeasible gap" for this penaltymodel. Probably that's what's broken.
