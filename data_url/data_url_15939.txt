Invoking the function retworkx.weakly_connected_components on the attached DAG gives different results, depending on whether it's the original DAG or the DAG is first converted to a circuit and back
(Interestingly the answer is correct only after I do the round-trip, not on the original DAG)

Yeah, it definitely looks like the round trip converter is dropping an edges somewhere, for reference the dag before the conversion:

and after running circuit_to_dag(dag_to_circuit(dag)):

Ok after investigating with @mtreinish it looks like the original DAG was malformed (kind of obvious from the picture above too). So this is not a Qiskit issue. It would be nice if Qiskit was able to validate the DAGs though (in particular how data flows through them, all data should start in green nodes and end in red nodes).
