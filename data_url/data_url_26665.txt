CALL fill_rho_set(rho_set_h, lsd, nspins, needs, rho_h, drho_h, tau_h, na, ir)
disassociated pointer tau_h is referenced.
You may double check by prepending
CPASSERT(associated(tau_h))
seems like needs%tau was never set to .TRUE., otherwise we should've seen segfaults in fill_rho_set.
Fixed via #1309.
