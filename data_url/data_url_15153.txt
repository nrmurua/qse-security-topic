This should fail because h is not in the basis_gates for the fake (and real) backend:
Run above
The fake backends should behave in a similar manner to the real system from which they are derived. As such, sending circuits with gates not in the basis_gates should raise an error to transpile first.
This is also problematic as the underlying error model does not act on gates outside of the basis set.
