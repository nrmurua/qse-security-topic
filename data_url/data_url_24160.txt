When variables are defined in Metal and properties are assigned to them, the assignment doesn't propagate properly into Ansys. In the example below, Ljx and Cjx (where x is 1, 2) are defined within Metal, and the junction inductances/capacitances are assigned to them, as is clear from the QGeometry table. However, when we look in Ansys the junctions don't inherit those values although the design variables themselves are present and correct.




In a newly opened eigenmode design, define variables as shown above, perform run_sim(), and look at the corresponding inductance/capacitance values in Ansys.
The inductance/capacitance values ought to be whatever we set them to in Metal.
Move part of self._analyze() (within run_sim() in sim_eigenmode.py) before the rendering step so that all variables are defined before assignment. Maybe use activate_ansys_setup instead of new_ansys_setup?
