The valgrind tests are too slow, especially with SPHINC+ schemes (#118).
I would propose doing the following:
I had tried to design the helpers.permit_test function in so that we could use a single function to control which tests to run, without having to make changes in every test file.  So perhaps we can make a list in that function of slow tests and then do the check you are proposing.
Yeah, I tried to set that up in #117 but it's not completely working yet (I think).
Also causing problems for #112
Fixed by #147
