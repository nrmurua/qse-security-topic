After introducing poetry, rtd is failing with:
because it doesn't install the docs dependencies:
Sounds like our toml is fully poetry centric (we do not define a docs parameter) therefore it fails.
If possible I would like to keep rtd for future releases until we have a complete centralized web page.
@alecandido any suggestion?
Poetry has its own features, like dev dependencies (potentially grouped), and we are using that.
But of course it also supports pip features, like extras.
However, it is possible also to use Poetry features on rtd, through custom (documented) commands.
So, we have two options:
I believe that 2. would minimize the effort, since we'd have to maintain a single set of docs deps, and a single installation procedure.
But in the end both of the options are viable, and supposed to work :)
Thanks, option 2 works great!
