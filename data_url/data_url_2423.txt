There are a lot of very common things you want to do especially in variational algorithms for lattice type models.
This sounds familiar to what @bryano  has been working on.
I think this is obsoleted by GridQubit.rect existing and general python functionality for looping when creating circuits. Getting into sub-lattices is probably too specialized.
