Adding a My Binder badge in the Readme file will allow prospective users to try out the software without installing anything locally. I tried it and it works, thanks to the new package structure, with the requirements.txt file in the topmost folder.
Pasting this in README.md should suffice:

(this is how it looks like: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/watermarkhu/OpenSurfaceSim/master))
To be most effective, the My Binder link could point directly to a tutorial, e.g. in the form of a Jupyter notebook, or to a script (using Jupyter Labs as My Binder default). Happy to help in this with PR or feedback along the way.
Done in #30
