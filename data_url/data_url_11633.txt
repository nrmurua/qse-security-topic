qiskit.__qiskit_version__
returns
Additionally, when running this code from the website:
returns this error, which I assume is related, but it confuses me that it managed to run the second import statement but not the third:
Run the code listed above
qiskit-aqua should return an actual version.
Thank you for your report. The error message says that Ignis uses cvxpy, but it is not installed.
Workaround is to install cvxpy pip install cvxpy.
Aqua's requirements.txt should include "qiskit-ignis[cvx]" according to Ignis readme.

I also found that if cvxpy is not installed, from qiskit import aqua fails as follow. This is the reason why aqua version is None.
This is a duplicate of qiskit-community/qiskit-ignis#429 it unfortunately looks like an aqua bug because aqua imports ignis in places. But the 0.3.3 ignis release and the corresponding metapackage release 0.19.6 (which are working their way through CI and automation right now) should fix this.
The qiskit 0.19.6 metapackage release (which includes ignis 0.3.3) is released now it should correct this issue
__qiskit_version__ returns:
and the test script returns:
[1, -2, 3]
I'm going to close this as fixed now, please feel free to reopen it if I missed something.
