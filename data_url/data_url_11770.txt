When using TruthTableOracle, the parameter "mct_mode" is ignored (ie the mct is decomposed the same way whatever the mode is).
The mct_mode parameter should determine the mct used (in particular, when using "noancilla", the circuit should not use ancillas).
Edit the circuit construction
(It seems changing
into
in truth_table_oracle.py, l. 331, is enough)
@mtillet many thanks for catching this :)
