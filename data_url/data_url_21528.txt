Returning a TTuple containing mixed types from the kernel results in a compilation error.
The following code will trigger the compilation unification error.
Expect the program to compile and allow mixed tuple types. The program works when returning a tuple of multiple of the same type or TTuple([TInt32, TInt64])
The result is a compilation unification error. This happens when attempting to mix TInt32 and TBool, TInt32 and TFloat, and likely other untested combinations. However, combining TInt32 and TInt64 works as expected.
Just to add, this error occurs only when TTuple is used in the annotation of a return value. When used to annotate function arguments, there seems to be no problem. Also, not typing the return value (i.e. fully rely on type inference of the compiler) seems to work fine and is probably the easiest workaround.
Should this AST be correct?

Should be fixed in #2164.
