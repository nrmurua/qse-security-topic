OpenQL has support for default gates which are hard coded. In case of a configuration mistake (e.g. typo in gate name), the compiler falls back on default gates without notifying the user. As a result, the QASM output could be scheduled with wrong gate times without the user being aware of it.
Proposed solution:
Provided an option to disable default gates. Without fall back behavior a configuration mistake can lead to a compile error which will be obvious for the user.
Alternative solution:
Remove default gates completely. The user is responsible for defining all gates. Prevents OpenQL developers from maintaining gate times for default gates.
@lriesebos  Based on 09b9c7e,  OpenQL options can be set/get by using set_option and get_option. print_options prints the list of available options. One of the option is use_default_gates which can be set to "no" to disable use of default gates.
New options work as expected!
