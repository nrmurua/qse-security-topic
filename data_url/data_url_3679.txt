@stevenheidel I opened this because it's been on my sprint TODO list. Should we provide a convenience method in Job to pull out the metadata from raw if it exists?
Yes, any metadata that's sent back should have nice methods to retrieve it. It would be a good idea to change raw to _raw to reflect that there are better methods available. If you work on this can you make that change as well?
Yup, I can do that. What should be the behavior when metadata is missing from _raw such as for QVM results? Should we raise an exception or return None.
Probably just returning None is safer
