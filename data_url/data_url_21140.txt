For reasons I haven't yet figured out the Julia and MATLAB resonator fit routines give different answers, especially for resonators at low power. I'd use the Julia code with caution for now.
Wildly different, or off by a simple factor?
Yeah, the Julia code will often fit to a negative Q_internal.
Okay, it should be fixed now.
