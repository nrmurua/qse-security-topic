Currently, transpiling circuits between Qiskit and Amazon Braket requires going through Cirq as an intermediate conversion. Now that Amazon Braket supports converting circuits to/from OpenQASM 3, we can setup a direct link for conversions between qiskit and braket. Will eventually integrate with #359
Qiskit $\leftrightarrow$ Amazon Braket
Current:
qiskit $\leftrightarrow$ qasm2 $\leftrightarrow$ cirq $\leftrightarrow$ braket
Desired:
qiskit $\leftrightarrow$ qasm3 $\leftrightarrow$ braket
Hi @ryanhill1 , I see that qiskit-braket-provider package has already achieved this conversion. Specifically convert_qiskit_to_braket_circuit does exactly what is required here, just directly and not through openqasm3. I think #359 can also benefit from this.
We can leverage/take inspiration from that to make our own converters. Let me know what you think about this.
@TheGupta2012 Yep that sounds great!
