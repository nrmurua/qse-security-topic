Once qsim has released a new github version that contains multi qubit controlled gate support we should look into supporting over here in TFQ. This will roughly entail:
1. Opening a PR to upgrade from qsim 0.3.1 -> 0.6.0
2. Adding serialization primitives to serializer.py for multi qubit gates and corresponding tests.
3. Hooking up new serialization primitives in underlying C++ and other ops.
xref for adding gates: #257
@we-taper has indicated some interest in tackling this and I'll be happy to help out when I can!
