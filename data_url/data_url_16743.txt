When drawing  a circuit containing a controlled Hadamard gate (output='mpl'), the coloring it displays is blue for the box and purple for the control line.
Draw a circuit containing a controlled Hadamard gate.
Consistent coloring.
I would suggest using blue everywhere so that it is consistent with two qubit control gates such as CNOT.
