It seems odd that MajoranaOperator is not a sub-class of SymbolicOperator. A notable side effect is that contrary to QubitOperator and other SymbolicOperators, MajoranaOperator does not auto-remove terms that are below EQ_TOLERANCE. Not the end of the world but a strange inconsistency...
SymbolicOperator stores (index, action) pairs. For MajoranaOperator, there is no action, so it does not quite map onto the SymbolicOperator class.
