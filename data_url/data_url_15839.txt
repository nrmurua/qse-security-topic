The QuantumInstance class can be supplied with a measurement_error_mitigation_cls (for example a CompleteMeasFitter). When executing the QuantumInstance then automatically a measurement error calibration will be performed and applied to any measurement result. This does require execution of the measurement error calibrations each time a QuantumInstance is used.
It should be possible to pass a user-defined measurement error migitation object (e.g. a pre-defined CompleteMeasFitter) to the QuantumInstance.
QuantumInstance is now deprecated and will soon be removed. Error mitigation is now done by IBM Qiskit Runtime primtives. Hence I am closing this since its no longer relevant as no further work will be done on QuantumInstance.
