Dear Everyone,
Thanks for the great job with Qutip package. I am amazed by the package and how various models and techniques are implemented on it.
I have been using the time-dependent bloch-redfield solver lately and the runtime is superb when I convert all the Hamiltonian and the collapse operators to string format, and use the solver option reuse_rhs=True.
I really wish I could run sweeps over the bath parameters while still retaining the original Hamiltonian without having to recompile it. It would be nice if you could extend the scope of args so that bath parameters could also be passed as arguments of the call.
The second issue is that the cython file that the brmesolver creates is missing the import scypi.spe, that is the special functions from Scipy. One needs to add the following lines to the BR_codegen:
import scipy.special as spe
cimport scipy.special as spe
