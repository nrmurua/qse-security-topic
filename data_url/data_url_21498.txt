I get an error when flashing kasli using nix openocd from nix-scripts master -- see below for error. I see the same error across several Kasli v1.1 known to work.Details are in the Forum here.
On branch 988d411946 the open-ocd version is Open On-Chip Debugger 0.10.0-snapshot (2021-07-26-23:34). And artiq_flash succeeds.
Probably nix-scripts needs to revert to using the m-labs 0.10.0 version of openocd.

We've been using the patched 0.11 to flash a substantial number of Kasli of various versions, so it's not that simple...
I'm using Kasli v1.1. Which according to the schematic has S25FL128S flash. It looks like the openocd probe reports a different flash chipset: Cypress s25fl256s flash.
The current openocd patch doesn't reference either version of the Cypress flash.
Confirmed that the Kasli v1.1 PCB in my lab is stuffed with s25fl256s.

Found a board here with the same flash that exhibits the issue. https://git.m-labs.hk/M-Labs/nix-scripts/commit/575ef05cd554c239e4cc8cb97ae4611db458a80d
Confirmed that this works on my hardware. Thanks!!
