When running the following code, I got backend ... not available error.
But when I queried the available backends, with pprint as below, I can run the code.
This patch removed qiskit.backends.discover_remote_backends(self.__api) in QuantumProgram.set_api. That's why users cannot run any program on the remote backends without calling available_backends.
Qiskit/qiskit@ace23ec
@diego-plan9 we can add this back to set_api so these work. I actually thought we did i check in the qiskit core and see.
@rraymondhp  can you check with 0.4.13 this should be fixed now.
@jaygambetta  Thanks! I have checked that it works with producing deprecated warnings for one or two tutorials.
I will close this issue once I have confirmed all tutorials work.
Confirmed that the latest version is compatible with old tutorials.
