Hi,
I'm trying to run the QSVM algorithm and I'm facing the following error message:
"FAILURE: Can not get job id, Resubmit the qobj to get job id.Error: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://api.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/Network/ibm-q/Groups/open/Projects/main/Jobs?access_token=.... NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES, Error code: NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES. "
I see that I still have credits and I'm running a   python file locally with the code.
Sometimes its seems the backend reports that no credits are available. Something very similar is often reported to us as an issue. The logic in Aqua re-retries if errors occur during circuit execution that it believes are recoverable. Since credits renew it re-retries so you may see this message repeat until it is ultimately  successful. Do you still have any issue - if not then this can be closed.
The circuits that QSVM is generating are fine. To run experiments (circuits) on the backend you need credits. Credits allow a certain number of experiments/circuits to be run before the credits are used up and the backend device will give back the credits not available message and refuse to run them.
Sometimes it seems that users say they have credits yet the backend device gives this message. Ultimately Aqua sees the message and keeps trying expecting that you will be given more credits in a while. There is nothing much that Aqua can do - either retry submitting the circuits, as we do now, or stop the algorithm completely.
If you find inconsistency between the error messages from the backend saying you have no credits, while elsewhere it reports you do have credits, then perhaps send a message to the ibm-q-systems channel on the public Qiskit Slack workspace reporting this. (There is a link to Slack to get an invite on the qiskit.org home page in the section at the bottom 'Where to find us')
