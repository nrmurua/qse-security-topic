At the moment the concept of 'depends_on' and 'inferred' from exists for Paramspecs, 'setpoints' can be specified when registering a Parameter to a measurement. However the concept of a parameter or measurement depending on another measurement does not exist.
Specifically I would like to be able to take stored data and analyse it, saving an 'analysis' dataset which has in it a reference to the 'raw data'. It would be great to be able to have a reference to a whole dataset but also individually to a certain row of that dataset and perhaps a standard way to record by means of something similar to a parameter. Discussion, ideas, implementation welcome
