Gmsh renderer fails to assign physical group to dielectric volumes due to a bug in one of the if statements within the assign_physical_groups method in the code.
Render any QGeometry using the QGmshRenderer and open Tools > Visibility, change to Physical Groups in the drop down menu. We'll not see any volume corresponding to dielectric layers due to this bug.
It should assign the physical groups to dielectric volumes.
Fix upcoming in a new PR.
