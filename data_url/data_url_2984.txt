Example program:
Output (with run-time error):
Possible explanation:
Simulator doesn't expect that there might be no gate (as in case of identity).
Ah, the confusion here is because the error message is including the "try_cast" result instead of the original result. It's complaining that it doesn't know how to turn a Hadamard into one of the xmon operations.
The tricky thing about the Hadamard is that it decomposes into two Xmon operations instead of one, so it doesn't fit into the "just cast to a different thing" concept.
Fixing this involves:
Thanks for the explanations. So the problem was not a missing gate, but Hadamard. Title gets updated.
@Strilanc  I'm going to submit a temporary fix which is to just make H a composite gate.  The problem is at the heart of why I've been advocating for a concept of a gate set.  "Composite" is a gate set decomposition problem, and right now we don't clearly delineate this.  I think adding "automatic single-qubit-operation" decomposition is a bad idea because it hides this decomposition logic.  If we are more explicit about gate sets, then having such logic for a particular gate set makes a lot of sense, otherwise it is hidden magic.
+1 for gate sets.
Fixed by #193
We should open a separate issue for the gate set thing.
