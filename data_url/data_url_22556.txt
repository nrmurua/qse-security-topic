On Windows, the process stays around after the main window is closed.
This happens intermittently, and it gets stuck here:
https://github.com/python/asyncio/blob/53edb85e6e08765008595a39eb28b4c544baa326/asyncio/windows_events.py#L741
Applets are also affected. Looks like a quamash or asyncio bug, or some issue with Subscriber.
Fixed by upgrading quamash.
