I noticed that there is currently no D-part availble (it is even disabled in the FPGA design) in the PID controller. Is there any particular reason for this?
I could find the commit in which this was introduced (8228109) but not any specific information in the commit message.
Thanks for the nice project and any useful hint!
I am also having the same problem trying to use a differentiator in the board, but not able to do so. I tried to bring back the codes that was commented out but it seems that those were commented out a long time ago and the gain register doesn't allow me to set at correct frequency and instead assigned something like 1e-4Hz. Is there any reason the derivative was taken down?
Ah it really looks like it's disabled on the hardware level. Even though everything in the pid class seems to work fine but the derivative doesn't do anything.
