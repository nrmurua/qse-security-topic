When we create Target from the legacy models with Target.from_configuration, it doesn't work with circuit scheduler.
A factory method Target.from_configuration introduced in 0.24 doesn't handle measurement instructions properly. This method only creates instruction entries for basis gates, however, IBM backends don't contain "measure" in the basis gates.
This causes a bug in the circuit scheduler chain.
The last line raises
because of the missing measure instruction. Even if we manually add "measure" to the basis gates, scheduler chain doesn't work because the factory method only checks the gate length property, i.e. "measure" duration is separately provided from gate length in IBM Provider model.

Target should have filled InstructionProperties for measure instructions.
The logic I implemented for IBM Provider is robust to missing operations in basis gates.

Oh, this is a big oversight in the constructor method, you're right from_configuration completely overlooks that in the old data model measure was implicitly available on all qubits. We need to be adding measure by default to the output Target in all cases when from_configuration is used.
@nkanazawa1989 , can I try solving this issue?
I have got permission to work on this issue, so I am currently working on this issue :)
