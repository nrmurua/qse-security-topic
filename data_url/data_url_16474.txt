Thanks to @1ucian0 for help investigating.
I think this happens because the parser doesn't recognize what to do at the recurrence of PI right after NNINTEGER. A quick fix I found for this was to add an additional regex match in the tokens for strings starting with a number and ending with "pi". Doing that little patch, it worked fine for the examples I'd tested it on.
Something like this: obliviateandsurrender@06d8b91
Perhaps modding here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/aa96d9e60ff2b725415f93ed4ad9ba046934b6cb/qiskit/circuit/tools/pi_check.py#L75
Since qiskit won't be the only thing needing to read the qasm, it's probably better to alter the output though pi_check then making reading qasm more complicated.
Can this now be closed?
