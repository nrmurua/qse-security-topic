Some tests rely on previous executions introducing non-deterministic failures from time to time.
These three tests need QE access to gain access to the backends and then filter the jobs there without preparation (without sending a deterministic set of jobs in advance). They rely on the jobs sent by previous executions of the test suite to work.
Can you clarify a bit? I don't see the reliance on previous executions from that example.
Clarified in the description.
I pretty sure that this issue does not apply any more. At least not to terra. @delapuente feel free to reopen if im wrong...
