In qasm3.g4, the creg type is defined the same way as bit, so it takes its designator immediately after the type name, e.g.
This is inconsistent with qreg in both 2.0 and 3.0, and creg in 2.0, all of which have the designator after the identifier:
This just seems to be an oversight, since the new types (bit, qubit, float, etc) all take the designator immediately after the type.
n/a
3.0 should be consistent with 2.0
Make the creg definition of 3.0 the same as how qreg is defined.
Actually this isn't the case - the implicit token 'creg' is defined in more than one place in the grammar, and I missed that.  I was concerned with the definition of bitType, but that is actually only used in function calls and returns, not in declarations, which use bitDeclaration instead.
