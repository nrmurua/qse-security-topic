Adapt backends to consume the new QObj format and produce the new Result format.
Version 1.0.0 of qobj was run directly on a backend and appears to return results. Still to do is to more testing with a range of qobj input, complete setup of a queue on a test device, connect queue to front end.

Removing "update the local C++ simulators for fully using Qobj (#664)" since it has been moved out of 0.6.
can this be changed to 0.7
