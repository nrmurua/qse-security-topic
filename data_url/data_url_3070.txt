The quil gates CCNOT and CONTROLLED CNOT are equivalent and therefore should render the same LaTeX diagrams, however, they don't. CCNOT abstracts away which qubit is the control and which are the targets suggesting that CCNOT may have yet to be implemented. The diagrams associated with the following pyQuil programs are produced.


To reproduce, use the to_latex method in the pyquil.latex module. See below for the code snippet and toggle comments between CCNOT and CNOT lines.
