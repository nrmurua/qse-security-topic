I'm running the following experiment,
And I can see the LED flashing twice but get the following error,
I can change the experiment to just having the LED flash once and that works as well, so it seems like the experiment running but I'mnot sure what the error means.
Can you run artiq_corelog in the device DB folder after you have got this error?
Are you using master/2.x runtime/bitstream with 1.0rc2 compiler? This may cause problems.
Do you mean open a separate terminal and run artiq_corelog?
If so, I get,
Linux
Windows
Do not mix major versions.
As for the other Windows error, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30539882/whats-the-deal-with-python-3-4-unicode-different-languages-and-windows/30551552
Reproduced when mixing 1.x/2.x, works fine otherwise. Again don't do that.
Okay, thanks. I was generating the bitstream on the virtual device and trying to run it on Windows using the version in conda but I guess I should just install it from github.
There are two conda channels/labels, "dev" with 2.0.dev/master and "main" with 1.0rc2/release-1.
Why do you want to use the development version?
