Run the following code
No memory allocation errors
Removing
qc1.measure(0,0)
avoids the runtime error. However, we don't get the desired density matrix after the measurement.
Thank you for your reporting. I was not able to reproduce your situation with the latest version (0.11.0) on MacOS 12.6.
Do you observe this error in the latest code?
@hhorii the code did run to completion on my side with 'qiskit': '0.38.0' and 'qiskit-aer': '0.11.0'
@v-r0 Thanks. Please let reopen this issue (or create a new issue) if this problem is happened again.
