I simply ran a circuit which does not perform any measurements. On the returned results, get_counts() crashes because an empty dictionary is passed into the Count constructor and the constructor tries to iterate on the empty dictionary.
I tried this on an older version, Terra 0.14.2, which instead of Count uses postprocess.format_counts(), which simply ignores the empty dictionary and returns an empty dictionary in this case. This did not crash.
Run any circuit without calling measure(), then try to apply get_counts() to the results.
get_counts() should return an empty dictionary (and not crash).
A simple check for an empty dictionary in the Count constructor would be sufficient, I think.
