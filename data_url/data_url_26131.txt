Pytest coverage is marking some lines as uncovered through tests. Either have pytest ignore these lines or add tests for these lines.
Ideally, these should all be covered. I think writing tests to cover all of these items is probably a mult-issue type of thing, but I would opt to (eventually) have them covered as opposed to ignoring them (as these are actual gaps in the present testing framework).

Option 1: Would you prefer to create an issue for each? Hovering over each item lets me create a separate issue.
Option 2: Or you mean multi PR type of thing instead? We can use this issue to link all the different PRs.
That's neat that you can create an issue from the list here that you created. Honestly, in that case, I think the consolidated list you have here could just stay as it is. If/when we are able to address the coverage issues for a given test, we can convert the item in question to an issue and close it out. Capturing it all here is great though!
