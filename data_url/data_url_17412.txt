Currently DeviceSpecification cannot receive u_channel_lo from backend.  It is not a list of float (see spec p.32), and LO is not configurable. Currently device.q[0].control.lo_freq cannot show any LO frequency information.
To get  u_channel_lo from BackendConfiguration, #2116 should be fixed first.
