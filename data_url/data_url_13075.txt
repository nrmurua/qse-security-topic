When RTD is displayed in dark mode, some of the images with dark borders appear cutoff. Those with white backgrounds and dark borders also appear cutoff and a little bit squashed.
Here's a comparison for one of the CDR images.
 
I'm not totally sure what the solution here is. Do you think the white background should be extended further around the image so the black background from dark-mode doesn't butt right up against the image?
Yeah, I was thinking it would be better to increase the dimensions of the white background. And make this background consistent for all images in the documentation.
There are some images without a solid white background layer as well. They appear dim in dark mode (couldn't think of a better term) which I guess is the intention of dark mode.
