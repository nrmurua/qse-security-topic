Dear All,
I am a Mac user and I want to run some experiments/simulations using __QWalk(). I understand that a BLAS library is needed in order to run __QWalk() and that uploading BLAS on Liquid is only available on Windows.
I have executed the command mono Liquid.exe "__QWalk(x)" where x is a valid parameter and I have certainly obtained some results. For instance, I ran mono Liquid.exe "__QWalk(tree)" and the results I got have been attached to this message (Liquid.log.txt file)
Liquid.log.txt
My question is: I do not know if running __QWalk() without a BLAS libray actually has a negative impact (that is, errors) on the results I get. Would you please be so kind as to share with me anything you know about the accuracy of running __QWalk() without a BLAS library?
Thank you very much in advance!

@svenegas BLAS isn't required to run __QWalk. It is only used to compute page rank.
You should see a line in your output with a message something like:
loadBLAS Failed: Unable to LoadLibrary(libopenblas.dll): 0x........ [A required library was not found]
This prevents Liquid from performing the page rank calculation, but everything else should work fine.
Thank you very much indeed for your reply, alan-geller.
I have borrowed a Windows machine, I have downloaded OpenBLAS-v0.2.19-Win64-int32 and have copied libopenblas.dll in c:\Liquid\bin
Now, I get an error message asking for libgcc_s_seh-1.dll and I do not know what to do. I am not acquainted with OPENBLAS installation or usage. Would it be possible to have access to a step-by-step guide to install and run OPENBLAS?
Thank you very much in advance,
Salvador
@svenegas There is some information on BLAS the Getting Started page: https://github.com/StationQ/Liquid/blob/master/GettingStarted.md#blas-optional.
Sorry for the delay in my reply, I have been having fun with BLAS :)
Thank you very much for your help, I appreciate it.
Best,
Salvador
