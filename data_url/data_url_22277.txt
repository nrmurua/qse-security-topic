In installing artiq v2 on a new system (Ubuntu 16.04), I found that I needed to deviate from the manual as follows:
The llvmlite version needed to be updated to 3.9 (from 3.8):
git checkout artiq-3.9
Needed to install llvmlite to complete  "Preparing the core device FPGA board". The instructions, along with pygit2, are later in the manual. Move them earlier or did I mess up?
Ubuntu 16.04 differences:
-- pygit2 version is 0.24.1 (matching libgit2-dev version) and pip (pip3 is not installed by default) works fine with Python3.5: python3.5 which pip install --user pygit2==0.24.1
-- Needed to install cmake, cargo, and  libgit2-dev. Not absolutely sure if the last was needed, but I installed it to figure out the pygit2 version number.
-- Joe Britton also recommended installing build-essential in case the system did not have the appropriate build tools selected during Ubuntu install.
Actually, this shouldn't be the case. I've rolled back all 3.9 changes. What prompted you to switch to 3.9?
I think there's some issue where things are imported too eagerly.
-- Needed to install cmake, cargo, and libgit2-dev. Not absolutely sure if the last was needed, but I installed it to figure out the pygit2 version number.
Why did you need libgit2-dev? There's already libgit2 as well as pygit2 packaged in conda. Cargo is in conda too (although the manual needs to be updated for that, I guess).
I cannot compile llvmlite with version 3.8. Tried again to make sure:
targets.cpp: In function ‘void LLVMPY_AddTargetData(LLVMTargetDataRef, LLVMPassManagerRef)’:
targets.cpp:95:29: error: ‘LLVMAddTargetData’ was not declared in this scope
targets.cpp: In function ‘LLVMOpaqueTargetMachine* LLVMPY_CreateTargetMachine(LLVMTargetRef, const char, const char_, const char_, int, const char_, const char*, int, int)’:
targets.cpp:224:14: error: ‘Default’ is not a member of ‘llvm::Reloc’_
Works fine with 3.9.
OK
I should have been more careful in my statement: I downloaded libgit2-dev to figure out the correct version number and I assumed that anything wrapping git2 would need the dev install. I don't know if it was actually needed.

Right, the doc should be changed to say git checkout artiq-3.8 now.
Don't you mean git checkout artiq-3.9? Version 3.8 did not work with the version of llvm I downloaded and compiled yesterday.
The LLVM and clang instructions should be similarly changed to 3.8, yes.
I believe I've addressed all this in cea57e2.
Small issue with the new LLVM-or1k and Rust instructions. Need to change directories to the project after clone before you can checkout the the artiq-3.8 versions. For example:
git clone https://github.com/m-labs/llvm-or1k
cd llvm-or1k
git checkout artiq-3.8
cd tools
git clone https://github.com/m-labs/clang-or1k clang
cd clang
git checkout artiq-3.8
cd ../..
mkdir build
cd build
Same for Rust.
