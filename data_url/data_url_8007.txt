I don't find matrix logrithm logm() in Qobj methods, so to compute matrix logrithm I call logm() in scipy.linalg, which changes the type from qobj to ndarray. And to continue the subsequent computation, I need to reinstantiate the resulting ndarray to Qobj, which is cumbersome.
It would be better if the matrix logrithm logm() is added to the Qobj
Add the matrix logrithm method logm() to Qobj.

It will be added it the next major release.
This won't be implemented in QuTiP 4.7, but one can implement it oneself for a given qobj using:
