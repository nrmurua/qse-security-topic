Optimization level 3 runs the CSPLayout routine regardless of the number of qubits.  On a 127Q system this takes ~50% of the total compilation time.
Transpile a circuit over large numbers of qubits at optimization_level=3.
The compiler should not run algorithms that do not scale efficiently over large numbers of qubits
I actually think this issue mirrors the same issue in #6631 as one gets longer runtimes depending on if the transpiler was called before.
Closing as well due to my error
FWIW, we're looking at moving away from CSPlayout and replacing it with #6620 which should be significantly faster. But that won't be ready until 0.19 at the earliest (because it depends on some unreleased retworkx code).
