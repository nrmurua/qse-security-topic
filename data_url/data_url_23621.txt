It's not a bug I guess, but I think its still unwanted.
Set any directory to the current working directory
Execute a python script/program that just imports the qcodes module
No side-effects of the file system
An experiment.db file is created in the current working directory.
I think it's better if measurement databases are only created when we actually call a function that initialized an experiment.
I use the qcodes module to load my experimental data from a lot of different working directories, like folders where I work on papers, during the analyses, etc...
