I wanted to ask whether there was scope to include the functionality to return matrices in the time dependent functions of time dependent hamiltonians, rather than just scalar values?
Not in list format, but some solvers (sesolve, mesolve ) accept time-dependant Hamiltonian as a function returning a Qobj:
