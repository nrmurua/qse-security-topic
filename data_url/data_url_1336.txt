We have flakes on tests that have quite high atols due to the move from np.complex128 to np.complex64 default.  See #5535 for example.  These are sometimes optimizers that are very numerically unstable.  We should likely use np.complex128 for these optimizers (say ones with atols of 2e-5 or worse)
We have rolled back the change in default #5636 so this is no longer a relevant issue.
