After playing around with some of the optimizers, I found this interesting behavior:
The above circuit is actually equal to the bottom one. It's not obvious, until you realize that W(0.125) propagates across CZs just like a Pauli X or Y does: by producing a kickback Z on the other line. This is true for any W rotation with half_turns=1.
If we had an optimization that noticed such rotations and gave them the boot, the circuits would canonicalize much better.
