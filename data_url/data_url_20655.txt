https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-stebila-tls-hybrid-design-03 says the code points reserved for hybrid private use are 0x2F00..0x2FFF, so we should use that range.
We don't have hard dependencies on the currently implemented code points, so it should be ok to modify them. What about non-hybrid algorithms?
We would leave those in the current private range; the Internet-Draft doesn't speak to PQ-only KEX methods.
