PR are failing lint due to a bug which looks unrelated to the PR.  Example
Dill just got upgraded so my guess is that is the problem.
Confirmed that bumping dill back fixes lint.
But now notebook tests fail.  joy.
There was a notebook that used cirq --pre but was not in the excluded list. I've added it there which fixes things. Need to investigate why that got through CI
