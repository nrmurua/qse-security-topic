Hey folks - really good simulator with rich functions and modules! I really love the way QFT and MEF are abstracted away.
I noticed in the "Quantum Computing Walk-through" example, that the application of Hadamard or SigmaX gates were not affecting the full system state in the visualization. Instead they appear to affect the states of the respective qubits as shown in the animation. So just wondering why the other basis states which are also contributed to, by the amplitudes of the qubit on whcih the signle-qubit gate was applied, were left unmodified? For example, I would expect the effect of applying the SigmaX gate on the qubit[0] would be to flip the whole system state along the direction of the qubit[0]. Kindly clarify.
Thanks!
