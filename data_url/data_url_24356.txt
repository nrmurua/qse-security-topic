Gui FoldingPanel Indicators causes errors
AttributeError: module 'PySide2.QtGui' has no attribute 'QStyleOptionViewItemV2'
Cell #28 in DeepDive
ERROR:pyqode.backend:ERROR:pyqode.core.backend.server:something went bad
other cells in DeepDive:
Uses MetalPyqodeFoldingPanel to subclass pycode.core.panels.FoldingPanel and overwrite the _draw_fold_indicator function to force it to use unnatural folding indicators to prevent call to functions that are incompatible with PySide2 (QtWidgets.QStyleOptionViewItem() and QtGui.QStyleOptionViewItemV2())
CURRENT TODO:
Part of PR #192 was a change in requirements.txt to accommodate some version error that was determined to be the cause of the ERROR:pyqode.backend:ERROR:pyqode.core.backend.server:something went bad . However it was not narrowed down precisely which package(s) was causing the issue and thus current requirements might be too strict.
It is also possible that a package version error is behind PyQode using PySide2 to make incompatible function calls to OptionView
From Grace:
#PyQode backend Error
Currently I've edited the requirements.txt because it looks like there is some package that's getting pulled in at a version we don't want. That said, I'm not sure this is the smallest subset of changes to the requirements.txt possible because I don't know precisely what package updates are causing the issue.
#PySide missing function Error
This error, to me, looks like an issue with PyQode not Metal. I think it looks like PyQode is trying to run code on PySide2 that just isn't compatible with PySide2.
Right now the FolderPanel indicator fix is overengineered/hacky and I'm not entirely sure what the scope of the real issue is if it's in PyQode.
#PyQt5 issue
During debugging, I also found a point in the code where the QT_API environ is set to 'pyqt5' despite PyQt5 not being installed so that needs further looking into.
After discussing this with Grace, this issue was completed and can be closed.
