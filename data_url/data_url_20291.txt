I have these questions:
1-What is the right way to export keys and signatures to hex string?
2-What is the right way to import keys and signatures from hex string?
liboqs' interface represents keys and signatures as byte arrays.  You would have to write your own functions, or rely on some other library's functions, to convert between byte arrays and hex strings.
Thank you so much,
