There are a couple of discrepancies between the Bazel- and Makefile-driven builds of qsim - most recently, we found that input files referenced by Bazel require a different relative address than when building with Make.
One possible solution to this is to fully migrate off of Make and require all users to build qsim with Bazel. The goal of this issue is to collect feedback on this proposal; we have not yet decided on this migration.
