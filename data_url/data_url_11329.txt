Whenever we cut a new release we need to write a list of the new features. I also forget what all the new features are by that time. We should keep a running list of new features in this "issue". Whenever you fix a bug or add a feature, just mention it here and when we cut the release we'll include what your write in the release notes. I'll start with a couple of points.
Ryan, I edited your comment because QuadraticHamiltonian uses Majoranas only internally, in contrast with my original plans that I discussed with you.
