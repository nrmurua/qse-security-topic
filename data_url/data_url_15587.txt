LaTeX rendering of simulated (evolved?) Statevector is mangled.
When running:
the output shows up like:
Printing the Statevector gives:
Here's a screenshot of the behavior as well.

LaTeX rendering of the simulated Statevector should be clean, as shown in the documentation.
Note: non-simulated values seem to be rendering correctly. I wonder if the issue is that close-to-zero values aren't being excluded.
BTW, I'm happy to look into this myself, but not really sure where to start.
Hi @NilsG-S: sorry this fell through the cracks a little.  I've transferred it to Terra, which is the package that is actually causing the bug.
The error is almost certainly in the file qiskit/visualization/state_visualization.py, probably in the LaTeX conversion routines (somewhere in _state_to_latex_ket).  Looks like all the kets that have None in front of them should be zero, so shouldn't actually be included in the output, but somehow they're getting included anyway.
If you're still up for this, I could mark you assigned (no pressure even if you say yes - it's just a tracking mechanism for contributors to see the issue's taken).  If not, no worries.
