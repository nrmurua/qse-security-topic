Which llvmlite are you using?
(artiq-phaser) britton@britton1:~/artiq-dev-phaser/artiq/artiq/examples/phaser$ conda list llvm
llvm-or1k                 3.9.1                        14    m-labs/label/main
llvmlite-artiq            0.10.0.dev              py35_24    m-labs/label/main
Looks like I should be using llvm-or1k =3.8.
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/phaser/README_PHASER.rst
I downgraded. To confirm versions....
tmpon1bvix5.ll.gz
Yes, the problem is incorrect conda dependency that permits llvm-or1k 3.9 to be installed.
@jbqubit please confirm and show that you are using the correct versions. I can't reproduce this.
I confirmed versions in my second post. Should I be doing something other
than conda list?

You need to start being a bit more diligent about your python installations:
That's not a conda package at all.
You can either install the correct conda package or use the install-from-source instructions. If you do the latter, obviously don't additionally install those as conda packages.
Do you need us to make a phaser binary package for you?
