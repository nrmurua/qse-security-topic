It should be possible to compute the run time of a circuit at the end of the transpilation process given the gate timing in properties, and the buffer.  This could me an additional metadata item.  For completeness, this would have to include measurement time, but that is not returned for all devices.
This has been requested several times.
working on this one.
@1ucian0 where can I find the timing properties?
@ruimaranhao you can use the backend.properties() for that. Let me know if that answered your question.
Is this being worked on?
I would be willing to take a stab at this if its still available. @ruimaranhao @1ucian0
It is currently on hold from my side, because of professional duties. Please go ahead if you think you can do it now.
After messing around with for a bit I have created an AnalysisPass that seems to be reasonably accurate. Before I really dig in and open a PR I have the following questions @nonhermitian @1ucian0

I would just put this in the propertyset. This feel like the place to put this kind of info collected by a pass.
Hello @domisterwoozy, has any progress be made on this? I am very interested to see the implementation.
hi @taalexander, I submitted PR #3488 addressing a runtime analysis pass without knowing about this discussion.
Currently the runtime pass estimates the circuit runtime based on a externally supplied op_times dictionary, which needs to have operation times for every gate in the circuit, i.e. no unrolling is done.
The unit of gate times supplied in op_times can be arbitrary, as the method to get the length of the longest path only adds up the weights of the longest path edges.
Any additional times, from system init overhead is not taken into account.

I think doing this is easier with scheduled circuits that are being built here: https://github.com/Qiskit/rfcs/pull/18/files
The duration comes for free after you schedule a circuit for a backend.
Im tagging this issue as on hold since this comment is from May and, I assume, Qiskit does not have scheduled circuits yet (not sure). https://github.com/Qiskit/rfcs/pull/18/files is closed and I could not track down the scheduled circuit current status.
The fix to this issue is the PR #4555, that implements circuit scheduling.
