We need to create PulseChannelSpec instance to specify channels_to_plot option of pulse visualizer. This is cumbersome to visualize a schedule created by scheduler, or a schedule automatically created by some python callables - in the case when PulseChannelSpec is internally configured. Using channel letters instead of PulseChannel will improve usability.
(now)
(what I'm proposing)
This might neglect type checking policy in pulse module.
I don't mind adding the ability to specify this by string as well as channels are not necessarily created by the user due to the CmdDef. However, this should be considered a helper method. As we have moved away from by string calling towards passing of explicit handles through qiskit.
Ok, that's good suggestion. I'll work on this.
