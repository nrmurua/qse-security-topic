One of the core compilation routines in CL-Quil/quilc relies on knowing the duration of different gates. At present, these fields are filled in with dummy values that reflect rough estimates of what the relative duration between types of gates (e.g., RX vs CZ) is like. We actually have precise timing data for these, and now that we have a database table to store them in within the ISA, it would be nice to give CL-Quil access to the real values.
In some sense, this is highly dependent on changes to the Forest architecture, but we can set quilc up to receive this data ahead of time.
Closed in #210.
