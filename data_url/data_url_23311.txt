It is expected that also the snapshot of the ScaledParameter reflects the latest value of the wrapped behavior.
Snapshot of ScaledParameter is not updated.
Windows
qcodes release 0.21
Example to reproduce:
@sldesnoo-Delft Thanks for your report. In all honesty I think the ScaledParameter should probably be deprecated and its use replaced by the DelegateParameter. Can you check it DelegateParameter solves your needs?
DelegateParameter does not provide any scaling. I've made a derived class to add fixed scaling, but that does not yet provide the option use a parameter as gain. I'm not sure whether all snapshot options are properly taken into account with this class.
It would be nice to have a proper ScaledParameter in qcodes.
Sorry I should have been more clear. All QCoDeS parameters have a scale and and an offset.
So you can do something like:
The scale argument is new to me. Currently this satisfies our needs.
In the future we might want to use a parameter for scale. When an amplifier is controlled as a qcodes instrument, then it would be nice to use the gain parameter of the amplifier as scale of the DelegateParameter.
Thanks agree that it is handy to be able to bind another parameter to the scale. I will think about how to best handle that
