The line :
!source activate Qiskitenv
is not working in colab.research.google.com notebooks
the error message I'm facing is :
/bin/bash: activate: No such file or directory
colab.research.google.com notebook with GPU on, and Python 3.6.6
You just need to run this code in a Google colab notebook to install Qiskit.
Can I use Qiskit in Kaggle? If so, can you share a Kaggle notebook to show us how Qiskit can be used in Kaggle competitions
Also, Can Qiskit be used to run Sklearn ML algorithms?, I'm new in Quantum computing for machine learning, that's why I have too many questions .
To install Qiskit in a kaggle notebook do the following:

Shared Notebook
There are some ML tutorials in this repository (can be run on qiskit, qiskit-aqua) and you can use your creativity to create and run anything you want using the entire power of python and qiskit.
@muneerqu and @ModMaamari is there still an issue here or can we close this.
@muneerqu thanks for the fix
@jaygambetta You can close this issue. I will be happy to help @ModMaamari if more help is needed.
