It may be best to limit line length in .py file for readability.
This is showing up especially in the documentation api-doc.
In PEP 008 it was proposed to be 79 characters for code (and 72 for comments).
I think we could choose whatever but since all is arbitrary, 79 characters could be the way to go overall.
There is a nice tool for code formatting that helps with this and other stuff, it's black (pip install black).
An example:
After using it, usually it is best to check its choices as sometimes line breaking are awkward.
Showing by default a line ruler can help in prototyping. In Sublime, this can be changed in Preferences.
I can run black on all modules and we could remember to check with it before the final push in PRs.
+1 on a limit for line length. I agree with 80 characters, arbitrary but a standard convention.
Also for pycharm-community the line length can be changed from the default 120 (why?) to 80 by:
File > Settings > Editor > Code Style > Python > Wrapping and Braces > Hard Wrap At
Sounds good. I've updated mine in PyCharm from 120 to 79.
Does anyone disagree @nathanshammah @rmlarose @andreamari ?
Otherwise @nathanshammah go ahead and update the existing library to match this
Closed via #59.
