When trying to use an external library in the lepton wrapper, the path to the module is relative to the present-working-directory (PWD) of the code at runtime. This happens to be the covalent_ui directory. As a result, the library will not be found, unless the user supplies a library path accommodating this starting-point.
Try to use a library in a lepton and don't supply a relative path, with respect to the covalent_ui directory.
If a full path is supplied, we should not get a ModuleNotFoundError error
