I'm trying to get the XACC/QuaC examples working and I keep running into issues when I run
model=createPulseModel()
returns
AttributeError: module 'xacc' has no attribute 'createPulseModel'
Is this an error with my instillation (I'm using a docker container)? Or has the API changed?
Thanks!
did you update your PYTHONPATH to point to the XACC install?
Also what docker image are you using?
Yea I've updated the PYTHONPATH and I have no problem running other XACC examples (such as opt.py and dueteronH2.py et al.).
I'm using my own docker image because I wanted to run jupyterlab instead of Theia. But it is based off of your dev-quac dockerfile. See below
Actually I am now seeing an error on startup:
[xacc-logger] [error] [XACC Error] Failure initializing XACC Plugin Registry - Bundle#9 start failed: libmpi.so.12: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Perhaps this error is the reason.
can you share the image on dockerhub so I can run it without having to build? Just sent you an invite to the xacc slack for quicker communication...
one thought is to
check me on that though, I think the MPI libs should be in PETSC_DIR/lib. This is a quick fix, but we should fix this via setting the RPATH in CMake.
Thanks to Alex's help I've figured out that I had mounted a volume onto my docker container at /home/dev, removing critical libraries. This wasn't an XACC bug, just user error.
