Running the code in the docstring for tfq.layers.PQC with a value for repetitions produces an error on windows.
This could be due to the use of multiprocessing in tfq.core.ops.batch_util.batch_calculate_sampled_expectation - Pickle cannot handle module objects to send to different cores. I am unsure of a way that this can be circumvented - it still doesn't work when entering as __main__, see below:
I presume the fix would be to check for windows and do the calculation without multiprocessing.
System: Windows 10
tensorflow==2.1.0
tensorflow_quantum == 0.2.0
cirq == 0.70
python == 3.7.6

Hey @DuckTigger thanks so much for the snippet and logs. This was a tricky one to diagnose, but it looks like linux and windows python multiprocessing modules behave a little bit differently.
My guess is that our batch_util.py file that pickles copies of cirq.Simulator objects and lambda functions works on linux and mac but don't work on windows. Just creating and dispatching a multiprocessing.Pool object is where the problem appears to be coming from. For the time being you can keep samples=None and that should keep you clear of the problem.
I'm going to look into getting a fix for it now.
#161 has gone in, I tested the fix on windows server (closest I could get to win10). Could you try installing the next tfq-nightly and see if that fixes the problem for you ?
Hi Michael,
Apologies for the dealy, I was on AL.
Upgrading to tfq-nightly now fixes the problem, with the output:
Thanks!
