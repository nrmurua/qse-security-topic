Shor executed on N=15, a=11, simulated on noiseless simulators, produces unexpected basis values with non-null probability.
Run the following code:
Additional remarks:
I would expect only the following outputs from print(res.get_counts()): 10000000, 00000000.
Instead, I get 62 different values.
The same behavior can be observed in the detailed log of shor.factor(15,11)
Remarkably, I have evidence that a previous version of the code used to work:
I suggest compraring the circuit obtained with qiskit 0.13.0 against the most recent versions, after full decomposition, and look for differences.
The issue seems to have appeared in Aqua 0.7.0.
I am currently working on fixing this. It's nearly done - I will create PR soon ðŸ˜€
