Small thing, but just noticed the Mitiq logo and gifs don't show up in the README on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/mitiq/):


I think the fix is to include these images in MANIFEST.in?
This was fixed by #831 which removed the gifs and linked to the logo by url (instead of file). Images will appear on the next pypi release.
