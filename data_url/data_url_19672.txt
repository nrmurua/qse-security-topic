I tried following the tomography+noise examples but I get an error when using State Tomography and Error Mitigation together if I have a measurement in my circuit:
QiskitError: "Unexpected state label '0 1', verify the fitter's state labels correspond to the input data"
Mitigation setup:
Circuit and tomography:
The last line gives the error above. Seems to be to do with multiple classical registers but complete_meas_cal doesn't work when I run it with the same registers.
I'd like to be able to mitigate the noise in a circuit+tomography when I have measurements.
I think I worked out a solution to my problem: I manually created the tomography circuits to reuse the classical register already present. Not sure if this was actually a bug but at least it might worth adding an example for the docs.
