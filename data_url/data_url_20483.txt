Hi Everyone,
I would like to retrieve more information in try_connection.py like liboqs detail information.
How I can retrieve above information in try_connection.py?
Is there any way to change the customize message text to send for KEM?
If I got guidance how to do , it would be helpful to me.
Best Regards,
Yamin
to retrieve more information in try_connection.py like liboqs detail information.
For more "in-depth interaction" with the library from within Python, what about using https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python ?
Is there any way to change the customize message text to send for KEM?
I'm not sure I understand what is meant by "customize message text": Can you elaborate?
Closing due to inactivity/missing feedback.
