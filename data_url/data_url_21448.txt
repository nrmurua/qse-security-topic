Several PyQt functions used within the artiq dashboard are being passed float arguments where they are expecting integers, causing the dashboard to crash.
This appears to affect many of the Qt functions. Had a look at some old working versions; the relevant code on the artiq side hasn't changed in a long time, so I thought it might be a new PyQt version, but it's the same as in some old environments I have that appear to work. I think I'm missing something obvious but at the moment I'm beginning to work my way down the chain of errors just casting directly to integer where relevant.
Dashboard starts.
Dashboard crashes before starting, with following error:
This appears to python=3.10 related; same issue doesn't appear (at least, not immediately, didn't press to see if it would fail opening applets/experiments) in an environment with python=3.9

This can be reproduced on Nix with:
nixpkgs:
Tested with nixpkgs 1127044143d3813cfa7f27ffd6f0c9c14b5c5d61. Builds for that version are also currently cached on nixbld.m-labs.hk, the widespread Python dependency causes a lot of rebuilds.
