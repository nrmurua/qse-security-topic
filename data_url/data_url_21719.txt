Sequence Errors in manual describes being able to add more lanes to the gateware. Looking through the gateware config kc705.py doesn't seem to have any references to it. Where is such a config setting, if it exists?
See the lane_count parameter to artiq.gateware.rtio.core.Core (which is passed down the tree to SED, etc.). Could use some documentation, though.
@drewrisinger is this for ARTIQ 2 as you mentioned in #1281 ?  There are no lanes in ARTIQ 2.
