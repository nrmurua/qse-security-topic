When using the OpenQL compiler from python, there are a lot of messages that "flood" my terminal. It would be nice if the verbosity level is configurable.
Are you sure it is because of OpenQL or because of test you run with assembler which prints output? The verbosity of OpenQL can be controlled when you are compiling by setting verbose to False as:
p.compile(optimize=False, verbose=False)
If after setting it to False, you are still seeing lots of messages, let me know the specific test.
@imranashraf this may very well be the solution I'm looking for.
I'll try it out and close if this solves my problems.
This is the output I get when generating multiple randomized benchmarking experiments with the verbose=False option.
The verbose =False option should suppress these messages (with the excpetion of the error).
I think we should fix this for v0.4.

@AdriaanRol this is the minimal information printed by OpenQL providing information about the names of the necessary files generated, which in my opinion should be printed.
I pushed some changes on the develop branch, in which the output is now sent to stdout and warnings and errors are now sent to stderr. So you can send stdout to /dev/null to ignore it and use stderr only. or put them in separate files by doing something on the lines of:
You can close this issue after testing it. A long term solution can also be to introduce Verbosity levels, but for that you can create a separate issue.
