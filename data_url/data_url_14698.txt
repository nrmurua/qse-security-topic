We can assign parameter object to another object in Schedule, however, if we assign common parameters to multiple parameters in the schedule, assigned value only applied to the first instruction. See below for details.
This returns
The value 0.1 should be applied to both instruction.
Fix behavior of parameter table.
If I remove this set instruction parameter value is applied to both instruction. Because in above example two instructions are just different from t0, thus they are reduced to single instruction by this line.

Is there any issue to remove this set? @lcapelluto
I think if you remove set, you then have to check if entry already exists in self._parameter_table[new_parameter]. We shouldn't have duplicates, right? I don't fully understand why the example code wasn't working
In above example, we have two instructions:
Here I'm trying to substitute common_param  into both amp (they have different uuid), but
is satisfied and they are reduced to a single entry, IIRC. Then substitution is applied to only one entry. We need to check t0 + instruction rather than just entry, or perhaps we can update pulse object equality check.
