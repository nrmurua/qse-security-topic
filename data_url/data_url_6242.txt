While running it in my local machine/HPC, I get multiple warnings for OpenBLAS Warning: Detect OpenMP Loop and this application may hang. Please rebuild the library with USE_OPENMP=1 option. How do I get rid of it? Does this warning affect my results/speed in any way?
Hi @obliviateandsurrender, got a few questions:
Have you installed aer through pip or did you build it by yourself?
Can you post a sample program where to reproduce this warning message?
By default openblas is built with pthreads and not openmp.  That warning happens when the pthreads blas is called in an omp section.  In order to get rid of that, you would have to build openblas with the openmp option
and then build Aer against that.  I believe that some people just disable the warning in source because it is annoying.
