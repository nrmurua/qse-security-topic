A possible solution would be to add a SummedOp.chop_summands(threshold=0) method that is added as default call in SummedOp.reduce, analogous to collapse_summands. With the threshold argument the user can choose what to chop: all summands with a coefficient smaller than threshold are removed.
This is equivalent to WeightedPauliOperator.chop.
@Cryoris I'd like to work on this issue, if that's fine with you
Sure, that would be great! Feel free to reach out for questions, if you have any üôÇ  Once you have a draft ready you can also open a pull-request for us to look at.
Hey @spencerking how is this going? Mind if I try?
@VANRao-Stack I actually just got started on this yesterday. If I don't make progress this weekend I'll let you know and you can give it a shot.

Any updates @spencerking?
@VANRao-Stack I'm going to make a WIP PR to get some feedback. I think I've got the general idea but haven't gotten much feedback on Slack.
Hey! I might have come up with a new method to resolve this problem. Can I open a pull request?
@shifubear I just finished implementing it. I'm writing tests, then I'll have a PR out.
@JosDenmark Dang, I was in the process of writing tests as well. In that case, I'll keep an eye out for your PR before I do anything else. :)
Many thanks üôè
