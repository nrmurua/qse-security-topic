Recently we update the Python bindings for kernel_builder to Kernel to be more Pythonic. I actually like this a little better. This type in C++ is meant to build Quake function representations, so it is in some sense a kernel builder. But ultimately it is a callable CUDA Quantum kernel, so I think it may be better to just call it cudaq::kernel.
