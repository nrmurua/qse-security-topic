Sinter uses some functionality available in the latest dev version of stim that's not yet released on PyPI, so I get the following error when running the first example in the sinter readme:
I'll install stim from source in the meantime but it would be great if the sinter and stim releases could be synced.
What are the specific versions of stim and sinter that you have installed? You need to have the latest dev version of stim installed to use the latest dev version of sinter. Does it still fail after you run
?
Note that sinter does not specify the exact version of stim in its requirements, only that it's the dev version, so it won't auto-update stim when you update sinter. Keeping the version requirements loose is intentional, to avoid problems where a downstream project can't create a consistent set of pinned versions.
Ah thanks, installing from source fixed the issue and so does using stim==1.9.dev1654147224. I hadn't realised not pinning to the latest stim version was intentional but that makes sense. I'd assumed that install stim with --upgrade would give me the latest version but didn't notice the latest dev versions
