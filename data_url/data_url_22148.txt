@sbourdeauducq This is how I understood the specification.
Do I understand it right that replay should advance the timeline?
Yes.
What is the length of a replay, then?
It should be as if the content of the with record had been inserted instead of the replay, in this case 5*(100+250)+5*(50+150) ms. In other words, value of now at the end of the with block, minus value at the beginning. How did you understand the specification otherwise?
