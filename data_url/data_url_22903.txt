Hi! I am very happy with the current implementation of the IIR filters. I just want to ask if I want to implement two or more IIR filters on a single board, is it possible to do so with just modifying the python scripts or library? Because we are now trying to use it to do very fast feedback with complicated filter functions, and since right now the filters are implemented in sequential manner, and thus goes to very high delay when filter order is high. But if one can have 2-3 in parallel the delay time could be greatly reduced! I also wonder how many IIR filters can we actually implement using all the resources on RP? Of course I can also try to do so with many RPs but with them all on a single board is much nicer!
