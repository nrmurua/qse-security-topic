Hi, I'm using Expectation within a custom circuit layer, and I'm getting some shape errors:
ValueError: Shape must be rank 2 but is rank 1 for '{{node circuit_7/expectation_7/TfqSimulateExpectation}} = TfqSimulateExpectation[](circuit_7/expectation_7/Tile, circuit_7/expectation_7/Const, circuit_7/concat, circuit_7/expectation_7/234)' with input shapes: [?], [8], [?,8], [4].
I expect this has quite a straightforward solution but I can't work out what it actually wants to have rank 2 rather than rank 1!
The below should be a complete toy example:
Thanks in advance!
I've found the issue, sorry! It seems that converting the readout operators to a tensor was the issue.
