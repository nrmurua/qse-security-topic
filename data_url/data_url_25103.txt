Hi!
It is an open source project that would benefit from collaboration. So many ideas, but working alone is hard - so it stayed dormant for the last year. I am into games because I love instant feedback and interactions!
There are some bigger plans:
If you can help with one of those (or another ones), let me know!
Write a comment, saying which ones you would like (and what is your experience in these task).
Awesome! I was just thinking it would be cool to be able to add an 'embed' feature as well so a level (or series of) could be put on website, blog, etc.
Not sure I have the dev skillz to help w/ any of the things on the list. Could potentially help out w/ graphics & enyclopedia?
@flashx Awesome! With encyclopedia first it needs rewrite to some framework, with jQuery-like approach of D3.js it is not easy to style/modify.
With graphics - sure! It would be highly appreciated!
I got contacted by Artur Ekert from the Centre for Quantum Technologies in Singapore to continue work on it. I post it here as it may interest people on the intersection of science, tech, arts and design. I look for people with these skills (one is enough, more is better):
If you are a software engineer or graphic designer, you don't need to know quantum mechanics - but you need to be open to collaboration with physicists. :)
There are many ideas we can explore:
It is going to take place this summer or autumn. ~4 people for 2-3 months; flight + accommodation + academic salary.
