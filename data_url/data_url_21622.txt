ARTIQ GUI apps on Nix should be wrapped with wrapQtAppsHook.
ARTIQ GUI apps have the following errors when run from command-line on WSL (Ubuntu on Win 2004, using Nix).
I would report in https://git.m-labs.hk, but registering accounts are locked there. From Nix, you need to wrap the binaries with wrapQtAppsHook: https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#sec-language-qt
NOTE: I tried this on Ubuntu 18.04 (native), and didn't have this same error message.
Should fail similar to
Log messages (on WSL):
Message on Ubuntu 18.04 (Native):
Modify this file: https://git.m-labs.hk/M-Labs/nix-scripts/src/commit/cc00cfc1a8bf16b6a7e25b2c8a1187b45c8efb3b/artiq-fast/pkgs/artiq.nix
Should add something like:
Thanks.
Is Qt on WSL2 able to use the GUI without a X server?

I'll get back to you on that. Still testing it. Mostly just using it to test/compile Nix packages locally.
Also forgot to mention, but this is the tracking issue on Nixpkgs for these sorts of errors: NixOS/nixpkgs#65399
Ok, after a little bit of hackery/annoying workarounds: I have ARTIQ running on Nix on WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux), with GUI dashboard shown via X11 on Windows host. So no @sbourdeauducq re w/o X server.
Basic steps (a few from memory, might have missed minor details):
@drewrisinger Thanks for the info!
