Currently, when a simulation includes SPAM noise, it returns a NoisyResults instance. However, when there are only measurement errors, the results could actually be given as CoherentResults. As such, we are currently throwing away information that could be given to the user.
Naturally, every time doppler, amplitude and/or "preparation" errors are present, the result has to be given as a NoisyResults instance (unless, perhaps, when N_samples=1). On the rest of the cases, the result should rather be CoherentResults.
Incorporating measurement errors into CoherentResults is not very hard:
