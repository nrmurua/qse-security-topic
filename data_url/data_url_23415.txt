The current QtPlot is painful to work with:
First step will be merging #290 ! Then polishing  all the things.
Note to self:  this may require major changes:
@giulioungaretti @MerlinSmiles The new pyqtgraph (0.10) has been released, so merging #290 is possible.
One issue is that qt4 is still hard-coded, e.g.
I suggest replacing this with qtpy:
(als some small changes in other places)
@MerlinSmiles Can you make a new branch outside the main qcodes repo (which is read-only now). I can then make a PR for the qtpy changes.
@eendebakpt  yep!  and yep
I will just fix the obsolete things in #290 !
@peendebak i just had a discussion with @giulioungaretti , it seems as merging this does not work without multiproccessing (default settings now), or with severe limitations in updating the GUI :( maybe @giulioungaretti finds a fix though ðŸ˜®
Note to me and @jenshnielsen  this is more and more releavant, as we need to tackle qdev's request.
Although maybe easier to start from scratch and not use that horrible plot_object thing.
