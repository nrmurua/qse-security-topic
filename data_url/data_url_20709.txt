Since liboqs supports the Google Ciphersuites and they are implemented in the liboqs-Library, i guess it makes sense to let this fork have the ability to use them, too!
Would this be possible?
Thanks
liboqs supports NewHope, but doesn't directly match the Google CECPQ1 ciphersuite.  At this point we don't have any plans to implement the CECPQ1 ciphersuite, for a variety of reasons:
Regarding the last reason, we will eventually migrate to OpenSSL 1.1.0, which does have ChaCha20, at which point it would be easier to revisit this issue.
Hi there,
can someone give me an update on how far the migration to the 1.1.0 has come so far, or if the current 1.1.0 branch of this repository already includes the CHACHA20 suites?
Thanks
We haven't started on a 1.1.0 migration, and probably won't for another couple of months.  Volunteers are welcome, however.  :)
This is a long dormant issue. But I can now report that we have an initial release of the 1.1.1 migration; it's in the repository under the OQS-master branch.  It has hybrid post-quantum key exchange in TLS 1.3 for selected post-quantum algorithms.  Since TLS 1.3 allows mixing and matching of key exchange methods with ciphers, one could use ChaCha20 as the cipher.
