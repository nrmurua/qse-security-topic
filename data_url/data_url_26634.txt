the compiled executable cp2k.psmp report errors and i do not know what is wrong with it.
cp2kmaster20210224's compiling condition is gcc 9.3.1 which provided by devtoolset-9, openmpi-4.0.5 and openblas.
when make test, all regtesting has been passed through without any error.
two copy of scripts were then run for test but report same error as below.
one script of the regtests H2O32.inp and another is from other team, which has been running successful for md, were cp  for single thread run. both the two scrpts could pass the "psmp --check" command but report the same error.
cp2k.psmp --check H2O-32.inp
SUCCESS, the input could be parsed correctly.
This does not guarantee that this input is meaningful
or will run successfully
Program received signal SIGABRT: Process abort signal.

Possibly related to #1273 in the sense that this is at startup time.
The originating line points to command line parsing:

Although I don't see how we can end up in that case switch with the given command line.
@alas-go can you confirm that the final command line is really just cp2k.psmp --check H2O-32.inp? Usually when running a psmp there is also an mpirun wrapper involved.
nevertheless, our command line argument parsing could use some rework:
When parsing arguments to flags we are possibly going beyond the number of provided arguments. Instead of an assert a proper message might be better.
That is what i typed in a terminal following "cp2k.psmp --help"  suggestions but not the scripts produced  by cp2k.psmp.
This time I tested it on a redhat 7.9 os with toolset-9, openmpi-4.05. and python/python3 provided by Anoconda3 envronment sets.
