Our colleagues and I from the IBM Research Europe - Zurich lab have found the baud rate in QDevid QDAC drivers to be incorrect.
From our QDAC manual sheet 14(51), we can read
[...] select a baud rate of 460800 [...]
The numbers 6 and 8 are inverted. We don't see errors often due to this, but it should be corrected nevertheless.
If you are using a released version of qcodes (recommended):
qcodes version: 0.32
@pharveycollard thank you for reporting! Could you check #3931 ?
Thanks!
