Describe the feature you'd like
Support for generating OpenQASM should be extended to all gates in the Braket SDK.
How would this feature be used? Please describe.
The to_ir() method on the gate classes should be extended to accept a parameter to determine the IR to translate the circuit to. The IRType can be either JAQCD or OpenQASM.
Implementation Notes
#322 adds the to_ir() implementation on the Gate class which delegates to _to_jaqcd or _to_openqasm depending on the specified IRType.
We need to implement the _to_openqasm methods for all the gates supported by the Braket SDK.
Note: #322 adds a reference implementation for IR generation for a gate (Rx) which might be helpful to look at.
Implementation Checklist
Additional context
All the gates should have the same names as listed above but completely lowercase.
Some gates an angle parameter. You can tell because the gate will defined with AngledGate as the base like this class Ry(AngledGate): Where the is an angle parameter, it will be in parenthesis after the gate name. For example: rx(0.0) q[0]; When there is no angle parameter, omit the parenthesis.
Gates provided with multiple qubit targets should list them with comma and space separated lists like this: cnot q[0], q[1]; The following are the multiple qubit gates
