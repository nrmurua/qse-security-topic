Currently, the QGAN algorithm only allows you to set an optimizer when you instantiate a QGAN object - it would be nice if we could change optimizers / gradient functions whenever we call QGAN.run(), just like with the VQE.
Hi @Zoufalc ,
I can think of a couple of options that would allow us to change the optimizer / gradient function when training, please let me know which one you think works best, or if you think something else would work better:
Thanks!
Thanks for your suggestions.
Since there is already the possibility to define a new generator -- including the optimizer -- after instantiation of a QGAN algorithm using set_generator, I would recommend adding a set_optimizer function to quantum_generator.py.
This issue was addressed by #1496 so I am closing
