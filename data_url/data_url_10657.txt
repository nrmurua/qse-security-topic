Current Problem
Placed file ftv33 from the TSPLIB in directory that contains ‘read’ script.  ‘Read’ script has a line
infile = open(ftv33)
Error is:
File "C:\Users\PSU Brandywine\my_env\myScripts\Test5Copy1.py", line 5, in 
infile = open('ftv33')
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ftv33'
Alternatives Considered
Tried ftv33.py, ftv33.txt and ftv33 with no .    Also tried these in the open call.  Same error every time
Issue is not attaching ftv33 to the directory that contains the 'read' script.  This has been done.  Issue is opening ftv33 so its data can be read.
Do either of these work for you?
I have tried the suggestions from akoszegi.  They work in IDLE, but not in a Command Prompt.  Something deeper prevents a file from opening in a Command Prompt.
