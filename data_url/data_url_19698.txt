When running interleaved RB it would be more convenient to pass in gate objects directly rather than having to construct a quantum circuit with a single gate. ie:
The input should be allowed to be a Clifford gate object (ie H, S, Sdg, X, Y, Z, CX, CY, CZ, Swap), a Clifford object, or a Clifford QuantumCircuit (For dihedral RB the allowed gates / operators would be those from the cnot dihedral group)
Checking the input is clifford could be done using the clifford class  (ie try: Clifford(input)) which will fail if the input is non-Clifford.
