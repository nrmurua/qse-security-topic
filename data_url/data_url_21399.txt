Imports do not work after pip install -e artiq with pip 23.1.2.
It outputs the installation directory. This works in pip 23.0.1.
It raises an AttributeError.
But do we support the installation via pip? I never saw it on our manuals as a way to install artiq... What is the situation with conda?

From a user's perspective I think supporting the most popular python package index may be a good idea. It is definitely important for us: Conda often does not have the latest packages and pip and Conda don't work great together. Historically I think artiq has unofficially supported pip for a long time, and maybe it is a good idea to keep doing so?

We've never used pip at m-labs so I'm not sure where this is coming from. Anyway, feel free to send a pull request.
This was due to implementation of PEP 517 and an error in our configuration. ARTIQ works fine with pip install.
