Would it be possible to have the copy plot function be a little more accessible? Currently it seems like we have to rick click on the plot, click export then click copy. Would it be possible to have this option immediately available on a right click or to just have a copy plot function? I'd imagine this is a function that people would use fairly often to quickly add plots to lab notebooks and things.
I'd suggest that we just have the usual keyboard shortcut (control-c).
