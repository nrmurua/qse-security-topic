A code inserts multiple pulse.measure instruction creates strange output.

All measure and acquire instructions are aligned in parallel.
This is a defect arising from the constraints of IQX backends measurement operation. Currently it inserts the acquire instruction for all qubits while a measurement pulse is inserted for the specific qubit. Thus repeating pulse.measure occupies timeslots of other acquire channels and they cannot be aligned.
This issue will be automatically solved when the acquisition for single qubit is supported by backend, or we can temporarily solve  this by allowing iterator as qubit argument.
