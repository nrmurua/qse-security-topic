In prebuild script used by the Binder, we try to do dotnet build on all katas and tutorials listed in https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas/blob/main/Dockerfile, regardless of whether they actually have a .csproj file to build:

We have several tutorials, ComplexArithmetic and LinearAlgebra, which are Python-based, and don't have an underlying .csproj file, so prebuilding them yields errors which look confusing in Binder log. It would be nice to check whether the folder has a .csproj file and run dotnet build only if it does, skipping that step otherwise. (The next line, jupyter nbconvert, should be executed regardless, since all prebuilt katas and tutorials have a Notebook frontend.)
@tcNickolas  Hi, I'd like to work on this issue. If it isn't assigned already, can you please assign this to me?
@deepto98 Sure! I recommend holding off the pull request for 24 hours to make sure it qualifies for Hacktoberfest :-)
@tcNickolas I added this check in this PR (#667). Do let me know if this would work.

Yes, that looks like it works :-) Thank you!
You're welcome. I want to contribute more to the project, do let me know if there are any other issues I can work on.
