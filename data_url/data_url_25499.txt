The lattice JSON serialization test (test_lattice_json_serialization) fails randomly. This is because Lattice has an attribute cova_imports which is a Python set, and serialization converts the set to a list. However, the list order is not deterministic.
Work around this by setting cova_imports to a singleton for the purposes of the test.
PR #981 doesn't actually fix the bug because it omitted the {} to construct a set containing a single string.
