Support the gate decomposition feature that is part of the config.
@imranashraf I have tested the fixes you have made. However, Now some tests (notably the butterfly sequence) is failing because it uses a predefined operation ("x") that is not part of the config file (which specifies "rx180".
As such this is now an important issue to fix.
@Nader-Khammassi , any updates on OpenQL developments?
@AdriaanRol  I was busy with some hardware development the past few days, but now I am back.
Both gate decomposition and aliases are now supported in the C++ side, now I need to update the Python wrapper and make some unit tests.
For example, the following section is now supported, the defined gates can be used as any custom gate, I added as well support for aliases with no parameters like "measure_all"... :
"gate_decomposition": {
"z q0" : ["x q0", "y q0"],
"h q0" : ["ry90 q0"],
"clifford1 q0" : ["ry90 q0", "rx90 q0"],
"sdag q0" : ["sdag q0"],
"measure_all" : ["measure q0", "measure q1"],
"cnot q0,q1" : ["ry90 q1","cz q2,q0","ry90 q1"]
}
This is implemented but does not have test yet.
If we add documentation of this feature to the configuration file then we can close this.
The generalization that @imranashraf showed me would be the preferred solution.
Support for parameterized gate decomposition is now available on cclight_eqasm_compiler branch.
This feature has also been documented in configuration specification file.
