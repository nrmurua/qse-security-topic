When adding calibrations to a circuit we can have situations where the numerical precision of the parameters cause transpiler issues.
The following code works for the end amplitude of  0.9 but fails for 0.95 with the error qiskit.exceptions.QiskitError: "Cannot unroll the circuit to the given basis, ['id', 'rz', 'sx', 'x']. Instruction MyGate not found in equivalence library and no rule found to expand."
The code above should not fail.
Perhaps rounding the parameters in the calibrations to 8 decimals would solve the issue.
Which qiskit version are you using, the above code ran fine on my build, with 0.9 and 0.95
I am using
'0.18.0.dev0+25df5ba' , which I recently built from source.
See the commit specified above.
This seems to be an issue of data structure of circuit calibration field, i.e. this is a dictionary with the assigned parameter value as a part of key Dict[gate name: str][Tuple[Tuple[qubit: int, ...], Tuple[parameter value: float, ...]], Schedule].
Perhaps this line?

Any bump on this?
