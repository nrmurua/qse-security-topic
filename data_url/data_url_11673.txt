When calling VQE._energy_evaluation for a fixed set of parameters, the same energy value is returned
When using QasmSimulator, I expect noise in the energy evaluation, at least due to sampling error. I expect the estimated variance to be larger than machine precision.
Make sure that VQE is not caching the circuit evaluations?
Hey Stuart - in the new Aqua we use the Aer Snapshot Expectation by default for improved performance, which has zero variance because it works by statevector matrix multiplication. To use shot-based expectations, add the following expect argument to VQE:
Let me know if that works!
Yep, that does it! Thanks
