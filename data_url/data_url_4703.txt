FockStateTF.fidelity() currently only allows other_state to be a state vector (ket), which is inconvenient.
Yep, this is on the to-do list.
At the moment, I think this is limited by the FockState API, so we'll start looking at expanding the state API to make the fidelity method more general, and then make sure all backends take into account the new behaviour.
