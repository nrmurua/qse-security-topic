When initializing a Result object with argument (backend_name='backend_name', backend_version="0.0.0"...) the repr prints backend_name as "0.0.0" (whatever the version is)
Initialize a Result object with a backend_name and backend_version argument and print a repr
Obviously they should be different
In https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/result/result.py lines 62-68:
The first self.backend_version should be self.backend_name.
Can I try this? This will be my first issue
