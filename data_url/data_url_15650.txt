UnboundLocalError is thrown when a loop-body circuit calls to_instruction().
The loop-body has if_test and its test expression is a tuple of Clbit and a value.
If the tuple consists of ClassicalRegister and a value, this error does not occur.
No error.

This isn't an issue with the control-flow builders particularly, more just with circuit_to_instruction with registerless bits:
will produce the same error.
