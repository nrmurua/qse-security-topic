At the moment I am working on writing Grover's algorithm for an arbitrary number of qubits, and I came across the following problem:
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 502 Server Error: Bad Gateway for url: https://api.rigetti.com/qvm
This happens any time I try to run it with 8 or more qubits, and I think the problem is that I'm defining some gates very inefficiently.  At some point I need to define some 8+1-qubit gate, and I do this by creating a 2^9 x 2^9 matrix.  However, the matrix is incredibly simple.  It is a diagonal matrix with all 1s on the diagonal, except the last entry is -1.  Is there a way of defining your own gates by using sparse arrays/matrices?
This error message should be reproducible by defining any arbitrary 9+-qubit gate explicitly as a 2^9+ x 2^9+ matrix, and then running that program with the qvm.
Thanks!
@JuanIgnacioAdame are you still experiencing this problem?
