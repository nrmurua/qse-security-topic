It seems that the basis_gates kwarg of qiskit.execute is being ignored.
If i run the following code
So the circuit is not being unrolled to the specified basis gates.
If I instead use the depreciated qiskit.compile i get the expected result:
It looks like either the specified basis gates is not being passed to the unroller, or the unroller is not being called by the execute function.
This is probably fixed by #2188. Can you check @chriseclectic?
@1ucian0 no, doesn't seem to change anything.
You might want to add some test cases where backend != None. Also it looks like all your tests go directly through the transpiler.transpile function, whereas the broken execute goes through the compiler.transpile function (the working compile function seems to go directly through transpiler.transpile)
This is fixed by #2166
In that branch I get:
