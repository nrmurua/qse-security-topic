This will fail:
The error message is:
AttributeError: module 'openql.openql' has no attribute 'Unitary'
That is copied from the documentation. The OpenQL is installed from the pre-built wheels like this:
pip install qutechopenql
Is the pre-built stuff up-to-date?
It's actually the documentation that's running way ahead of the pre-built stuff, because the documentation didn't exist at all yet when the previous version was released. We're working on stabilizing the current develop branch to bring out a new release ASAP, however, and then we'll probably have ReadTheDocs track master instead. Or, in my opinion, we should just release more often now that the process is automated.
Solved in 0.10.0
