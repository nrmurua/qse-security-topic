The mpl drawer changes leading hyphens in parameters to the math mode minus sign, which is similar in width to the + and about twice the width of a hyphen. There are other places, such as e notation and the imaginary part of complex numbers, where a minus is intended, but a hyphen is used. Note below.

Also note that pi_check returns +- for the imaginary part instead of just -.
For all parameter expressions in the mpl drawer, convert hyphens to minus signs. Since all parameters go through pi_check, this could be done at the pi_check level.
Hi, can I work on this?
Sure. I believe this can all be done at the bottom of the pi_check function. The +- issue affects all drawers, but the hyphen/minus sign is only for the 'mpl' version.
Great! I will start with your suggestion.
Hi @enavarro51, I think I figured out where the format making this inconsistency. But I want to double check if you want to change all minus signs to be longer as in mathematical mode, which is defined in latex like this $-$, or you want all to be shorter as indicated in the below picture?

Secondly, do you think I should keep the +- that the pi_check.py return?
The +- should be replaced with -, as in your first U1 above, again for all calls to pi_check. And we want the $-$ for the mpl drawer.
Is this issue solved?
Hi, I'm working on it.
