In setup.py the package name is specified as "pyEPR" but the package on PyPI is named "pyEPR-quantum". This causes a problem for the conda packaging because conda uses setup.py to determine the name while pip uses the PyPI name. The result is that conda install pyepr-quantum followed by pip install pyEPR-quantum causes pip to overwrite the conda install and leaves pip freeze showing that both pyEPR and pyEPR-quantum are installed.
