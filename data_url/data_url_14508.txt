Using the PauliEvolutionGate with a parameterized time and the MatrixExponential as synthesis method breaks. The reason is that the evolution time, after being bound, is not cast to a float but remains a ParameterExpression with 0 free parameters. That type is incompatible with SciPy which is used to compute the matrix exponential.
