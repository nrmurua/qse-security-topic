I noticed the default of None is used in QRenderer.  From pyEPR, I noticed variation could be a str,
i.e. variation = “scale_factor=‘1.2001’“.
This TODO will be removed from issue #215 and made into this issue.
I am a little lost here. What is the request in this issue?
BTW, I have been refactoring the renderers for #255 , so some of the todos (including some of the ones addressed in #215) were already resolved.
The renderers will be eventually replaced with pyaedt.  We can depreciate this request.
