The command line switches to select an Experiment from a file are inconsistent.
artiq_run: -e EXPERIMENT, --experiment EXPERIMENT
artiq_compile: -e EXPERIMENT, --experiment EXPERIMENT
artiq_client submit: -c CLASS_NAME, --class-name CLASS_NAME
Change artiq_client to use -e
ARTIQ master and release-4
It's called class_name in expid, which is used in many places (potentially in user code as well), so changing artiq_run and artiq_compile will result in the least breakage.
