This script is globbing tests from a specific directory in the llvm-lit test/ directory and then has hardcoded matrices of test filenames vs. simulation targets as to which are invalid in the script itself.
What is desired is a separate directory from test/ that has subdirectories for each target simulator. Those subdirectories should then contain tests (or symbolic links to tests) that should run on the target. This sort of structure will allow a more open ended path to adding new tests to llvm-lit as well as to the collection of nightly simulation tests.
