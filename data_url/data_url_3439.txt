The PyQVM throws an error if the last instruction on any qubit is not a MEASURE instruction.
The result is that programs which MEASURE only a subset of qubits acted on by instructions run fine on a QVM but will throw an error on a PyQVM. This is a particular example of the problems detailed in issues #906 and #803.
Scanning through the code I don't see why we can't simply remove this error condition from  _make_ram_program. (Note that a single qubit program X(1) MEASURE(1) runs fine on a multi-qubit PyQVM; the logic is already in place to ignore qubits without any instructions, but not to ignore qubits with gates but no MEASURE.
I started working on this here: #874 . It does seem to Just Work. You're very welcome to finish this off!
@ecpeterson @kylegulshen is there any update to this issue now that #874 has been merged?
