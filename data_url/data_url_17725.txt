@jaygambetta expressed discontent with methods of the shape get_something(). It seems he is not the only one.
A quick grep returned:
In many situations the prefiex get_ simply can be removed. In others, it can be replaced by more specific, like generate_output. If there is a set_something, in that case I think get_something makes sense.
Since this change affects a lot of things, do it in several PRs please.
Yes there are many that we need to fix. The get_backend I think we keep as we have a backends command.
The matplotlib one I wouldn't worry about it, it's an internal method on a class only used inside that module (to set anchors in the figure). It's never going to be called anywhere else
For the Results, there is an attempt of discussion at #830. For the rest of instances and potential implementers, please note as well that even if the technical challenge is indeed relatively straightforward (as in, renaming the method and revising the rest of the codebase and test for usages of the method), some discussion might be needed:
It would probably be a good idea indeed to go case-by-case basis (per class or similar) - other than those nits, it sounds good! Thanks @1ucian0 for starting the effort üëç
Maybe select_backend?
lol I really like select_backend but the spec is out and we have so many people using get_backend. But select is so much more descriptive. @diego-plan9 @ajavadia thoughts?
