The goal of this issue is to make TrotterQrte use ProductFormula and EvolutionGate classes.
ProductFormula is supposed to define the type of Trotterization and EvolutionGate should be returned by the algorithm which will allow a compiler to optimize gates used to perform an evolution. These classes are being finalized in this PR: #6975.
More information about EvolutionGate can be found in this notebook: https://github.com/Cryoris/notebooks/blob/master/Evolution%20Gates.ipynb.
The development should start from this branch that already includes a preliminary implementation of TrotterQrte in the new unified Quantum Time Evolution framework (design available internally).

One should remove Trotterization in the unified design as necessary building blocks were introduced here:
#6975.
A Quantum Real Time Evolution algorithm based on Trotterization that follows the unified design is available here:
