Classical controlled custom instructions which act on two or three qubits are improperly drawn by latex drawer as below:

If more than 3 qubits are involved then the classical control wire is missing.
There was an attempt to close this issue in #4426 but OP got unresponsive.
If you are thing about working on this issue, have a look to #4426 before. Maybe you can use some of the work there. Don't forget to respect the authorship of the original contributor.
Hi @1ucian0 @ajavadia  . Now that all the classical bits are given in a single wire, I think we would also have to provide the control value when representing the classical control. I thought of something like this.


Do you have any suggestions?
PR #5855 fixes this issue. So, closing this issue.
