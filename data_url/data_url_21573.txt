Applets do not work and the dashboard raises a similar error at startup.
@sbourdeauducq , I expect this to be caused by the recent change to nixpkgs 20.09.
A working dashboard with applets.
I've reverted to 20.03, but I don't remember seeing this issue on 20.09...
That's a bummer. At least 2 machines here have these errors, both running on very similar systems. Also with a minimal Nix environment and ARTIQ project I can reproduce it.
Please let me know how I can provide more information to debug this issue.
Could it be the sipyco update? And does it occur with 20.03?
That looks like the error we got using quamash on py 3.8 due to the changes in asyncio. It should have been fixed by qasync
Sipyco does not seem to make a difference on the 20.09 channel. No problems occur when switching back to 20.03 (also with sipyco 1.2).
I have no experience with quamash, but if that is the problem and qasync is not an option, maybe 20.09 with Python 3.7 is an alternative.
Ok, shall keep release-5 on nixpkgs 20.03 then.
@lriesebos thanks for the bug report, this bit me today. Helped having a working solution already ready.
