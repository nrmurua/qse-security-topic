Timestamps added to lines of QISA. This is required for extracting timing of flux pulses.
Format is:
Line starts with integer denoting clock that corresponds to the start of the instruction.
Rest of the line contains the actual instruction.
Timestamp and instruction are separated using a colon (:) .
To ensure alignment integers are prepended with spaces.

By 'QISA', do you mean the assembly that will be accepted by the assembler? If it is the case, then the : may raise some confusion to the assembler since it is also used to denote a branch target label.
@gtaifu, We are talking about generating a different file that is identical to the QISA with the only difference being the addition of time labels per line. As this would be a separate (additional) file, I do not think this would lead to a direct conflict.
However, I think you raise a valid point. Is there another character you can suggest to separate the two pieces of information? Otherwise I suggest keeping it the same as the structure is quite uniform and otherwise well behaved.
Just pushed the feature. A separate file is created in the output direcotry with the name scheduledCCLightALAPTimeStamped.qisa. Till the time we are not decided about the field separator, I am using 4 spaces to generate the following code.
We can close the issue if it is in the desired format and we have decided the field separator character.
Currently live on the cclight_eqasm_compiler branch. Closing this issue.
