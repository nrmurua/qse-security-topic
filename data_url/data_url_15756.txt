Notice that circuit.decompose().qasm() works and isinstance(circuit, QuantumCircuit) is True.
There should note be exception. QuantumVolume should be dump as any custom gate.
_insert_composite_gate_definition_qasm call in ~/repos/qiskit-terra/qiskit/circuit/quantumcircuit.py seems to return None instead of the definition. But not sure why. My a class inheritance issue?
Ultimately, this is because UnitaryGate defines self._qasm_definition = None, and there's a check in the QASM-ifier that simply uses instruction._qasm_definition if the attribute is defined.  Since QuantumCircuit.qasm is accessing a private attribute, it's not really fair to say that UnitaryGate is violating the API, so it's probably best just to fix the check for now, and overhaul the QASM definition bits when we handle QASM 3.
Also, just for linking things together: this circuit causes the duplicate declaration bug of #7029.
edit: no, sorry, it's not the same cause here.
There are two options, synthesis or a better error. What do you think?
This should work, so there should be no error thrown at all.  I'll look into fixing the check now - my initial quick-and-dirty fix yesterday uncovered some more annoying bugs, then I had to put it aside to do other things.
