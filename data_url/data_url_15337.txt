Currently, the :meth:taper of the z2symmetry class does the following (I only kept the relevant parts)
For the QEOM algorithm in qiskit-nature, we encounter the problem of tapering products of operators. In that case, the first step is multiplicative while the second step is not : STEP1(A @ B) = STEP1(A) @ STEP1(B) but STEP2(A @ B) != STEP2(A) @ STEP2(B). This multiplicativity reduces the resource requirement of the first step.
I propose the addition of two additional methods :meth:convert_clifford and :meth:taper_clifford corresponding to step 1/2 respectively, to allow a more efficient management of the tapering of products. Overall, this would also contribute to making the tapering more understandable.
I know that the future of the z2symmetries has some uncertainties so this is more of a quick, short term possible improvement.
