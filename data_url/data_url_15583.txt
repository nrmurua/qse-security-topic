The BasicAer simulator is failing when the number of shots exceeds some threshold.
Output:
BasicAer should not have a shot limit.
No response
BasicAer is largely just meant for testing of things that need to run on a backend within Terra, and it's not efficient at all.  If there's a large number of shots, it's really a lot better to use the full Aer, and we probably don't really want to encourage people to use BasicAer for anything more than small-scale local testing.
Re-opening because we have decided we will support increased shots in BasicAer.  Since the max_shots field of backends should be an integer, there's probably no way to make this actually infinite, but we can bump up the limit to 2**32 or so.
In backendv2 you don't have to define a limit, it's validated in the Options object's validators when you try to update the value. If you don't set a validator it doesn't check anything and any value can be used. But yeah in BackendV1 it is a required integer field in the BackendConfiguration
We can just set max_shots to zero, right?

Is this issue still open or is someone fixing it at the moment?
It should be fixed by #7801. @alejomonbar please add the line "Fixes #7634" to the opening post there.
