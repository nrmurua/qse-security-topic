Updates to the AWS and IBMQ device lists often cause errors on when calling get_devices(refresh=True). If a particular backend is no longer supported and we haven't updated our MongoDB to reflect that yet, we want to catch the error on the front end, and just not load that device into the list, or simply list it as unavailable.
Match IBMQ backends displayed with list returned from qiskit.IBMQ.provider.backends(), e.g.
Also should include error catching for device_wrapper function
