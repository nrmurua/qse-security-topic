Description of the issue
Similar to cirq.SQRT_ISWAP_INV, define a global constant for cirq.ISWAP_INV and replace usages of cirq.ISWAP ** -1 with cirq.ISWAP_INV.

Cirq version
0.14.0
I could work on this.
@unaiic I've assigned it to you.
and replace usages of cirq.ISWAP ** -1 with cirq.ISWAP_INV
Help me understand here, why is this something we want to change ?
@MichaelBroughton I guess it's more a matter of convenience. @tanujkhattar Should we replace all ** -1 gates with _INV for consistency?
Yes, it's mostly about consistency. Since we have SQRT_ISWAP_INV, we should also have ISWAP_INV just to be consistent.
