After changing single tone profile, the parameters of DDS  don't correspond with that of the selected profile.
DDS parameters should change corresponding to the selected profile.
Profile 2 and profile 6 get wrong parameters: profile 2 get the same parameters as profile 3, and profile 6 get the same parameters as profile 7.


I also find that if I change the profile to some other profile before change it to the intended one can cause different results.
If I change the profile to 0, 3 or 7 in advance, then the result is as expected.

However, if I change it to profile 1 before, then the result is: 
If change it to profile 2: 
Change it to profile 4: 
Profile 5: 
Profile 6: 
Solved by adding self.cpld.io_update.pulse_mu(8) after self.cpld.set_profile(profile_n)
@MYCyw you should double-check the timing on this. The datasheet claims that the changing of the profile pins alone should be sufficient to update the profiles, but our experience at NIST with the AD9914 (which I am guessing uses similar logic) was that if you attempted to change more than one profile pin at once it didn't work properly. There is also the issue of making sure the profile pin changes meet the setup timing criteria based on SYNC_CLK. See p.41 of the datasheet https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad9910.pdf
Ran into this problem recently despite being able to switch between 6 profiles quickly during a pulse sequence, and found it was because we were profile switching in a regular kernel function. After testing, we believe that it's not an issue if you record any sequences involving profile switching onto core DMA.
For reference, we have AD9910 Urukuls (hardware rev 1.5) in 2x EEM mode.
@clayton-ho: Not sure this makes much sense on the face of it â€“ regular event submission and DMA should lead to exactly the same output (if it successfully executes on both).
