I get BLAS Info: INTEL MKL but INTEL MKL Ext: False when installing numpy with MKL via conda.
The environment is set up with conda on windows.
No response
This installs MKL but qutip doesn't correctly indentify the DLL.
When looking in the conda Libraries\bin directory, qutip searches for mkl_rt.dll which doesn't exist leading to the displayed result. However, the dll mkl_rt.1.dll does exist and a copy and paste + rename solves this.
