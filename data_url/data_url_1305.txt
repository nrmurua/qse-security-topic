Description of the issue
Follow-up to the changes requested in #5696.
The AQTDevice.neighbors_of() method can be removed and replaced by LineQubit.neighbor().
I am however not sure about the durations_of method.
The DeviceMetadata does not have an attribute for gate durations.
There is only one derived class, GridDeviceMetadata, which has a gate_durations dictionary,
but AQTDevice is not GridDevice so this class is not appropriate.
@MichaelBroughton , @dstrain115 - should I be adding a new AQTDeviceMetadata class with an extra gate_durations attribute?
You will have to create a new derived class AQTDeviceMetadata which exposes the relevant properties / methods like durations_of and neighbors_of
