I am running the tutorial 5-more-gate in Pluto.jl, and am getting an error on the following cell:
UndefVarError: label not defined
It is another outdated tutorial, the function name has been changed to “addlabel”, sorry for that. We should have added a deprecation warning.

Thanks. I don't recall finding addLabel either. But I will try this out.
