After describing a rotation gate in the configuration file like this:
and using it in an alias decomposition in the configuration file as well
OpenQL confuses the rotation parameter -- that is a classical register (-/+ 90) -- with a quantum register. This results in a compilation failure.
Now supported by new-style decomposition
