Currently, if you want to use a default pass manager with only a single pass changed, e.g. for example the swap mapper changed, you need to go and create a whole new pass manager.  It should be possible to simply replace one pass in a pass manger with another.  Something like:
An index is used here since you could have multiple passes of the same type.  It would also be nice to be able to slice a pm and get a new pm, e.g. pm2 = pm[:5] which would save people from having to rewrite things like this:
I agree.
I also think I should be able to draw a pass manager
pm.draw()
and it make a flow diagram of all the passes I have in my pass manager with the inputs going into them
