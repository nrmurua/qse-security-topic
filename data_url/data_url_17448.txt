It is not possible to map a single qubit circuit to a device qubit that is not zero.

Note also that the layout used is not valid for the device, but no error is thrown.  I think all of this is due to this:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/ef46e442e4320500c847da617aadd5476bca4b70/qiskit/transpiler/transpiler.py#L190
that sets the coupling map to None, and therefore the transpiler skips the swap mapper that currently implements the mapping to device qubits.  Increasing the quantum register size to two or more gives a circuit with correct mapping, and which is the width of the device.
#2110 should fix this one
