Hello,
I tried to write a surface code example. I put here, hope it is fine. I will be happy if you can check :) Since the toric code is written as a hypergraph product code (HGP), the non-full rank matrix of the repeating code is used: this is an n×n matrix with rank n-1. If I remove one of the rows - in the code this is the last row - then I have an n-1×n matrix with full rank. I have replaced the Hr matrix with this matrix.
I attached the result in the absence of errors. However, I am not sure for X stabilizer code.
I also did not add z stabilizers too
