As a contributor it is frustrating to having to keep pressing the "Merge with master" button on my PRs. Also, the Cirq mergebot is flaky / rarely up.
What do you think about https://github.com/marketplace/actions/autosquash?
I don't see a drawback except I would miss CirqBot's cute little face.
There is no reason we couldn't enable it and test it out for a while while keeping old autobot around.
I'm going to close this - the decision for now is to keep running Cirq automerge bot.
