Engine that creates program and job needs support as well as just "create program" then use this as a sampler.
Oh just found it.
Actually we need to make sure that QuantumEngineSampler also supports the Program object in engine
The Sampler interface has a fundamental problem that it assumes that you pass in a program each time
We could definitely generalize sampler to have some concept of passing in a program reference. Default behavior would be to throw a "that program does not exist" exception.
Fixed in #1982
