Description
Repo's About current URL, https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/system, was built three months ago, and local builds are since failing due to installed NumPy being version 1.22.1 and Python being < 3.8.
We should either update the local requirements file or switch the URL to https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_system/sdk_index.html
IMO switch the URL
