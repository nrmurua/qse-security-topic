NLocal raises UnboundLocalError if reps==0.
The error message does not look comprehensive.
output
Display a comprehensive message to ask users to set reps >= 1.
Check reps >= 1 and if reps <= 0 a message should be displayed such "reps should be larger or equal to 1`.
Hello,
I am new to open source contribution and I think this should be a good first issue to work on.
If this is available please can I work on it ?
Thank You!
Feel free to work on it! This is a good first issue indeed.
I was thinking to check in the init class constructor if reps<=0 I would raise a TypeError.
Something Like this on line 138 in n_local.py
if reps <= 0:
raise TypeError('reps should be larger than or equal to 1')
also, add the information of new raised error in comment line 116 in n_local.py
Please let me know if there are any simple alternative approaches that I might have missed?
Feel free to work on it! This is a good first issue indeed.
Is the approach I mentioned earlier fine ?
Thank You!
It is! However I think raising a ValueError would be more appropriate.

Okay will do the code and submit a pull request!
