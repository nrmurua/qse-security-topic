It seems that we can't get away with the light-weight functional wrapper for long. A qgrad.Qobj class seems necessary. What do you guys think?
For instance in expectation function that I am working on, I could just use .is_oper attribute to decide whether to take trace or not
But we need to be cautious not to pass call objects as parameters to functions that we need to take a derivative of
It looks a fair working route to me.
@nathanshammah Now that I look back, I think we will run into the same problem with qgrad class as we did with Qobj in QutTiP. I guess we better stick with the functional approach (at least for the moment) as there is no urgent need yet.
