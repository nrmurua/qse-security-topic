This would be very useful for me because I have an algorithm which swaps the order of qubits but I don't want to add extra gates to swap them back. Perhaps the run methods of the simulator can take in an optional final_qubit_order argument or something like that?
Maybe it's better to have a general method for reordering wavefunctions? Does that exist already?
I realized that resolving #281 made this no longer important to me.
