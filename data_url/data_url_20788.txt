Travis CI has changed and they don't allow an infinite number builds for OSS anymore. This means that our Arm64-tests-on-hardware are not being run reliably at the moment.
We could, following https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing, try to ask for more build credits. We would need to figure out how much credits we need then.
