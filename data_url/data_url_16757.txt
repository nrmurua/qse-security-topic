@ewinston says in #3864:
In PR #3739, open controlled gates were implemented. With that PR a new keyword argument was added to specify the control state,
XGate().control(3, ctrl_state=6)
This creates a 4 qubit gate where the first three qubits are controls and the fourth qubit is the target where the x-gate may be applied. A ctrl_state may alternatively be expressed as an integer string,
XGate().control(3, ctrl_state='110')
where it is more apparent which qubits are open and closed. In this case when q[0] is open and q[1] and q[2] are closed the x-gate will be applied to q[4].
As a reference #3867 implements open controlled gates for the text visualizer like this:
The current output for circuit.draw('mpl') is:

Hi @ewinston , I am new to qiskit, but I would like to work on it if you don't mind.
@1ucian0, I played around with this a bit and think I know how to make the changes. I'm not sure if @JayantiSingh is still interested, but if not, I can take it on.
Haven't heard any pinging. Shall I proceed?
Thanks, Luciano. I'd already started working on it, and this is what I have done. Given this code,

Is this what you are looking for? I also have a couple of questions.
