Hello Team,
As mentioned in the step4 of linux
To generate HTML documentation of the API, run:
ninja gen_docs
The same way , there is no such index.html i have found in docs/doxygen/html/index.html in winodws 10 compilation.
Is these html files provide us API that we can use to create a demo. Can you please provide me the file structure of the html file.
If you run ninja gen_docs in, say, the build directory, the index.html file should be present at build/docs/html/index.html. Let me know if you're unable to find it there.
I have used Windows 10 compilation , and i got nothing in index.htnl

You should look for the docs\html folder under the build output directory (i.e the directory in which you run ninja gen_docs).
Can you name this directory build and try opening C:\Backup\liboqs-master\build\docs\html\index.html?
I'm closing this as there has been no activity for over a week. If the issue persists, feel free to re-open the issue or create a new one.
