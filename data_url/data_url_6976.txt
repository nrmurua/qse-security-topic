When you Hadamard transform 16 qubits, the output state gets reweighted in a way that causes the Bloch displays to stick way outside the normal range. Figure out what it's happening and fix it.

The shader compiler was doing something shader in the coordinate arithmetic. Passing in the 0.5 as a uniform prevents those optimizations. (uuuurrrggghhhh)
