What are the minimum preconditions for pyzx.extract_circuit to work? i presume equal number of inputs & outputs is the barest minimum, but I am not clear on the rest. I often get error like:
but I am tnot sure if that is a bug or if there is a problem with my graph
Hmm, that particular one looks like a bug.
But to answer your question: it is really hard to give necessary preconditions for the extraction to work, as it depends on the graph having a gflow. But in any case: all spiders should be Z-spiders and maximally fused together.
