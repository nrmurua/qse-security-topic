The coverall integration is nice, but could we configure it not to comment each and every travis build on every PR? I think is is rather noisy and generates a lot of email notifications... Perhaps the badge in the README file would be sufficient?
You can click on the coveralls bot icon and block the user.   This will stop you from getting the emails.
OK thanks, I've done that now and it is better now.
