Output for a repetition code run gives significantly different behaviour than expected.
Repetition codes were run on ibmqx5 with an encoded bit value of 0. The output should be 0 on all qubits. Given noise levels and previous results, it can be expected that 1 will instead be output for each qubit for 10-20% of the samples. This is seen for codes of size d=3 to d=7 using the implementation here.
For a d=8 code, it is found that some qubits output 1 for 50-80% of the samples. A comparison of recent runs showing the expected behaviour for d=7, and the unexpected behaviour for d=8, can be found here.
If this is noise, a solution is obviously outside the scope of the SDK. However, it could be that something strange is going on in the process of taking the QASM and turning it into a pulse sequence. I'd suggest looking further down the stack for a possible bug.
This issue relates to jobs created by this file. A stripped down version focussed on the job with the issue can be found here. Results for runs with and without the issue are compared here.
@decodoku We fixed a problem that was causing some of the CX gates to drift, so results should be more stable now.  However, I ran your notebook, and it still is exhibiting the same behavior for d = 8. I'm going to have to dig in a bit deeper to try to figure out where this error comes from.
I think we close this as its not in the sdk. But i let @hanheepaik  and you debug to determine if it is the pulse generating code.
