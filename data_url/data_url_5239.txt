It's possible we have superfluous syncs. There are the right number between master and worker nodes. However, it's still worth digging deeper. I think it may be possible to remove at least one pair of syncs. Also: there is a sync in reorganize-amplitudes, (and execute-instruction, calls reorganize-amplitudes). It would be better to keep all the syncs in the main loop for both worker and master.
Indeed. At least one pair was redundant.
