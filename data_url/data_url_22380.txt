Hi,
I'm a new postdoc at NIST.
Hope this wasn't already reported.
Terminal output:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\Anaconda3\envs\artiq-main\lib\site-packages\artiq\gui\applets.py", line 328, in delete
self.applet_uids.remove(item.applet_uid)
KeyError: False
Best,
Daniel
The condition is not "the last applet", but I've been able to reproduce this on Linux.
though only partially. I had several applet UIDs incorrect set to False in my artiq_dashboard.pyon which is what was causing this bug, but I don't know how they ended up with this value.
Thanks.
D.
I see this as well with the browser.
From #444
Delete artiq_gui.pyon and start the GUI
Right click in applets pane -> new applet
Right click in applets pane -> new applet.
