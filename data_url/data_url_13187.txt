Despite executors supporting functions which output acceptable forms of bit strings, there is not public method to get bit string output once the user-defined function is converted to an executor. We do have the executor._run function, but this is still semi-private. We should upgrade this function, or write a new one as suggested in #1614 (comment) to allow for this functionality.
Community call decision is to upgrade the current function.
