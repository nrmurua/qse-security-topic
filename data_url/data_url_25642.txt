Add an executor plugin which interfaces with the OpenPBS job scheduler used in HPC environments.  This executor should be similar in format and style to the Slurm executor.  For details on how to translate Slurm commands to PBS commands, see resources here and here.  For a more complete view of documentation around PBS, see Altair's PBS User Guide.
Has this executor been developed?
Is there a timeline for its release?

@Vespertili0 we currently have an unreleased version of this plugin.  If you are interested in testing and providing feedback please let me know.
@wjcunningham7 I am interested in using covalent in workflows similar to your advanced tutorial on quantum chemistry (https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/3_QuantumChemistry/nitrogen_copper_interaction/source.html).
The HPC cluster I have access to runs with PBS, so, I am happy to test the plugin.
