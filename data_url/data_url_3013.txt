When a gate is composite, it is composite with respect to a fixed set of other gates.  For different contexts these decompositions are either the one you want or not the one you want.
Ultimately circuits end up being written in some gate set (for now just Xmon at the bottom), where we use an extension to define the mapping.  Can we do a simpler thing for composite gates, i.e us an extension to define the composite gate?  I think this may be possible now, but we should have an example of this and document it in compositegate's doc.
I'm doing an expand_composite point optimizer right now, which I think will work as I described.
Hmmmmm. I was thinking of a gate implementing Composite as a hint "Hey, you can turn my into other things. Maybe those other things will be useful.". You're right that it doesn't make as much sense in device-independent contexts.
