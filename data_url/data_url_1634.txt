'cirq.sim.simulator' has no attribute 'SimulatesExpectationValues'.
How to solve this problem?
Hey @sassan72, please paste a snippet of the program that throws this error so that we may reproduce it.
example of page 7 of Quantum TensorFlow paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02989.pdf.
qubit = cirq . GridQubit (0 , 0)
theta = sympy . Symbol (’theta ’)
c = cirq . Circuit ( cirq .X ( qubit ) ** theta )
c_tensor = tfq . convert_to_tensor ([ c] * 3)
theta_values = tf . constant ([[0] ,[1] ,[2]])
m = cirq . Z( qubit )
paulis = tfq . convert_to_tensor ([ m ] * 3)
expectation_op = tfq . get_expectation_op ()
output = expectation_op (
c_tensor , [’theta ’], theta_values , paulis )
abs_output = tf . math . abs ( output )
I don't get your error. I get a different error: tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: pauli_sums must be rank 2. Got rank 1. [Op:TfqSimulateExpectation]

Thanks @vtomole . The error you are getting is what should be happening in your snippet. This is a mistake in the whitepaper that we will fix in the v2 which should be coming in the next few months. The fix is to ensure that the paulis tensor is rank 2 instead of rank1. You could do this by adding another list dimension to it before converting it to a tensor.
Will give:
I'm going to go ahead and close this for now since this isn't a problem with Cirq it's a problem with TFQ. @sassan72 would you mind re-opening this issue on the TFQ github with a small snippet of code that can reproduce the error you are seeing (if it is different from the one Victory got) along with the version of Cirq + TFQ you are using ?
