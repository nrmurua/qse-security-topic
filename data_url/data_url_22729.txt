Parameters such as device S/N are passed as command line arguments and are controller-specific. They cannot be extracted generally from the DDB, and the code to perform this extraction and instantiate the driver is in each controller and should not be duplicated.
The current relying on special DDB entries that duplicate controller command line parameters is broken. The function get_from_ddb should be replaced by a simple ddb.get(key)["command"] (+ error handling).
Running actual controllers in the test benches solves this problem and improves test coverage.
