I used circuit_drawer() on a Jupyter notebook without having latex installed on my computer, but instead of getting the message WARNING: Unable to compile latex. Is pdflatex installed?, I got the following error:

Thanks @artix41 for the report - and for taking the time of provide a spot-on and informative suggested solution!
