Part of the decomposition of measure_observables described in #1028 is to pull out calibration of observable expectations. Calibration can be performed after--and largely independently from--the raw estimation of expectations; one caveat to this is that the symmetrization level should be consistent between the initial estimation and the later calibration (in general 'consistency' may depend on the noise model).
Move the calibration code in measure_observables into its own method. This will require collecting all of the results from the loop in measure_observables and passing them to this new method.
