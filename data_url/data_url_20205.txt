I'm unable to reproduce this locally with circleci local on either of my two machines. Is anyone else able to? @baentsch @xvzcf
I am unable to do so.
Both on my regular Linux VM and OSX natively:
=================== 381 passed, 8 skipped in 614.32 seconds ====================
so, No, sorry, can't reproduce.
On the hunch that limited resources are the problem, I also set up a small Linux VM (2 cores, 2G RAM) and retried there: It just took an eternity to run but then returned the same result: All OK.
Thanks guys. So should I turn it asan off from the nightly builds? Or skip the SPHINCS schemes for asan on CircleCI?
Unless many more seemingly-hard-to-debug errors arise, we should just skip SPHINCS for now.
Okay, I'll try to work on that sometime.
Something mentioned on today's call made me wonder whether pytest running in parallel with asan turned on is exhausting the limited resources of CircleCI's build machine.  @xvzcf, could we come up with some CMake cleverness so that the run_tests command doesn't add the --numprocesses=auto flag when "${CIRCLE_JOB}"="ubuntu-bionic-x86_64-asan" && "x${CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM}" != "x" (the latter condition (checking whether CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM is empty or not) is, as far as I can tell, a way of detecting that it is being run live on a CircleCI server, rather than with circleci local)?
Looking into it.
It seems you both were right @baentsch and @dstebila, this build running with --numprocesses=1 passes. I'll open the PR tomorrow.
Fixed by #743.
