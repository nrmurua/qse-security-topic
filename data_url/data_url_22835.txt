Ansys supports synchronised variables for optimetrics sweeps, meaning that one can specify sweeps where more than one variable change at a time. Support for this could be added in Optimetrics.create_setup by allowing the given variable argument to be a list (or tuple), and accordingly have the swp_params be a 2D list.
See the following figure (especially the result in the bottom-right corner)
