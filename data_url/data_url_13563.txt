There is an exception when Tensorflow-quantum is not installed, so that the tests of the documentation executors should not throw an error. However, when running such tests with make docs from root directory in bash, two errors occur, as reported below. This is not the expected behavior.
If tf-quantum is installed, with the additional command
then the tests run fine. Since this is the case in CI, this is not picked up by github actions.
Use the about() function to summarize information on operating system, python version and dependencies.
Looks like you didn't install tensorflow either -- the try/except block only handles missing tensforflow-quantum
Oh, I see, thanks. The documentation says that tests in docs should work if "pip install -r docs/requirements.txt" is not run:
I will open a simple PR putting the TF import in the 'try' condition.
