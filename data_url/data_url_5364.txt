Removing deprecated tape execution methods in PennyLane (PR #2339) fails  Lightning Python tests. We should remove the deprecated tape.execute() and tape.execute_device() methods.
@maliasadi let me know how this one goes, and if you need any help/changes are needed to PL.
Hopefully, this should just be a case of updating places in the test where tape.execute(dev) are called, to dev.execute(tape) or dev.batch_execute([tape]).
Or the solution you have of qml.execute([tape]) should also work, and is maybe more future proof since it is independent of the device API :)
Thanks @josh146! I used qml.execute([tape], dev) instead of the dev.execute method. I am glad that you just approved it ðŸ™‚
