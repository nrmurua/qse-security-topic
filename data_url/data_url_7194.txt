Particularly the energy levels -- there is a lot of redundancy for species with hyperfine structure. This also leads to redundancy in specifying Einstein-A coefficients for transitions. E.g. in yb171.jl:
All of these transitions are possible and have the same Einstein-A coefficient from atomic structure, hence the redundancy of specifying them all individually. (Yes, this is my fault.)
