The way Sirius dependencies are enabled here:
https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/tools/toolchain/install_cp2k_toolchain.sh#L299
means that they are installed even when the user disables Sirius explicitly with --with-sirius=no. It would be better if they were only enabled when Sirius itself is enabled, perhaps with the exception of ELPA and spglib.
