Need to define how Krauss operators are implemented.  (Other name for this is Operator Sum Representation).
Should these be just a different Gate feature? (one that implements as _kraus smilar to _unitary)?  Or do we need to muck more generally with a new Operation.
An important question is how to handle this when these are measurement results.
