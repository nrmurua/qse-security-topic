Presently there is no clear way to identify if an instance of the dashboard has lost connection to its master. This can happen often in a lab environment - where there are likely to be many instances of the dashboard spread around - after the master has been restarted.
The current behavior after the connection is lost is that the schedule remains unchanged, and one 'quamash.QEventLoop' exception appears in the log. Only after trying to schedule / delete an experiment do any further error message appear, and these 'quamash.QEventLoop' exceptions do not make it clear what the cause of the fault is.
