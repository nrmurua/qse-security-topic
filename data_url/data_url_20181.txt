A recent nightly build with AddressSanitizer failed for SIKE-p434-compressed.  I tried reproducing locally, and it seems non-deterministic: it fails about 20% of the time when I run locally.
Two different errors occur, see logs below.
You may have to run the last command (tests/test_kem SIDH-p434-compressed) several times to see the error; I observed it only approximately 20% of the time.
The SIKE team is investigating this. We shouldn't wait for this for v0.4.
This issue was triggered by the "invalid ciphertext" test performed by libOQS test_kem program. The test generates a fully random (not genuine) ciphertext as input to the decapsulation algorithm. It turns out that one of the parameters in the ciphertext is an entry for a lookup table, so the random ciphertext would select a random entry that could be outside the table limits.
A pull request with a fix is provided.

Thanks, @geovandro. I'll take a look in ~2 weeks when I'm back from vacation.
