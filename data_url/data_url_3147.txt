If useful, provide a numbered list of the steps that result in the error.

Operating System:
Python Version (python -V):
Quilc Version (quilc --version):
QVM Version (qvm --version):
Python Environment Details (pip freeze or conda list):
exponential_map takes a parameter and returns a function closing over that parameter. But, the returned function includes conditionals testing the value of the parameter. These conditionals should probably be moved outside the body of the returned function. OTOH, as @appleby mentioned in another channel, the value that is closed over includes mutable attributes, so someone might be relying on this behavior.

We could create a deep copy term, which would effectively make it immutable.
This should be addressed together with #373 and #537
