Currently, the regtest script runs the collection of results at the end, just after the run of the results:

It turns out that this procedure is very inefficient on Daint since we run in batch and it is sequential (a slow because of disk access). Therefore I would propose to have two phases:
This can be achieved by adding a new option to the regtest script, something like:
default (no option): runs tests and collect results
-collect=no: runs only tests
-collect=yes: only collect results
Any opinion?
I've actually just started to rewrite the do_regtest script in Python. I should have a working version in a week or so. I propose we then incorporate your improvements there.
Most tests have now switch to do_regtest.py, which offers the new --keepalive mode.
