A statement like "cu1(-pi) q[0], q[1];" cannot be parsed correctly, unless we insert a space like so: "cu1(- pi) q[0], q[1];". This problem can be reproduced on https://quantum-circuit.com/ as well.
The antlr grammar needs to be changed. A quick search found some discussions:

@wh5a thank you for reporting. Will be fixed asap. In meantime, you can use -1*pi instead -pi.
