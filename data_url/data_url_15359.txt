Now that the first release candidate for the 0.22.0 release has been tagged, the stable branch for the 0.22 series has been created and we can start developing the 0.23.0 release on main. This commit bumps all the version strings from 0.22.0 to 0.23.0 (and the backport branch for mergify to 0.22) accordingly to differentiate the main branch from 0.22.*.
