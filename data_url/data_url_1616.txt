I filled in a diagram test from output during one run:
But then it fails in the next run:
The issue is that the hash id is going into the diagram, but hash ids are not stable over time.
The hash is entirely based on the contents, which we can see anyways. I suggest just dropping it.
My reasoning behind including the hash:
An example from the CircuitOperation tests:

Note from cirq cync: the hash is not useful in the diagram and you can get it from the repr (or from other means) if you have a use case where you want to compare equality.
Is #4712 what you are thinking of?  I (in my ignorance) feel like CircuitOperation could benefit from:
Responded to (2) in #3605.
Your thoughts on CircuitGate mirror the early design stages for CircuitOperation - we strongly considered that option, but ultimately determined that CircuitOperation was the cleaner solution. This mostly boiled down to Circuits being more similar to Operations (both have defined qubits, while Gates do not) and Operations having better access to certain features (e.g. tags are defined at the Operation level).
I believe this issue is now fixed with merge of PR #4712
