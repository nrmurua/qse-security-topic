These should optimize to an empty circuit.
Input 1:
Current output:
Input 2:
Current output:
Hmmm. The first one would be fixed if you optimized again, but the second one is a fixed point.
Maybe we need a "commute forward looking for your anti-self" kind of check.
Although I think this would be great to do, it is quite difficult to pick a stopping point when it comes to optimizers. I think "all optimizations cancel locally" is as good a line as any. Also... this is now obsoleted by xmons being an older architecture.
