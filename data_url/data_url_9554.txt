I suggest using a more modern documentation style, to increase legibility but also attractiveness ✨.
Moreover, the current readthedocs sphinx_rtd_theme style behaves poorly on large screen size:

Compare this to for example furo:

There are many good themes on sphinx-themes.org. I suggests using furo—for which black docs have recently changed by the way—but it really is up to us.
I agree that the large screen size behaviour is annoying, but I must say I'm not a big fan of the furo design. I also think a point should be made in favour of ReadTheDocs for its widespread use and consequent user-familiarity.
How about we select a few candidate themes and have an informal election?
Yes ReadTheDocs is widespread, but for me it is not a pro actually ; it shouts "good old python" rather than "up to date maintained package".

It's really a matter of taste, so that would be the nicest way to do so!
