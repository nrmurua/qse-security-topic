How to reproduce the issue

Cirq version
You can get the cirq version by printing cirq.__version__. From the command line:
0.13.1
The problem is that the symbols on the boxes are generated entirely based on wire_symbols:

As a comparison, the text representation of a circuit also consider the exponent:

May I be assigned with this issue? I guess cirq-web can generally follow the same pattern.
