The gate declaration paragraph is not explicit about the qubit argument type (as it was ambiguous in the QASM2 specification). It currently says:
The parameters are identifiers with arbitrary-precision numeric types. The qubit arguments are identifiers. If there are no variable parameters, the parentheses are optional. At least one qubit argument is required. The arguments in qargs cannot be indexed within the body of the gate definition.
After talking with @kdk, we think it should be more explicit that the parameters are always single qubits. For example in:
The variable broadcast g t[0]; g t[1]; happens at g calling time, not at U time.
Yes the qubit parameters are always single qubits. Could you open a pull request to update the language in the spec?
