The bqskit runtime only sends logs through that have a logger whose root is bqskit, e.g., bqskit.passes.something or bqskit.ir.something.
Consider having both white-list and black-list
A workaround: name the logger bqskit.dummy.your_logger_name and it should work rather than use name  as a default.
