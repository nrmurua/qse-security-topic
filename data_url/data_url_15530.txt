The qasm exporter gives an invalid qasm in the order of gate definition, this happens with RC3XGate and C4XGate in a subcircuit.
Run:
Output:
Read the qasm, leads to error: Cannot find gate definition for 'rcccx', line 4 file
The generated qasm should have had rcccx and mcx definitions swapped.
Provided that #7148 will be fixed, then it would be sufficient to reorder the gate definition. Thus fixing this bug, with a post-processing reordering will probably benefit also #7769 .
I am wondering if you think that this and #7769 have the same root cause or they have different reason why they end up with out of order gate definitions?
These features of the program concur to produce the error (removing any of them result in a valid qasm):
Looking forward to hearing your feedback on this situation, thanks in advance
