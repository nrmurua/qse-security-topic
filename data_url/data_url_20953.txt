avx2 instructions found in keccak library, which is being used by QRL for hashing purposes. User's hardware doesn't support avx2 instructions.
May i propose to mention this info, together win AES-NI, as a prereq on https://docs.theqrl.org/node/QRLnode/ ?
Will add and update the documentation to include this requirement.
@fr1t2 awesome. Tho i think avx2 are not really necessarry, it's just enabled by default during build process. Folks here claim it has little impact:
