OpenQASM version:
3.0 (0.4.0)
Python version:
3.11
Operating system:
macOS 13.0 (Ventura)
What is the current behavior?
Parsing a OpenQASM string with arrayType inputs raises an error.
Steps to reproduce the problem
Create a new Conda environment
raises error when processing the last line, in openqasm3/parser.py in visitIODeclarationStatement line
type=self.visit(ctx.scalarType())
What is the expected behavior?
OpenQASM grammar definition shows support for arrayTypes https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm/blob/main/source/grammar/qasm3Parser.g4#L96 but visitIODeclaration only visits scalarType() as mentioned above.
This differs from visitClassicalDeclarationStatement where type does include arrayTypes():
type=self.visit(ctx.scalarType() or ctx.arrayType())
Suggested solutions (Optional)
Adding or ctx.arrayType() to the visit call in visitIODeclarationStatement, similar to the statement in visitClassicalDeclarationStatement
how did openqasm apply for angle type?
I believe it is handled as one of the scalar types if you look at the parser.py file line 743:
https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm/blob/07b41d01042a35768c4e26a83ce52b97961d0b84/source/openqasm/openqasm3/parser.py#LL743C45-L743C45
angle type represent of phase of quantum state but scalar type represent amplituted of quantum state, i have a confussion about role of angle type if this is handled as scalar type
