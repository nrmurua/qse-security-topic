Controlled gates (other than RX, RY, RZ) with symbolic parameters will not compile.
Controlled RX, RY, RZ gates with symbolic parameters will compile (see related issue).
Either run the example code provided, or:

Quilc version 1.26.0
Fair enough. A generic analytic compilation routine for parametric gates, including controlled versions of simple gates, is somewhere between hard and impossible â€” but for specific cases, we can probably figure it out.
Definitely CONTROLLED PHASE is a variant of CONTROLLED RZ up to local phase. I think, but I am not certain, that CONTROLLED XY p q r is XY q r followed by a (CZ p q)-conjugate of XY q r, maybe with some more local gates to balance out phases. One would have to chase it out.
It doesn't look like there's any phase to chase. Here's some quilc -P -m output:
which looks like the controlled version of
For funsies, here's a recipe for CONTROLLED CONTROLLED XY(0.8) 3 2 1 0:
and a recipe for FORKED XY(0.35, 0.25) 2 1 0:
@stylewarning: This sounds like it should be tagged "good first issue". I don't have tag permissions, myself.
Just to finish the job, here's an example circuit which relates CONTROLLED PHASE and CONTROLLED RZ by implementing the identity:
