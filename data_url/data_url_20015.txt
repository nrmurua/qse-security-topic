In preparation for the 0.7.2 release, I ran the Valgrind constant time tests. Picnic is failing them. It seems all Picnic variants fail.  We previously had suppression files in tests/constant_time/sig/passes/picnic and .../picnic3 but something must have changed in the Picnic implementation that makes those suppressions no longer match.

This yields the output in the attached file, with a few excerpts below
@sebastinas Do you have any insight on this?
The issue in picnic_L1 is a regression and fixed locally. The issues in picnic3 are due to refactoring and consequently the suppression file no longer matches.
I can update the suppression files.
I can update the suppression files.
Thanks! Will you do this in the PR landing the local changes from @sebastinas or separately?

Looks like @sebastinas is already on top of things in #1280.
Fixed by #1280.
Unfortunately, picnic3 still fails the test :-( Reproduce by building for "skylake": cmake -GNinja -DOQS_OPT_TARGET=skylake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DOQS_ENABLE_TEST_CONSTANT_TIME=ON ..

Maybe @sebastinas only worried about picnic(base), not picnic3? Could either of you please check/retest again, @christianpaquin ? Maybe I did something wrong...
It's the different code paths the SHA3 implementation takes (AVX2 vs opt64). I'll update the suppression files.
… this would all be a lot easier if declassification of certain values would be possible then we would need to play whack-a-mole with the suppression files.
@baentsch Please test #1286.

We have the declassification macros in tests/test_kem.c:

I guess it would be possible to use macros in the Picnic code to do declassification when the appropriate #ifdef is set...
@baentsch Please test #1286.
Constant runtime tests for picnic now all passed: Thanks, @sebastinas !
Fixed by #1286.
