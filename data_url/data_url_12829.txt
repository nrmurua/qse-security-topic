This is a great first issue for somebody familiar with LaTeX but not very familiar with Q#!
The quick reference has last been updated for Q# 0.3, which is almost a year old now. We need to update it to the latest version (currently 0.9) following the Q# language documentation. Some of the things that need to be added/updated, at a glance:
There are probably other things I'm missing - this is just a list to start with.
Also, the list of resources needs to be reconsidered - for example, we have a lot more Q# repositories now compared to a year ago.
Ill take this.
Thank you for picking this up! Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any doubts about anything.
To link the issue with the work in progress, the PR is open at #207.
This has been fixed in #207 - thank you!
The second part of the change would be to include more information on quantum primitives, such as quantum gates and measurements, and on the commonly used library methods such as ApplyToEach, but this can (and should!) be covered by a separate issue/PR.
