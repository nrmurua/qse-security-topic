During #4454 , it came up that DAGCircuit.compose will remap clbits used in classical instructions, but does not always remap clbits used in conditional gates.
Conditional gates in the in the composed circuit should have their conditions updated to match the provided clbits. In the example above, the condition should be = 2 and the output counts should all be 110.
DAGCircuit._map_condition is already called by DAGCircuit.compose, but needs to be updated for the possibility that the wire_map reorders bits in the classical register used by condition.
