Description of the issue
/cirq/protocols/quil.py does not have any tests.  Not sure how it got past the coverage check.  (Quil code in contrib does have tests).
I think cirq.circuits.quil_output_test.py covers it...
I think this might be able to be closed. I do not see that file anymore, and the replacements (I think) look to be tested:
