Hello,
I downloaded the latest version of the code (updated in the weekend) and when trying to compile from the directory "tests" I got the following error:
cd ../src && make util.o
make[1]: Entering directory '/home/sellier/qbsolv-master/src'
make[1]: 'util.o' is up to date.
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/sellier/qbsolv-master/src'
cd ../src && make solver.o

This used to work a few days ago. Did somebody change something?
I hope this helps,

This should be due to the dependency on the googletest framework being added. (you noted the failure to document that in another issue)
Would you mind trying again with that library installed?
It was due to googletest indeed. I installed it on a GNU/Linux system and compiled the files in the "tests" directory, it worked (I had to modify the Makefile though).
Thanks for the hint!
Where they only modifications for your local path to the library? If it was something else I'd love to know.
The dependency on gtest has been noted, so I'm going to close this based on that, but additions to the readme are, of course, welcome.
