When multiple packages reference the same (dependency) package, but with conflicting version requirements, pip is not able to derive the common working version subset.
One solution would be to keep all dependencies in sync across Ocean packages, but an easier solution is to pull (some) deps one level up, to the SDK.
This should be resolved with pip 20.3+, as it now implements a proper dependency resolver.
