Schedule is incompatible with Runtime (see Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime#571). ScheduleBlock should be used instead. Example:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/36c91add58a6649fd0788c2abc7a5a236e2e6098/qiskit/transpiler/passes/calibration/rzx_builder.py#L172
Now this problem is fixed with #8949 . It would be great if you could test new branch in the runtime environment.
