Small bug in layout of the GDS/Q3D export window in the gui when you rescale it

Try to rescale the window
The window should rescale the contnes inside
use a layout container
@JeremyDrysdale-ibm  someone who knows the gui can help tackle this, shouldn't be too hard. Mostly add a layout container I think to the way it is laid out.
