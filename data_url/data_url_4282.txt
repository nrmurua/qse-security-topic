I have the following QASM file that I hope to be able to convert to a Qibo circuit.
In the above file, gate command is used to create a new gate.
However, running
circuit = models.Circuit.from_qasm(qasm_code)
gives me the following error
ValueError: QASM command gate is not recognized.
May I know what should I do to overcome this challenge?  It seems that parse_qasm didn't handle gate command.
Thanks.
