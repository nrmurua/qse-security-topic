Pretty sure the recent quimb release broke some of our tests, as seen here:
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/runs/6903632243?check_suite_focus=true
The fix should be as simple as updating the strings, but we might also consider pinning our quimb version to prevent this in the future.
Some discussion from the PR: we should avoid testing exact-match for string representation of quimb objects. Basic checking for expected substrings (e.g. output_state: TensorNetwork) should be sufficient.
