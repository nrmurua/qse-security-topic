Hi, is it possible to illustrate an example code in which a quantum circuit is taken as an input and the qiskit backend properties are feed to a custom compiler to perform noisy simulation?
Hi @rockingcubes,
There is an example notebook that describes how to build custom compilers https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/examples/qip-customize-device.ipynb
If you can extract the properties including the pulse strength and duration etc from the qiksit backend. Then you can use them to build the compiler.
BTW, I would recommend to use the separate package qutip-qip which is same as qutip.qip but with a few new features. We are also planning to build a Qiskit backend in that package in the next few month.
