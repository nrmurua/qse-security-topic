Currently the Linux x86_64 wheelbuilder image depends on an older version of the manylinux images, resulting in binaries compiled with older (v8.x) of GCC. Newer versions of GCC see to perform better optimisations of fundamental complex kernel operations, and should be favoured. We should upgrade the image from manylinux2010 to manylinux2014, which upgrades the GCC version to 10+
