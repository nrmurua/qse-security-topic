Hi! I am working with pyrpl for my bachelor's thesis. For our specific application, quantization noise is quite significant. My supervisor (Gary Steele) mentioned a way to reduce this using decimation averaging. Using this you can get an extra 2log(decimation) bits of accuracy. My question is why does the pyrpl scope throw away these extra useful bits after averaging? (
