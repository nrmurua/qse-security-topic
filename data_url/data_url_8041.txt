Summing a list of qobj does not work anymore since the change in the qobj class.
Summing should be equal to (qobj_list[0]+qobj_list[1]+....+qobj_list[N-1])
If I understand correctly, this happens because sum starts with 0 and then every object in the list, as written here:
http://www.marinamele.com/2014/04/modifying-add-method-of-python-class.html
In python sum start at 0.
So it's doing (0 + qobj_list[0] + ...)
And int + Qobj is only defined for square Qobj.
sum(qobj_list[1:], start=qobj_list[0]) would work.
Thanks for the replay.
Doesn't it make sense to define 0+|ket>=|ket>?
Fixed in #1934.
