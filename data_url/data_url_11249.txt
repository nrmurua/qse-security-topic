There's a similar thing with FermionOperator, which is that FermionOperator('0^ 0^') does not simplify to zero. However, we have normal_ordered to simplify FermionOperators, while there is no analogous function for QubitOperators. But since simplifying QubitOperators is cheap (and normal-ordering is expensive), I think it makes sense to deal with this kind of stuff upon initialization.
Also, QubitOperator('X0 Y0') should simplify to i Z0.
I mean, if we're going to do this I guess it should be able to do arbitrary multiplication. E.g. it should know how to interpret "X0 Y1 Z3 X2 Z3 Y0", right?
