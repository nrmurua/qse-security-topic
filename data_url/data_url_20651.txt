I follow the README instruction to build liboqs and openssl in a Ubuntu 18.04.
After that, I want to do a quick test with build openssl s_server / s_client with instruction in README:
First, I created a self-signed certificate 2 commands:
Now I try TLS1.3 connection with openssl s_server / s_client:
Do I have some misconfiguration ? or running command with wrong parameters ?
@jhfeng Thanks for this report. I cannot reproduce this behaviour as described, though (on Ubuntu 18.04, x86_64). Can you please share how you built the oqs-openssl that you are running above? Did you follow exactly the documentation or set any Configure parameters differently (e.g., OQS_DEFAULT_GROUPS or use shared libraries)? What output do you get if you run ldd apps/openssl?
@jhfeng Closing this issue for now. Please re-open if you encounter this again: In that case, please also provide steps to reproduce.
