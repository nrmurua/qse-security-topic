Hi,
I think that an option for printing the circuit "as is" would be really useful for visualization, especially in cases when we want to show exact order of gates or compare two cirquits which are equivalent but only differ by gate order. Unfortunetally this is not possible at the moment which can be shown with code snippet below:
which produces output:
As shown above even using justify="none" option which makes gates appear in separate columns still reorders them. We can also see that the circuits data is different and represents exact order so it is possible to retrieve it and print the gates accordingly.
Expected behaviour:
results with:
The prefer way to express a specific gate order is with barriers.
Thank you for this solution. I will definitely try it.
Nevertheless, it is a bit tedious to add a barrier between every gate, especially if you have a circuit from a different source. In such cases, it becomes necessary to copy it and insert the barriers just for printing, which is, again, a bit tedious. I find it somewhat unintuitive as to why the justify="none" argument reorders the gates.
The proposed feature would still be appreciated.
