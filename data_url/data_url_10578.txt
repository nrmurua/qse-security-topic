Description
DWaveCliqueSampler is not a composite with a child solver so I'd expect it to have a .solver.name property at top level analogous to DWaveSampler.:
To Reproduce
See above.
Expected behavior
I think .solver.name should be copied to the top level.
Environment:
Additional context
You can do this:
That is an implementation detail of DWaveSampler, not at all guaranteed by the API. If we want to expose the solver name, I think we should implement a more general way.
