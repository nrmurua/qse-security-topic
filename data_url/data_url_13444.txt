Readthedocs fails to build the pdf. The standard html build works. This is the reason why CI passes but our readthedocs badge is red.
The problem could be related to some latex formulas in some docstrings introduced in #701 but I am not sure.
This has been fixed right @andreamari? I think so, so closing. Reopen if not.
