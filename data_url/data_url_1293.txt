Description of the issue
There's an obvious typo on the page at https://quantumai.google/education. I would offer a PR to fix it but I haven't figured out where the source pages are kept. In a past Cirq Cynq, I was advised to report such issues in this issue tracker, so here it is.

I dont think that webpage is sourced from this repo.

I agree! But in a not-too-long-ago Cirq Cynq, I specifically asked about where to report issues on such pages because I couldn't find the right repo. People said they didn't think there was a public repo for them, and said to report them here anyway.
And so, here we are.
We've got a fix for this in the pipeline. Ty for letting us know!
What is an algoritheets? lol
Dunno but it should be fixed :)
