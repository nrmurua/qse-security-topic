I had crashes with Ubuntu 16.10, which uses GCC 6 instead of GCC 5. There may be a link with the aforementioned warnings. Taking a closer look with gdb showed a segfault that went away once I commented out the following lines:
In s3_clnt.c:
OQS_KEX_free(oqskex_kex);
OQS_RAND_free(oqskex_rand);
Closing old issue.
