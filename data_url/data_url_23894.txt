This issue is to track discussions about supporting a simple, pure text IR for QGL. Some initial notion of what that might look like from this morning's discussion:
The LoadCmp seems very APS2 specific and adds an extra instruction. Perhaps the comparison operators (CmpEq etc) should take an address and the APS2 would translate that to LoadCmp(addr).
Sure, I like that.
