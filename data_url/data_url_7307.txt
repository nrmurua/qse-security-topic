Hi, came across an inexact error simulating with mcwf_dynamic;
I think in this line I get very small imaginary parts from dot(psi_new.data, psi_new.data)

Defining a more forgiving conversion seems to solve all issues:
Base.convert(::Type{T}, x::Complex) where {T<:AbstractFloat} = abs(imag(x)) < 1e-16 ? T(real(x)) : throw(InexactError(nameof(T), T, x))
But taking the real part, or the norm instead of dot is probably more efficient.
I've put together a small example Pluto notebook, but seems l can only upload the pdf:
ðŸŽˆ kpo_mcwf_mwe.jl â€” Pluto.jl.pdf
@leostenzel you're right, there should be a real there. I've opened a PR.
