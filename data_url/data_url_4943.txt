Compiling fails with error like error: call to non-‘constexpr’ function ‘long int sysconf(int)’
As per OpenImageDenoise/oidn#106 (comment), catch2 header file is outdated for newer version of glibc.
Replace tests/catch/catch.hpp with newer version on Catch2 repo.
Since we have modified the catch header to support distributed unit testing, this potentially isn't so simple a fix. I'll investigate!
#348 potentially fixes this, it updates Catch2 to the latest v2.x availabe. @exAClior can you confirm compiling works as expected in your setup with that branch?
@rrmeister Hi, sorry for the delay. I can confirm compiling works. I also tried all the tests, they work too with that branch. I am using AMD platform.
