Here is an initial stab at code that compares the performance of cirq's simulator to projectq's simulator.
This could be fleshed out into something capable of making comparisons more generally, and tracking our performance on a more absolute scale.
Note that there is a benchmarker for simulators in dev_tools/profiling
It is easy to modify the benchmarker in dev_tools/profiling if we want to do this.  There is also a repo https://github.com/Roger-luo/quantum-benchmarks/blob/master/RESULTS.md which compares different simulators, which I think is sufficient.  We also have effectively performance regression tests in the tests that simulate examples.
I'm going to close this as it's not clear it belongs in Cirq.
