We should write all attributes to the yaml at the end of startup for example.
any comments on this? Pro/Contra?
Maybe it helps to edit the yml latter on, but on the other hand, it makes the config file grow  immediately with a ton of unused modules. At least, I don t foresee any bug related to it.
the bug i have in mind is that we may change the default value of attributes. if they were never touched by the user, this will modify the configuration resulting from a config file that has never saved a value for those attributes. Let's keep this issue open for now in order to see whether this bug appears in practice or not..
But related to this, I propose we add 2 things to the yml editor:
implemented in yml editor
