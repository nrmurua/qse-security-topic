When specifying that the execution of a task (electron) should be done on an alternate Conda environment, a Covalent-related object (TransportableObject) is passed to alternate environment for handling, requiring that Covalent also be installed in that environment. If it isn't the task execution fails.
In the initialization of an executor plugin, set conda_env=<some_conda_env>, where <some_conda_env> is a Conda environment that does not have Covalent installed. The execution will fail.
No Covalent-related objects should be passed to the alternate Conda environment by default, in the BaseExecutor class. Instead, the TransportableObject should be de-serialized to a "normal" Python function before passing to the alternate Conda environment.
