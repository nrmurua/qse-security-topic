The plot_xy applet fails after a clean conda install (v2.2, on ubuntu, which packaged pyqtgraph v0.9.10). This is fixed with pip install --upgrade pyqtgraph, which installs v0.10.0. This seems to be a known bug elsewhere online with the switch to Qt5.
Applet signature:  $python -m artiq.applets.plot_xy --embed $ipc_address --title "test" temp (where temp is a 1D ndarray).
Traceback:
We have been using Qt5 for much longer. That itself can't be it.
But maybe related to the switch to anaconda's qt5 packages. @cjbe ?
Also the backtrace looks like it might be something else entirely.
My thought about Qt5 and pyqtgraph 0.10.0 came from google pulling up this issue: Ulm-IQO/qudi#47. Based on here (rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn#480), it might also originate in numpy 1.11 -> 1.12?
@npisenti With pyqtgraph from pip, does the image applet exit cleanly? This patch was required: m-labs/pyqtgraph@7d34e22
@npisenti Well, this particular bug does seem fixed in 0.10 (https://github.com/pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph/blob/1426e334e1d20542400d77c72c132b04c6d17ddb/pyqtgraph/imageview/ImageView.py#L396). Can you try other applets, try to break them, and make sure that they behave?
Adding the conda-forge channel before installing ARTIQ fixes the problem, as it installs pyqtgraph 0.10 then. AFAICT there are no adverse effects.
I don't see any issues either. All seems to work as expected.
