I am having an issue implementing a controlled rotation gate using the IBM backend. I think the gate decomposition in the IBMCNOTMapper compiler is not working, as I am receiving an assertion error, that the control count for the gate should be zero.
Thanks for your help! (I am an undergrad with limited coding experience, so my understanding of the error message is not great.)
My code is here.

Just remove your explicit engine_list=[IBMCNOTMapper()]. This overwrites the default engines which would try to compile your controlled rotation to the IBM gate set.
You might want to change your IBM QE password now ;-)
Here is a cleanup version of your program (I slightly change the algorithm as I was not sure what you intended to do).
Please have a look at the example folder as well.
Did it solve your issues?
Yes it did. Thank you!
You are welcome
