I think the actual output drawing is correct.

However, I dont think these warnings are useful and they should be removed.
I think giving some dummy values is probably the cleanest way to remove these obscure warnings.
I am new to quantum computing and programming in general. I have learnt python. I am willing to solve this issue
Assigned! Thank you!
@1ucian0  I was running the program in juypiter notebook but no such warning massages were displayed



@1ucian0  please tell me where the problem is arising?
Hmm... in master the out is different. Maybe a regression?

Indeed, it is a regression inserted in #5581
Maybe @nkanazawa1989 has any insights?
@1ucian0  in my computer, in the master branch it is showing the modules of qiskit are not present even though the I am installes qiskit. Please have a look sir.

@Atri22 have you followed these instructions to install Qiskit terra from source?
Visualization of zero duration schedule is not tested, so this is a corner case. Here the plotter sets the xaxis but with above input axsis_config.window = (0., 0.) crashes matplotlib.

Above config object is generated by the formatter time_map_in_ns by default.

Such callback functions are stored in the stylesheet, so that user can modify almost all appearance of image without codebase modification.

You need to set some minimum window length. Since v2 drawer can take arbitrary formatter function to generate such configuration, perhaps it's better to add zero duration check in the plotter rather than in the formatter.
@nkanazawa1989 sir,can you please tell me where and how to add zero duration check and set minimum window length.

@Atri22 you can find the plotter in qiskit-terra/qiskit/visualization/pulse_v2/plotters/matplotlib.py, on line 79 you can see where the axis_config is set. This could be a a good place to check for zero duration (i.e. if the time_range is 0.0,0.0) and set a minimum time_window. Unless @nkanazawa1989 suggests otherwise?
@1ucian0 sir recently when I try to run the program in my terminal certain issues pop up.Are they due to any recent changes in the program? How to handle them?

hi. is the issue already fixed... otherwise I would love to work on that

Hi @Atri22 it's difficult to tell what the issue is from this screenshot, I would recommend double checking you've installed qiskit from source correctly (instructions here). It looks like you might have missed the pip install -e . step. Also make sure that you've pulled the latest version of main.

Hi @MR-Asif12116135 this issue is already assigned to @Atri22, so feel free to take a look at some of the other issues that are tagged as 'good first issues', there are a few that are not assigned to anyone yet ðŸ˜„
Hi @Atri22, are you still working on the issue? Otherwise I'd like to work on a fix based on @1ucian0 suggestions. Thanks! @javabster
Hi @scapape it seems that @Atri22 is unresponsive so I will reassign to you. Let us know if you have any questions ðŸ˜„
