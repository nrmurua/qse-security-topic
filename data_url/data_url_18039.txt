I am trying to clean up depreciation warnings from the tests but have run into errors where by I cannot get results from running the qobj in test/qobj
Should be able to get back results
It seems like a config section is needed for each experiment, but is not in the original input qobj.
No, I don't really think we can assume the files in test/python/qobj are 100% valid at the moment. They should be only "valid according to the usage that is made of them in test/python/test_qasm_simulator_cpp.py", since it is the only place they were used, and have been briefly touched in the successive updates to the schema (#709 , #655, etc) but only for making the tests pass.
It might be worth considering adding it as a subtask of #664, although I'm not sure of the importance, as they are basically helpers for the C++ simulator tests rather than examples of valid Qobjs. @chriseclectic , any suggestions?
Ok.  Currently the test example in question gives a depreciation warning, and switching to the statevector simulator results in an error.
@nonhermitian @diego-plan9 is this a bug?
I would say yes.  If a depreciation warning says use another backend, but the backend fails due to an invalid qobj then I would say we have an issue.
So, this issue is about updating the files in test/python/qobj/, am I wrong?
There is no deprecation warning during these tests anymore, so I'm closing this.
