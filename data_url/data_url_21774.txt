Running 4.0.dev+1401.g20cddb6a on a Sayma that produces nice sinusoids if amplitude is not modified. The following produces glitchy output instead of amplitude-stepped output.

@jordens Can you look into this?
@jbqubit Wrong ref_period? It seems that the SAWG may be producing the correct output, except that the steps are too short.
Agreed pulses were too short. Works fine with longer pulses.
