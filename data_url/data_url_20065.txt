Maybe #1069 could be expanded to also run CI on M1 (adding OSX-aarch64 testing).
Unfortunately, github runners are not available for M1. On the bright side, CCI OSX-M1 self-hosted runners are supported.
@dstebila : Would you be OK if I'd install a CCI self-hosted runner onto your M1 box? Would you want to create a separate, possibly more limited user for that?
Fixed by #1175.
