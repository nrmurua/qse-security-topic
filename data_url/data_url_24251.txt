After following the installation guide step by step, I tried to run the first tutorial script.
When importing qiskit_metal the following error message is displayed in jupyter-notebook:
~\Anaconda3\envs\my-env\lib\site-packages\pyqode\core\dialogs\goto.py in 
6
7
----> 8 class DlgGotoLine(QtWidgets.QDialog, dlg_goto_line_ui.Ui_Dialog):
9     """
10     Goto line dialog.
AttributeError: module 'pyqode.qt.QtWidgets' has no attribute 'QDialog'
Import qiskit_metal
To import qiskit_metal without errors
perhaps the wrong version of pyqode is installed ? My version is pyqode.python 2.12.1
This is a known setup issue, that arises when in the virtual environment there is both the installations of the production pyqode.qt and the github forked pyqode.qt (or just the production pyqode.qt)
Can you please verify with pip freeze that you are using the git version? Should look something like this:

If it is, then can you create a new conda virtual environment (new name because old env name libraries remain on disk and get picked up when same env name is reused) and follow again the exact steps of the installation?
If that still does not work, then we will have found some special user-case and we might need to have a live screen session to debug it.
Thanks for the quick reply. I was able to solve the problem:
During the installation with conda due to an internal access error the wrong pyqode.qt version got installed. I had to manually resolve it, now it works.
Best wishes
