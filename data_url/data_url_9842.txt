We recently added lp.dump() and lp.dumps() which has restrictions on the types of variable/constraint labels.
We currently use uuid4() for our random label generation. We could prepend v to variable labels and c to constraint labels and be automatically compliant without any loss of generality.
And perhaps filter out es?
And perhaps filter out es?
es are only disallowed as the first character of a label.
Update: So, it is not necessary to filter out es.  But were you thinking that it might be prudent to do so, for some reason?
