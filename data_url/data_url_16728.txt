In some contexts, users want to manually route their circuits. If a circuit is already routed, the default transpile levels will skip running the router, but a) this is not publicly documented and b) if a user makes a mistake in their routing, the routing stage will still run (and the user will likely not immediately notice their error).
#3999 added routing_method as a keyword argument to transpile. We should add an argument like routing_method='none' to allow users to specify that the routing should not be run.
I gave an example in #3999, which you rightly pointed out won't work.
transpile(circuit, backend, coupling_map=None)
Instead, I think the correct way to this is actually:
transpile(circuit, backend, coupling_map=CouplingMap.from_full(backend.num_qubits+1))
This means assume all the characteristics of that device, just override its coupling map to be fully connected.
Why backend.num_qubits+1? Would this remove our ability to run CXDirection, or raise early if a user mis-routes their circuit?
I like routing_method='none'.
If a user selects routing_method='none', we still have a coupling map so we can still run the equivalent of CheckMap as a constraint check or validation pass.
