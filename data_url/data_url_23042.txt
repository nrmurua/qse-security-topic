This issue only exists on one of our PCs - it is a newly set up Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Anaconda 2018.12 (Python 3.7) installed. The code is run in a jupyter notebook, however the same messages are outputted in a terminal when the precompiled binary is executed from it. The same code works on other PCs in the same network without problems.
After connecting to the RedPitaya a message of the following format is given out, and the GUI stops working (the oscilloscope doesn't show a curve, and the spectrum analyzer doesn't work either)
INFO:pyrpl.modules:Calling setup() for ..., where "..." might for instance be "spectrumanalyzer.span...", or "scope.decimation..."
This error can be generated by only executing
from pyrpl import Pyrpl
r_lock = Pyrpl('R_LOCK').rp
R_LOCK is attached as a .txt
The complete output is:
INFO:pyrpl:Please select or create a configuration file in the file selector window!
DEBUG:pyrpl.memory:Loading config file /home/sopa/pyrpl_user_dir/config/R_LOCK.yml
INFO:pyrpl:All your PyRPL settings will be saved to the config file
   /home/sopa/pyrpl_user_dir/config/R_LOCK.yml 
If you would like to restart PyRPL with these settings, type "pyrpl.exe R_LOCK" in a windows terminal or
   from pyrpl import Pyrpl 
   p = Pyrpl('R_LOCK') 
in a python terminal.

I wonder, whether this issue might be related to issue #339, as I also get the following output after just importing Pyrpl (and issue #339 is the only place mentioning an output of this kind):
from pyrpl import Pyrpl
DEBUG:pyrpl.attributes:SelectProperty unit of module None has no options! DEBUG:pyrpl.attributes:SelectProperty unit of module None has no options!

However, this disappears after running the import line for a second time.
R_LOCK.txt
I've noticed that using the pyrpl-develop-0.9.3.1 branch files gets rid of this problem - the error messages after importing Pyrpl stay though.
The output of
from pyrpl import Pyrpl
r_lock = Pyrpl('R_LOCK').rp
now is (without the messages when importing Pyrpl first):
DEBUG:pyrpl.memory:Loading config file /home/sopa/pyrpl_user_dir/config/R_LOCK.yml
INFO:pyrpl:All your PyRPL settings will be saved to the config file
   /home/sopa/pyrpl_user_dir/config/R_LOCK.yml
If you would like to restart PyRPL with these settings, type "pyrpl.exe R_LOCK" in a windows terminal or
    from pyrpl import Pyrpl
    p = Pyrpl('R_LOCK')
in a python terminal.

  b = (np.nanmin(d), np.nanmax(d))
and scope and spectrum analyzer work without any problems - so it looks like the problem has already been solved
