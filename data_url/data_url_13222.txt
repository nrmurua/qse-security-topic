It would be great to add a BQskit <> Mitiq tutorial to the docs to show the use of Mitiq with a compiler.
Rework the existing notebook (https://github.com/unitaryfund/research/blob/main/ieee-quantum-week/compilation-with-error-mitigation-tutorial/bqskit.ipynb) into myst format, addressing the remaining comments in that PR and updating docs requirements if they need to be updated with bqskit.
