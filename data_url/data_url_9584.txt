PR #199 added the option of including several types of noise to the simulation.
When noise is specified, the current implementation generates a new Hamiltonian before each run, which allows us to introduce random noise into it. However, such random noise is only strictly necessary when either doppler and/or amplitude noise are involved, as those are the two types of noise that are simulated through small, random changes to the Hamiltonian.
If neither amplitude nor doppler noise are involved, then there are a few modifications that can be done to speed up the current implementation. Separating by noise type:
