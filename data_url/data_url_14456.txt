When I try to run SWAP test, I see the ValueError: Duplicate key "statevector" in save instruction error.
Run the following code.
You will see the following error:
It would not generate any runtime error.
No response
It looks like you're using a pretty old version of Terra (and probably Aer) from your information at the top - the latest version of Terra is 0.20.  Could you see if the error is reproducible on more recent versions?
On my side, I couldn't reproduce the error with Terra 0.20.0 and Aer 0.10.4, though I did need to insert a transpile(swap_test_circuit, backend) because the chosen simulator doesn't support cswap natively.
