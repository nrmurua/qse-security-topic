tfq doesnt like cirq.LineQubit layout required in ionq circuits, tfq.layers.SampledExpectation throws
ValueError: Attempted to serialize circuit that don't use only cirq.GridQubits.
Given the specificity of the error message I would assume this is intended functionality. Is there a need to use LineQubits over GridQubits?
ionq requires cirq.LineQubit layout
This is an intended error. We don't currently support LineQubits like @lockwo mentioned. If it's not as easy as just switching from linequbits to GridQubits, then the fix here might be a little more involved.
I also got the same error by applying the NamedQubit.
When I want to call tfq.convert_to_tensor, I got :


I have no idea how hard to support another type of Qubits layout, but it may allow the circuit more readable. For example, the tutorial hello_many_world.py is made use of the GridQubits to declare the q_0, q_1, while the GridQubits layout lets the output of SVGCiruit become meaningless.
When I use NamedQubit, it makes it readable in any circuit output.
As the result, my code  




Opened #611 for anyone interested in tackling a fix for this issue. For now the workaround is to use GridQubits as that is the only qubit form that is completely supported by TFQ. Going to close for now.
any insight how to fix this?

I know, so I commented the NameQubit (replace into GridQubit) and everything went fine ~ ~
I just want to point out supporting (tfq) other qubit layout may not be the trivial issue ~ ~
