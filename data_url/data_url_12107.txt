As part of the new Getting Started page being designed for IBM Q Experience by Jules Murphy and myself, we will add a step-by-step intro for IBM Q Experience users. The tutorial is based on https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html
The step-by-step is distinct from https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-iqx-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/1_start_here.ipynb and https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-iqx-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/fundamentals/1_getting_started_with_qiskit.ipynb. It will not replace these two existing tutorials.
