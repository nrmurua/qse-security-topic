I have recently written code to implement two decomposition methods for arbitrary 2-qubit unitaries that require less than three 2-qubit gates to implement, on average. This is significant because the common 2-qubit unitary decomposition method with CNOT gates requires 3 CNOT gates. Implementation of 2-qubit unitary decomposition with fewer 2-qubit gates required can lead to increased efficiency. The decomposition methods are detailed in the two papers listed below:
B-Gate decomposition - Minimum construction of two-qubit quantum operations
Quantum Instruction Set Design for Performance
SQiSW decomposition - Algorithm 1 in Quantum Instruction Set Design for Performance
Hi @thomasverrill thanks for opening this issue.
I recently cleaned up some of your B gate decomposition code and made a PR: #9328 --- maybe you can take a look at that and see if it looks ok.
For the sqrt(iswap) I think there are some bugs for the case where there are 3 sqrt(iswap) required. I was not able to get an equivalence there. Did it work for you?
Hi @ajavadia! Thank you for taking the time to add the B gate and the B decomposition to the PR. I've tested the code on my own and it seems to work perfectly. I've found and fixed bugs in the SQiSW code, but as you mentioned, the decomposition doesn't work when 3 SQiSW gates are needed or when CNOT is used. I will keep you updated as I try to debug.
