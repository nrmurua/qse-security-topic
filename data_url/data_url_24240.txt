Please be as descriptive as possible, including: what is expected, why is this feature needed, what is the objective, etc.
Sometimes it is useful to have the option to include ground between the couplers of qubits and the qubits, right now one has to change the charge line parameters to get something like this which is a restriction.
The ability to create more unique qubit setups and architectures without breaking grounds.
I would suggest even creating a new form of the transmon pocket to cover such design layouts.
Is there a sketch of what you have in mind? It sounds to me a little like this?

No, I actually mean it like this:

So that there is ground between the coupling pads and the qubit.
Please make your own custom component.
