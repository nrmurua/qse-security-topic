It looks like we're running flake8 with max-complexity = 10 (which is what ./test_build.sh does), and these two functions have a higher cyclomatic complexity than that. Is it our intention to enforce this metric? Otherwise, should we stop checking for it?
I see now that this was likely there because it was in the example here, so I'll just close this issue.
