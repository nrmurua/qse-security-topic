Same behavior with two different AMCs.
60fd362 was the only thing i was able to find. (Error while refactoring the code to simplify clocking).
I was not able to test on hardware since M-Labs's RTM is no longer working.
What do you mean by no longer working?
I just tested the RTM hardware and it works fine. Are you using the wrong USB port? You need ftdi_location 3:10 at the moment.
OK then i'll retry on Wednesday, i was using 3:10, it was working correctly but then stopped.
What was the error?
Anyway I tested the latest code, and seems this problem is resolved. Thanks.
