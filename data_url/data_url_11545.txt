When I run
python test/aqua/test_grover.py
I get the error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "test/aqua/test_grover.py", line 28, in 
from qiskit.circuit.library import GroverOperator
ImportError: cannot import name 'GroverOperator'
And I search the "GroverOperator" in https://qiskit.org/documentation/, I get nothing about it.
python test/aqua/test_grover.py
No error return when running python test/aqua/test_grover.py
You should define GroverOperator before using it.
The master branch here is only guaranteed to work with the master branches of the the other dependent parts of qiskit, such as qiskit-terra in this case where you will find GroverOperator. If you install the latest from master you should find that works.
