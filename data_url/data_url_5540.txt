In one of my colleagues, this qiskit aer was working perfectly,  he gave me the .yml(his environment) file where all the package list was there, and then I used the command "conda env create -f qiskit-aer.yml" after that i downloaded the qiskit aer from this github repo , , changed the directory to qiskit-aer , then i tried for this command "pip install ." here it is throwing this cmake conan error, i have added the snip of the error


Heres the error

how to resolve this
compile  options add -DDISABLE_CONAN=ON

How and where to add to this

qiskit-aer files

I also ran into this issue on an Arch Linux machine with cmake version 3.27.7
On an Ubuntu machine with cmake version 3.22.1, I did not get this issue.
@Sraj4063 what is your cmake version?
Oh I just tried again on the Ubuntu machine in a different virtual environment and it failed.
