After changes introduced in #228, make sure all links in articles.bib show up correctly as links. Currently, some of the URLs are strings because pybtex was unable to parse "\url{some_link}" correctly.
The goal of this issue is to figure out what format works for URLs in sphinxcontrib-bibtex and is also compatible with pybtex. Then, apply those changes to most of the @misc refs in articles.bib.
