BUG TEMPLATE 
A user in the public slack channel pointed this issue to me. When running a Clifford circuit with a ccx gate, the transpiler does not know to unroll it to the set of basis gates of the stabilizer simulator. As a result, the stabilizer simulator cannot simulate the ccx gate (and any multi-controlled gate on more than two qubits), although it is a Clifford operation.
Gives:
Implement multi-controlled gates in the stabilizer simulator, and add them to the set of basis gates.
By the way, it could be nice if there was a way to implement simulation of any c...cx gate, on any number of qubits, and add "all c...cx gates" to the set of basis gates.
ccx and any multi-controlled x gate aren't Clifford gates. Their decomposition requires T gates.
I see. And if you don't decompose, and try to work directly on the tableau, this will not work, right?
Closing because ccx is not a Clifford operator
