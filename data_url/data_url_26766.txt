The newly added regests in QS/regtest-corr_dipm take quite long, which occasionally leads to timeouts.
@hforbert, could you please have a look? Ideally, tests shouldn't run longer than 30 seconds.
Got feedback from the implementor, hopefully iit is better/fixed with merge request #780, but
CI is either slow or not working atm.
The CI got stuck somehow. I just restarted it which seems to have done the trick.
Thanks for reducing the runtimes!
