There should be a clear distinction for users between the two methods so developers do not have to go searching through the class hierarchy in different packages to discover these distinctions between the two:
Onto a Quantum circuit, you can

Thank you @sriramanved for submitting the issue :) .
This bug content in particular, doesn't belong to this repo but to the qiskit-terra repo, @1ucian0 could you check if I'm right and if it's the case, transfer this issue to the terra repo, please?
I'm not sure we should tag this "good first issue" - we (core devs) don't have a clear consensus on what the differences between these two functions should be.
My opinion is that compose should be purely an "inlining" operation accepting only QuantumCircuit, and append should remain an "add blob" operation accepting anything that is an Operation or can be converted to one.  I contend that those are very distinct and both useful operations from a compilation perspective that's best served by having two methods.  However, that's 100% not the only view - others think that users shouldn't have to care about the distinction and it's better to just have one "super method" that does both controllable by a series of options.
With no consensus, I'm not super keen to have this open to first-issue contributors.  In my way of looking at things, it's a mistake that compose accepts anything but QuantumCircuit and we should look to remove that, and in others' way, append should be almost a hidden implementation detail, so it's not 100% clear what we should write in documentation.
Hi team! I want to contribute with this issue, please can add me to solve this issue?
