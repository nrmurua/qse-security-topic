Run the above code
Plot the barrier
Check how the barrier instruction is correctly plotted with the Qcircuit package, see the manual: http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/CTAN/graphics/qcircuit/qcircuit.pdf
This is already solved and was added in #764 (it was my first real contribution to terra) Your local qcircuit latex package is just too old. That's what the latex error is telling you above, the latex drawer emitted a \barrier directive in the output latex but pdflatex on your system doesn't understand that control sequence. You need to upgrade to the latest version (which is 2 years old at this point) 2.6.0: https://ctan.org/tex-archive/graphics/qcircuit?lang=en I'm going to close this as there is nothing to fix.
