In controller usage examples (and presumably elsewhere) "::1" is used, mapping to localhost
See #134
True. What is the problem with that?
For pedagogical reasons, writing examples with the full domain name / IP address would be much clearer. Since the localhost may not be the correct server and someone new to this sort of thing may not recognize "::1" as corresponding to the localhost, being a bit more clear in the documentation would be helpful.
Non-localhost IP address and hostnames are obviously site-dependent, such examples would work only on one machine/network.

Another new ARTIQ user ran into this problem. It would help if NDSP
examples use an obvious placeholder for fully specified DNS name. e.g.
artiqmaster.mydomain.com
