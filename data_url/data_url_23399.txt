In the current version (commit b28c13d) of the ZI UHF-LI driver, the Scope parameter's get method both arms the scope trigger, awaits triggering, and transfers all the data. SInce this is blocking, it is not possible to arm the trigger, start a signal that sends a trigger using a different instrument, and only then poll the data.
I suggest splitting the current get method into an arm and poll method (where the latter will be called get). For using the scope in a loop, one would then have to arm at each loop point.
