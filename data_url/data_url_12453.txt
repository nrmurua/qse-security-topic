I have written following code:
Here, the input in the function is a tensor. Basically, I have considered the image dataset into a tensor instead of a numpy.ndarray.
After this function, I wrote the following block of code and raised an error:
The error is:
Can you please help me out why is this happening? The only change I did was taking input the tensor instead of numpy.ndarray.
You can't use a tensor to specify rotations, it must be a numbers.Real or sympy.Expr. Simply cast the tensor to a numpy array to solve this problem. This worked for me (I actually don't know whether casting to numpy as a single value or as an array is more efficient since I'm not sure what that looks like in the underlying memory operations, but may be worth considering if you iterate a lot over this function), where the key difference is rads=values[k].numpy():
I believe #713 resolved this.
Thanks for this as well !
