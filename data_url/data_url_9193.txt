It appears that the line
in examples/Makefile should be modified to remove the example-f90 target, as there does not seem to be any f90 wrapper for example.o.
This extraneous target leads to an error when running make in examples/ of the form:
After manually removing the example-f90 target, there appear to be two more issues needing to be manually addressed so that the examples will build:
The path to eigen3 is hardcoded to /usr/include/eigen3 as in make test-cpp hard codes the eigen include dir to /usr/include/eigen3Â #56 and should perhaps be ${HOME}/.local/eigen3 or the environment variable EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR.
There is no definition of the target libwalrus.hpp and removing it from the rule example.o: example.cpp libwalrus.hpp seems to fix an error.
