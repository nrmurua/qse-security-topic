E           AssertionError: Sample rate 0.0108 is over 5 standard deviations away from 0.006666665896773338.
This is presumably a one in a million failure. But the test has been run a lot of times and there are a lot of similar tests. Just compute the probability of seeing this sort of thing by chance and eyeball if it's reasonable.
Note that this occurred very recently after a change to how seeding is done.
Saw this again https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/runs/6332576101?check_suite_focus=true
I think, both times, this failed on osx. This most recent one was OSX. If it happens again make sure to document.

Saw one on windows this time:
Was the source of this ever pinpointed? I am really glad that this is documented regardless of the source
@ChrisPattison No.
I suspect it's just that the tests have tolerances that are too tight, but I'm not closing the issue until I actually do the math and work out the expected false positive rate.
I tried running these tests hundreds of thousands of times and saw similar flakes. Increasing the sample count decreased the number of flakes. So I'm confident this was just statistical flukes.
