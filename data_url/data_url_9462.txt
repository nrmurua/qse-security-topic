Currently, the noise model parameters must be chosen to the user according to the available options. However, there is not predefined noise model associated with the available devices, even though the parameters are known.
The proposal is to define some default noise models for the available predefined devices (Chadoq2, AnalogDevice, IroiseMVP) and allow the user to select them if they want to do a noisy simulation.
The proposal comprises the following points:
