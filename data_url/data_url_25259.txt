The goal of this issue is to treat sublattices similar to other electrons. Currently, the dispatcher assigns the workflow executor for postprocessing and sublattice execution and calls the runner._run_abstract_task. The runner in turn checks if an electron has a sublattice prefix in the _run_task method and subsequently, builds the graph as well as dispatches the sublattice workflow asynchronously. In this issue, all specialized logic to handle sublattices has to be removed from the runner and dispatcher and instead it should be treated like a regular electron. Moreover, the data_manager.py and electron.py need to be updated to deal with the sublattice electrons. A new DISPATCHING status needs to be defined to describe sublattice electron execution.
Hey team! Please add your planning poker estimate with Zenhub @kessler-frost @AlejandroEsquivel @cjao
