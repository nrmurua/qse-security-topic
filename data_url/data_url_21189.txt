The idle kernel does not run automatically after booting after startup kernel has exited.
Idle kernel should run if no other kernel is running.
This seems to be related to #2041.
I have proposed a PR to address this issue here: https://git.m-labs.hk/M-Labs/artiq-zynq/pulls/276.
RISC-V platforms are not affected, correct?
Correct, the idle kernel starts immediately after booting, and after startup kernel on RISC-V.
