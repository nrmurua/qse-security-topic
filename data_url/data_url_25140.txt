Logging akin to logging in non-QElectron Covalent.
There are a number of points in the QElectrons implementation that are significant for debugging. Instead of adding print statements every time an issue comes up, it would be nice to have a built-in logging system.
For example:
This should probably be a separate log from the Covalent log (especially since QElectrons work outside Covalent). It would he acceptable not to expose these logs in the CLI.
Adding manual print statements every time, then spending 10 minutes  to remove them before making a commit.
