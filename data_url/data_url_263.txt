When trying the vqe_h2.cpp example (cuda-quantum/docs/sphinx/examples/cpp/algorithms/vqe_h2.cpp) with IonQ simulator target,
it hit an assertion:
Seems like it is trying to access index 4 on a size-4 array.
No assertion
Not a regression
No response
I've simplified the above example into a minimal reproducible example:
The issue seems to be in the loop unrolling pipeline:
produced
Line %1 = quake.subveq %0, %c3_i64, %c4_i64 : (!quake.veq<4>, i64, i64) -> !quake.veq<2> looks dubious as compared to the original code.
Works for me.
