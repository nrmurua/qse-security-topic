This is because IdentityGate doesn't subclass SingleQubitGate.  Instead I = IdentityGate(num_qubits=1).
cirq.H, X, T, etc. all have for_each() so I expected cirq.I to also have this method.
Do they? There isn't a for_each method, but there is on_each, which seems to be supported by IdentityGate as well: see cirq/cirquits/circuit_test.py.
Yes, I meant on_each.
Another class called IdentityGate is defined for a test (cirq/circuits/circuit_test.py#L1488) but the class of cirq.I is cirq/ops/common_gates.py#L587.  The first one subclasses SingleQubitGate but the second one doesn't.
