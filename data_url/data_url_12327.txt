Hello TensorFlow Quantum Team,
The installation guide suggests that these versions are compatible, but in practice, I've encountered the following error:
NotFoundError: /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/tensorflow_quantum/core/ops/_tfq_simulate_ops.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
In my experience, the most recent version of TensorFlow that is compatible with TensorFlow Quantum v0.7.2 is TensorFlow v2.8.0. I installed the packages using pip.
My environment is as follows:
I wanted to alert you to this issue for potential updates to the compatibility information in the installation guide.
Thank you for your time and your work on this project. Please let me know if you need any further information regarding this issue.
I believe this is because the docs are built from the nightly version, not a stable release. TFQ 0.7.2 has TF requirement 2.7.0 (#777 (comment)), but there is work being done to support 2.11 (see recently merged PRs).
