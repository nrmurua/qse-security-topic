In this code, I used two method to calculate a matrix element table, and I expect to obtain the same results (print True):
With the current code, I got False here.
Then qubit.plot_matelem_vs_paramvals() gives a wrong result when sweeping n_operator over EL. Issue #114 is also an example of it.
For the fluxonium qubit, qubit.n_operator() depends on the value of EL as it is in calculation of the oscillator length qubit.phi_osc(). When doing a parameter sweep, we are calculating the matrix element with updated evecs and a unchanged operator. That's why we get a wrong answer.
For fluxonia, phi_operator and n_operator depends on EL and EC (in oscillator length). As issue #114 mentioned, d_hamiltonian_d_flux depends on flux in TunableTransmon. Those matrix elements are not calculated properly in the method get_matelements_vs_paramvals and there might be more examples.
Bug fix pushed to main with e8fccdf
