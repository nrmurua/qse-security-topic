BUG TEMPLATE 
FAILURE: Can not get job id, Resubmit the qobj to get job id. Terra job error: 'Number of qubits 30 is greater than maximum (24) for "statevector_simulator".'
I am wondering why Qiskit sets such constraints on simulation. The memory of my computer is 64GB and can support the simulation of 32 qubits.
However, when I execute my program using 30 qubits, I encounter the above problem.
It sounds like you aren't using Aer but possible BasicAer or IBMQ provider? If you switch to using Aer you should be able to run 30 qubits.
See the  following tutorial: https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/simulators/1_aer_provider.html
Hi,
I am very curious why Qiskit-Aer limits the number of qubits in simulation.
I checked that Aer does support 30 qubits. However, whatif I have more available mem, doesn't Aer support it?
Regards,
Vincent
