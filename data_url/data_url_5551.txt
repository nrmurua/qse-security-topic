From 0.12.1 on, there are no wheels on pypi for Linux (Debian bullseye) aarch64. Also, there is no source wheel.
For the older release 0.12.0 there are suitable wheels, e.g. qiskit_aer-0.12.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.whl, as well as the sources qiskit-aer-0.12.0.tar.gz
For running inside a Docker container, I have to either revert to the older version 0.12.0 or clone the repository and locally build the wheels.
Look up
https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-aer/0.12.1/#files
https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-aer/#files
Binary wheels for manylinux/aarch64, as well as source wheel on pypi.
Build missing wheels and push them to pypi.
Thank you for your reporting. Unexpectedly, uploading sdist and wheel on aarch64 were failed in deployment workflow for 0.12.2. I will rerun failed workflow.
Hey looks like it may have failed again - any chance of building the missing wheels please?
