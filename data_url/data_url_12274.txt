This requires the installation of latex and image creation packages that are quite big.
I think we should place instruction of how to use latex and pdf packages in the advanced topics, not in the getting started

The circuit visualization cell has to be updated. I'm not sure where I have to push changes since some big refactoring seems to be taking place. But that entire cell should be replaced by this:
Can you make this change?
This does not alleviate the dependency on pdflatex. But it is cleaner (that entire function has now moved to the SDK itself).
We can put this in a separate tutorial on visualization later.
I have updated the new getting started in #119  It is much simpler but i want to get the visualizations.
