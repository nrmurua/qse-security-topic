It is possible for the user to define a Qobj whose dimensions (dims) do not match the shape (shape). An example is given below,
prints
If this is an expected behaviour, it might be needed to change the docstring of Qobj, as it does not mention other.  Or I am missing something. A look at issue #28 did not help.
One might insert a check on dims product to match shape.
Good catch. I think we can add a check here and there in qutip.qobj.
where we can define a simple check_dims function for consistency checks.
But this is also really not a bug perhaps but more to do with minimizing user mistake.
@ajgpitch
If my memory is correct forcing dims and shape to be consistent might break some stuff, like the ENR states (where it is assumed they can be different).
Closing it for the time being, as not a bug.
