Based on https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/5ecfec18301299b58ac16be0151541484eae03f6/tutorials/circuits_advanced/08_gathering_system_information.ipynb, Qiskit needs a how-to on Obtaining information about a backend. The main difference with the previous versions is to port it to backend v2.
@1ucian0 I'm interested in contributing to this documentation. Is this a good first issue for me to work on ?
I wouldn't call it a good first issue, but If you are familiar with backendV2 and our documentation guidelines, I think it is doable. There are many good first issues in https://qisk.it/good-first-issues
@1ucian0 I can take this in case that nobody is working
@1ucian0 I'm familiar with the backend and learning about sphinx as well. Thank you for the link !
I'd like to take this up ? Can you please assign it to me ?
Sure.. assigning you @ayukumar11
Hey @ayukumar11, how's it going working on this? We're trying to coordinate the timeline for this issue as part of the qiskit-metapackage migration in Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#1473
Also let me know if I can help! And feel free to hand the ticket off to me if you'd prefer, but 100% okay to keep working on this!
Hi @MaldoAlberto I have started working on it. What time frame are you looking at for the metapackage migration for me to level set ?
