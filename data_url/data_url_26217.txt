coveralls is listed as a dependency in the toml file.
But this package is not compatible with py>3.10.

Probably why a warning is raised by pytest in the 3.11 workflow?

probably related to #218.
Hmm, I think we can probably remove the coveralls dependencies and usage. It looks like the package isn't well-maintained and hasn't been updated in some time.
Perhaps we can stick with codecov (similarly to how it was done in mitiq?):
unitaryfund/mitiq#301
Any thoughts, @purva-thakre ?
@vprusso I am fine with using codecov. Saves me the work of searching for replacements. thanks!
