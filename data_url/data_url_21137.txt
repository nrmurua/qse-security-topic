We need to update the code base so it works in newer versions of Julia.
In case you are interested, I slightly modified the Savitzky-Golay filter to work on v1.0 or later. Notice that requires DSP and LinearAlgebra.

Thanks Leandro!  We're working on an update to v1.0.  Hopefully we'll have something up soon.
You're welcome!
Quick question: how far is this project from DSP.jl? (I mean in terms of topics and purposes) I'm just asking because efforts can probably be merged into one direction. I noticed that DSP.jl currently doesn't have any Savitzky-Golay filter option, for instance.
The quick answer is Qlab.jl is focused on the processing and analysis of data from quantum information experiments.  Specifically, we load HDF5 files produced by some of our other software and plot, fit etc...  DSP.jl seems much more general and useful across a wide range of projects and applications.
