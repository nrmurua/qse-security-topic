The Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and the Hessian with respect to the supported types of parameterized quantum circuits are symmetric. However, the current implementation evaluates every entry individually without taking this symmetry into account.
Should this be opened on the Terra repo now that opflow/gradients are maintained there.
Sure will do.
Closing as this was migrated to Terra Qiskit/qiskit#5631
