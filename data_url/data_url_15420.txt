When I use VQE via on some backends with measurement_error_mitigation=True (when set to false it runs without issues) and try to solve on a huge qubit operator (around 500 terms), it throws me this error :

This is something we also encountered with @eggerdj with the QAOA runtime and seems to be related to the error mitigation. We're looking into it ðŸ™‚
The error that @Cryoris and myself have been running into relates to this: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/16169de38ba858747e796a2acb5c96f8f37cb3b9/test/python/algorithms/test_measure_error_mitigation.py#L84-L90
I have also experienced this issue on cairo, mumbai, and auckland.
@nathanschnitzerNNL the one that @eggerdj posted or the one from @LenaPer?
I am referring to the one from @LenaPer . Here is the log error output that I got from my latest job cb620trshjg0cvokdsb0 (Auckland). Sorry for the formatting...
I'm also having this issue. I can run measurement error mitigation without any issues using either the VQEClient and QiskitRuntimeService on open systems like manilla and nairobi, but if I try any of the closed ones I get this error.
Not sure how but a job with measurement error mitigation on ibmq_montreal completed without any issues.
Here is the log for the job.
The behavior is noted in an issue here #5730 As noted there it can be device specific. It even recently changed for a device that had worked that later did not (discussions out on public Qiskit slack)
I saw it was removed from the 0.22 milestone, do you have an idea on when it will be solved? @1ucian0 @mtreinish
I do not think that this is something that should be solved on the Terra side of things.  Namely, this is an issue with the limitations of the QuantumInstance; a class that is being deprecated in favor of runtime primitives.  The primitives do not have the same issue because they use improved mitigation methods that the QuantumInstance cannot handle due to lack of flexibility.  In principle, those who wrote the VQE runtime can refactor it on their side and fix the issue without any changes to Terra.  Indeed, this is one of the benefits of the abstraction into the cloud.
The VQE Runtime is now deprecated, along with QuantumInstance which never supported circuits on different qubits (hence the error message it raised). The solution/workaround is to move to using the Estimator primitive from IBM Qiskit Runtime which supports various error mitigation capabilities via a resilience_level. Refer to the link for more information and code examples etc. This issue is therefore being closed.
