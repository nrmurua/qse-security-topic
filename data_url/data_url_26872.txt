Just a reminder to follow up on #159.
Thanks @dev-zero !
please note: this is yet another band-aid. The proper solution would be to build everything except maybe binutils/gcc/valgrind/... for each combination of MPI/no-MPI, OMP/no-OMP and CUDA/no-CUDA. But at this point we would be replicating what EasyBuild or Spack have solved already.
