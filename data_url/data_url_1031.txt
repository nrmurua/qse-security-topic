Description of the issue
!pip install --pre cirq works fine but
!pip install git+https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq.git fails with the following error
Cirq version
0.12.0.dev
Upd: On multiple runs of the command, the error keeps changing to one of the many different extracted modules. eg:
The workaround is to use subdirectory in the URL. If you want to install cirq-core only:
if you want a single submodule (that is not cirq-core), you'll need to add cirq-core as well:
if you want all the modules:
For all the modules + the metapackage it gets long:
As this is WAI, I will close this issue.
Reopening to leave a chance to discuss this - thanks @Strilanc for pushing back on closing this.
We might be able to make  pip install git+https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq.git work by changing setup.py so that it can install all the submodules as well - this would end up actually helping with making pip install .  work too (instead of pip install . ./cirq-core ./cirq-google ...): one direction to try out would be https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40831794/call-another-setup-py-in-setup-py.
Things to ensure still work: editable installs and wheel packaging.
Better error messaging: there is not much room for changing error messaging in pip itself as far as I know.
Update: No immediate success, some kind of setup.py magic will be required, if it's possible at all.
Possible ideas:
