When running this Grover-search tutorial to compile on ibmqx5,
https://github.com/rraymondhp/qiskit-tutorial/blob/ba1d80923fc02234f1fadda7be996bdd6fb4c712/reference/algorithms/grover_algorithm.ipynb
I encountered this error:
Should be no MapperError as the simulator (version 0.5.2) and all backends of version 0.4.15 can run without problem.
See the error message above.
Will look into it.
See #494 for a fix.
Thanks for the quick response!
Fixed by #494
