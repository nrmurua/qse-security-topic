As pointed out by @ajavadia , the QuantumCircuit methods are currently inconsistent with regards to the default value of the inplace kwarg.
Consensus seems to be that inplace=False is preferred as a default value, so the work to be done here is:
I'll add the inplace kwarg for .tensor() in #6065 to overload the ^= operator.
@kdk. I can work on this.
I will just say that inplace=True makes a lot more sense here.
Thanks @enavarro51 , assigned.

@nonhermitian For some methods, or across the board?
For the examples with inplace=True make intuitive sense in that they are convenience functions that replace boilerplate code.  The code they replace performs measurements in-place.   I know this is not true for the removal, but that makes sense as well.   Doing parameter bindings inplace by default makes a lot of sense given that the params are properties of the circuit instance.  I would also expect that iterating over params and adding them in place for things like VQE is much faster.  Thus it makes more sense in my mind to have that move to inplace=True I really never use compose, so can't say much there.  I would also say the measurement routines are much more widely used, especially measure_all so changing that is less palatable in my opinion.
Here's my 2 cents worth. (edited)
So overall recommendation,
All the methods that add gates / operations (e.g. .cx()) are in-place. I can foresee confusion over .measure() being in-place while .measure_all() is not.
