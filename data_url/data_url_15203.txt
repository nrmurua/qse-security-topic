multicontrol Rz rotation not correctly being built - see example below.
(Also multicontrol Rz, Ry, Rx gates can all be implemented using fewer nonlocal (two) qubit gates... See solution below)
mcrz method in QuantumCircuit  should implement the correct quantum  circuit. Solution provided below.
This code fixes the problem and acutally reduces the depth of all multicontrol rotation Rz,Ry,Rz gates:
We can check this is working via:
The new approach gives an improvement to the correctly implemented mutlicontrol rotation gates currently coded in qiskit:
Hi @AlexisRalli, thanks for reporting this! Indeed the MCRZ looks wrong, it's not equivalent to the multicontrolled phase gates, as which it is implemented. Do you have a reference to the multicontrolled Pauli rotations you're using? We could definitely add those as default decomposition to Qiskit if they use less CNOTS (or have shallower depth) ðŸ™‚
Hi @Cryoris , I was using Theorem 8 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0406176.pdf to build these circuits.
Thanks for the reference! Would you be interested in fixing this in Qiskit? ðŸ™‚ We can of course have a discussion on how to tackle this, if that would be helpful.
@Cryoris Sorry for the late reply. I'd be happy to fix this.  I guess I should just fork the repo and make a pull request
@AlexisRalli I have assigned you the issue. You can find instructions on how to setup your local development environment in the contributing guide. If you need any help, please let me know!
