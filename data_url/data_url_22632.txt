Errors in the use of the ARTIQ language should result in concise error messages that can guide the user. Here's an example of this going wrong.
I've attempted to get_dataset() for a dataset that doesn't exist.
The problem is simple and properly caught by KeyError. The expected result is simple: the worker terminates. OK.
But why does this resolution pass through another exception state? "During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:" and the ensuing stream of crud. This verbosity makes ARTIQ harder to use.
The commit does not resolve this issue. I expect that the log output ceases after
2015-10-28 12:20:52,311 INFO:worker(0):print:KeyError: 'common_plot1_ypp'
Running a build including ec328cf...
If you were running a version that included that commit, the message would be something like:
Still not perfect, but it does not contain the double exception you were talking about and cuts some of the tracebacks.
