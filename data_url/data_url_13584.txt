We have a theory section called About Error Mitigation which, for the moment, is mainly focused on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE).
However we are going to add soon a module on probabilistic error cancellation (PEC).
Add a subsection called Probabilistic error cancellation which should give an overview of this error mitigation technique.
It can be something similar to the current Zero-noise extrapolation subsection.
