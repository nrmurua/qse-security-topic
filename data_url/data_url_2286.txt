Currently only there are only functions that convert from bit or digit lists to ints with the big endian convention (first digit in the list is the most significant).
Little endian versions would be useful (e.g. #2074 (comment) and #2074 (comment)).
Functions to add to cirq/value/digits.py:
Is there a reason we need both endiannesses in cirq? I haven't followed the referenced issue so I don't have much context, but having both endiannesses floating around seems like a potential source of nasty bugs.
I agree.  This came up while I was modifying simulator code that internally uses little endian for sampling measurements.  The function slice_for_qubits_equal_to uses little endian and now is a backward compatibility issue if it is changed.
In #2074, I just fixed the wave function simulator to use big endian internally.  Now slice_for_qubits_equal_to is the only function I'm aware of that uses little endian.
This appears to be fixed now.
