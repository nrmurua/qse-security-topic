When pausing a 2D or higher loop, it will only pause once the outer loop progresses to a next iteration...
I will postpone this for the new silq measurement code.
I've had a look into this problem this morning and I've found that the issue is that the loop pause button sets the ActiveLoop state to be paused, but this is always the outermost loop, rather than currently active loop. There doesn't appear to be a convenient shortcut to the innermost currently active loop but it can be accessed via:
qc.active_loop().actions[0].actions[0]...
This is quite ugly, is there an obvious way of finding other loop objects, similar to qc.active_loop()?
Closed because the new measurement loop doesn't have this problem
