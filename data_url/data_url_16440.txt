When specifying a QuantumRegister that is smaller in magnitude than the size of the coupling_map you're using, SabreLayout will throw an error.

The item it specifies seems to be random as well (i.e. it can throw item 6 - item 14 as KeyError). Note that the line:
will not fail, just the one that is using the circuit with the Quantum Register < Coupling Map size.
If you specify the initial layout yourself or use the built in Trivial or Dense options, they will not fail when the Quantum Register is less than the hardware graph size and I imagine it should be the same with Sabre. As far as I can tell, if you don't specify the Quantum Register size as the # logical qubits in the circuit, if you use the:
passes then it won't properly label the 'extra' qubits as ancilla, so you probably want to always specify the # logical qubits as the Quantum Register size. Granted, this analysis could be wrong, but it seems that way from what I could tell.
Unsure what the source of the problem is (new-ish to qiskit), so no suggestions from me.
Hi, I also encountered this bug. I think replacing 'circ.qregs' with new-circ.qregs at line 104 in sabre_layout.py would solve the problem.
