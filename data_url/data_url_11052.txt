I was trying to see how QAOA works through the two examples given. But in both the cases, it is showing the same error in the last part to print "most frequent bitstring from sample".

Thanks for reporting this @riyasett . Would it be possible for you to share the code-snippet that produced this error so I can try to reproduce this on my end?
@riyasett I can't seem to find the notebook. Maybe github email filtered it out?
Oh, I am extremely sorry. I sent you the notebook through email. I am attaching it here again.

I cannot attach the notebook (.ipynb) here...
hmm .. I unfortunately still can't see the full code to reproduce the error. Can you turn the notebook into a small script that I can run? You can also copy-and-paste the code you are running into a comment here.
import numpy as np
import pyquil.api as api
from pyquil.paulis import PauliTerm, PauliSum
import networkx as nx
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from grove.pyqaoa.qaoa import QAOA
CXN = api.SyncConnection()
def print_fun(x):
print(x)
def maxcut_qaoa(graph, steps=1, rand_seed=None, connection=None, samples=None,
initial_beta=None, initial_gamma=None, minimizer_kwargs=None,
vqe_option=None):
inst = maxcut_qaoa([(0, 1), (1, 2)], steps=2, rand_seed=42, samples=None)
betas, gammas = inst.get_angles()
probs = inst.probabilities(np.hstack((betas, gammas)))
for state, prob in zip(inst.states, probs):
print(state, prob)
print("Most frequent bitstring from sampling")
most_freq_string, sampling_results = inst.get_string(
betas, gammas)
print(most_freq_string)
Thanks @riyasett, this will help me in reproducing your error!
@riyasett we just pushed a fix to master for your problem #109. Thanks @jonathanward for this. We will have a release of Grove coming up soon that will contain this fix.
@riyasett You're welcome! We just pushed a new release of grove. v1.4.0 I hope your problem is fixed there. I'll close this ticket, but feel free to reopen if you encounter the issue again!
