Getting the following error when trying to run the circuit.
A simple circuit with Hadamard gates.
The error was raised on any of the available real quantum systems.
This worked fine on previous versions. Seems an error is popping up after the introduction of Unroller.
Do we need to follow some more steps before executing a circuit now?
No response
Hi @prakharb10, could you post the complete snippet that produces this error, including which backend you're using and how you submit the job?
Hey @Cryoris
Here's the snippet for the backend selection:
And job execution:
Then I extract the counts and perform further processing.
Let me know if you need anything else! ðŸ˜„
Could you show the output of qiskit.__version__?  The file names and line numbers in your original traceback don't line up with any recent version of Terra - I think something might have gone wrong with your Python environment, and you're not loading up the version you think you are.  It looks to me like you're using something from the Terra 0.16 series (originally released in late 2020), whereas your version information comment at the top of this issue says you thought you were loading Terra 0.20 (released a couple of months ago).  Perhaps a virtual environment's not loaded?
Hey @jakelishman
You were right. The issue had something to do with the venv environments. For some reason, the program was referring to the base installation despite activating the venv.
Upgrading the version in the home environment fixed the issue. Apologies for the false alarm.
Closing the issue.
