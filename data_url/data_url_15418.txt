Doing qc.save_statevector when the backend is statevector_simulator fails with "Failed to load qobj: Duplicate key "statevector" in save instruction".
If I do this
it causes an error
The error disappears when I comment out the qc.save_statevector() line.
qc.save_statevector() needs to error out saying that it is not supported when the backend is statevector_simulator.
No response
save_statevector is actually supported, it's just that statevector_simulator is a legacy backend that automatically inserts a save_statevector instruction at the end of the circuit to be executed.  When you manually add an extra save_statevector it duplicates things, and that causes the error.
Erroring out on unsupported instructions / circuits at runtime would be the domain of the backend, not a method of QuantumCircuit, at the very least.  That said, with statevector_simulator being a legacy interface to AerSimulator, it's in critical maintenance mode only now, so Aer might not be accepting patches on it.
