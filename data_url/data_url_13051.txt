The test_with_observable_batched_factory test is quite old but, for some reason, it seems to fail more often in the last weeks.
See e.g.:
https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/actions/runs/5423886272/jobs/9862463130#step:5:3881
I would suggest to have a look under the hood  to check that everything works as expected, e.g. what circuits are executed, what results are obtained, etc..
If everything works, we should probably modify this test to make it deterministic.
The linked logs have expired.
