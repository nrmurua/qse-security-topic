If an executor returns expectation values as float variables, Mitiq should always be used with observable=None (default),
since in this case the observable is implicitly defined and measured in the executor.
From a Discord discussion, it seems that no error is raised for incompatible settings.

For an executor function:
It is a bit weird, and I'm not sure it behaves correctly, but if I give it the right Observable, it gives back some expectation value. For example, given the PauliString "XX", it applies the measurement in the right basis.
On the other hand, if I try to use something that's more intuitive to me, like:
I lose the automatic measurement in the right basis even when I provide the right PauliString.

Yes, thanks!
