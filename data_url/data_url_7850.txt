This issue originates from a problem in the Help Group.
Calculating the entropy of a density matrix in the Dicke basis leads to -Inf, while the standard calculation with "entropy_vn" returns a finite (more logical) result.
I already tracked down the problem to the calculation of eigenvalues in dicke_trace_function. Due to numerical behaviour some eigenvalues have very small negative values, which lead to -Inf entropy. If these values are rounded to zero, the problem disappears. However, I am not sure, which way is the best way to perform this rounding.

The value for the entropy should not depend on the way it is calculated. I.e., we should have vn_dicke == vn_dicke_over up to numerical uncertainty.
