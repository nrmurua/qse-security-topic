There is an harmless but unnecessary dispatch id existing in the UI code which when visited just shows a blank UI page with no details. We should remove this special case if it's not needed anymore. It look something like this:

@Prasy12 is this a front end test ID ?
@santoshkumarradha We don't have any test-ids in OS.
@kessler-frost  Can you let me know the steps to recreate this?

@Prasy12 after starting up covalent if we go to http://localhost:48008/this-id-doesnt-exist we see this page.
Is it been shown in the list of dispatches in the dashboard page?
And can you try any other random text? Something like
http://localhost:48008/abcd and see if you're getting the same error?
@kessler-frost
It's not. It's only if we go to this url precisely.
Okay we will check @kessler-frost
Oh, actually you're right, it is the case with any other random url as well, I see the same page.
@RaviPsiog Can you validate this when you find time? TIA!
@Kamalesh-suresh Please take a look at this.
