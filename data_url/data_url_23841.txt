as described in #59 ,running a measurement in the background is not possible for numerical simulations.
hence I run my loop as:
This gives me the error:
I do unfortunately not know what causes this error. The datafile gets created fine, but with this error I do not get a handle towards this file.
I encountered a similar issue in working on #53 when I went to test Loops - some of these modes don't play so well with each other right now. I'll fix this at the DataSet level at some point (and I'll leave this issue open until I do), but for the time being I think you can solve it by adding data_manager=False to your loop.run(). That's what I do in a new wrapper I made loop.run_temp that's meant for loops that are embedded in other parameters.
This seems to be working for the moment,
thanks
This method worked using:
but when I run it as (which is more nice if I would actually like to save the outcome of the experiment)
I get the error:
It seems that qcodes doesn;t like to create new data-files. Is that a problem on my end, or is this a bug within qcodes?
@alexcjohnson I am running into this same error again.
I am running everything on the main process server and it complains with the same error message,
could you look into this?
@damazter  what this status with this ? The example you give is not enough to reproduce the issue.
@damazter is this still a problem ? I can't reproduce this nor #110 . Likely closed by Monday, unless a real example is provided.
Error is obsolete (this issue was raised before multiprocessing was working, fixing the multiprocessing probably fixed this issue along the way. Now that the multiprocessing will get rewritten, this issue is sort of obsolete)
