I stumbled into this tutorial with the following example of the pulse builder with AlignEquispaced:
Which outputs:

Right off the start, I think it's safe to say that this example is not a very good one for AlignEquispaced. With a single instruction, the excess duration is just appended before the instruction. And I would have simply changed the example here, unless I found this single instruction behavior a bit odd - Doesn't it make more sense to place the instruction in the middle of the total duration? If the user bothers to specify AlignEquispaced I think it would make more sense. I would also be fine with raising an error on this one. But pushing the instruction to the end of the duration seems counterproductive here.
To Do:
Note there is an alternative example on this documentation page: https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/0.24/qiskit.pulse.builder.align_equispaced
