Slack link for joining slack channel in README and #1237 is dead.
Click on the link mentioned in README and in #1237.
One should be able to join slack channel https://qiskit.slack.com
Create a new slack link which does not expire.
The link should be https://join.slack.com/t/qiskit/shared_invite/enQtNjQ5OTc5ODM1ODYyLTc2YWJhOWViZDA2OWI5N2EyMjIxN2YwODM5MWQyN2Q3MjczOGRlMDU4MzMxMWE5MzZjMzEzYzM3MmJiMzU5MzU
Link is not working :(
Hi, I couldn't find an active link to join the open qiskit channel.
Indeed, try this one https://join.slack.com/t/qiskit/shared_invite/enQtODQ2NTIyOTgwMTQ3LTI0NzM2NzkzZjJhNDgzZjY5MTQzNDY3MGNiZGQzNTNkZTE4Nzg1MjMwMmFjY2UwZTgyNDlmYWQwYmZjMjE1ZTM
It worked, thanks!
Hi @1ucian0,
Seems like the link isn't working again... Is there a new link?
https://ibm.co/joinqiskitslack should always be updated. The README file points there. Let me know if it does not work.
Thanks @1ucian0! It worked perfectly :)

Hi Luciano, is it still possible to join the Slack channel?
@konradha Can you use the new link https://qisk.it/join-slack. It should work. For future reference, we have switched over to https://qisk.it/join-slack, please use it in the future.
