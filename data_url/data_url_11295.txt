I am trying to run on Fedora (Fedora release 27 (Twenty Seven)), but I have no success so far.
Everything is up to date.
I am receiving following error message
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "HH.py", line 1, in 
from openfermion.hamiltonians import MolecularData
ImportError: No module named openfermion.hamiltonians
when I try to run the example: example
Many thanks in advance
What's the output of pip show openfermion?
This certainly looks like an install error.
I will close issue for now.
Thank you. It seems you are right. After I have installed properly, it worked as expected. :)
