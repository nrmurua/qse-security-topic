and i have a problem when we will use yy gate and ms gate.
Hi @XIECHO thanks for reporting, it will be fixed asap. (You can help/speedup by reporting more details.)

i think  the parameter is not right . aha

the cu3 matrix
@XIECHO OK, fixed. Will be published ~1 hour after now.
@XIECHO What issues you have with YY gate? It looks good to me.
@XIECHO OK, published. Please update quantum-circuit package to version 0.9.94.
XX, YY and ZZ gates are implemented natively in trapped-ion quantum computers. It is added by user request - I am not using it as well :)
@XIECHO may I close this issue?
