In the tutorial, the link on "circuit" in this sentence is broken:
To build the above variational quantum algorithm using Cirq, one begins by building the appropriate circuit.
From Craig:
It's because we are using relative links, but once it's in read the docs it's relative to that instead of GitHub.
Tell Dave we should not update the links, but instead update our tooling to translate the links. That goes for both read the docs and the package generation.
I think this is already fixed. The source says one begins by building the appropriate [circuit](circuits.md). This will link to the appropriate .md file. @dabacon
There are probably many many relative links, throughout the docs, with this issue.
I only found 2 for ones that link to docs/: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/856/files
#856 just "fixes" if you look at gitub.  We still need to update the tool for readthedocs links to work.
