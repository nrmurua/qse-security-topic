Specific bit of code:
Output:
WARNING:tensorflow:AutoGraph could not transform <bound method ParameterShift.differentiate_sampled of <tensorflow.python.eager.function.TfMethodTarget object at 0x7f514e8093c8>> and will run it as-is.
Please report this to the TensorFlow team. When filing the bug, set the verbosity to 10 (on Linux, export AUTOGRAPH_VERBOSITY=10) and attach the full output.
Cause: unexpected indent (, line 77)

Let me know if you need anything else
Thank you for attaching all this information, I was able to reproduce and find a fix!
We have run into these sorts of problems before where the autographer almost gets through autographing stuff, but gets hung up on little things here and there. It looks like in this case we had some formatting that it struggled with in parameter_shift.py. Fix is up here #207 .
In the meantime you are safe to ignore these warnings, but if you can't stand them then once #207 is merged the latest tfq-nightly should have this fix in it.
