At the moment the only way to insert delays is to use qiskit.pulse.Delay() and add this to the qiskit.Schedule() object. This does not allow for mid-execution (or even post-execution, pre-measurement) delays in OpenQASM-only machines (which, at the time of writing, is all open source IBMQ devices except ibmq_armok). Crucially, ibmq_armok only has a single qubit.
Adding this functionality would in particular allow certain error benchmarking circuits to be executed across 2 or more qubits on all open source IBMQ devices, before they necessarily allow OpenPulse integration (if ever).
First time issue ever submitted on GitHub so advice is welcome in this regard too
Please have a look at this #4555 and see if this meets your needs from an instruction level. We are considering adding a delay instruction to OpenQASM/QuantumCircuit and this would be accompanied by backend support.
Also welcome to Qiskit and thank you for making this issue, its good to know there is external demand for this feature.
Thanks - had a detailed look and that looks perfect. Any idea on how long that will take to get merged? @itoko ?
