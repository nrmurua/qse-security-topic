there is a unittest failing frequently which might be related to this issue
the rounding off is the reason for the unittest failing: -> need to remove the roundoff and make gui compatible with that
I suggest that we remove the nice-but-not-quite-working ProxyProperty currently implemented for rbw and replace it by the formerly used manually customized Properties. The other (preferrable but more time-consuming) option is to clean the widget (the widgets are the only source of error here, because it is not clear/consistent between different types of widgets where they get their information from - this is why ProxyProperty doesn't know how to handle this in a generic way), see also #277
recommendation: explicit solution that avoids ProxyAttribute
solved in develop-0.9.3
