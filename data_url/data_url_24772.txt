Examples for various use cases of the existing code are required as tutorials for potential users and future developers. These should ideally be provided as an IPython Notebook (http://ipython.org/notebook.html).
Task: Determine examplary use cases that must be covered by tutorials/examples.
Examples will be provided in a static form embedded in the documentation generated with Sphinx. Selected examples will also be provided in the form of IPython notebooks to allow a user to interactively experiment.
