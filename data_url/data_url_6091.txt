The behaviour of the pulse simulator function digest_pulse_obj is unclear in terms of what information is being drawn from where. Various parameters for the simulation are being populated from qobj and backend_options, and currently, it isn't possible to know which fields are drawn from where without opening and reading the code.
Additionally, some fields are being drawn from backend_options, but ideally would also be retrievable from qobj, to facilitate the use-case of a user getting a device configuration and directly submitting it to the simulator without specifying anything (or much) by hand. An example of this is the Hamiltonian.
Aside from pure simulation parameters like 'seed', backend_options should be treated as an override for the information that can otherwise be found in qobj. This allows the user to either specify, or not specify, information that can be found in the backend config, and also makes the behaviour of digest_pulse_obj more clear.
Edit: Nevermind, closing issue as it stemmed form a misunderstanding.
