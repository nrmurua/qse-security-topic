When #2414 was introduced it came with a sizeable performance regression in transpilation. This is best seen here: http://169.61.88.206/#quantum_volume.QuantumVolumeBenchmark.time_ibmq_backend_transpile?p-width=14&p-depth=34&commits=79c44e56
It is typically between ~1.2X  and ~1.9X times slower to transpile circuits with #2414 applied.
As a follow-on to: #2499 (comment) there is work to improve the performance introduced by #2414 in progress with #2529 and #2525, but it's not clear from those whether it will return to the prior performance or not. This issue is to track the progress to make sure we fix this prior to the next release.
Fix the performance regression.
@kdk added some additional benchmarks for circuit creation and the bit classes introduced an even larger performance regression there. The worst case was 5.87x slower: https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit/#circuit_construction.CircuitConstructionBench.time_circuit_extend?p-width=20&p-gates=2048&commits=79c44e56
