The text circuit visualiser raises a warning when using its default arguments if called on a circuit that has an opaque (to the drawer) instruction that operates on a single clbit out of a register.
gives
No warning for using the defaults with a regular circuit.
The drawer sets cregbundle=True by default, but really it wants to infer the best value in this case.  We probably want three-level logic, so the default is set to None.  This can still default to True at a suitable point of the drawer, but should cause no warnings to be emitted if it is inferred to be False instead.
