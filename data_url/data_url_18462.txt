Since introducing the checks for the SDK update code has been duplicated across quilc and qvm. This increases the likelyhood of having bugs.
I have also noticed little bits of duplication here and there. I think some code duplication is fine, especially for trivial functions (which comprise the majority of cases I have noticed), but at some point the scales tip in favor of having some shared dependencies, as you say. Perhaps a pair of systems like cl-rigetti / cl-rigetti-tests (or whatever you want to call them) is in order.
