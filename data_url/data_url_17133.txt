The following code returns a deprecation warning before listing a backend overview:
Run backend_overview()
A backend overview with no deprecation warning because I didn't call IBMQ.backends() explicitly. The issue arises because tools/monitor/backend_monitor.py uses IBMQ.backends() in the function get_unique_backends() to get all the backends for which to show the overview.
Update tools/monitor/backend_monitor.py to account for providers.
