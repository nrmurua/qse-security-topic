I want to get the IP address of the client on SSL server with the following code,
Here ret is 0, but peer address is
(gdb) print peer
$16 = {sin_family = 10, sin_port = 37604, sin_addr = {s_addr = 0}, sin_zero = "\000\000\000\000\000\000\000"}
Look the sin_family value is 10, that is AF_INET6, and s_addr is 0. However the client makes connection to server on IPv4.
apps/openssl s_server and s_client are used as server and client.
This is very weird, any ideas?
Many thanks,

Nope, not something we have experience with. Maybe check some generic Unix networking programming guides.
