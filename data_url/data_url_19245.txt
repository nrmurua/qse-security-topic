In some examples where it is necessary to load data from a different folder the code is not running.
I have found this problem in:
anomaly_detection
variational_classifier
I made an error as i was not executing the file from the correct folder. However as @alecandido suggested it should be better to have an absolute path to get the data.
I.e. you should get them relatively to the file path.
In particular, __file__ is a special variable containing the path of the module (filled by Python itself during the load process), so it's customary to do something like:
Once you have the directory containing the example in the here variable, you could use that one to spell out the path to the data.
E.g.
instead of:

P.S.: remember that if you use slashes inside the strings you might prevent the code to run on Windows (that separates paths by backslashes), while the / operator on pathlib.Path objects (and strings on the RHS) is actually adaptive, using the current system path separator
@Simone-Bordoni could you please implement this change in your example and in the other examples with similar issues?
I have changed them in PR #947
I have updated anomaly detection and variational classifier, moreover i have eliminated and unuseful import from EFQAE
