The compressed contraction crashes in some cases when using multiple hyperedges. See a minimal example below. It only seems to occur when the hyperedges have an odd number of inputs. The exact contraction works fine.

Hi @jjcmoon, yes compressed contraction for hyper tensor networks is not currently defined / supported. This should probably be caught and raise an error. Some options to proceed are:
Or longer term, more usefully:
Neither of which is trivial..
In general, the compressed contraction functionality is still very experimental, and I'd note for example, that you likely need to use a contraction optimizer specifically for compressed contractions to get any savings over exact contraction.
