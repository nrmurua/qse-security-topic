Each item in the checklist needs its own issue, and that issue needs to be linked here before starting.
Most of these are done in various places, and may need cleaning up, updating to use the latest code, or more thorough explanations.
Please assign me:)
I think a lot of pulse stuff needs to be reworked as the tutorials within the docs cannot access the IQX.
Also, much of the material I have seen can likely be put within the Qiskit docs.
Closing in preparation for archiving this repo in favor of the tutorials living directly in Qiskit (aka Terra), qiskit-algorithms, and qiskit-aer.
I believe this is out of date too.
