transpile() doesn't change the Parameter objects in the circuit if transpiring a single circuit (even if input is list of a single circuit). However when multiple circuits are transpiled then the Parameter objects of the circuits change so that they are no longer the same as the original Parameter
Running the code prints 'True True False'
New parameters shouldn't be created so code should print 'True True True' .
Not sure. The problem arises before _transpile_circuit is called from the parallel task so I think the issue might be in the parallelization.
Hi @abhishekagarwal2301 , thanks for reporting. This should be fixed by #2947 , which was included in the latest release if you use use python equality (==) for parameter comparison instead of identity (is).
Feel free to re-open if this doesn't work for you, or if there are other questions.
