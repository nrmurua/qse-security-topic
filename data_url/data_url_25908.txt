Currently write_streams_to_file will attach the stdout and stderr files to the results directory if those files are specified using relative paths. However, this always queries the results directory in the config file when instead it should be looking at the electron metadata.
Edit:
The stdout/stderr log files that are written to is determined by priority.
In this issue, we ensure that priority 2 is indeed being checked and implemented.
