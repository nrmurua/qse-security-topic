I ran into 38 test bugs in the latest version of cp2k@8.2.
Can you take a look?
[root@centos8 ~]# spack debug report
Could you report the error messages? This is before the Summary report.
@alazzaro The error is as follows:
There are too many error logs. I can only display a few. Most of the problems are Segmentation faults.
I hope you can test the 38 errors on CentOS8. There are detailed logs. I cannot display them all.
Interesting, we see the exact same errors on Eiger (AMD64, EPYC 7742).
@Tom-python0121 there's an unmerged PR for libint in Spack here: spack/spack#24665 which introduces debug and fma flags. Could you maybe try again with a libint +debug?
@dev-zero I installed libint as required, but there is a bug spack/spack#24744. Can you help fix the problem in the new libint package?
Ok, I've an idea what's going wrong here. It's interesting that we didn't get this error earlier in any of the other platforms (including EPYC 7742) running the 2/3center integral tests. From a coredump on Eiger (AMD64) I get:
The indicated line is where we're going to call the function pointer we pulled out of the array of function pointers. And since it fails already for n_a=n_b=n_c=0 which would be the first element in that array my guess is that our forward declaration of that array is bogus. Let's see whether libint 2.6 fixed the declarations of those arrays as indicated by the source code comments.
@pseewald if you have time and still remember the circumstances of that part of code, a hint would be really appreciated!
@dev-zero I have testedï¼Œbut there is an error occured:
If it's fixed, please let me know.
@Tom-python0121 thanks for the update
@JWilhelm any ideas?
about the original issue with libint: I think the problem was that we're often linking libint statically and that kind of forward-declaration of the pointer array works in this case. But both EasyBuild (on Eiger) and Spack (on @Tom-python0121's system and with Eiger) are linking dynamically with RPATH instead.
I'm wondering whether this explains the massive issues I/Debian had with libint2/cp2k shared linking on some architectures, but I don't have the bandwidth right now to do test builds.
