Hi,
After successfully installing cp2k version 9.1, running cp2k.psmp produces a Segmentation Fault.
Do you have any ideas?
cp2k.ssmp works properly.
Thanks in advanced for helping me.
System details:
CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009
NVIDIA Tesla V100
gcc version 9.3.1
openmpi version 4.1.1
cuda 11.1
cmake 3.18.4 (also tried using --with-cmake=install)
Installation steps:
Have you tried ulimit -s unlimited ?
Alternatively, you could build the pdbg version, which prints nice stack traces.
Running ./cp2k.pdbg -h
I obtained the following error:
This is strange. My guess would be that the #pragma once does not play nice with the dynamic initialization of the string constant.
Oops, I confused #pragma once with #pragma omp single. Then I'm out of ideas ¯_(ツ)_/¯.
What do you think @kabicm?
Looking at the stack trace again, this certainly smells like a case of the Static Initialization Order Fiasco as the crash occurs during __static_initialization_and_destruction_0.
Apparently, get_min_local_dimension() is called in strategy.cpp to initialize a static local variable. I'm a bit confused that this initialization happens during startup, because AFAIK it should get deferred until control flow passes through for the first time.
Nevertheless, get_min_local_dimension() belongs to a different translation unit (environment_variables.cpp), whose dynamic initialization is therefore not guaranteed to have been executed before.
