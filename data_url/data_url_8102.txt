I have seen in multiple places of the code (in qutip/core/data) that a TypeError is raised when the shape of the input Data (Dense or CSR) is wrong, even though  the Type of the input data is correct. Do we want to raise TypeError or ValueError? I ask this because we sometimes raise ValueError, which I believe should be the raised error. Examples are:
They should be ValueError if it's a correct type but incorrect shape.  pow was probably just a mistake on my part, and eigen is just copied from old QuTiP code without modification.
Ok, just what I thought. I actually found a few other functions that return TypeError so I wanted to check first before opening a PR.
