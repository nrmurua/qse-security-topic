The BackendV2 interface is the next version of the abstract Backend interface used for describing backends in Qiskit. It was introduced in qiskit-terra 0.19.0 and it's now the primary version used for representing backends in provider packages. We
should update Aer's backends AerSimulator, StatevectorSimulator, etc to be based on BackendV2 instead of BackendV1.
