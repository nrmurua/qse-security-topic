The simulation process remained at 15% and no results come out after refresh. I think there is no problem with my network (I can simulate before), is it because of the hardware resources occupation?
Expected behavior: (What you expect to happen)
The Strawberry Fields Interactive to 100%.
Actual behavior: (What actually happens)
The Strawberry Fields Interactive gets stuck at 15%

Reproduces how often: (What percentage of the time does it reproduce?)
Every time regardless of the gate/s used.
System information: n/a
The problem was brought up by a user here https://discuss.pennylane.ai/t/can-not-load-the-circuit-results-in-sf-interactive/1406
Thanks @CatalinaAlbornoz for reporting this! I have edited your comment for easier readability ‚úè
Closing the issue as SF Interactive has reached EOL and will no longer be supported in its current form üòø
