The Dilithium Makefile.Microsoft_nmake currently still specifies a TODO to set /W4 and fix the resulting conversion errors. It will require some similar work like #29, #61.
Given that Dilithium is currently not included anymore, this issue is superseded by the more general issue of adding a pqclean-compliant Dilithium.
