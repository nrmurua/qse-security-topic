Description
Two pages exist titled composites, but listing different methods that do not seem clearly delineated:
https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_dimod/reference/sampler_composites/composites.html
https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_system/reference/composites.html
Also DWaveCliqueSampler is confusingly not a composite sampler, may be worth a cross-reference.
To Reproduce
Expected behavior
Page titled 'Composites' should contain all composites, or else refine definitions and cross-reference
Environment:
Additional context
I'm fairly new to applying ocean tools and couldn't find the composites I expected: Expected to find FixedEmbeddingComposite on the sampler page.
We should probably at least mutually link these pages and explain the differences (e.g., composites specific to D-Wave systems)
