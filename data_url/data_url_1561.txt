In discussion of #4339 at the cirq cync, we thought it would be a good idea to think about moving some of the "interop" functionality from cirq-core, especially to_quil into 3rd party modules like cirq-rigetti if one exists. Then issues could be fixed by their rightful codeowners
A question: what will we do with other interop like to_qasm that don't have 3rd party modules to handle?
Xref: #4623
One proposal is that it could be moved to contrib.
Moved to triage-discuss to get a decision.
Discussion from Cirq-sync: We have moved quil outputs to cirq-rigetti now and qasm seems universal enough where we can just leave it in cirq-core (since it has no better home we can think of. Same goes for quirk). Going to close for now.
