#TODO: This is just a prototype - should add features and flexibility.
comment from @zlatko-minev :
The plots to be customizable, so you can change to log scale etc. doesn't need to be done for March.
This TODO will be removed from issue #215 and made into this issue.
This renderer will be sunset and replaced by pyaedt renderer.
