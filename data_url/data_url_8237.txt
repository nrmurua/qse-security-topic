Description
There was an error in line 613 of qutip/stochastic.py as the measurement operators for heterodyne detection in the implemented stochastic master equation should be c + c.dag() and 1j (c - c.dag()) as explicitely presented in equation (5.64) and the following 2 paragraphs in https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09523. The same measurement operators can also be drawn from equation (4.108) of Milburn & Wiseman Quantum Measurement and Control.
Changelog
Fixed error in m_ops definition for heterodyne detection in smesolve.
