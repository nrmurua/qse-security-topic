The metaclass abstraction  is leaking sockets, I think.
The mwe is hard to make (but nonetheless attached), but  it's simple to visualise that  the side effect of init, via the side effects of a possibly confusingly named set_persistent (which will connect a socket by default) result in a open socket, that will never be destroyed (until the interactive session is over (or gc zaps) ðŸ‘€).
Now create two instruments withe the same name: and watch how many connections appear.
Eventually they may die and get GC, but does seem dangerous.
Possibly also related   to  #411 .
