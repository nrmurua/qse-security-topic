When a mining pool found a solution for a block and submits it to the node and the block is being processed, in the meantime another solution found by a miner in the same pool, results into the submission of two solutions.
This is not a critical issue neither wastes miner CPU cycle, thus has been labelled as low priority. Fix for this issue is to lock submit mined block when a solution is being submitted.
Fixed in PR #1642
