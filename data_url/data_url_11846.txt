Since terra changes the order of Pauli, we might need to address how cplex_ising to handle the Pauli label.
I made one version that works for the newest Terra but maybe there is a better to do that.
here is the line I changed.

@t-imamichi
if you think it is okay, we can close this issue.
I tried it with https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/community/aqua/optimization/maxcut.ipynb;
but errors occur when importing get_algorithm_instance and get_input_instance.
Can you check it? I cannot run aqua-master.
I cannot find get_input_instance in aqua-master. Where can I find the information of the change?
@t-imamichi Thanks for your help.
There are numerous changes in Aqua recently.
One major change is that for the programmatic users, they won't be able to use get_xxx_instance anymore.
They will construct the object directly, and the same thing for get_input_instance.
Let me paste an updated script for that notebook later.
here you are
Thank you for the information. I checked the code and noticed a bug. I make a PR #203
Your maxcut scripts works well with the PR.
