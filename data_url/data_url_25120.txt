If a user installs covalent with COVALENT_SDK_ONLY=1 then the imports will fail currently since the qelectron plugins import mpire and pennylane packages which aren't installed in this mode.
After #1916 users will be able to disable quantum dependency installations by setting the COVALENT_DISABLE_QELECTRON env variable to 1 when performing the installation.
