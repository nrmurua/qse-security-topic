The pulse compress may increase the recursion depth of input schedule and crash the pulse assembler.
Prepare very long schedule
Note that rb_scheds.instructions does work.
If we use two qubits for RB, the assembler crashes at almost the half clifford length ~ 150.
This is a realistic setup and should be supported.
Perhaps QV is also affected.
Transform module should convert the schedule so that transformed schedule has the almost constant recursion depth.
I'm not familiar with the logic of transform. @taalexander
Instead of using << and |= please trying using sched. insert(inst, inplace=True)
