Due to our directory structure, and our dependency with Qiskit-Terra, we have a far from ideal testing workflow, which is very error-prone and confusing many times.
We have to figure out a way to improve this situation and make testing seamless again.
As for now, this has been greatly enchanced due to removing ___init__.py files where they were not needed.
One can build and install everything, by just typing: pip install . (as long as you have all prerequisites installed).
