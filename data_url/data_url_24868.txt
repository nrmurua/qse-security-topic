If the bug manifests in unexpected behavior (as opposed to a crash), confirm that you have consulted the
API documentation
Please provide a concise description of what the bug is.
When solving the eigenvalues of a fluxonium using sweep, adding another system without any coupling between the two changes drastically the values found.
To minimize misunderstandings, please state briefly what you expected to happen.
Not coupling two systems should not change the solution for a single system.
If not clear from your description above, please provide the steps to reproduce the behavior:
Here is an example with a fluxonium and a resonator.
Here is the result I get:

Any additional information you would like to provide to aid us.
I tried to change the values of the cutoff parameters, but didn't see any improvement.
Hi - thanks for posting this. I am not quite sure yet we are truly looking at a bug. Note: you are plotting differences like w01 and w12. In the first version, those are always differences between fluxonium eigenenergies. In the second case - even without coupling - you will eventually include differences between resonator and fluxonium energies (as soon as there is a non-avoided crossing) among low-lying levels involved.
The workaround for that is to employ bare-product state labels instead of dressed indices. ParameterSweep and HilbertSpace allow for that through a spectrum lookup that converts between the two kinds of labels.
Thank you very much for you response.
In the end, instead of using sweep['evals'], what I needed was sweep.energy_by_bare_index((0,0), subtract_ground=True, param_indices=(0,-2,i,3,0)).
