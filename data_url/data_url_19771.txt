When performing state tomography on more than one qubit in a circuit that also contains classical registers, StateTomographyFitter.fit crashes.
I perform state tomography on the circuit
using the following code:
It crashes with the stack trace
If I replace lstsq with cvx, I get instead
However, it doesn't crash when the classical register is removed from the circuit, or when measured_qubits is set to a singleton list [q[0]] or [q[1]].
No crash! Certainly, adding a classical bit that doesn't do anything should not affect the output.
Maybe there is a bug in qiskit.ignis.verification.tomography.data.marginal_counts or near one of its call sites.
Looking at the code, this is kind of by design because the additional classical register changes the form of the counts dictionary that is returned by results. For example, this is what is returned from the above example for the first circuit

I addressed this issue in the state tomography tutorials (see the 2nd to last cell in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/ignis/state-tomography.ipynb).
Also note that in your example you need to replace the statevector simulator with qasm simulator.
