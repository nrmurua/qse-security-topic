This change simplifies the creation of a Sequence by asking the Register to be provided directly to it, side-by-side with the Device, instead of feeding the Register through the device. It also allows each Device to be an instance of a PasqalDevice dataclass that, after initialization with the characteristics of a specific device, can be static and immutable (i.e. does not receive the Register).
