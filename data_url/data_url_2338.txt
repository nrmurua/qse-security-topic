When building a circuit is often useful to have some extra information about certain parts of the circuit.  For example you may want to preserve a certain part of the circuit while performing a transformation (optimization pass).  There isn't a great way to do this right now, but we were able to tag our operations, then we could use the tag to do this.
Tagging could also be used for diagrams.
Tagging might also be important when differentiating different "types" of gates for the same unitary.  For example sometimes exp(iZt) can be compiled out of a circuit, but sometimes you want it to stick around.
Thoughts?
Amusingly got a request for this today from someone else.
It seems like it would be low effort and generally useful for a variety of tasks.
It seems like there are a fair amount of different tasks where we have a generally accepted behavior or optimization pass, except we want to ignore one specific use case, so this would be a good way to accomplish all of those kinds of tasks.
Another question is whether Gates should also have tags.  Any gate with a tag transfers it to its operator when applied using on
Another question is about equality.  I guess gates and ops with different tags need to not be different.  I was going to lazily add the tags, but if we want that to work then there is a bit more work.
How much structure do you want tags to have? A string field? a list of strings? something more like an enum?
list of strings was my thought
