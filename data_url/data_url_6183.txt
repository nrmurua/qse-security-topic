You're looking for the symbol setup in skbuild https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/setup.py#L3, and it doesn't install such symbol:
hmmm, yes it does. scikit-build is a replacement of setuptools so the setup() function must be there.
You are looking into the files that compose the package, but setup is a function... so it must be defined elsewhere into these files.
You just need to previously install scikit-build as the error message says.
