The current version of OpenFermion is not compatible with cirq v0.13.  When attempting to run the necessary checks prior to pushing , this error notified me that certain features of cirq had been completely deprecated, which forces tests to be interrupted during collection. Prior to this, the version of cirq that was used, was v0.10. This issue was fixed by downgrading to an older version, v0.12.
hmm we test against cirq 0.13 and cirq.Qid was introduced a really long time ago.
I'll investigate
I couldn't reproduce naively.
Can you paste your exact openfermion and cirq version
The version used when I ran into this incompatibility for openfermion and cirq version was 1.0.0 and 0.13.0 respectively. The reason for using such an outdated version of OF is because it is installed in editable mode, for method development.
Ok, you need a more recent version of openfermion to use a recent version of Cirq. Since you've installed in editable mode it should just be a matter of git pull origin master in your openfermion directory. I recommend doing all development vs the master branch rather than vs the 1.0 release. You can always merge in the latest changes to your feature branch using git pull or git merge
