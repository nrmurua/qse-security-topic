This issue was captured in #783, but #783 was closed because the local emulation was no longer failing. However, the underlying invalid QIR generation issue still exists.
Specifically, For certain unrolled-loop test cases (like the one in the title), the compiler is injecting __quantum__rt__result_record_output calls even if if checks prevent measurements from occurring.
The compiler should not inject those calls for cases like this.
See this gist for the resulting QIR coming from the compiler at the time of this issue creation (freshly regenerated at the time of the creation of this new issue).
The QIR can also be generated like this in the dev image like this:
You can also run it on the provider hardware in order to see a test actually fail:
When run on H1-1E, the unit test should pass.
Not a regression
No response

That tracks. QIR lowering assumed straight-line code.
