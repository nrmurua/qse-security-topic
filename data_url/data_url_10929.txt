I've tried the classic MapColoring sample but got a seemingly incorrect output SVG.
Environment: Cygwin64_2.873, GNU make 4.2.1, Python 2.7.9.
Intermediate Files: usa.qubo, usa.qbout(i.e. "xaa")
Does it means, currently qbsolv is still in its simulated annealing version, so cannot solve a N=51 NPC problem?
I have found the problem.  The .adj file has HI ( Hawaii ) listed incorrectly.  It should be after GA (Georgia)  The order of the states in usa.adj must correspond with the order of the states in blank_US_state_map.svg.  I will push a fix.
pushed a fix for example program
The adj input was out of alignment with the blank map, also forced HI and AK to different colors in adj file, and one line of output was missing in the color_states.py program
