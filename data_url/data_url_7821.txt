In the documentation for mesolve it says that callback functions are not supported for c_ops, but support does exist for QobjEvo, which are callables.
Separately, propagator checks that c_ops are only Qobj or lists of Qobj, but can actually be QobjEvo due to mesolve's support. It's easy to workaround this by setting _safe_mode=False.
Although it seems qutip 5 has fixed these issues it would be good to have the documentation reflect the current level of support.
