We support 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6. So basically all of them (I don't think any of the other versions are really in use). We certainly can do this. I think a good option would be to add a badge showing the versions supported (for instance, this is done in ProjectQ). @Strilanc or @dabacon do you know how to add that badge?
Actually, @damiansteiger or @thomashaener can you comment on how to configure this badge? Since you guys set this up in ProjectQ you must know how to do it.
Added badge.   This isn't pulling from anywhere specific, but using the custom badges from https://img.shields.io/
