Describe the bug
The testing suite is reporting potential memory leaks (test_constant_time.txt) for Classic McEliece which are not documented in the suppression files.
To Reproduce
I am unable to reproduce this issue locally. Additionally, these errors aren't being caught by the CI during weekly constant time tests. One might try to reproduce this with following steps:
Thank you for sharing this issue @bhess! Could you please share information about your environment:
Environment (please complete the following information):
Addressing the (potential) leaks documented in this issue doesn't fix the larger issue of the current Classic McEliece implementation (potentially) not being constant time in certain environments. Aside from documenting this in the advisories (as in #1541) should we be taking additional measures for the final 0.9.0 release?
Thank you for picking this up @praveksharma !
The environment is:
OS: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
OpenSSL version 3.0.2
Compiler version used: GCC 11.4.0
Build variables used: -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DOQS_ENABLE_TEST_CONSTANT_TIME=ON
liboqs version: main
This is an interesting problem!
I have no real experience (I think I understand the McEliece cryptosystem), but if this isn't too bad to fix I can try. Any analysis yet? Why is this happening?  What architectures are having this issue and on what version?
@praveksharma, do we consider this to be resolved?
