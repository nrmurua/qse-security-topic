I use binder image in the Qiskit readme
The histogram of cell 13* in entanglement_introduction.ipynb shows only one state (00), however, it should show 2 random state as described in the context.
*The output is the measurement of the figure below

I get the same result every time when I reset and restart the notebook
I should show random states as described in the context instead of a deterministic state.
Hello,
I use (qiskit 0.7.2| python 3.6.3 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| Windows 7). The problem seems to be related to BasicAer.
I am able to reproduce the same bug when I use:
backend = BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
The problem disappears if I use:
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
Hello
it works like magic! , Thanks for your answer
