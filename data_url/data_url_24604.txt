Currently TimeType allows arbitrary fractions.
I think there isn't any usecase for which a single denominator i.e. a global clock is not enough. However, the user should in principle not be burdened with setting that clock. If hardware is present this can easily done via taking the greatest common divisor of all instrument sample periods. We could provide a common default value in that case and provide an easy function to set the clock.
This only makes sense if 1ns is always part of the greatest common divisor calculation.
The performance gains I measured do not justify the amount of work. I am closing this in favour of putting more stuff into an extension.
