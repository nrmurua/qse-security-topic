It would be good to guarantee that e.g. [t for t in tn] always returns tensors in the same order on two different runs of the same script. This particularly applies to the TN simplification functions rank_simplify, diagonal_reduce (which currently seem to be non-deterministic).
As of python 3.7, the actual order tensors are iterated over in tn.tensor_map should already be guaranteed to the be the insertion order.
Tensor order should now be deterministic, even after tn.full_simplify().
