We should choose a theme for the docs. I propose the pydata one, instead of the classic rtd theme. Let's have a discussion on this here, as this is related to #205 but predates it.
One thing that would need to be fixed of the proposed pydata style documentation for mitiq is the fact that in the top left button, reading "Mitiq", does not take one to the root folder page, which one accesses at ~github.io/mitiq, but takes you to ~read_README.html. There needs to be a way to tweak this. The reason is that we have no logo for mitiq, see for example the behavior in the pydata sphinx theme website itself, where clicking on the pandas logo takes you to the index. I'd like to find a fix.
I like the current theme (this is the pydata one, right?). Overall the docs are looking great! Thanks Nathan and everyone.
About the top left "Mitiq" button: this is not the title of the documentation but it is actually the title of the first section of the documentation (the README section). This explains the strange behavior, but I agree that it can be confusing.
Thank you @andreamari. It sufficed to add the option in the configuration file conf.py
to correctly display the logo, which takes the user to the main page. Lacking a mitiq logo, I added Unitary Fund's. It also now justifies better the top menu.
We also agreed via email about the pydata theme, so I am closing this issue.
