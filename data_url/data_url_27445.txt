Some enhancements for the sidebar. I've added an image to the bottom to clarify each of the enhancements
 Quicker navigation using hotkeys
Instead of clicking on the sidebar, using hotkeys to quickly navigate the items would be useful. In particular, a few of the navigations should be:
 Specify at what minimum level an item should expand.
As an example, in the image below, when NMR is pressed, I want all the subheaders to expand except Pulse train. This one should stay minimized. Ideally, there should be a hotkey that increases/decreases the minimum level. This should be saved in the notebook such that it is remembered next time.
 Show all initialization cells.
An initialization cell is run during startup. Info on whether or not it is an initialization cell is written in the cell's metadata. Ideally there would be a button/letter at the top that, when pressed, only shows the initialization cells together with its corresponding header.
 Remove triangles for items that cannot be expanded.
In the image below, Tau does not have any subheaders, but it still has a triangle.
 Add second sidebar on right-hand side.
Currently, the javascript code for the sidebar is completely mixed with the code for the table of contents. Ideally, this should be seperated, as it would allow us to create multiple sidebars. We can then add the table of contents to either of the side bars, maybe as a widget. We can also add other widgets to either of the sidebars.

Completed 2/5 points, remaining ones will be done some time in the future
Not sure if this is going to continue, we are very slowly gearing up towards jupyterlab
