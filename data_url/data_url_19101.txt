Taking the adjoint of an objective that contains a numpy array as a control throws an AttributeError ('numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'dag')
It turns out that this was because some Lindblad operators were being passed that were not in the correct qutip nested-list format. So, not really a bug.
