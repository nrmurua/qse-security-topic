@imranashraf @Nader-Khammassi
I would like the OpenQL repository to be an open repository. @imranashraf told me that we just need an OK from @Nader-Khammassi .
I think this is important for several reasons in addition to the general open source stuff
I think that both reasons make this something we really want to do.
as it is open now, so closing this issue
