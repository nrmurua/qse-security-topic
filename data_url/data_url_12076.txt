I am not sure what category to put the amplitude estimation and random variates under. @stefan-woerner do you have any thoughts on this?
I'm curious about this issue. It looks like there is no longer a tutorial on amplitude estimation in this repo or on the Qiskit Web site. Was it moved somewhere else or does it no longer exist? I found this one: https://github.com/stefan-woerner/qiskit-tutorials/blob/0697eae042dab907b19a6b6cb267b7829d022379/qiskit/aqua/general/amplitude_estimation.ipynb
Yeah, this issue is stale @wagnersj. Thanks.
