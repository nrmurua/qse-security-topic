Running the first cell of code in the state_tomography tutorial notebook:
throws this error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit.ignis.error_mitigation'
Run the first code cell in the state_tomography notebook
Packages should be imported without any errors
I replaced the line: import qiskit.ignis.error_mitigation.measurement as mc with
import qiskit.ignis.mitigation.measurement as mc as I saw the folder 'qiskit/ignis/mitigation' was similar to what was being originally called. After I did this I ran through the notebook and the imports did not throw any errors. The other cells seemed to work as well.
