Using 2.0.dev+563.gc4559fc on windows, I have the following code,
Which generates the following error message,
The problem seems to be having an if statement with strings in the kernel. Would it be possible to have support for them? For our particular case we can work around with integers but it could be useful to someone else in another situation.
If it's hard to support this, could it be specified in the documentation that if statements are with Boolean values or with integers/floats? Also, this error message seems a little hard to interpret.
This was already supported, just didn't work properly because of a separate bug.
That was quick, thanks!
