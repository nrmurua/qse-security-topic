random_quantum_circuit_generation.py has two "named" patterns: GRID_STAGGERED_PATTERN and GRID_ALIGNED_PATTERN.  They are documented.
In the grid_parallel_two_qubit_xeb.py experiment though, there's a third, unnamed pattern which seems like half of GRID_STAGGERED_PATTERN. Why was this chosen? Should we promote this to a "named" pattern in rqc_generation.py?
@viathor @kevinsung
The only logical requirement on the pattern used in grid_parallel_two_qubit_xeb.py is that it involves all possible grid interactions. A staggered pattern was chosen because it matches the one used to calibrate the chip internally (at least, I thought that was the case when I implemented it). It actually might make sense to call this one GRID_STAGGERED_PATTERN and change the name of the one that currently has that name to GRID_STAGGERED_PATTERN_HARD or something like that.
I like that idea. Do we have to care about backwards compatibility issues if we do that rename? I'll try to poke around if anyone is using it internally
