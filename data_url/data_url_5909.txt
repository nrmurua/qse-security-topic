When importing qiskit in the python REPL, I get the following error message:
However, doing a quick pip list | grep qiskit yields:
which means that qiskit-aer is installed, contrary to the error message.
Importing Aer from qiskit must not yield error messages.
One way is to downgrade to python 3.8.6 but I don't see why version 3.9.0 might have this issue.
I have same problem in Arch Linux. What do you get when you try
In my case I get this error
Anyways, in the requirements for the moment they do not support python 3.9 officially, so probably there is some issue that they will fix for the next release. If I find out a solution I will let you know.
@iyanmv Yes, there was an update about 3 days back which rolled out python 3.9 to Arch linux (Artix is Arch without systemd).

I get the same error as well.
@iyanmv There's a hacky solution for now. In the AUR, python-3.8 is available as the packagepython38. I created a virtual environment using virtualenv available in the official repos as python-virtualenv and specified the version of python to be used. Installed qiskit and it works as expected. However, this only works with the virtual environment.
You can create the virtual environment using:
There is no release of qiskit-aer with python 3.9 support yet (I'm working on a PR now to add it to ci, update pkg metadata, etc). But in the meantime since there are no precompiled binaries locally unless there are unforeseen issues there shouldn't be any blocker from building it from source locally with python3.9. The error undefined symbol: slamch_ normally means that you don't have a lapack library that aer works with locally. Normally I use openblas with lapack support enabled. (on archlinux https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openblas-lapack/ )
