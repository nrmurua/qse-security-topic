In some rare cases, like the example below, simdiag does not return orthonormal eigenvectors, despite this always being possible.
Since by requirement of simdiag all input matrices must be hermitian and commute, the common eigenvectors should always be orthonormal.
The fix is simple:
Here
la.eig has to be replaced by la.eigh
Thanks @Sola85. Would you mind trying this on 4.7.3?

Yes, this is reproducable in 4.7.3 and in the current master branch
