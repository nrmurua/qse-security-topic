Across many different circuits I am getting this error when executing jobs.
The warning does not provide much useful information on what exactly the bug is.
@epelofske-LANL Thanks for reporting this!
Thanks for the report. In this particular case you pasted above the warning is overzealous and is safe to ignore. Z.SX.Z is indeed a longer sequence in terms of gate count, but nevertheless actually preferable over SX.X in terms of fidelity (Z gates do not cause infidelity for common hardware platforms). We changed this message to a DEBUG level log message in #7124 Since the warning can still in certain cases indicate an actual problem, we hope to have a more complete solution once #7084 merges.
Closing as already-fixed but feel free to reopen if there's something I missed.
