One of the groups in Qiskit Camp was focused in improving the our current DAG. A lot of small issues accumulated around DAG and it's time for a big refactor to balance out the technical debt here:
In general, this is the plan:
I will try to focus exclusively on this on the coming days because it's a change that will touch many things. So, it will probably happen soon. I'm touching base with @ajavadia to keep it align with the broad goal and @boschmitt is the main driving technical force in this effort.
Closing this as not relevant anymore. Most of the things listed here have already been done or aren't really relevant anymore. Especially a lot of the performance and optimization things were addressed by moving to retworkx andother tuning. If there are any outstanding things in the DAGCircuit api we need to cleanup we can open that in a separate issue
