I have edited the private server of QD_DynaCool to work with PPMS. Also the instrument driver is obtained mainly just by changing the name "DynaCool" to "PPMS".
The server.py works on the PPMS dedicated control PC.
However, when the server talks to the controlling software 'MultiVu', AttributeError emerges. I guess the 'GetChamberTemp', 'GetLastTempSetpoint', 'GetFieldSetpoints' commands do not work for PPMS.

How to get the right commands for PPMS privater server?
How would the AttributeError of PPMS_private_server be solved?
If this issue is solved, I expect to commit the driver for PPMS.
The commands of PPMS is expected to be the same with DynaCool. Most of the commands work properly, such as GetTemperature,  GetField, GetChamber, *IDN. Right status of the PPMS could be obtained.
However, 3 commands listed below get AttributeError on the PPMS dedicated control PC when running the server.py.

Running the following code when the above code is commented out to make the server running.
The result is as follows:
operating system
Windows
qcodes branch
0.4.0

Hi @zznature, thanks for reaching out. I must admit that I am not completely sure what you are doing. Could you elaborate on what you mean by

?
It might be good if you could refresh my memory on what the instruments are called and what they do. What's the difference between DynaCool and PPMS?
In any case, I agree that it looks like you are trying to call non-existing methods of the MultiVU API. Do you have any API documentation from the instrument vendor? When I wrote the DynaCool driver, I used the instrument simulator (proprietary software, can be obtained by writing to the instrument vendor and asking nicely) to look up the API calls and their call signatures. It was rather cumbersome, but no proper documentation existed.
Thanks! @WilliamHPNielsen  Sorry that I did not express myself clearly.
DynaCool is the cryo-free version of PPMS, with some updates possibly, in my opinion. Both are made by QuantumDesign, Inc. I have asked for the python socket_server files from QuantumDesign, which are in python 2.7 and the same for PPMS and DynaCool.
I have only changed the name from 'DynaCool' to 'PPMS' in the private_server.py and instrument driver of DynaCool.py in Qcodes. So I am wondering how to obtain the API for the controlling software, MultiVu. With your reminder, I have sent an email to QD asking the API.
The PPMS MultiVu version in our lab is 1.5.11.
Actually at present I could work with the results in the snapshot above. The value of temperature and field could be acquired, only the setting parameters are not acquired.
