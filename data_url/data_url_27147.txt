Psi4 fails to build on the 21.11 branch. It attempts to pull QCElemental from an external source:

It seems that 23.0, which is in nixpkgs is too old for Psi4-1.5
@sheepforce should we downgrade Psi4 for NixOS-QChem-21.11 or back port QCElemental 24.0 to nixpkgs-21.11 (maybe the latter one)?
Yes, it is too old unfortunately and strictly requires 0.24.0. I would rather backport QCElemental to 21.11, as Psi4 1.5 had important bug fixes, that are influencing correctness of results.
