Thanks to @JavierSerranoGarcia for pointing this out.
The benchmarks script gives a ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qibo.benchmarks' when attempting to execute with qibo installed using the standard user installation approach. I have tested installing both with python setup.py install and using the precompiled wheels and pip install and both cases result to this error. Benchmarks work only when installing with python setup.py develop which is what I was using so far so I did not discover this issue.
Personally I am okay if benchmarks are only accessible from the develop installation as they are probably not very useful for the average user, however if we want to include them in the "public version" we should probably fix this issue.
If I remember correctly we did not include the __init__.py file because indeed this should not be a qibo module but instead an external code. I believe we can move the benchmark folder to the root of the repository as soon as #99 is closed.
I am still getting some problems with the installation from source. I have a conda environment active  for installing qibo but when I  do
(qibo-0.0.1) javi@Mini-HP-WS:~/OneDrive/pythonDev/qibo$ pip install -r requirements.txt
the packages are installed in the base conda environment instead of the active one. This is quite weird  because the requirements file just has a list of packages.
Any idea about what is happening?
Are you sure you are using the pip command from your active environment? (you can check with which pip).
Thank you Stefano, I have been doing so many changes that I forgot to install pip in this environment
I am getting this error when try to install from source. After doing the build ...
but when I use pip option pip install -e . it works fine
Are you using python 3?
There is something strange, QIBO seems to be installed in a python3.7 environment. Please check carefully your python version to avoid trivial mistakes.
Closing this in favour of #166.
