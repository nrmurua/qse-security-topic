This is a follow-up to Issue-1721: GPU low clock usage.
I wanted to ask if there has been any progress on enabling batching over multiple circuits on GPU as mentioned by @doichanj
Aer sampler using GPU appears to not be optimized for executing multiple circuits and parameters as GPU usage only makes up for a relatively small fraction of the sampler.run() command.
Subsequent code can be executed to reproduce the behavior.
Above code outpus:
According to nvidia-smi, actual GPU usage only makes up ~5 seconds.
GPU also accelerates execution of multiple circuits.
Thank you, any suggestion on how to optimize multi-circuit execution is very much appreciated.
GPU optimization to parameterized circuits is implemented in #1901, but we found issue in AerSampler and currently this optimization is only available for AerEstimator. The fix for AerSampler will be provided
By combining PR #1901 and #1935 Aer can not accelerate this example because this example passes only 1 parameter per circuit.
Aer can only accelerate cases which passes multiple parameters per circuit at this time
