Using snapshots in circuits causes the qobj to fail schema validation, raising a SchemaValidationError. The issue is that the type of the snapshot is stored in a field called snapshot_type in the dict returned from qobj.as_dict(), but the schema is expecting a field called type
Changing the schema from having type to snapshot_type fixes this problem, however it may be preferable to find where this error is being introduced.
