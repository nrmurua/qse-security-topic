Is there a method to add space in the circuit diagram generated with circuit_drawer. For example by adding dummy gates? In this way different sections is a quantum algorithm can be grouped together.
Yes, you can add identity gates followed by barriers, which will prevent the compiler from optimizing them out. See this notebook for an example:
