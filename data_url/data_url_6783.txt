This is a convenience for developers that ought to have no affect on uysers
When there is an error in a shader, the log shows "Error in Line 64" and then a dump of the source code.  As a convenience, there should be line numbers in the console log to make it easier to find where the mistake is.
This is a small change to WglShader.js.  Patch is already written.
