qiskit                      0.7.0

qiskit-terra             0.8.0
Windows 10
When running this line:
from qiskit.providers.aer import noise
I got:
from qasm_controller_wrapper import qasm_controller_execute
ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
There are additional error messages:
from .aerprovider import AerProvider

Running this line:
from qiskit.providers.aer import noise
I meet the same problems.
This problem comes from the Aer modulor can not be imported
you can try
from qiskit import Aer
and you will get the same ImportError: DLL load failed
Thanks for reporting! I'll look into this
I probably had a similar problem. I have posted by solution on stackoverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53929599/cannot-import-aer-from-qiskit-0-7/54275759#54275759
To make it short, I found that just copying the legacy simulator's openblas.dll into site-packages solves this for me. Maybe it helps you too?
Yeah, I noticed that. A new version with some bug fixes (this included) is coming very soon.

Could you tell the details of doing this: where to get openblas.dll, and where to place it (give folder names)?  Thanks!
@cubicgate I will clarify, yes! In my setup, I copy from
<anaconda_install_dir>\Lib\site-packages\qiskit\providers\legacysimulators\openblas.dll
to
<anaconda_install_dir>\Lib\site-packages\openblas.dll
In general, i.e. using python environments, the openblas.dll must be placed where qiskit-aer has placed its files
I am pretty sure adjusting some path (something equivalent to LD_LIBRARY_PATH) would do the same trick. I wasn't particularly interested in getting much deeper into the subject once I repeatedly was able to fix this issue with the described way. I hope this help!
Hi carstenblank,
Thanks for your detailed tip. It worked for me.
cubicgate
When I run this example at the bottom of this web page: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer
The following lines:
result_noise = execute(circ, simulator,
noise_model=noise_model,
coupling_map=coupling_map,
basis_gates=basis_gates).result()
have this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 4, in 
File "C:\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\qiskit\tools\compiler.py", line 110, in execute
return backend.run(qobj, **kwargs)
TypeError: run() got an unexpected keyword argument 'noise_model'
When run these lines:
result_noise = execute(circ, simulator,
noise_model=noise_model,
coupling_map=coupling_map,
basis_gates=basis_gates).result()
from this example: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/qiskit/aer/device_noise_simulation.ipynb
Have the same error
@cubicgate sorry I think I can't help you there. I have tried the examples, they work for me. However, I notice that you use qiskit-terra 0.8.0. Could it be that is doesn't work with qiskit 0.7.0?
Thanks carstenblank for your kindness to help me. Yes, after I changed to 0.7, it worked for me.
Perfect!
@atilag thanks a lot, I appreciate the bug fix & looking forward to this!
Latest version of Aer (0.1.1) should have this fixed. I'm closing this issue, reopen it if needed.
I can't import Aer, I'm getting an import error
Still getting this error  on python 3.6.2 and using pip. Already upgraded qiskit, but didn't work.
I too have this problem. I think it should be re-opened (@carstenblank).
Running from qiskit import Aer gives
It was suggested on Stackoverflow to try from qiskit.providers.aer import Aer . It gives the same error as above.
I am having the same problem. The error says 'DLL load failed while importing controller_wrappers: The specified module could not be found.'
