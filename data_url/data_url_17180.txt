With some recent changes, a circuit that gets transpiled onto a coupling_map now will contain information about which qubits of the original (virtual) circuit correspond to which qubits of the final (physical) circuit. For example:


This request is to show the layout information next to each qubit. This can be found via:
So I envision something like:
Note: the fact that we have q0, q1, .. q19 is an artifact of not being able to create register-less circuits currently. Eventually this should just be shown as physical qubits 0, 1, ..., 19.
The example Layout is the reverse mapping, but other than that this is good.
