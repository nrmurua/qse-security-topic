Is there an code example and documentation  available in QuNetSim to define a simulated quantum network over a physically distributed classical network using IP nodes. Would be nice feature to to simulate network latency testing, like satellite networks.  Thanks for guidance.
Thanks for the post, that's an interesting idea.
Currently we've not demonstrated this completely but have been thinking closely about it.
