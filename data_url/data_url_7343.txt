Following a discussion with @PhilipVinc on gitter: it makes sense to split QuantumOptics into sub-packages. At the very least into two, where one does not do any time evolution and thus is independent of any DiffEq packages (say a package called QuantumOpticsBase.jl).
Things that should definitely go into QuantumOpticsBase:
Things that should probably go into QuantumOpticsBase:
Everything else should be kept separately. For now it should probably suffice to load QuantumOpticsBase.jl into QuantumOptics.jl and keep all the remaining things there as well.
It's important to proceed in a structured way here:
I agree with your definitely list.
About the other things... I'd like to share this simple load time benchmark, done by substituting all include("xyz") statements in QuantumOptics.jl with @timeit to "xyz" include("xyz") statements.
Every line is the time spent loading a specific file. See this gist
My idea for QuantumOpticsBase is for a package to be able to
A nice way to think about this is to try to keep the dependencies of QuantumOpticsBase.jl to a minimum.
As such, I believe that
Additional thoughts:
Just wanted to say that as someone who currently uses QuantumOptics mainly for Hilbert bases and quickly creating Hamiltonians to test things I would really appreciate this change!
I'd also like to help out wherever I can, although I've only recently started using Julia.
(P.S. I agree with David that Pauli stuff should go into the QOBase)

I included:
I excluded spectralanalysis for now since it's really just a thin wrap around Julia's diagonalization routines anyway. @PhilipVinc I don't think metrics depends on spectralanalysis. Eigenvalues in metrics are computed from the .data field or did I miss something there?
Regarding the FFTOperator: I agree it's unfortunate to have FFTW just for this. However, it would feel a bit inconsistent if we include every subtype of AbstractOperator except this one. So I kind of want to keep it.
I still have to make some changes to new repository (like changing the readme and stuff). Other than such superficial things I think it's done, though.
I think you can remove the WignerSymbols dependency.
You are also right on spectral analysis. I had just quickly skimmed over the code in metrics.
I think that's great!
