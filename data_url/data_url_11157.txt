Both the molecular and (soon-to-be-merged) pbc resource estimation code is not tested through the CI, largely because there are some external dependencies (pyscf, btas,). I think we should enable these as part of the CI, possibly only run if the resource estimation code is touched. An alternative would be to migrate these to open-fermion pyscf or similar.
Either way, tracking if the upsteam dependencies don't break things is important.
