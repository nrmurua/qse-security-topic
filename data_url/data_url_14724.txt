When it is used in a controlling circuit, QuantumCircuit.diagonal() decomposition does not provide global phase (as a relative phase), but instead only identity operator is used.
The code example is:
The output statevector corresponds to the case where identity operator is used in CIRCF_1.to_gate(label='DiagGate1')  and CIRCF_2.to_gate(label='DiagGate1'), without applying the global phase as relative phase. The list of diagonal entries in PARAM1 and PARAM2 does not affect the output in any way, i.e. the output statevector is always in form:
Output state vector should be 0.5|0>(GATECIRCF_1+GATECIRCF_2)|Psi>+ 0.5|1>(GATECIRCF_1-GATECIRCF_2)|Psi>, where |Psi> is the initial state given by the H|0> for all qubits. Any change in PARAM1 or PARAM2 gives exactly the same output as above.
Global phase for .diagonal method should be included.
