Add support for the FORKED gate modifier to pyQuil.
See the Gate Modifiers section of the Quil spec  for a description of the FORKED modifier, plus the respective cl-quil and qvm PRs:
Once this is implemented, don't forget to update the Quil spec grammar, as per the code review comment thread here:
quil-lang/quil#15 (comment)
This is going to be non-trivial since it extends gate applications (even standard gates) to take a variable number of parameters.
