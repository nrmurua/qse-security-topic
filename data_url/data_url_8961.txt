I am currently using your provided example in the README for sinter and I added "plot_args_func" in the sinter plot shown above to see how much I modify the plot.
I encountered the error above. It appears that "plot_args_func" is not implemented in sinter command line. Is this intended? I am using Stim version 1.9.0.
It wouldn't be unreasonable to add a command line argument to use that functionality, since it's exposed to the python API.
Although, just to make people more generally aware, sinter plot is not intended to be a swiss army knife plotter that can do anything and everything. It's supposed to be a simple way to get a quick look. Anything more involved should move on to writing python code that can more intimately interact with matplotlib.
