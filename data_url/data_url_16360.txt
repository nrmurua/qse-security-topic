Same as other drawers:

@1ucian0 Maybe I can help with this, would that be ok?
Sure! Thanks!
Perfect, I'll start taking a look later today.
Thanks!
Fwiw, this used to work fine. It looks this was a regression introduced in: #4410
Yeah, the issue seems to be that "self.ops" is empty, but its first element is checked in if self.cregbundle and self.ops[0][0].name == "measure"
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/visualization/latex.py#L302
Now, if I have understood correctly, self.ops is the list of layers in the circuit: @1ucian0 is it supposed to be empty for a QuantumCircuit?
I noticed in text.py it's handled differently (called instructions there, but still, if I'm not mistaken...), so my guess is that it's OK and it's fine just making sure the list isn't empty, is that right?
Sounds good to me. Let's discuss it in a PR ðŸ˜Š
