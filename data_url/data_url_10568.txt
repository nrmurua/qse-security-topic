Current Problem
The clique sampler by default uses extended J range (when possible), disabling the ability to perform spin reversal transformations.
Proposed Solution
if the parameter num_spin_reversal_transforms is passed to the sample method, we should use j_range instead of extended_j_range and maybe raise a warning.
Alternatives Considered
The alternative is using FixedEmbeddingComposite with minorminer.find_clique_embedding, and set things by hand, but adds a level of complexity in the script.
You can also do SpinReversalTransfromComposite(DWaveCliqueSampler()), is SRTs on the logical problem good enough or do you need them on the embedded problem?
I kinda wanted to have them on the embedded problem, but I'll test it first.
I don't love the switching behavior of not using the extended J range based on a seemingly unrelated parameter - we know the relation but the user probably wouldn't intuit it.
One solution would be to emit a warning, but I find that unsatisfying as well.
