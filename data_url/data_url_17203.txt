Part of the #2678 Epic. Repeated below:
Change: BaseBackend.cmd_def should return a CmdDef rather than a list of PulseQobjInstructions.
Rationale: This discussion is rooted in our desire to modularize the transport layer. We usually don't want to be working with message passing instances directly. Currently, it is up to the user to reformat their data properly by calling CmdDef.from_defaults(backend.defaults().cmd_def, backend.defaults().pulse_library). When the user asks for a command definition from the backend, they should receive data already formatted -- and it is easier to understand when a .cmd_def attribute returns a CmdDef. This minimizes the scope of the message passing interface to message passing. After data is received, it is decoupled from the backend before being passed to the user to utilize in later function calls (such as in qiskit.scheduler.schedule/schedule_circuit).
This is also being fixed by pulse defaults being updated
