Greetings,
Ever since I produced some circuits using liquid I've been using the LiquidTikz.tex file as a "library" to make my circuit using tikz. I'm not sure if Q# has an updated version of this library or something similar.
I like that it's fairly simple and straightforward to use. But, mostly, that it uses tikz instead of e.g. qcircuit's XY-pic so I can integrate and modify the images in a way that I am familiar with.
There's some small things that could use improving. Specifically, the file has some side effects on inclusion (e.g. setting text height and depth globally) and would ideally have some configuration options for the colors used (or leave those up to the user, it's tikz after all!).
Anyway, the licensing situation is a bit unclear to me. If you do not wish to work on it, would you consider releasing it under a free software license?
We're working on making this available under an MIT license. Sorry for the delay!
