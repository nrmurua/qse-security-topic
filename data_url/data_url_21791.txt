When installing Artiq with Conda >= 4.3, conda throws error about missing "noarch/repodata.json" file.
In testing, adding m-lab and conda-forge channels via conda config (or .condarc file) fixes this issue.
M-Lab Conda channel admin should run following commands in the conda directory (on the buildbot directory, probably), as shown above.
Alternatively, can just force users to add m-labs channel first, but this is a straightforward fix.
conda create -n "any_env_name" -c mlabs artiq
The remote server could not find the noarch directory for the requested channel with url: https://conda.anaconda.org/mlabs
It's m-labs / https://conda.anaconda.org/m-labs and not mlabs / https://conda.anaconda.org/mlabs. Could that be the actual problem?
https://conda.anaconda.org/m-labs/noarch/repodata.json exists.

Confirmed. Misspelled m-labs as mlabs. Fixed the issue.
