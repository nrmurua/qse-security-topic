Reading this paper : Here ,
I noticed that the equation for the PauliFeatureMap (equation 3) featured an alpha parameter (which is not present in the equation of this page of the documentation here, but that's another problem).
In the said equation, the parameter alpha can be set individually for each Pauli gate. However, in the PauliFeatureMap code, you can only give alpha a float (or a Parameter).
I tried to integrate the ParameterVector for alpha : PauliCustom.zip, but the created circuit has a weird behaviour. When I print the final circuit, only the Parameter starting at index 2 are in fact present in the feature map.
Lets say I try to create the CustomPauliFeatureMap object like so :
Then the drawn circuit is :
I'm guessing that there is a behaviour I dont understand in the Nlocal class, and I hope my code helps.
