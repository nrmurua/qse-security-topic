README seems to suggest that the Slack #dev channel is available to hang out in, but if you try to join it seems to only accept people with an @rigetti.com or @qxbranch.com email address.
Huh. That shouldn't be the case, and I don't see anything in the settings that suggests this is the case. Can you post a screenshot of what you're seeing?
@lukego Maybe former and present devs now speak in #qlisp on Freenode. We ought to update the README.
