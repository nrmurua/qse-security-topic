I was playing around with things like CONTROLLED CONTROLLED Z 0 1 2 and noticed that the behavior of Quilc is very sensitive to the specific choice of single qubit gate. For example, consider the following session
Since X = HZH, one would hope for less disparity between these two numbers.
The behavior is also sensitive to Z vs RZ(pi) and so on,
I realize these are somewhat special cases, but it would be nice to handle them a bit better. For a very naive bound, one can refer to Theorem 8 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0406176.pdf (this could even be implemented as an explicit define-compiler). There are probably even better bounds out there.
I should probably tone down the warnings too.
