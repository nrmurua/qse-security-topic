When running TEST-COMPILER-HOOK test, when it signals a tolerance error, i.e., quil::state-prep-compression-tolerance-error, a second-level error is signaled with an error message that looks something like this:
Here's code to reproduce this, assuming you're in a REPL with quil test system loaded and in CL-QUIL-TESTS package:
This has recently been seen "in the wild" for a CI test associated with a recent and pending PR (#733). Here's a URL to the failing test: https://github.com/quil-lang/quilc/pull/733/checks?check_run_id=3759605488
Anyone know if there an issue already for the 1st-level error? I understand it's been ascribed to something like floating point imprecision by knowledgable folks such as @stylewarning
I didn't see the first error in a quick scan; but it's definitely "well known" and ought to be logged if it's not already.
