This is my stage now. Is this means HiQSimulator installed successfully or not?
Still with some problems I think.

Hello. According to the first log you have problems with gflags library. Though cmake reported that it was successfully found actually it is not. And than make scenario has failed to find gflags. May be you just need to install gflags using apt-get same as glog.
Nevertheless it is a but in cmake configuration scenarios and we have to fix it. Please in current wrong state try to find gflags.h file and libgflags.so* files and show the result. Also please show the output of the command
ldd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglog.so
pip install --user .

Ok problems solved I think.
Solution: Modified the file ./cmake/Findgflags.cmake line 103, added "!"
@Takishima Is there a more perfect solution?

This does not solve the issue at all!
The goal of this check is that if CMake is able to find the gflags library using the CONFIG method, then we need to extract the information about the library header and binary locations from the targets found (which can be either stored in CMake targets gflags::gflags, gflags or in CMake variables gflags_LIBRARIES and gflags_INCLUDE_DIR depending on the version of glfags installed).
The problem can be seen in the log here:
It seems that CMake does not finds the full path to the gflags library.
Could you run this command on your machine for me @DechinPhy ?
If you get an error message, you may need to run these commands before the one above:

Installation is not successful. Error message can be seen in the log here:
You probably need to delete everything that is found inside this folder: /home/dechin/git_lab/HiQsimulator/build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.7
