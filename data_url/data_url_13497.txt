From #574, copying here so we don't forget. https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/runs/2018759271

Since we decided not to focus on CI issues in this milestone, but it is quite critical to have CI not failing, my proposal is to remove the greeting.yml document right now from the code base, and address how to solve this in a future milestone in a more complex way. If there are no objections @crazy4pi314 @rmlarose @andreamari, I'll proceed.
Could be a very quick fix, I would wait for @crazy4pi314 before removing.
Note: If further commits are pushed to the PR, the greeting message doesn't trigger and thus passes.
Yeah it would only fail the very first time a user ever makes a PR and no other time. I will look into this on stream today and let you know if we should yank it.
This was fixed in #617.
See #618 (review) for an example of the greeting action working.
