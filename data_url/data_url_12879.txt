When trying to compile with C++11 on ubuntu 18.0.4, G++ 7.4.0 and cmake 3.13.3, there is an error at the following stage,
llvm[3]: Compiling ToolRunner.cpp for Release+Asserts build
/home/project/ScaffCC/llvm/tools/bugpoint/ToolRunner.cpp:131:12: error: invalid operands to
binary expression ('llvm::raw_ostream' and 'std::ostringstream' (aka
'basic_ostringstream'))
errs() << OS;
