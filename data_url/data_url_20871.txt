The motivation for some of the checks we perform is perhaps obvious, but that's not the case for all. I often find myself asking or trying to remember what the exact motivation was. Some are documented in issues or pull requests, but many also surfaced during offline discussion.
Also as a justification towards potentially frustrated contributors, we should write up a small motivation for each of the checks we perform. Perhaps a separate markdown file?
I added https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/wiki/Test-framework which contains an explanation of every test in the test framework. If you think this is sufficient, we can close this issue. Otherwise, I suggest one of you write a wiki page explaining further.
Nice! I'm still missing the 'rationale' part, though. E.g:
dynamic_memory: Checks that each implementation does not use dynamic memory functions (malloc, free, realloc, calloc).
While that's useful, I assume that's what most people would get from the name of the test alone. What's less obvious is why we care (i.e., because it can fail? Because it's typically not available on embedded devices? Because it costs a bunch of cycles?)
Okay. I've added a rationale sentence to all of the C checks.
