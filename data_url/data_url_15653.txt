Using the NumPyEigensolver for calculating ground state energies causes segmentation fault. The problem occurred with my own problem, as well as when running the example code here https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/blob/main/docs/tutorials/03_ground_state_solvers.ipynb. The VQE solver works correctly.
Run this notebook https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/blob/main/docs/tutorials/03_ground_state_solvers.ipynb, segfault occurs at [6] ("We can compare the VQE results to the NumPy exact solver and see that they match.").
There should be no segfault and it should print the correct results, as shown in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/blob/main/docs/tutorials/03_ground_state_solvers.ipynb.

Please could you show the output of
for this one?
This is probably not something on Qiskit's end but rather NumPy. Can you run numpy.linalg.eigvals for a matrix of the same size used in the tutorials; 2^(number of qubits in the hamiltonian? If it's not that it might be the Hamiltonian to matrix conversion?
I was able to fix this by updating numpy from 1.21.2 to the latest at the time, 1.21.5. I have no idea why that worked. Thanks for your suggestions.
