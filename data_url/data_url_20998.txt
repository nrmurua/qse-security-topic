The unit tests seem to be leaking resources.
PR #1233 shows how to enable leak detection and reproduce the problem.
We would like to apply a fix to PR #1233 and solve any leaking issues in those tests.
Seems to be an issue with gRPC CleanupThreads, used by Channels.
gRPC docs make no mention of having to cleanup after channels.
Channel has no close() function. del stub, del channel doesn't work either.
