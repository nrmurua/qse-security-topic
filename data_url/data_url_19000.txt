CMAES, being currently implemented as an unconstrained optimiser, can sometimes give (and internally use) parameters that are out-of-bounds (OOB). No error or warning is raised so this fails silently.
MWE shown in this .py file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nc6D195WnUTvDr-K9Sn7gvzar_67sYsE/view?usp=sharing
For the optimiser not to give OOB results and if there are such results then for a warning/error to be raised.
There are two solutions that need to be implemented here:
It seems that the solution given in (1) in practice doesn't work all that well, nor does artificially making the function be in an infinite well such that infeasible solutions have a cost of $\infty$. As #236 at least makes this not be a silent failure and currently there does not seem to be a reasonable way to make CMAES be constrained, I will mark #236 as closing this issue.
