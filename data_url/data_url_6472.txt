I'm getting the following error (using the CuQuantum container here) when attempting to simulate the statevector of a circuit.
Was able to produce a MWE where this repros with:
Traceback (most recent call last):

RuntimeError: Unable to cast Python instance to C++ type (#define PYBIND11_DETAILED_ERROR_MESSAGES or compile in debug mode for details)
edit: this also repros with the example full state vector simulation in this tutorial here.

@paaige if you're using the cuQuantum Appliance, I'd recommend posting this issue on our GitHub as well so that we can follow/update this issue.
I did this on your behalf: NVIDIA/cuQuantum#75
I provide edits that avoid the error you post here.
Added a clarifying note to the linked issue. In short: QSimOptions only accepts individual option values, not a dict. The {string: value} input format referenced in the docstring can be passed to QSimSimulator as the options parameter.
