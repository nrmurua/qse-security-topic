Fresh qiskit installation inside a new environment on windows 10.
In one of the terra tutorial (using_the_transpiler) from qiskit.test.mock import FakeTokyo is failing 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named vcr'
'pip install vcrpy'
'vcrpy' needs to be added in requirements.
Hi @fvarchon, this should be fixed by #2448.
