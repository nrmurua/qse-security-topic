Current Problem
GitHub front page is missing a description
Proposed Solution
"An API, sampler, and composites for using a D-Wave system."
Alternatives Considered
Additional context
Request to add short descriptions for all repos
Maybe something like "APIs and objects for using the D-Wave System", though it would be good to distinguish between dwave-system and the cloud-client though.
Would it be accurate (and helpful) to say something like, "dwave-system's implementations of dimod and cloud-client enable easy use of the D-Wave system"?
While keeping it to twitter-length, this gives both the purpose ("use of the D-Wave system") and the connection to the other involved repos ("implementations of dimod and cloud-client"). Adding short descriptions of the other repos (in parentheses after each) needs a lot more space.
A description has been added, based on the current README
