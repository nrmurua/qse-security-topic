Unable to import qsimcirq with latest versions of cirq, due to cirq.StateVectorSimulatorState being removed:
Yup, pip install cirq --pre is going to be pretty unstable for a bit while Cirq 1.0 changes rush in. qsim hasn't released a patch for 1.0 (in no small part because of how many deprecations are going through) so for now you should fall back to stable Cirq (no --pre)
