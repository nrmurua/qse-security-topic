Allow passing AwsDevice or IBMBackend directly to qbraid.device_wrapper as an alternative to qBraid device ID or vendor device ID.
I think I can do this. If it is possible, can you assign me?
@EnriqueAnguianoVara Yep go for it!
@ryanhill1 Hi! I have a question. What classes are going to be the output parameters with this modification?
@EnriqueAnguianoVara The output will be a qbraid.providers.DeviceLikeWrapper object, same as currently specified in docstring. But the accepted input type will change from a str, to a str or some new QDEVICE type. Could make this new type mirroring that of QPROGRAM, but instead of a union of the supported program (i.e. circuit) types, a union of the supported device (i.e. backend) types e.g. braket.aws.AwsDevice, qiskit_ibm_provider.ibm_backend.IBMBackend
