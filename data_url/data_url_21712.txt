The startup kernel should not be interruptable by other kernels.
The experiment submitted on the master runs after the startup kernel.
The startup kernel gets interrupted by the experiment, leaving the hardware in a partially-initialized state.
@cjbe: I think most of the weird startup behaviour we have been seeing should be explained between this and the Urukul sync phase tuning issue on Alice.
I fundamentally agree that there is a need for something like "critical sections". Two things:
That was implemented in earlier ARTIQ versions by not opening the server socket in the runtime until the startup kernel has run, so the computer would get a "connection refused" error instead of interrupting the startup kernel. I guess that behavior got inadvertently changed later on.
by other means than restarting the core device?
In my experience, having a USB (JTAG/serial) connection to each core device is indispensable anyway, so I'm not too worried about this.
By definition, hung startup kernels only occur when (re)starting the device, so just power-cycling the device again should never be a problem for users.
This is fixed in the new firmware on Zynq.
