Uniprocessor systems and therefore the Papilio Pro are no longer supported. Build for KC705 instead as this it is the main board to be used with ARTIQ.
If support for Papilio Pro is depricated it would be good to update various
parts of m-labs/artiq to reflect this. Some references I can find...
Is Pipistrello now the officially supported low-end FPGA board? -Joe

Updated, thanks for the reminder. Yann, if we are going to mention pipistrello binaries on the website, we need a binary package for it too (if building both binaries is a mess, then update the website).
If I understand well what needs to be done:
If the pipistrello build works, then I update the website to just say "install the conda package" + "flash via artiq_flash"
If the pipistrello build does not work, then I update the binary_package.tar.gz file to contain real pipistrello binaries and let the text as is
Is that alright?
LGTM
If building for KC705 in CI keeps being difficult, I would consider starting to do something like releases now. If it all works mostly (before show-and-tells, tutorials, etc), tag an artiq commit and build bitstream+bios+runtime+conda package for it and upload.
As stated in the status report of May, both KC705 and Pipistrello bitstreams are now built by Travis, moreover the bitstreams+bios+runtimes are included in the conda packages so that any newcomer can just:
$ conda install artiq
$ artiq_flash.sh
And it should work out of the box.
Before closing this ticket, I still need to update the website :
This is fixed now:
