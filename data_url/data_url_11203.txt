I've been thinking about a unified way of running notebooks easily in Cirq as well as OpenFermion. I saw the binder link - initially I liked it but then I opened it and it takes way too long to bring up the container (5+ minutes).
What do you think about using Colab?

It is much faster - but you'll need a Google account as soon as you want to run anything.
Also you'll need to add in all notebooks the !pip install openfermion command at the beginning with clear instructions that it's only for colab.
When you say that you'll need a Google account to run anything - do you mean just a gmail for instance? That requirement isn't ideal but I suppose most people have a gmail at this point. It seems like a reasonable price to pay for the faster execution. Can anyone think of any other downsides we should consider?

Yes, a gmail account works. Agreed!
I think the price of having a google account is small in comparison to the 5 minute load time of binder.  I'm pro colab transition.
Great! We can also put a colab detection logic for installation on top of the notebooks.
This way they can still work in a local jupyter env as well.
Happy to raise a PR for this.
