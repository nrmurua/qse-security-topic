Hi all,
I've been using OpenFermion to study some simple spin models on the Honeycomb lattice related to the Kitaev model, and it occurred to me, given the popularity of the Kitaev model and other spin models e.g. Heisenberg, XY, etc., it would be convenient to define a Hamiltonian function for such models. Getting the connectivity right for the honeycomb lattice takes a bit of thought, so perhaps this would be useful. Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev may not be the most efficient transforms in this case, but that's a separate issue.
I would be happy to take a first pass at this if anyone thinks it's worthwhile.
This sounds great to have.  Looking forward to the code!
This kind of models is quite easy to define in kwant (kwant-project.org). I started working on importing hamiltonians from kwant to openfermion, check it out: https://github.com/alicjadut/kwant_to_openfermion
