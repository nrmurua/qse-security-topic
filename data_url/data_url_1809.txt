Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Child of #3235.
CircuitOperation implicitly relies on single-step parameter resolution for its internal parameter mappings. This is inconsistent with the default behavior of ParamResolver, which is to resolve parameters recursively (see PR #3538).
Describe the solution you'd like
CircuitOperation should accept resolve_parameters(..., recursive=True) and handle it in a manner consistent with ParamResolver (within reason).
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
Disabling recursive resolution for CircuitOperation (current behavior)
Changing default resolution behavior to single-step
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters
Discussed at cirq cync. Default to single step and keep the error message would be a minor breaking change but the behavior would be most predictable
I was thinking this would be a quick fix, but I assume it's not or it would've been done already. Do you have any thoughts on the matter that you can note here?
By recursive does that mean it would have to recur through the subcircuit operations, or does it just mean recurring through the local symbols of the CircuitOperation, (or does it mean both)?
It is the root cause for #5016. I don't know whether that was a known effect or not.

I haven't looked at this in a while, but discussion on #3538 demonstrates why this is potentially complicated. In summary:
A breaking change could probably resolve this; at the time, we opted to keep things stable. You're welcome to take a look, especially given #5016 (which I agree stems from this).
