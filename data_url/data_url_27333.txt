The optimized SIKE implementation uses a slightly different logic when checking bounds for generated keys than the reference implementation (currently used). We should switch to this logic to avoid any differences with the official optimized implementation during key generation.

The round 3 package contains a simplified implementation of key generation, let's use it:
