There's only one unit possible now.
I haven't really decided which way I want to go on that. For the most part users shouldn't be calling those methods anyways, they should be using the more convenient cirq.X**0.5 or cirq.Rx(np.pi/2). So I'm not too worried about making it convenient to call them.

Isn't it two? exponent  and global_shift

Anyway, these are the comments on the commit that introduce it
I agree.
I think the argument that it doesn't require a docstring is not a positive one.
@vtomole What I mean is that one is no longer allowed to specify the rotation in units of rads or degrees. There is only one choice: specify the exponent.
@kevinsung Thanks for the clarification. In that case i agree.
I like that we continue to force the keyword, because I'm still not happy with the API here. It insulates us from making subtle breaking changes, where the first argument becomes different.
I think that's fine.
