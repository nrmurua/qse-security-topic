I am writing the example on here. However I encounter the error of
    result = qp.run(qobj, wait=2, timeout=240) TypeError: run() got an unexpected keyword argument 'wait'. Why does this error happen?
Hi,
The version of the notebook you are referring is the old one. The new qiskit version does not support wait anymore because we can do asynchronous queue.
Please refer the latest version below:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/8e1cc40fce8d30113cef0a663d80d39b2f364dbd/reference/tools/getting_started.ipynb
You can notice that we are no longer using QuantumProgram, and some other details with using the latest qiskit.
Thanks for the help.
