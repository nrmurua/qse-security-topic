Many tutorials start with a big block of imports. I don't this is optimal, since
When tools are used later, it is not clear whether they are qiskit or not.
Changes are made to notebooks making certain imports unnecessary, but they still remain (and provide problems for new versions). For example, the import of CompositeGate in this notebook, which is not used.
Importing tools close to their first use, so that the context is clear. It should also be clear to remove them if the code is changed.
@attp @rraymondhp What do you think of adopting this style going forward?
Thanks for pointing this. I agree we have to clean the import and start reviewing if they are needed at all.
Show me the import block you are thinking.
Below is what I'm thinkingm using the sniopet from the qiskit website. Just a matter of importing directly before first use. Not best practice for actual usage, perhaps, but I think it better shows what needs to be imported and why.
I think we definitely need to check if tutorials are using what they import. However, I'm not sure about importing packages right before they are used. In my own code, I sometimes use the following convention so that the namespace of the functions I'm using is obvious:
