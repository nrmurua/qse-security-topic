Running all Aqua tests takes a horrendous amount of time. Many tests are end to end and just run the algorithms for different sizes, which 1. takes very long and 2. is not a very stable error detection.
We should filter some of these tests out and add more insightful tests than inspect the creation or runtime states of the algorithms or objects.
Some tests that take a very long time to run (on my laptop):
And have more coverage!
Since Aqua repo contents are being moved out to Terra and domain related repos I think this can be closed rather than open issues on these new repos. Tests out to be improved etc on an ongoing basis in any case, and given the refactoring/move its an immediate opportunity to consider improving tests
