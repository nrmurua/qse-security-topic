I'd like to begin using the 3U BNC, SMA and RJ45  EEM boards with ARTIQ. Initially this will be using a KC705.
KC705-> FMC-VHDCI adapter -> VHDCI cable -> VHDCI carrier -> IDC cable-> 3U BNC
Development of this path is discussed in #780. This interface problem is a specific instance of a more general pattern with which this Issue is concerned. Here's the more general pattern:
If Kasli is brain:
Kasli brain -> 3U interface [B] -> 3U device [A]
[A] is in {BNC, SMA, RJ45, ... } are EEM peripherals
[B] is in {IDC cable, backplane}
If KC705, Metlino or Sayma is brain:
Brain [D]-> VHDCI-interface [C] -> VHDCI cable -> VHDCI carrier -> 3U interface [B] -> 3U EEM device [A]
[C] is in {direct, FMC to VHDCI adapter}
[D] is in {KC705 LPC FMC, KC705 HPC FMC, Metlino VHDCI Port 1, Metlino VHDCI Port 2, Sayma FMC}
Parts of this path that will be reused in different combinations are [A], [B], [C].  Is there an agreed upon way for abstracting interfaces so they can be re-used? Where will they fit into the ARTIQ/Misoc repositories?
@sbourdeauducq It there a commit that illustrates the approach you have in mind for this?
This is part of a bigger problem, which will be discussed and dealt with in due time.
Is there an Issue for the bigger problem? If not please reopen this Issue.
There isn't.
But this description you wrote isn't good, and dealing with this is not a priority. Please use the existing APIs to build your own KC705+EEM designs, as I explained in the other issue you opened.
Agreed that the current tools are sufficient to kludge something together that will work in my lab.
I understand that my Issue is a specific case of a broader problem. I also gather that your statement of the problem would be different, likely more general. All the same this is a fine placeholder for the broader problem. I've applied state:needs-discussion.
