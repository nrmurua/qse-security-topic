When I try to load my account with IBMQ, there is the following warning:
Remote backend "ibmq_qasm_simulator" could not be instantiated due to an invalid config: {'coupling_map': ['Field may not be null.']}
And then the ibmq_qasm_simulator is not visible in available backends.
qiskit.IBMQ.load_accounts()
qiskit.IBMQ.backends()
<IBMQBackend('ibmq_qasm_simulator') from IBMQ()>
should be an item of the list with backends when executing:
qiskit.IBMQ.backends()
You need to update to the latest qiskit terra version 0.8+
Thank you.
