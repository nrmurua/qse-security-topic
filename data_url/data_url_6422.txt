I am trying to compile qsimcirq with cuda support from source and also tried v0.19.0 release zip, since the precompiled version on pypi doesn't come with cuda. (gpu_mode=1 or 2 doesn't work)
Following the instructions here https://quantumai.google/qsim/tutorials/gcp_gpu, after pip install -v ., first I met cmake complaining about target_link_libraries should be all keyword or all plain. The conflict resolves by adding keyword (PUBLIC?) to FindCUDA.cmake (deprecated cmake module) or instead using findCUDAToolKit for all the CMakeList under pybind_interface folder.
Next I encounter the error about the code itself and have no idea how to get rid of.
I am using Ubuntu 20.04, python 3.8/3.10, cuda 12.3, tried gcc11.1.0 or gcc9.4.0, cmake 3.27.9/3.24 on python venv, tried several configurations, all stucks here.
CUQUANTUM_ROOT is set to the python package  ~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cuquantum/
