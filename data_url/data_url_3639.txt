RX(%x+%y) will parse, but RX(%x-%y)  does not. The problem is that identifiers can include minus signs.  Adding spaces fixes the problem, so RX(%x - %y) is OK. But converting parsed quil back to a string eliminates the space. e.g.
python -c 'from pyquil._parser.PyQuilListener import run_parser; print(str(run_parser("RX(%x - %y) 1")))'
Either minus signs should be disallowed at the end of identifiers, or extra space should be added when converting expressions to strings.
Has been resolved.
