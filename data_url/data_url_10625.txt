Description
Trying to sample a CQM through the LeapHybridCQMSampler returns a SSLCertVerificationError, even after setting the parameter 'permissive_ssl' to True when instantiating the LeapHybridCQMSampler. Full traceback attached: traceback.txt
To Reproduce
Error message:
SSLCertVerificationError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1108)
Environments:
@rafamartinc, just to confirm, you are behind a proxy that intercepts and inspects/rewrites your https requests?
Hi @randomir. Not that I know of... But shouldn't the validation be skipped entirely when using the permissive_ssl parameter?
@rafamartinc, you are right, we do have a known issue with permissive_ssl, see dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client#507. But the fact you're seeing an SSLCertVerificationError means some proxy on your route to D-Wave is rewriting requests and spoofing D-Wave API responses/certificates (in order to inspect the SSL traffic in plain text).
For that reason the use of permissive_ssl is not recommended. (Maybe a "good" actor is rewriting your traffic in your enterprise, but you can't distinguish that from a "bad" actor stealing your API token and/or other private data.)
We'll prioritize fixing this issue (although, we would rather just remove the flag/feature), but in the meantime you can try one of the two known workarounds:
Hi @randomir,
Workaround no. 2 was very closely related to the issue here. It was a specific configuration in our network, so we finally managed to get it solved - for now at least. It would be great to have dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client#507 solved though, to avoid further issues, so we'll keep an eye on that one as well.
Thank you so much!
