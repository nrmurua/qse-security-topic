A key element of making this work is typename std::remove_const<T>::type, making it possible to define implicit conversions like const std::vector<T> & to PointerRange<const T>.
Actually, ideally, this would fix a semantic issue where the range sometimes acts like a reference (for equality) and sometimes like a pointer. Might be good to introduce a "RangeRef" type to disambiguate.
