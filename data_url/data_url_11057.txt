Working on Deutsch-Jozsa. I want to find the wavefunction of our system after undergoing the oracle.
This is producing RuntimeError: Can't get the index of an unassigned qubit. How can I get the wavefunction after the oracle?
@rasa97 Thanks for the issue report! We just refactored the Deutsch-Josza module significantly. Would you mind looking at it again and see if this is still an issue?
The refactored one works for single qubit. However, when I run the code for 2-qubits, there are errors. For balanced, I get:
The code is print dj.is_constant(qvm, {'00':'0', '01':'1', '10':'0', '11':'1'})
For constant, I get the error:
The code is print dj.is_constant(qvm, {'00':'0', '01':'0', '10':'0', '11':'0'})
@rasa97 Thank you for the followup! I'm opening up a PR to fix this!
I'm curious to know why the inputs should be represented in a dict. Isn't list enough? Its easier that way, right?
@rasa97 I agree that a list has less overhead, but it also makes implicit assumptions about ordering. Moreover, the structure of a dict highlights the structure of the problem and makes it more apparent. In the end you will have to provide 2**n inputs, so an additional factor of 2 will not make too much of a difference.
What's your thought on this?
For the sake of convenience, list is better I guess. If the user has an idea about the ordering, it would be easier to just type in the bits. The pattern in which it should be typed can be highlighted in docs.
