run pip install qiskit on linux machine with python 3.9
Should be able to install it
No response
That specific error ERROR: THESE PACKAGES DO NOT MATCH THE HASHES FROM THE REQUIREMENTS FILE. and the other related output points to a local networking issue. What pip is reporting there is that it downloaded a package file for the package scipy (which is a dependency for qiskit) and the checksum of that file it downloaded from PyPI does not match the checksum the package recorded for itself. This points to something corrupting the file when it's being downloaded (a network issue, hardware fault, etc). I expect this is coming up on scipy because it's a larger package (33.8MB compared to the 4.8MB for terra and 19.2MB for aer). My only suggestion is to maybe try fetching the scipy package from https://pypi.org/project/scipy/#files directly and manually verifying the checksums to see if you can get it to download without any corruption. If you can download it and verify the contents with the checksum then you can manually install the package and try installing qiskit again (although it's likely you'll have similar issues on other packages too).
That being said there isn't really anything we can really do about it from the qiskit side as the failure is local to your specific environment and/or network. I'm going to close this issue accordingly, but please feel free to reopen this if I'm missing something or there is more to discuss on this.
