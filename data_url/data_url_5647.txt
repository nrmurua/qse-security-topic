Python 3.7 is no longer supported in qiskit-terra and Aer does not need to support the version. We do not need to run tests and to create packages in the version for 0.13.
Hi @hhorii do you need any help? May I pick up this task?
@hhorii Can I work on this?
@devilkiller-ag bounties are open until the associated issue is closed, so yes you can still work on this! It does seem like #1819 might resolve the issue, but it hasn't seen much attention. @hhorii or @1ucian0 can you comment on the status of the linked PR?
Thanks @natestemen
was this issue completed successfully? @hhorii
