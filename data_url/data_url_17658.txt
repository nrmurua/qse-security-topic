Since yesterday evening, I'm having the following error by performing a process tomography for the teleportation process as here [https://github.com//issues/1432]
The Traceback is as follows:
Before that, I ran over one hundred process tomographies in the last couple of weeks without any error.
It seems like there has not been any shoot at all.
Here the code to reproduce the error (which appears also if measured qubits and prepared qubits are the same.
and this is the output of 'print(process_data)'
I cannot reproduce your error.  The above code ran fine.  Note however that I have run in on qiskit-terra 0.7 that is being released soon.
I tried once more and it still doesn't work (counts and shots equal to 0 within the tomo_job.result() )
I used qiskit 0.6.1 with tomography.py patched as from @chriseclectic fix here.
Updated: same issue with the original tomography.py
Your original problem statement shows that NumPys eigensolver is failing. Perhaps there is something up there
I'm not sure eigensolver is the issue.
Look at the awkward tomo_result:
Maybe there's something wrong within the results returned by tomo_job.result() function
Updated:
Oops, I mentioned tomo_result but I meant process_data. So the error should be in tomography_data function
problem solved in 0.7.0..
FYI, the issue in 0.6.1 was likely due to "get_counts" produced with hex value since monday
