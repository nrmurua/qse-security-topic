The problem is that I want to install the quantum chemistry drivers required to execute the Jupyters Notebooks but I am not available because this webpage (https://qiskit.org/documentation/aqua/chemistry/qiskit_chemistry_drivers.html) does not work.
Could you please tell me how to install the drivers please?
What platform are you using - you did not say. If its MacOS or Linux, PySCF should be installed by default and you can use that. If you are using Windows then PyQuante can be used unless you have access to the commerciial Gaussian 16 product. Most of the notebooks are done using PySCF, though there are a couple in community chemistry tutorials that use PyQuante.
Which driver are you interested in installing? Documentation is being re-worked to be based in the code and built out using Sphinx. This is still work in progress and the online  documentation has yet to be updated. Here are some links in to the text which would be better when formatted but I think can be read ok like it is

@TheFirstBestBoss Did the above help? If so can this be closed? For further questions etc in the future you can always join the public Slack workspace and ask questions and search if it might already have been asked etc. There is an aqua channel there for discussion/questions etc around aqua.
