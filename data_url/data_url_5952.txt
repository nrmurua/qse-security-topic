FEATURE REQUEST TEMPLATE 
use MPS method to simulate noise
ENHANCEMENT REQUEST TEMPLATE 
The MPS method currently does not support Kraus noise. This is currently under development. We will update you when it is working. For now, you can use the default "simulation_method": "statevector."
thanks a lot!
