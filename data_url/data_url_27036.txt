@Altaimorin Some elements are taking a long time for sad guess.  For example, see the following MgCl2 HF/6-31G calculation. The guess takes >90% of time which is totally stupid.
Please save the atomic density into files and save them into basis folder. QUICK should read them during the guess.
Someone has done this for Zn in past: https://github.com/merzlab/QUICK/blob/master/src/getMolSad.f90#L153-L170
@Altaimorin Lets start with CaCl2 6-31G, 6-31G* and 6-31g**. We need to make sure at least the basic elements are working. Here is my input.
@Altaimorin We should also store guess for F and Br.

@Madu86 Thank you. I would simply keep it in the basis folder.

Yes there's a problem with CaCl2 after SAD guess when calling DGEMM. Working on this now.

I think you have fixed this in by adding call upcase(keywd,80) in quick_molspec_module.f90 so that it allows the element names to have lower case letters.
