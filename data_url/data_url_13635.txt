Currently the mitiq-examples repository is private and contains informal notebooks with internal tests and other non-reviewed code.
Rename mitiq-examples and keep it private.
Create a new public mitiq-examples , to be filled with a select choice of examples.
+1.
Examples are certainly good to have. Do they need to be in a separate repo?
An advantage of adding these examples into the docs is that they are then continually tested with CI and so are easier to maintain.
Spoke with @rmlarose and sounds like there's consensus on keeping things in one repo for now. We can re-open discussion if needed.
