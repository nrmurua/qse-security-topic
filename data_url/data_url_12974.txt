Hello,
I have been trying to run the various synthesis algorithms that BQSkit has to offer on specific unitary gate sets and so I started with the tutorials in the examples directory. But it looks like the modules are not correctly named/imported. So it would be great if the tutorials are updated accordingly.
Yeah, you are right! We should definitely update those. Honestly, all the examples and tutorials should be moved to the bqskit-tutorials repo.
