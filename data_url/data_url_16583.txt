Using initialize in a circuit and then running with Statevector results in the error "Cannot apply Instruction: reset"
Funny cause the circuit has no resets:
That circuit has a lot of things I don't like, but at least it has no resets.
@nonhermitian That circuit does have resets, notice the two |0> |0> at the start? The definition of initialize has reset instructions on all qubits that are removed by the transpiler if it is the first instruction in a circuit. This is so you can "initialize" subsets of qubits at any stage of a circuit.
I'm transferring this to Qiskit Terra. In the future please post issues related to the Quantum info module in Terra, not Aer.
That is not just the initial state of the qubits?  That is what used to be there.  It is hard to tell the difference here.  So that means that initialize is no longer a unitary operation like it was before?  I guess I missed that as well.
A reset method was added to the Statevector class last release, so the simulation could be updated to work with initialize via adding support of reset to the the from_instruction method.
@nonhermitian I think this was changed recently in the draw function. Now circuits are drawn without any initial states, so any time you see them they refer to reset instructions.
Yeah, it is just that the original text drawing is very close to the reset instructions so it is hard for the user to understand.
