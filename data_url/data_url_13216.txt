We currently have 40(!) labels to use for issues/PRs. I suggest trimming this down so that labels can be found more easily, and used more effectively. I've put together a google sheet with the labels, and my proposed actions here.
For reference, here is the following python script I used to get the counts of the labels:
Fine for me. maybe I would keep executors and observable since like zne, pec, etc... they are Mitiq modules.
Thanks Andrea, I've updated the sheet to keep those. WDYT @nathanshammah @Misty-W?
I've removed the ones we agreed on in the google sheet.
At some point I'd like to go through the closed issues with label stale to ensure the bot didn't close anything that we actually want, but I think this is okay for now.
