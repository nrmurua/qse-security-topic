setup.py test invokes test_td_formats.py, which generates rhs*.pyx files in the build subdir.
setup.py install installs everything in the build subdir. So that includes the rhs*pyx test files.  The test files get installed at the toplevel of the installation path, just above the qutip dir.
The path in question is /usr/lib/python3*/dist-packages/rhs*.pyx
Would you be able to open a Pull Request? Also for #986.
I'm not entirely certain how to fix it inside setup.py.
I use Debian packaging tools and can add commands to debian/rules to delete these files after running the setup.py commands (clean and test). But I'm not sure how to get setup.py to clean up after itself.
Should have been taken care in the recent conda and pip release of QuTiP, 4.4.0, #1037.
Thanks, confirming the stray rhs*.pyx files are no longer installed in 4.4.1.
