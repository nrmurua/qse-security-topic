I see frequent RTIO underflows with a significant (>10us) positive slack reported, only when using the external clock.
For example, the below experiment runs without error using the internal clock, but gives this error within a few seconds of running on the external clock:
I am switching from internal to external clock via the "external_clock" option to the core device in the device_db.
My understanding is that the external clock on the Kasli is fed from the Si5324. As expected, on the internal clock RTIO events precess in phase relative to the Si5324 outputs on the MMCX, whereas on the external clock there is a clear phase relation between the RTIO events and the Si5324 clock - so there does seem to be a valid RTIO clock present after the switch.
I am using a Kasli with a (slightly modified) Opticlock gateware (Artiq 2f9d012).
I also see this issue using the Kasli DRTIO (master+satellite) gateware
I can reproduce this with the current opticlock variant (right now, in that variant, external_clock=True means using the si5324 in free_run mode).
