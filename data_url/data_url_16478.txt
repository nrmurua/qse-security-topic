BaseBackend (or BackendProperties) should have a helper function to enable users to get duration of an instruction easily. It would look like
This kind of function would be helpful for majority of users who want to use default instruction duration of a backend. It would also simplify the implementation of InstructionDuration, which will be introduced in #4555, provided a way to get all duration as a list of tuples, e.g. [('u3', 0, 200), ('cx', [0, 1], 800), ...]).
We already have BackendProperties.gate_length(gate, qubits) but it returns gate duration in seconds as a float value and it does not return duration of measurement. To get the integer duration from the float one, we have to
and this works only for pulse-enabled backends (which have dt).
Another option might be PulseDefaults.instruction_schedule_map.get(instruction, qubits, *params).duration. Although it allows us to get integer duration, it always requires parameters. Giving dummy parameters just to get u3 duration would be too much.
Comparing with those existing methods, the proposed one is much simpler.
Instruction.duration seems to provide this. Should this issue be closed?
Instruction.duration seems to provide this.
The instruction duration depends on the backend. The attribute Instruction.duration is for setting the duration of the instruction once the backend is known. I think @itoko is asking for a way to query the backend on the duration.
BackendV2 has a way to do that, not sure if that covers the use-case:
@itoko please, reopen this is somehow not what your enhancement request was about.
