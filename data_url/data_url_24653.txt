How can one create multi-channels pulses from sequenced pulses?
The SequencePT seems to remove to atomicity. The following minimal example fails with a TypeError: Non atomic subtemplate

This is correct and currently the case for simplicity. Allowing to create AtomicMultiChannelPulseTemplate from arbitrary subtemplates is a bit difficult to implement so we have only implemented it for atomic PTs at the moment.
You can use the concatenate function from qupulse.pulses.table_pulse_template.
This does not create references to the concatenated PTs but creates a new one. Therefore, it is not ideal.
@terrorfisch Thanks for the reply. The concatenate works for me.
