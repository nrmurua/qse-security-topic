This is my code to test the problem:
Output:
Cirq's simulator output is consistent with Qiskit's. While qsim's output is as if the 0.232*I term is nonexistent.
I tested with a new circuit, circuit = cirq.Circuit(cirq.ry(0.3).on(q0), cirq.ry(0.2).on(q1)), where all qubits are used. Even with this, qsim's result ignores 0.232*I.
This is on qsimcirq==0.13.3. Sorry, I'm still on an outdated qsimcirq because of the RAM requirement of the latest qsimcirq (#612).  On latest qsim, this is no longer a problem.
Thanks for confirming! For reference, I believe this was fixed in #577, #578, and #588. Versions before v0.16.0 may experience this issue.
