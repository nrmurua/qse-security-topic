You should be able to pass a result (or list of results) and the discriminator will just extract the calibrations that it needs.
Expected behavior could be:
Within __init__, loop through the results provided to the discriminator and only save the ones that match the regex cal_\d+$ (i.e. starts with cal_ and ends with digits). The expected states, if not given, will correspond to the digits in the name.
