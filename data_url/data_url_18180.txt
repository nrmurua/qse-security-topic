When running plot_circuit on a fairly large OpenQASM input, it logs a warning that Qcircuit cannot be found but that is not the underlying issue. I do have Qcircuit installed and I have produced images for smaller circuits using QISKit.
An error is returned that does describe what is going wrong.
For the following code
I get a warning
I looked into the tex that is being generated and compiling that manually gives me some wholly unrelated error:
I was trying to make a plot of a small(er) circuit but I had the above code lying around so I tried that first.
Thanks @eddieschoute for raising this. You are right, the error message is triggered when latex compilation fails, which is not always due to Qcircuit not being present, as you experienced. Huge circuits might become problematic for drawing purposes.. but the error handling should be improved regardless.
I would suggest maybe logging the output of the subprocess to DEBUG logs and logging a warning/error referencing debug logs, if parsing the output is out of scope.
