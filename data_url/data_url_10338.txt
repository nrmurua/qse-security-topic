Estimated time of problem completion, as returned by SAPI, is known to be an overestimation in certain circumstances (only one of them is user upfront cancelling jobs).
Scheduling the first (problem status) poll according to the ETA can thus be problematic (see here and here, for example).
Since we already use exponential back-off, removing ETA dependency (and starting immediate polling) shouldn't have negative effects on SAPI load.
Conditional problem submit should be implemented server-side, and it's not affected by this ETA removal.
For the time being, we can keep eta_min and eta_max properties of Future object, in informative capacity to end-user.
