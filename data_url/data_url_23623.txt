Currently, if as part of a sweep, the result of an ArrayParameter is passed to DataSaver.add_result as a python list or tuple, as opposed to an ndarray, the data will silently be truncated to the first element. This is not made clear to the user and hence data is easily lost.
Either an error should be thrown for an unknown type, or python sequence types should be handled.
Data is silently truncated to the first item in the array.
