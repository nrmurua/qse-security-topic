@Strilanc : For the Cirq bootcamps I am using a device that has a method to check if a gate belongs to a certain supported gate set. That method is also used for a kind of automatic compilation, by calling cirq.decompose with the keep parameter.
You can see an example of the method here
I have a repo with this solution at https://github.com/alexandrupaler/fondq
This made it to the roadmap: #3243, #3245
I'm going to actually close this, as we will tackle this as part of the gate set and device hierarchy items and there is no need to track twice.
