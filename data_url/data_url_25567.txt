Hi @FyzHsn - We are thinking of either of the following implementations reg 'Deletion of dispatches from the web app GUI' -
I am guessing your preference would be Option 1 since the covalent dispatcher will try to update dispatch records in the DB and it would mess things up if we deleted them. Let me know what you think?

@mshkanth @mshkanth My preference would be to add a field deleted field in the tables to indicate that something has been deleted in the UI by the user. At this moment, my advice is to not mess with deleting actual data. If anyone needs to filter out the deleted workflows, they can simply use this field.
This would be true for both completed and in-progress workflows. Also, the logic of what to do with in-progress workflows if they get deleted is not clear to me. For example, when a user deletes a running workflow, perhaps the protocol is to cancel it first and then change the deleted status to True.
@FyzHsn - I agree that doing a soft delete is the way to go. Can you add a deleted or is_active field to all the 3 tables? I'l also add this to the database schema discussion.
Reg deleting inprogress flows, Yes, the idea flow would be to issue a cancel request (presumably to the /api/cancel API spec'd out inside covalent_dispatcher/_service/app.py) and after confirmation, soft delete those records in the database. We will park this for now and take this up as an improvement after we implement the DB schema revamp on our side.
