Describe the issue
Hi there! Actually, I'm new to QuTiP, so I'm not sure about this, but here's my issue.
I tried to install it from source by following the documentation.
After installing the build requirements, I ran the following command,
At around 61%, the testPropHOSteadyPar test failed and gave the following report
To Reproduce
System Information:
Windows 10
Python 3.9.6
The error:  - incompatible Liouvillian and state dimensions
didn't seem like it was because of missing a requirement, so I'm posting this here. Also, as a side note, to reach 61% it took my system 4 hours, which doesn't sound right (I have a decent system with 8GB ram and core i5).
Thanks!
Hi, thank you for opening an issue. Unfortunately, I have not being able to reproduce it. Here is my qutip.about() output:
Regarding to the tests being slow, I usually run only the test file related to the changes I do. For example, to run tests for qobj it suffices to use pytest qutip/tests/test_qobj.py from the command line. I then leave the CI do its job and run all the tests once I submit a pull request. I guess it is desirable to improve the speed of some tests, I do not think is a priority though. Also, it only took me 6 minutes in my local computer (i7-6700 and 16GB RAM)to run all the tests using your script. I wonder if there is something else going wrong.
Hope this helps!
Hey  @AGaliciaMartinez !
Thanks a lot for the reply. I tried it again on windows, but it didn't work.
In the end I just redid the whole thing with WSL and the tests ran like the wind (12 minutes).
All tests have passed, so that's great.
Also, thanks for the tip (running tests on the changed files). That will help a lot.
[ Will close this issue now ]
