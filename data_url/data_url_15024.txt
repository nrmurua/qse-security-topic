When trying to print all steps and passes of level 3 with following code I get the exception: "'ConditionalController' object has no attribute 'name'".
#display all passes of optimization_level=3
from qiskit.transpiler import PassManagerConfig, CouplingMap
from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import level_3_pass_manager
from qiskit.test.mock import FakeSantiago
sys_conf = FakeSantiago().configuration()
pm_conf = PassManagerConfig(basis_gates=sys_conf.basis_gates, coupling_map = CouplingMap(sys_conf.coupling_map))
for i, step in enumerate(level_3_pass_manager(pm_conf).passes()):
print(f'Step {i}:')
for transpiler_pass in step['passes']:
print(f'  {transpiler_pass.name()}')
'ConditionalController' object has no attribute 'name'
Implement attribute name also for ConditionalController
Thanks for the report.  This isn't a bug; ConditionalController is a flow controller within a pass manager, so has its own passes within it and is not a pass itself.
Okay, thanks for clarification :-)
