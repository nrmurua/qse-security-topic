hey,
i am using a chain consists of a list of matblocks. i want to cache the chain for frequent use, however the error comes out as
so how should i set the cache_key for it?
Thank you!
Hi, the cache feature is mainly used for parameterized gates e.g shift, rot so their matrix won't be generated twice. There is no benefit of caching a matblock since you will be using the matrix you created anyway, thus there is no cache_key defined for it.
It looks like the chain is calling cache_key recursively. Might be better to define one for matblock too?
OK, I think maybe just use hash as cache_key for matrix block makes the most sense in this case.
thanks~
