In addition to python files, setup.py install Installs these files in $PREFIX:
regular installation
no such files shuld be installed
fix it
I think that this is a duplicate of: #1457
This is quite a damaging bug, it pretty much prevents packaging and distribution.
Therefore it should have the highest priority.
I don't view it quite as severe, especially from a packaging perspective it's very easy to filter these as part of your packaging spec file (whichever format you're using). That being said the reason this wasn't an easy fix as it's a bug in the upstream scikit-build which is used to manage the C++ of qiskit-aer (see my comment on this: #1457 (comment) ). We're kind of stuck until its fixed in scikit-build as we need to include the c++ src in the sdist with the manifest file to ensure it's available for building from source. But doing that causes scikit-build to inject it into built/installed packages incorrectly.
Closing it as a duplicate of #1457.
