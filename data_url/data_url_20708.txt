It would be nice to have a Docker image for automatic benchmarking of liboqs-based ciphersuites in this OpenSSL fork.
Please take a look at https://github.com/Coen-Schuijt/liboqs-benchmarks
Hi Coen-Schuijt! Thanks for doing this -- looks really great!  This week we're all focused on getting a release out the door, but we'll be able to take a look at that starting next week.
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  We finished our release last week and are now ready to work on the next phase. Getting Docker images for testing a variety of things -- including benchmarking -- is next for us.  My colleague Shravan @smashra is taking the lead for us on this right now.  I've asked Shravan to take a look at this and follow up.
@dstebila @smashra I just noticed this issue and would like to ask whether anything beyond the above has happened? If not, please take a look at this PR: open-quantum-safe/ci-containers#34 and the docker images "falling out" (on hub.docker.com -> openqsafe): They have the openssl speed option easily exposed so that one only needs to pass the QSC algorithm to test as parameter, e.g., docker run -it openqsafe/liboqs-ubuntu-bionic-run oqs-speedtest dilithium4 kyber1024(does CA&server key gen and runs s_server and client (s_time option)).
It's been my intention to update openssl speed in OpenSSL 1.1.1 to have this functionality for some time (we had it in OpenSSL 1.0.2, but never did it in 1.1.1).  We haven't followed up on this issue since last year, unfortunately.
@dstebila We have openssl speed and docker-based perf testing now -- so shouldn't we close this?
