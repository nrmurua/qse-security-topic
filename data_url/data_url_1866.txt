Description of the issue
In the documentation the physical z is listed as having a typical length of 12 ns: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/docs/google/devices.md#physical-z-gates
I believe that the physical z is typically 10 ns long, with 5 ns pads before and after.

Discussed on Cirq Cynque:
Sure, I will take care of this shortly.
We can retrieve gate lengths, but the problem is that some gates have multiple different durations depending on parameters (z can be 0 or 20ns and Fsim can be 0, 12 or 32)
