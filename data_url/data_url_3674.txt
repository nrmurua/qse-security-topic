I would like to see the following things in a PyQuil 2.0 release:
Something that came up in discussions is providing better result types. Right now for run it returns a list of list of bits, if instead it returned an object then we could provide higher level methods like getting outcome probabilities. This would either have to be a new method or a backwards incompatible change to the current methods.
