This experiment script was marked for bug reporting. SB, do you recall the problem? I'm applying a 1 MHz external pulse train to PMT1.
timestamps_compiler_opt_fail.py
Output is below.
As I recall, that broke with a large L, similarly to issue #49. Is that still happening?
I've updated the code to use modern ARTIQ:
It successfully outputs a long sequence of [-1]s with L<=20000, and raises an RTIOUnderflow with Ls>=30000. Is that the expected behavior?
No, -1 means no rising edges were detected - did you connect the 1MHz generator?
No, I have no idea what to connect, and also I'm not in the lab...
I tried to add a TTLClockGen on 19th channel, still no effect:
The 10MHz clock on SMA I'm talking about is built into the gateware and driven here:
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/gateware/targets/kc705.py#L37
The SMA TTL is here:
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/gateware/targets/kc705.py#L168
The clock generator on channel 19 is a different pin (it's on the FMC and relatively hard to connect), and it won't feed into the SMA TTL unless you connect it physically.
@sbourdeauducq, so would you test this?
Affected by a similar problem as #228 now...
#228 was fixed, does this work now?
I'm pretty sure this works, but I'd be paranoid and test it anyway.
Works but timestamps are affected by #286.
