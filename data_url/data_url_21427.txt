Impossible to install ARTIQ7 in a fully functional way on Windows/Conda
Running routines normally after installing current ARTIQ7 version
Getting "core device quit unexpectedly" errors for certain routines (see attachment below, TestAlex.py works while Kasli_1TC1_PsCooling_simple does not work - they access the same class libraries and overall structure)
Kasli_1TC1_TestAlex.txt
Kasli_1TC1_PsCooling_simple.txt
Operating System:
ARTIQ version: 7.8123.3038639
Version of the gateware and runtime loaded in the core device:
coremgmt_log_output.docx
If using Conda, output of conda list (please submit as a file attachment, as this tends to be long)
conda list output.txt
Hardware involved: Kasli 2.0 - we also have MCX DIO units and Fastinos, but this is probably irrelevant

This kind of nonsense (and much more, the developer side of things is hell) has been a constant problem since we started using conda and I don't see it getting better. I believe the proper solution is to move ARTIQ to MSYS2, which is much better engineered and a lot less buggy.
Until then you'll have to do manual workarounds such as retrying installations, fiddling with channels, and what not.
Running certain routines works, for others you get an error ("core device quit unexpectedly"),
I suspect this doesn't have to do with conda and we will need more details than "certain routines" and that terse description of the error.
The code you posted is very long and it is difficult to pinpoint any potential source of the problem. Can you minimize it while still reproducing the error? What is the entire error message including call trace and any other relevant details?

Please consider using .txt for this.
Thank you for your quick reply.
Yes, I was expecting this, obviously we're trying to narrow the problem down. However, we are in the middle of a very time-restricted data taking period and don't have the time to debug this in detail. I wanted to go ahead and post this issue in case somebody already knew the clear solution since we of course desperately need this to work. Apologies.
We will of course work on this.
Please find below the terminal output with the errors:

Please let us know if you have an idea for a workaround, and we will try to narrow down/pin point the code that is actually the problem.
Thank you!!
Are you trying to run several kernels at the same time?
The log doesn't show any relevant errors otherwise, other than some DRTIO issues. But it does show that you are running several kernels.
We're definitely not running two kernels in parallel on purpose. If that is happening, there's probably something wrong.
Is that what is causing this error? Because we are only getting this exact error when running from the newly installed ARTIQ7 version (on several different host machines) and with none of the others (on several different host machines).
Impossible to install ARTIQ7 in a fully functional way on Windows/Conda
ARTIQ-8 (backward-compatible and without NAC3) can now be installed with MSYS2 with none of the issues mentioned.
@SaivaHuck If you are still getting "Core device connection closed unexpectedly" problems, please open a new issue since this is not related to conda. It looks like it could be #1975, though you should see the LoadFault messages in the core device log.
