Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
cirq.MatrixGate is a convenient way to create a unitary gate for an arbitrary matrix.  It would be nice to have a quick way to create a channel with Krauss operators directly.
Describe the solution you'd like
A new gate cirq.MaxtrixChannel that allows one to pass in the Krauss operators.
Alternatively one could reuse cirq.MatrixGate.
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
Can create your own custom channel and implement _channel_.
[optional] Additional context (e.g. screenshots)
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
The cirq-custom-channel RFC may be of interest here. The measurement features it includes are motivated by #3241.
This is solved by custom channel.
