Except when we explicitly test the qasm parser, we should make circuit objects and use those in tests. Not every circuit operation is supported by QASM, and parsing is slow anyway.
We should also try to compare circuits for equivalence or DAGs for isomorphism, rather than compare QASM strings in test asserts, as the latter is too restrictive.
