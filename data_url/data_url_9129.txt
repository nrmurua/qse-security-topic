Shares EPR currently reports if there is an EPR pair in the storage shared with another Host in a non-intelligent way (simply checks for existence). This can be made better by checking the quantum systems for entanglement between other Hosts in the density matrix.
We can improve this in shares_epr or, since this is backend dependant, make a separate method.
