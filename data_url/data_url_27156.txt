This is a list to keep track of packages that are either good enough to be submitted to upstream nixpkgs or can be easily brought into shape for upstream nixpkgs.
As discussed some time ago I've opened a PR against NixPkgs to be added as a maintainer and would take of a few of those. See NixOS/nixpkgs#124370
How about
?
CP2K is running just fine now, I suppose. I would be fine with maintaining it in NixOS/nixpkgs, if that's OK for you (I also use it regularly)? Upstream there is no bats test. Is it OK for upstream to simply inline them as a installCheckPhase?

Yes, we can do that but libvori is missing upstream. We should PR that one first.

That is OK. We just keep the bats tests here. Expensive install checks are not so welcome upstream anyway since Hydra is already very busy. The advantage of having it here is that they are run local hardware (at least from my perspective).
I was starting to port CP2K to nixpkgs and just noticed that also libint is missing. Would you like to bring it to nixpkgs or should I take care of this?

I have a branch here.
I will take a look libint. That one requires some cleanup.
Also just saw that fftw is built without Fortran bindings upstream. I guess enabling this would cause many rebuilds?
Going through the repo I found some more candidates for moving upstream:
I am closing this issue, since the list is completed now.
We have managed to mature quite a lot of packages for the inclusion into nixpks ðŸŽ‰
