Since #4670 merged the memory consumption of running qiskit-terra has increased by ~50% on average. For example:
https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit/#passes.PassBenchmarks.peakmem_width_pass?p-n_qubits=5&p-depth=1024&commits=202efa71&os=Linux%204.15.0-46-generic&machine=dedicated-benchmarking-softlayer-baremetal&ram=16GB
It might also be related to the slowdown in pulse schedule creation introduced by the same commit: https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit/#pulse.schedule_construction.ScheduleConstructionBench.time_sample_pulse_schedule_construction?machine=qiskit-benchmarking&os=Ubuntu%2018.04&ram=16%20GB&p-number_of_unique_pulses=2&p-number_of_channels=128&commits=202efa71
Neither @taalexander or I were able to recreate the regression locally. So it's likely something isolated to a change in the benchmark environment. Inspecting the benchmark machine doesn't show any obvious candidates for causing the increase in memory consumption, my only thought is that a system dependency (like python) changed on the machine, but I haven't been able to find a log of that yet. Anyway I don't think there is an action item to take here so I'm going to close this
