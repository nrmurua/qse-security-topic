When working on #35 ran into the surprising behaviour that Pulse.hashshape() is random between python instances. Probably related to hash being randomized between run in Python 3.3 release notes. I'm not sure whether we should care but it is unexpected.
After discussion with @blakejohnson  we're going to leave this as won't fix.
