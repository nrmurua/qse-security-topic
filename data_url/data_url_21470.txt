I'm looking at adding DHCP support for core devices and I wanted to see if there were any thoughts on this upstream.
We want to be able to centralise management of Kasli IP addresses.
I'm planning to upgrade smoltcp. Then make use of smoltcp's DHCPv4 client in the firmware runtime. I'm not planning to add DHCP support to the bootloader or DHCPv6 support. I think probably it's worth adding support for a config option, probably just on/off. Although we could always run DHCP if an IP address isn't present in the config.
@occheung label this as area:smoltcp, type:feature and complexity:invasive*
*: There are lots of breaking changes in smoltcp 0.8.0 with a MSRV of 1.56 when we are still using 1.51.0-nightly-2021-01-28. For artiq-zynq the upgrade should be relatively less painful.
@stevefan1999 Did you actually try it or is this just an uninformed guess? I just tried compiling the firmware with 1.57 and most of it seems fine.
@sbourdeauducq Tried but need to take a closer look, changes like InterfaceBuilder changes are easy, but changes like smoltcp-rs/smoltcp@ef213fa and smoltcp-rs/smoltcp@4e365ce seems complex.
There are a few breaking changes, but I think I have them all under control. I have everything building with smoltcp 0.8 and some basic testing looks good. I was going to test it more thoroughly and try adding the DHCP stuff before creating a PR, but I'm happy to show you what I have so far.
#1085 (just for the record, not much stuff in there)
Apparently, there is already an open issue exactly for this. At least now there is a dedicated DHCP socket available in 0.8.

Good to hear that.
Right. Let's continue this discussion in #1085.
