I went ahead and fixed the other two bugs. There are probably more:
FYI there's also the bug where you need an even total number of RTIO messages or some of them get dropped. We've discussed it and decided not to add a workaround in runtime before it's fixed in gateware because the workaround is quite ugly and tricky to get right.
What two other bugs?
And again: the messages are not dropped, they are not moved from the buffer at an appropriate time. This is issue #263.
See the commit log.
I already did, if I commented here that's because I didn't find analyzer-related commits.
The other two were multi DDS bus related.
