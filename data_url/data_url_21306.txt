Experiment window right-handside buttons may bump into scan widget.
Open experiment window containing a scan widget, then resize it horizontally to a small size.
Experiment window resizing is limited, or other reasonable and consistent behavior.
Buttons obstruct parts of the scan widget.

The proposed solution (without patch) does not work because we are using the stretch mode where "The size cannot be changed by the user or programmatically".
I can't reproduce that here. On my systems it's not resizable to a width where they would collide. But I found a couple suspicious size related lines in the UI. They also have pixel based sizes which doesn't work well for HIDPI displays. Could you give this a try:

That does not help, additionally it makes the spinboxes uselessly large when the window is enlarged horizontally.
