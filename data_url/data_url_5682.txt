Run the above code on a system with GPU.

I could not reproduce this issue on the latest Qiskit Aer (built from source)
Could you please try using the latest one on your environment and if this issue will not be reproduced we can close this issue.

I would like to close this. Please reopen this or create new issue if the same situation is happened.
