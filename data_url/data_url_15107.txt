The nightly runs of the full test suite including the slowest components are failing following the changes in #9629.  The same tests should be running as in the regular CI runs, and this same suite runs in nightly (non-slow) CI on Python 3.10 as well, and all of those runs are passing.
Sample test failure log:
See the comments on the slow-test issue from this comment: #7864 (comment).  Currently, that comment and the two following comments are about this problem.
Tests pass.
I'm suspicious that the use and testing of a logger with a fixed name (LocalLogger) from multiple different files might be allowing race conditions, exacerbated by longer-running tests with the slow-tests active.  It may be more appropriate to use a unique logger for each individual test to alleviate this, or perhaps to change the test more significantly to explicitly only touch local state (e.g. by instead using a TransformationPass that just has a unittest.Mock instance as its run method, which can be directly queried).
I'm just guessing at that being the cause, though - I don't know.
@ElePT and @Cryoris, please could you look at this?  It's going to keep pinging the error log for the nightly runs until fixed.
