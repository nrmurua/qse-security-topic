In docs, the year is not updated.

Need to make changes to: LICENSE and docs/conf.py.
Updating the year could be automated on a yearly basis: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/update-license-copyright-year-s
Another major problem: docs was last updated 3 years ago. https://github.com/vprusso/toqito/deployments
An additional thing here is that I don't think it's fair that my name is put next to the copyright. Since its inception in 2020, the project has grown to include many different contributors. I think my name should also be removed from the updated copyright doc.
Use this issue to also automate the docs build:
https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pull-requests.html

https://metos-uio.github.io/sphinx-docs-example/rtd/
After #279, this issue is open to create an automated update to the copyright year range 2020 - new date.
It does appear RTD build is already automated. So, #229 (comment) can be ignored.
