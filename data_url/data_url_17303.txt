It seems that this is true only if the job is not done.  So perhaps there should be a check for the job status before the query for the properties to avoid this error.
This is an IBMQProvider issue.
I guess we can't just change self._wait_for_submission() to self._wait_for_completion(), because we would want to have some properties for a running job? But even submitted, it seems it has no set properties before completion, or I missed something?
