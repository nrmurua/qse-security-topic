Hi,
I installed qutip on my windows system and tried the testing codes and faced the problem (as the figure shows):
TypeError: Cannot convert _UnitedFuncCaller to qutip.cy.cqobjevo_factor.CoeffFunc

I would appreciate it if you can give me some advice to help me pass the testing codes!
Hi,
This a manual installation of the master branch?
Are you using the qutip tests in qutip.testing.run(), if so could you tell us which test is failing? (And which similar only are not.)
Hi Ericgig,
Thanks for your response!
I installed the qutip manually with master branch. And yes, I used the qutip.testing.run() to test if the installation and functions are ready.
I re-run the testing and the error happened on the "Monte-carlo: Collapse terms constant (func format)".
Attached file is the error output with context.

Thanks!
Hi Irunze,
PR #1040 should fix that bug.
Thank you for reporting.
Eric

Hi,
Has this problem been solved? I met this same error when installing qutip-4.4.0.
This bug is only in 4.4.0, the patch has not been released yet.
Don't use parallel_map in windows for mcsolve and stochastic solvers to go around it.
Or if you can install from source, the working version is in #1040

I download the version 4.4.1 from https://github.com/Ericgig/qutip/tree/4.4.1/qutip  but still met this
problem.
See #1069
The code is (until merged) at https://github.com/qutip/qutip/tree/qutip-4.4.1.
Should be released next week.
The version at the last link posted also gives me this error. Should that have been fixed in there?
Hi, I get many errors while running the test code, and at the end, I came up with a nitification that says (Failed(errors=12)). here are the errors:
td_brmesolve: passes all brmesolve tests ... ERROR
td_brmesolve: time-dependent a_ops ... ERROR
td_brmesolve: time-dependent a_ops tuple of strings ... ERROR
td_brmesolve: time-dependent a_ops tuple interp ... ERROR

Please let me know how to fix it. thanks in advance
HI, I have some errors similar to these, and I don't know how to solve it. Is there anyone will face these problems if installing on windows?
Hi @saiyagami, thanks. Are these still occurring with the 4.4.1 release?
This should be addressed in v.4.5.1.
