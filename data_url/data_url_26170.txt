If toqito is tested on macos, one of the tests fails.
https://github.com/vprusso/toqito/actions/runs/7173291207/job/19532340600?pr=339#step:5:1540
This issue is to understand:

The behavior observed here is the opposite of what was seen in this issue: DevExpress/testcafe#3956
Appears to be fixed by a8349e5. Based on linked SO discussions, there is no need to install BLAS and LAPACK for macos.

Reopening this.
As observed in d1a6213, I forgot to change the os even though the job was labeled as a test builder for macos. The previous comment refers to the tests passing on ubuntu with the job labeled for macos.
It might be better to skip the failing test for now and create an issue so that we remember this. I am not too familiar with macOS and installations.
I think this is a bug related to numpy (there is now an issue on this in their repo: numpy/numpy#25395). If we search for mac in open issues, there are quite a few open discussions about some build failures and AssertionErrors on Mac. Maybe these are related.
The macOS version being installed in the Github actions run is 12.7.1.
