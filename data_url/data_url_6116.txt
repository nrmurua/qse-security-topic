The open pulse simulator should go through the pulse sequence and look for repeated patterns and then only simulate those patterns once.
This requires computing the unitary from the underlying time dependent evolution. This involves computing the dynamics of all the basis vectors.
I agree this would only be a good idea in certain situations.
Closing as not being actively developed.
