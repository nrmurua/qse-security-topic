Bug#1: A random initial layout is chosen by the mapper. This is undesirable when users explicitly use CX gates that are supported by backends.
Bug#2: The mapper sometimes reuses a measured qubit for further operation. This is rejected by real backends. It is, however, functionally correct because the measured qubit is only used as a swap intermediary.
If the circuit already conforms to backend topology, don't alter it. The user probably wants the exact same qubits.
Don't reuse measured qubits if the backend is real.
A manifestation of this bug is in the "quantum emoticon" example, as reported many times.
This input circuit:

gets rewritten to this (Notice what happens to qubit 6 after it is measured.)

Current workarounds are:
Fixed via #347
