If not set explicitly, the ideal gate is set at instantiation of an Instruction with no consistent way to change it.
Inspect the ideal gates in the two qubit example. They are all identical to the rx90p because they were copied.
When the name of an instruction is changed, the corresponding ideal matrix representation should be updated.
