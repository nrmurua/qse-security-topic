This issue is dedicated to ensuring that the sublattice and parent lattice 'Lattice' table records are connected via the 'electron_id' field in the 'Lattice' table.
When this issue is closed, it will mark that we're done implementing V9 of the DB implementation and can proceed with enhancements corresponding to V10.
Acceptance criteria
@mshkanth Issue corresponding to the sublattice electron id's not showing up. I'll be giving you a play by play of how close we're to getting this merged.
