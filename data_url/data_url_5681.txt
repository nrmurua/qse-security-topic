If ran inside a multiprocessing context, the aer_simulator_statevector simulator crashs resulting in a SIGABORT (exit code -6) as soon as device is set to GPU.
When run, a SIGABORT exit code and process ids are reported:
The script should output the results of the simulation, e.g. {'1 0': 516, '0 0': 508}. This happens if one executes the sim() function without multiprocessing - hence the simulation with GPU enabled does work on this system - just not inside a Process.
CUDA does not support multiprocessing
