When loading a structure from a PDB file it seems that CP2K silently ignores a given MASS keyword in the KIND section for the matched chemical element, while still using other values set in the KIND section.
While a resulting RESTART file contains the coordinates of the atoms copied from the input PDB, the initial MASS in the KIND section is preserved, making it completely non obvious that effectively the mass either from the PDB and/or the default mass for the element have been used (have to investigate further which one it is).
This could be related to the fact that in the tested PDB the name of the atoms were given as HW1, HW2.
More details will follow...
