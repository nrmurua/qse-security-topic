There are now three different labeling systems for Pegasus
So we need a many-to-many translator.
One approach suggested by @boothby would be something like (using grids as an example):
This should also support chimera and pegasus. So something like
Another approach was provided by @joseppinilla as part of dwavesystems/dimod#460. See https://github.com/dwavesystems/dimod/pull/460/files#diff-03fca389ac2a33bd03a720399e336e2dR163
I like @boothby's approach to interact with the converter, I think it's great.
In my approach I'm more interested in the way the "coordinate converter" is obtained from an existing sampler or graph.
Part of the solution would be, as you mentioned in  dwavesystems/dimod#460, to have the topology property carry everything we need to build it. And... from what I've seen, I think we would need family, shape/[columns,rows,tile], and labels
