As we work on Ignis, we need to understand how we cope with other repositories on whom Ignis depends, e.g. Terra and Aer. Essentially there are two options:
I prefer Option (2), but I think Aer and Aqua tend to work with Option (1), so it's OK too. The reason that I prefer Option (2) is that, with Option (1), we may find ourselves too busy in adjusting to frequent changes in Terra interfaces. Also we will depend on the master branch of Aer to be updated with the master branch of Terra. I think Option (2) is cleaner.
Decision here will affect:

I think Matthew will help with tagging releases so that we can guarantee that certain tagged branches work with certain versions of Aer/Terra. Also the pip version of ignis should work with the pip version of Aer/Terra.
I'm coming around to maybe keeping certain pieces of code in ignis (e.g. marginal_counts) so that we don't get burned later, thoughts @chriseclectic
Because the first version of ignis will be released before the next version of terra, for now Ignis has to work with Terra stable (0.7).
Going forward, the benefit of staying in sync with Terra master is that you can make small adjustments to stay in sync rather than a big change. However, there is one downside and that is you will not be able to release at your own schedule (you would have to wait for terra to release first).
