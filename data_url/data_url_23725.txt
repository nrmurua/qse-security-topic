The write_metadata function has an argument read_first:
https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/data/format.py#L107
The HDF5 formatter does not have this argument:
https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/data/hdf5_format.py#L238
This generates an error here:
https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/data/data_set.py#L764
A one line fix would be to add the read_first argument to the hdf5 formatter, but ignore it.

@peendebak , I thought I took care to preserve the interface when making the hdf5 formatter. Maybe this got added later? (or maybe I just messed up). I approve of your immediate solution.
