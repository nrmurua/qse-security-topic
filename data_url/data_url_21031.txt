Requests to PublicAPIService::GetObject with a query that is an valid QRL Address result in the following error:
I tried to reproduce this in v0.62 but could not do so.  Do you still see this issue?  Was there a particular client language you were using to access the API?  Or maybe a specific address that caused the issue?
Issue was fixed on PR #1037
Thanks @cyyber !  If I was more experienced with python I would have attempted a fix myself
