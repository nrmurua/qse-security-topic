Alternative to this fix: allow function xxx to be namespaced as __NAMESPACE_xxx in test_symbol_namespace.py.
This is actually a good point. Allowing _NAMESPACE_xxx on Linux in the first place is what caused this issue: because MacOS added some namespaces on top of the normal NS we are in trouble.

It may be slightly complicated to handle this for the symbols exported from assembly files.
