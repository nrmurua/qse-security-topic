Does not install on m1 macs.
Successful installation.
I got this issue while installing qiskit which depends on tweedledum.
I can confirm that pip install tweedledum==1.1.0 works but pip install tweedledum doesn't.
It looks like the wheels are missing from pypi on arm64 macOS on the latest 1.1.1 release. The build job looks like it failed: https://github.com/boschmitt/tweedledum/actions/runs/1218553134 but it was long enough ago that the logs are gone. @boschmitt can you retrigger the job so we can see what the failure is?
In the meantime you can probably just run pip install --prefer-binary tweedledum tweedldum and it will install tweedledum from 1.1.0 which has the missing wheels available.
Thanks @mtreinish.
I will investigate this further.
@mtreinish this does not work with arm64, I have the same issue.
arch -arm64  pip install cmake tweedledum --no-binary :all:
I have had the same issue on an M1 MacBook with macOS Ventura 13.0.1.
There is a workaround:
After you do this, pip will think you have satisfied the requirement for tweedledum (rather than tweedledum-dev) and so will allow you to install packages that depend on tweedledum.
If this approach does not appeal to you, you can punt on virtual environment and use Anaconda, which also works.
