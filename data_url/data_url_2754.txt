Natural to put the resource name on the JobConfig.  Also useful in using the JobConfig returned back in EngineJob to call the other resource name base commands.
/projects//programs/ etc.
As all information needed to construct the resource name (currently in run_sweep()) is already present in JobConfig I would go with constructing the resource name directly when instantiating JobConfig.
Skimming thorugh the code I recognized that engines run() method takes keyword arguments that are not documented yet. A link to apiclient.discovery.build() documentation or a hint / check that kwargs have to be in ['model', 'requestBuilder'.....] might be helpful.
Is this worth an additional issue or should I just work on that?
May I ask you to assign me this issue?
Digging a bit deeper I realized the EngineJob returned by run_sweep does already have a job_resource_name attribute, which is derived from the job results dictionary.
As I cannot access the Quantum Engine API I cannot really tell whether this is what you were going for.
Please let me know whether any further work is required.
JobConfig no longer exists.  We have moved away from using resource ids in the client code.  All that code should now refer to specific ids (project_id, program_id, job_id).  These are accessible attributes on relevant objects.
