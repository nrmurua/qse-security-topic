While using python-3.7 and running
python -m pip install -r dev_tools/conf/pip-list-dev-tools.txt
throws an error:
pylint 2.3.1 has requirement astroid<3,>=2.2.0, but you'll have astroid 2.1.0 which is incompatible.
Updating the requirement of astroid in pip-list-dev-tools.txt to 2.2.* makes it work.
Hey @iamvamsikrishnad, this was a compromise we had to make to be on a latest version of pylint while getting around this bug:

Hi,
Thanks for the reply. I am not sure I totally follow you.
Yes it (pylint-dev/astroid#650) is a issue in 3.5.2 and hence astroid was pinned to version 2.1.*, but that is breaking it for users on python 3.7. I believe we need to find a fix for both versions right ?

Yes, the fix is solving that issue that you linked which is still open. I've spent an hour or two playing around with astroid to try to fix that bug with no luck. You can open a pull request to astroid if you find the fix.
In that case, Can you please keep this issue open.
This issue is not a bug in cirq. It's a bug in astroid.
I'd leave it up to your judgement.
I feel since the cirq installation is failing because of the dependencies, we should track it here as a cirq bug as well.
The cirq installation does't fail because of this. It throws a warning that the versions of astroid and pylint are not compatible. If i'm wrong about this let me know. Also, the title of this issue doesn't seem to match what we are discussing right now.
Sure.
