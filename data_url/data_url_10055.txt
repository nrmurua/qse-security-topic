Application
(samples_like ~ Iterable[Mapping] is enforced)
Proposed Solution
If sample is given as a list, assume indices for variable labels.
Alternatives Considered
There are many alternatives, this is just a "sugar-y" feature.
I am trying to envision when this would come up outside of testing edge cases?
It just seems more consistent. If from_samples is accepting (one) sample as a list, and is accepting one sample as a dict, and is accepting a list of lists/dicts; why not the combination?
