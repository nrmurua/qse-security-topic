I am trying to enable the 'SPHINCSSHAKE256128FSIMPLE' variant. I have enabled it in the generate.yml file. When I run 'python3 oqs-template/generate.py' from the openssl directory . I face this error 'Must include LIBOQS_DOCS_DIR in environment'
This precisely means what it says: In order to run generate.py successfully, it needs to know the location of the docs directory of liboqs. Thus you need to set LIBOQS_DOCS_DIR accordingly before, e.g. via export LIBOQS_DOCS_DIR=/full-path/to/liboqs/docs (obviously replace the first two path elements with where you have placed the liboqs source code tree).
