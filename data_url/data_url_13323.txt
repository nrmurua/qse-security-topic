Implement the built-in digital dynamical decoupling sequences via rules (e.g. xx_rule, xy_rule) described in the RFC for dynamical decoupling.
They are necessary to determine how to fill slack windows (holes with idling qubits) in a circuit.
Implementation ideas with pseudo-code are present in the RFC but, of course, a different approach can be used as long as general planned features are achieved:
@andreamari this one looks like a good candidate for next steps on ddd? I'm happy to pick it up for milestone 0.15!
Sure, thanks @Aaron-Robertson!
