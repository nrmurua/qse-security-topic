Hi @ncrubin
I find this project really interesting and would like to work on this task of migrating Grove to Python3.
I'll report my progress as I start working on this.
Awaiting your reply.
Sounds great!
@ncrubin Do I strictly port the code to Python 3 or should the code support both Python 2 and 3?
@waseem18, thanks for taking on this task! The library should support both versions. Have a look at rigetti/pyquil#66 and rigetti/pyquil#68, where we introduced tox and corresponding python2.7 and python3.6 test automation.
Thanks for the information @ncrubin and @jotterbach . I'll start looking into this. :)
See #57
The above two PRs fix this issue
