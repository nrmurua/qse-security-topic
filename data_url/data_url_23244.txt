Right now, using a PWM requires to set the input of the "PWMx" to some internal signal.
However, this comes with some limitations, for instance, I would like to use the pwm as the output_direct of an iq module (without sacrificing the normal output of the iq), and in this case I am screwed.
Would it be possible/not too expensive in hardware resources to add PWM0/1 to the list of output_directs?
Right now, each available output_direct requires to compute the sum of all possible 15 (or 14 or so) possible output_direct signals. This is indeed a costly calculation. I dont believe we can afford another one of those.
I believe that this again pushes us towards the idea that instead of the output_directs, we allow to have modules with mutliple outputs (and inputs, too), maybe a total of 32, and simply have 3 or 4 modules that take the sum of - say - up to 4 different intputs. Then we would simply treat all analog outputs as modules with input and no digital output.
For the meantime, maybe you have an extra IQ module available which you can run with identical settings except for the value of output_signal?
Closing this because there seems to be no more interest... ???
