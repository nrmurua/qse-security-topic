The AQT service hosted at gateway-portal.aqt.eu has been deactivated and has been replaced with a new solution by AQT. Usage of the current version of the AQTBackend in projectq.backends is therefore no longer possible!
The new service offers improved access to AQT's quantum computers and can be used through the API described at https://arnica.aqt.eu/api/v1/docs.
The qiskit-aqt-provider may help as a reference for adapting AQTBackend to make use of the new API.
