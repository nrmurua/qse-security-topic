Description of the issue
The requirements for cirq-rigetti requires an outdated version of httpcore (v0.11.1, 2020-09-28, https://pypi.org/project/httpcore/#history), while the latest version is v0.14.3 (2021-11-17). Reliance on an older version of httpcore is causing build failures in nixpkgs (NixOS/nixpkgs#153500). Pinning happens here: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/4201daa3229c6fa86e66f0c4ef2dbf68e7e38be4/cirq-rigetti/requirements.txt
Cirq version
latest (master 4201daa, issue since 912110f)
Remedies
The main issue from an API perspective seems to be the test in cirq-rigett/cirq_rigett/service_test.py, which imports private types for URL & Header, which breaks with httpcore>0.14.0.
Suggested solutions:
@drewrisinger Please submit a PR for this. If you aren't able to fix it before the Cirq 1.0, we'll look into it.
Marking as post Cirq 1.0 as this issue is not related to Cirq core. cc @MichaelBroughton
