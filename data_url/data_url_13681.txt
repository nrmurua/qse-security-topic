It has picked my attention that in the User Guide, the fold_from_right functions reported also in this summary (that could be generated with autosummary like for the factories example, or at least use the autodoc referencing ) did not link to the existing function in the API doc.
Actually, they are completely absent from the documentation!
Even when the functions are referenced correctly, the problem is that the decorator (in this case converter) that wraps them makes them invisible. By removing the line@converter, the functions are reported correctly.
This is a known issue and I am trying to understand how to address it permanently in our documentation.
For the workshop, my best fix on the fly now is to "cheat" a bit, but at least render these important functions in the API-doc (linked in  the user guide). I can:
I will proceed as described above, cc @willzeng @andreamari @rmlarose.
I may do some auto-merges to speed up stuff.
Please list here other functions wrapped in decorators.  These local folding methods are the important ones, but also picking other functions may be good. I will skim through the source code to find them all.
Hmm let's be careful of hacking something temporarily that may be hard to maintain in the future. Let's not automerge anything even if it means we have some things missing for the tutorial @nathanshammah We don't want to build up tech debt that we'll regret later.
Likely we'll want to add this to the next milestone and think about a proper solution. There's a few suggestions in the issue that you linked.
@willzeng yes, agreed. I will leave it as it is now.
@nathanshammah was this closed by #218 ?
