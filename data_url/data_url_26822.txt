cat /etc/os-release
Tried installing all with the main installer script, but failed with a generic error on the lapack installation, so I drilled down to the lapack installer.
The lapack installer in tools/toolchain/scripts/install_reflapack.sh tries to compile lapack with the value TIMER = INT_ETIME in the generated make.inc file, and I had to change to TIMER = INT_CPU_TIME to compile successfully.
Can this variable be set based on the fortran compiler found or make this the default?
My apologies for not responding earlier: can you please also report the compiler vendor and version as well as the CP2K version plus the original error message?
While it is ok to have a workaround for an issue we can not apply this if we don't know when we have to. Closing due to missing feedback.
