From the documentation* this hybrid should be using SHA2-256 to hash the data before it is signed by p256, but in fact it uses SHA2-384. This may have something to do with the issue around labelling Dilithium2 as level 1 rather than level 2? Personally I would have thought it was level 1, but am happy to be corrected.
Dilithium2 is claimed level 2 as per the Dilithium submission.
We do have some inconsistencies around this in our documentation (see e.g. #378) that need to be fixed.
P256 with SHA2-384 is not a standard scheme in TLS1.3. But I guess adherence to existing standards is not really necessary in this context.
