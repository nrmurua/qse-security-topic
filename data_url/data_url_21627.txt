How to check DHCP status?
I was trying to connect the Kasli board to a Ethernet port on the wall and control it from remote. The IT department has assigned an ip address to the mac address of the board, but when I connected it I was still not able to ping its ip. The artiq_dashboard was not working also. I was thinking that this might be caused by the DHCP setting but I don't know how to check it. I will be very appreciated if you can give me some advice on my problem!
DHCP is not supported on the core device (Kasli).
(Use something like artiq_mkfs storage.img -s mac <…> -s ip <…> and artiq_flash … -f storage.img storage start to configure the IP address; there is probably documentation somewhere.)
DHCP support is #1085

Thank you very much for your quick reply! I guess then I have to connect Kasli to my PC.
