The following circuit fits Vigo-like topologies exactly:

But optimization level 3 gives:

Where as the default gives the expected original circuit (save for H -> U2):

It seems like TrivialLayout was not  an attempt before DenseLayout. #3324 could be a solution to this. #3043 is also an option. @ajavadia ?
It's important to notice that neither TrivialLayout nor CSPLayout are noise aware (yet).
In PR #3391 I implemented the second approach, using CSPLayout (which resorts to the trivial layout if that's the only possible map).
