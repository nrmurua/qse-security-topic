The goal is to make driver tinkering independent of each other and indepentend of the frontend.
Currently the driver code of each device lives in two places. A file _program contains the programming logic and a file in hardware/awgs contains the device communication.
The _program package and its contents are currently not considered a stable interface. We need to declare (parts of) Loop as stable for a somewhat independent driver implementation to make sense.
Open questions:
@Nomos11 @maxbeer99 What are your thoughts on this plan?
Regarding loop: I know too little about that to judge which parts can be deemed "stable" or not.
Regarding the questions:
The first version lives in Gitlab already and could possibly stay there for internal consumption until some issues have been discussed (?) (referring e.g. to reocurring upload issues out of our control and possible optimizations)
I would not have a strong aversion to code duplication; but workarounds have previously been made in separate branches for individual experimental setups anyway...
