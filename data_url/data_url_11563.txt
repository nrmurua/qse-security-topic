In the following code, circ is a QuantumCircuit equivalent to the identity, whereas it should be equivalent to exp(-i Z * X).
The code path avoids much of the complexity of PauliTrotterEvolution, calling PauliTrotterEvolution.evolution_for_pauli on the PauliOp Z @ X.

But is this a valid operation? I mean Z@X is not Hermitian,
therefore exp(-i Z*X) is not unitary.
Note that the following works as expected.
Yes, you are correct!  I got lost in trying combinations of operators, and forgot to restrict to Hermitian ops.
