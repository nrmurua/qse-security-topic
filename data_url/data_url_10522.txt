Description
I have tried out the max_clique implementation using the sampler returned from EmbeddingComposite. If I iterate the graph over a few iterations I sometimes get non max-cliques. Please see my code sections 39 and 57.

To Reproduce
Copy the iPython notebook, replace the credentials and run the cells. (I realize this is a security bug in exposing the credentials)

Expected behavior
The non max-cliques 1, 3, 5, 10 should not be returned.
Environment:
Additional context
None
The different functions do not necessarily return optimal answers (see  https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave_networkx/blob/01c4cdae24f4feb1bbb9356b93b63b9fa5eac99b/dwave_networkx/algorithms/clique.py#L54).
Some of the reasons that we do not verify the correctness of the solution are discussed in #71 .
