Some pool codebase may require a larger extra nonce.
For example, nodejs-pool requests blocktemplate with a 'reserve_size' of 17 bytes to accommodate the nonce for it's  xmr-node-proxy.
QRL is using a fixed 8 byte, so I have to turn off this feature in my pool temporarily.
Do you have plan to support more extra nonce bytes in the future?
Is there any reason not to put extra nonce into base transaction?
Thank you for raising the issue. We will discuss with our team and will explore the further possibilities.
reserve_size has already been increased to 17 bytes.
