Much of the logic in the addresser and compressor passes is written half-way between being specialized to the case of 1- and 2-Q gates and being applicable to the generic case of hardware that supports native n-Q gates.
Frankly, the software may also end up being more elegant when written in this general setting.
Johannes points out (1) that ion trap computing naturally has an all-to-all topology, and (2) they naturally support n-Q gates (cf. equation (5) of arxiv.org/abs/1601.06819, also arxiv.org/abs/1603.07678). This isn't us, but it might be relevant to a compilation-as-a-service product.
