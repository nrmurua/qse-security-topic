@willzeng Is there a particular reason why the Meyer Penny game, and the Prisoner's dilemma game, are in the QVM section? They seem more appropriate for the Examples section after Advanced Usage, or elsewhere.
Yep that's a good call out. It would be better as examples.
K great. We've got some open PRs to the docs, I'll include that in a followup.
