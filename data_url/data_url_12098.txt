In this tutorial "Qiskit Aqua: qGANs for Loading Random Distributions" there is a  link on this line:
"How to use a trained qGAN in an application, i.e., pricing of financial derivatives, is illustrated here: qGAN Option Pricing."
If you right-click and chose "Open link in new tab" it leads to a blank page that only  says "Unknown type"
I think this is no longer an issue.
