Considering running artiq_master --blind * on PC_1 but open dashboard on PC_2.
Then if you right click the Explorer on dashboard and select Open file outside repository, you'll be able to see all the folders (and *.py files) on PC_1.
Is that supposed to work like this?
I think if one connected to the master on another computer and tried to Open file outside repository, he would want to submit a local experiment instead of seeing all files on the server.
Yes, it is supposed to work like this. Experiments can use multiple files, and the client cannot know what to send. You can use a shared network folder to solve this problem.
