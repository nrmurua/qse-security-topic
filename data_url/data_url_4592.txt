I think I have found a bug in tf2.3.0 running on GPU in eager mode.
Some our tests fail when the tf.tensor_scatter_nd_update is called with complex64 or complex128 objects.
Here a minimal code to reproduce the problem:
Make sure you are running on GPU
this produces InvalidArgumentError: Unsupported dtype: complex64 [Op:TensorScatterUpdate].
Similar problem for complex128. The same code runs fine on tf2.2.
Reference: tensorflow/tensorflow#42581
@stavros11, fortunately we only use this call once in cgates.

Thanks for spotting this problem. I checked the call and if you like a solution would be to change this operation to numpy as:
I checked and tests pass with this approach. I don't think there will be serious change in performance as this specific function is not used for any common functionality, only in very specific cases during gate fusion (which may be rare). Also unitary should be a 2x2 matrix there which is small so recasting will not be an issue.
Yes, this sounds good. If we add this patch tests will pass except for the test_gradients. Here we can or cast to float or maybe drop the test completely given that we never use gradients with custom operators.
