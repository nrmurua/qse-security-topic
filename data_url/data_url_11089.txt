Hello, I am new with openfermion. I want to know if there is a way to calculate the unrestricted HF energy of a molecule for a fixed value of the spin. I would appreciate of any guidance to implement this.
Hi, sorry for the delay. Could you provide some more information on what you want to do, i.e., do you want to build a circuit to perform a UHF calculation, or something else?
