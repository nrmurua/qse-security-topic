At the moment there is no nice way of checking whether a circuit has feed-forwarding or post-selection. Currently, it can be done by e.g. (the try-except is needed since not only measurement circuit operations have the select property):
It would be much nicer, and less overhead, to have properties in Program that return True/False for when feed-forwarding and/or post-selection is used, instead of having to check each operation in the circuit each time you want to run it.
Hey @thisac, I'm going to tackle this issue ðŸ˜„
Awesome @felipeoyarce! Feel free to open a PR and ask any questions you may have for the team about the implementation.
