Behavior reproduces for dev branch when I build html on my machine.
Works for me https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-release-2/search.html?q=pulse&check_keywords=yes&area=default
Your search string "pulse" returns
However it does not return free-text references to "pulse" in the documentation. This is problematic for other reasonable search terms like: mac, openocd, conda, device_db.pyon.
works fine in master
I'm on master. I can build html using sphinx 1.5.1. Ubuntu 14.04, Chromium browser. When I load artiq/doc/manual/_build/html/index.html I see a search box on the left-hand side.
A search for "EnvExperiment" returns some results but it not a free-text search of all the documentation. It fails to find for example artiq/doc/manual/_build/html/release_notes.html
A search for "HDF5" returns no results.
works fine here: https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-master/search.html?q=HDF5&check_keywords=yes&area=default
maybe sphinx-doc/sphinx#3270 or/and sphinx-doc/sphinx#2989
or sphinx-doc/sphinx#2930 sphinx-doc/sphinx#2989 sphinx-doc/sphinx#1918
could you try make clean html?
​$ make clean html
file:///home/britton/artiq3/artiq/doc/manual/_build/html/search.html?q=HDF5&check_keywords=yes&area=default
I see animated "Searching..." ​

Try downgrading to sphinx 1.4.6 (and make clean html). That fixes it here.
Your instructions on how we should solve this make me suspect you would like to get involved and do it yourself.
Your instructions are wrong. As you can tell right away from the link I posted above, it works fine on master.
The issue you are seeing locally that I worked around for you is a different one (cross scripting defense) than the one release-2.
I could have been more clear. It's still broken on the URL linked to by "Manual" on the m-labs.hk homepage.

I know. I just explained to you that that one and the one I just resolved for you are different bugs.
