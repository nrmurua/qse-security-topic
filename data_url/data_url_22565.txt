In artiq/gateware/targets/kc705.py, lines 135-137, the value of CONFIG_DDS_RTIO_CLK_RATIO is set to 8 >> rtio.fine_ts_width (giving 1 for the default 3-bit fine timestamp width). This is true for the AD9858 but not for the AD9914, where the ratio between DDS clock and RTIO clock (from DDS SYNCCLK) is 24 (and thus CONFIG_DDS_RTIO_CLK_RATIO should be 3, or 24 >> rtio.fine_ts_width.  I wasn't able to chase down where rtio.fine_ts_width is initially defined.  This issue manifests itself only in a subtle way through the phase tracking, on lines 144-148 of the dds.c runtime only in lines 144-148.  Am I missing something here?  Otherwise the kc705.py should be refactored to put this configuration into the individual QC1/QC2/clock classes.
