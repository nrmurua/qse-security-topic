Currently we say that Lightning is compatible with a specific version of PennyLane or higher, specified here and in requirements.txt.
We should add a test to make sure that this is the case.
Should this issue be closed?
Hi @trbromley; What are the acceptance criteria for this issue? I couldn't get what exactly the test must check.
With PR #353,  PennyLane-Lightning dependence will be set to the most recent PennyLane version.
