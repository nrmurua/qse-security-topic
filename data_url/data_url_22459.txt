In practical terms, this makes it easier to work with a core device on an internal network from outside that network, as there is no longer any need to poke holes in NAT, or various tunneling solutions. It also permits IPv6-only deployments.
If for once lwip works correctly, it should be easy. Try it on the master branch so we have plenty of time to notice if it breaks anything else.
We have migrated from lwip; IPv6 support now depends on smoltcp: smoltcp-rs/smoltcp#3.
