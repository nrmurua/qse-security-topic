For testing decompositions, it's often useful to prevent AutoReplacer from passing along complicated gates. This functionality could go into DummyEngine, but separating it out keeps DummyEngine simple.
See #54 for the basic idea.
Sure, why not. While it is basically an InstructionFilter, it's nice to have for testing.
Oh, you do have an existing engine for this. In that case it would make more sense to merge behaviors into it rather than make a separate one.
I think having a separate one makes sense, but the new one can, e.g., derive from InstructionFilter.
