As reported many times (last one is #3425), there are users how wants to use multiprocessing on top of Qiskit (Aer). I think this is a valid use-case, but there seems to be conflicts with our multiprocessing use in Job management.
I found myself in the need to disable it by changing the source code, for debugging some C++ code.
It would be great if users could have a simple way to disable job concurrency.
I haven't dig too deep in the code, but a simple solution could be a parameter named: "parallel=False" of the Backend.run(). If this parameter is set to False, we can control the initial value of os.environ['QISKIT_IN_PARALLEL'] = 'FALSE' and set it to ' TRUE'.
This seems to be an easy feature implementation (unless someone come up with another approach), so I'm tagging it as Good First Issue... not quite sure I'd have too much time for mentoring though :(
Or we direct them to use parallel_map which has the logic for cases just like this.
As a side note, the jobs are async so that may cause issues as well if they are spawned by a processpool.
Is this still open and what are some suggested modules to look at in order to fix this?
Hi!, if this issue is still open, can I give this a try?
I believe this was covered by #4345 . Feel free to re-open if not.
