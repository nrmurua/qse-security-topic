We are not planning to add this issue as part of Hacktoberfest. If you would like to still submit a PR for this, feel free to do so but that will not be considered as part of Hacktoberfest. Also, please go through their guidelines about spammy PRs here: https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#spam
This is not a change we want to include at this time.  Closing as not planned.
