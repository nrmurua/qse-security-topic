Hi @sassan72, it's a bit difficult to read (or reproduce) the issue you're having. Would you mind describing it in more detail and maybe add a minimal working example?
i have a quantum state like this:
def statepreparation(circuit, angle, wire):
angle = feature_train1[1]
q = QuantumRegister(3) # QuantumRegister define number of qubit.
c = ClassicalRegister(1) # this defines a classical bit for storing measurement results
circuit = QuantumCircuit(q,c)
circuit = statepreparation(circuit, angle, [0,1,2])
#circuit.measure(0, c)
circuit.draw('mpl')
i can draw the circuit for it.

i can also add the variational circuit to it and draw it:

but when i want to calculate the gradient of the gates, i got this error.
here:
var = np.copy(params_init)
bias = bias_init
v = np.zeros_like(var)
v_bias = 0
num_train = len(y_train)
for it in range(100):
i can send you the whole code, if it works for you.
From the above traceback it seems to me you mixed up the order of parameters in the call to statepreparation. Instead of
it should be
yes. you're right. thanks a lot. it solved my issue.
