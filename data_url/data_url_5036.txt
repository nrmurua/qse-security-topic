In docs for createDensityQureg claims:
" initZeroState should be called after this to initialise the qubits to the zero pure state."
But within function, this is called internally.
This is stated correctly in createQureg.
"The qubits are initialised in the zero state (i.e. initZeroState is automatically called)"
Fixed in the new_docs branch
