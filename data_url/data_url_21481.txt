This bug is seen plaguing the build #75623 and build #73252 previously, and it is seemingly repeatable under specific conditions. The bug lead us to here, which is where the unit test stopped in both Hydra executions:

Indeed, after commenting out that line of code, the test pipeline continues smoothly. But after some close inspections, it seems like this probably isn't the entire story. I have written a Minimal Reproducible Code that replicated this issue pretty consistently.
It should pass no matter what
It stuck like this in the log below.
It seems like this issue is from numpy.
It is also reported there is some hardware fluke on KC705. Maybe we should take this to other hardwares for sure.
Commit up to df6aeb9 also succumbed to this It seems fine after I rebuilt the gateware, the new problematic commit is 20e079a
7209e6f is seemingly a good commit
It is also reported there is some hardware fluke on KC705.
Other than the problems due to the IP settings?
Somehow this is related to #1798, and I can pass the MRC building with PR #1802, but I should try more rounds of testing first.
Case resolved with #1802
