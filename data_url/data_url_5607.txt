When building a noise model from a backend with a non zero temperature, the excited state population is not correctly computed.
The Maxwell Boltzmann distribution is computed in qiskit_aer.noise.device.models._excited_population(freq, temperature) where the frequency and temperature are normally in GHz and mK, but the frequency is passed in Hertz, yielding a 1e9 error in exp_param and an incorrect population.
The frequency is taken from relax_params in qiskit_aer.noise.device.models._device_thermal_relaxation_error, called in qiskit_aer.noise.device.models_basic_device_target_gate_errors, where the params are taken from Target.qubit_properties, that is an IBMQubitProperties object, where the frequency is stored in Hz.
Build a noise model from backend with non zero temperature :
On my end this yields a warning :
qiskit_aer/noise/device/models.py:394: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in exp  exp_param = exp((47.99243 * freq) / abs(temperature))
And then look at freq in qiskit_aer.noise.device.models._excited_population, it's in Hz.
The frequency should be expected in Hz, and a factor of 1e-9 should be added to the exp_param computation.
Change the function to accept freq in Hz and then add a 1e-9 factor in exp_param.
