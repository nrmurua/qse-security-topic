Steps to reproduce:
Start 1st level and build, say, a working solution (so that the photon is moving for a longer time)
Click laser
While photon is moving, click the button to switch from orthogonal to oscilloscope mode
Observed behavior: The graphics does not change. Only when I click on the laser again for the next time, the representation of the photon changes.
Expected behavior: The representation of the photon changes immediately.
Possible fixes: Either change the representation of the photon immediately (ideal solution) or deactivate the orthogonal/oscilloscope switch button while photon is moving.
Thanks for this remark. Changing visualization while it is running might be hard with current architecture.
I will try to block it during the visualization phase.
