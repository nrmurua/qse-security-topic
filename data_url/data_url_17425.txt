When following the build from source instructions I get a build error and can no longer use latest version of terra.
setup build successfully
Original bug was when compiling with XCode 9.3, I can confirm updating to XCode 10.2 let me compile. The install docs should probably be updated to mention the required version
I am not sure that it is an xcode issue, or that you were using a version of xcode that is not compatible with the os version. 9.3 was for osx 10.13 whereas you are using 10.14
Removed bug label as this is just an error from using an old version of xcode on 10.14
This can probably be closed.
