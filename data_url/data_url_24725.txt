Typical waveforms we generate consist of an initialization, manipulation, readout stage. The manipulation stage is typically short (200 ns), while the other stages are long (upto a ms).
Can we add an argument to the plot function to only plot a slice of the entire waveform?
Maybe we could use the pulses identifiers for that? Not straight forward, though.
Or do you more think of a time slice?
I was thinking of a time slice. Even better would be to be able to reduce a sequence to a slice (and then the plotting can work as it normally would)
@terrorfisch Any update on this issue?
@eendebakpt I addressed this in PR #412 by adding an optional time_slice keyword argument which is just a tuple of start and end time specifying the interval that should be plotted. Can you test and give feedback whether this is what you need?
