Could you take a screenshot and paste it here?

In my experience, linux machines usually do well at rendering the fixed width characters as actually fixed width. On my windows machine it never quite looks right though.

That's actually not nearly as bad as I was picturing. On my windows machine the lines often just don't line up at all, because the fonts aren't fixed width when it comes to unicode.
I think it's not devastating for the lines to be italicized like this. Not ideal, but the intention is still getting across. Worth fixing, but not urgent.
We need an updated example of this. @vtomole do you see somewhere else in the documentation where this is a problem?
I removed the direct quotation of these examples in the docs and instead link to the source code.  I don't think this issue is relevant anymore.  Please re-open if you find other instances of this in the docs.
