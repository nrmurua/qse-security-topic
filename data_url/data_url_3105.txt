The QCS API supports engagement with, and job submission to, QPU endpoints. These represent execution on a particular architecture, such as Aspen-9, but there may be multiple such endpoints. Some may serve live access to the quantum processor; others may serve simulated access. There is a system-determined "default" which is used for engagement when no endpoint is specified; however, certain users may prefer to engage with and send jobs to alternate endpoints for testing.
Add an endpoint_id optional keyword argument to EngagementManager constructor, which will then create and store engagements for that particular endpoint. This will propagate through the rest of the related classes, which depend on the EngagementManager for the URLs used to connect and run jobs.
