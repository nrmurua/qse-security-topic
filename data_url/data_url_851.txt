Describe the bug
AwsSession fails to manage multiple profiles for QPU-related tasks. It only works if I move the credentials to the default profile.
QPUs = AwsDevice.get_devices(types=["QPU"], aws_session=aws_session) is failing but simulators = AwsDevice.get_devices(types=["SIMULATOR"], aws_session=aws_session) is working. We created aws_session using the instruction provided in the docs . The only workaround is to move the credentials to default profile.
Error message:
ClientError: An error occurred (UnrecognizedClientException) when calling the SearchDevices operation: The security token included in the request is invalid
Hi, thanks for documenting this issue! Would you mind sharing a code snippet that you are using that gives this error? If we can see how you're setting up the credentials and setting up the sessions, that will help with debugging. Please redact credentials of course
The credentials are stored in the AWS cli profile using the instruction given by AWS cli document. I have multiple profiles and each with a different IAM policy. AWSBraketFullAccess is the only profile with access to Braket. If my credential storage is wrong, then it shouldn't work when I try to retrieve on-demand simulators...
Yes, the setup looks good, just wanted to make sure I'm debugging the same scenario you're facing. Getting QPUs searches over multiple regions and involves copying the session, whereas simulators is more straightforward, so that gives a good start to where this edge case is cropping up. I'll take a look and see if I can get this fixed quickly. Thanks for sharing!
My profile is setup for only us-east-1. Its weird when it works fine for the default profile.
Thank you!
Thanks for identifying this bug! Here is a PR with my fix: #446. It is not ready to merge as I need to update some of the adjacent unit tests, but feel free to install from source to unblock your development in the meantime.
@ajberdy its working! Thank you very much!
