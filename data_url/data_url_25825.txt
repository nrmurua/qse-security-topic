Implement a service for managing result objects and other files. The service will consist of 2 API methods, upload and download.

Ideally the service should be able to integrate with a local object storage service or a managed cloud service like S3. For now it is enough to get the local object storage service working. We will need to do some research to find a service that works best.
Objects in the service will need unique IDs that can be stored in the results DB and used by the data service to retrieve results.
We considered storing results directly in the DB. This design was abandoned because results objects can be very large which would impact DB performance and maintainability.
We also considered uploading and downloading files to and from a file system rather than an object store. We agreed on the object store because it should perform better, is easier to implement, and because there is not an immediate need for the service to be able to manage a folder structure directly.
