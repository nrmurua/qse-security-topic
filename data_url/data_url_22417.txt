I'm trying to run this command,
python3.5 -m artiq.gateware.targets.kc705 -H qc1  # or qc2
but get the following error,
It used to work fine but I'm unable to generate the bitstream. It seems like the /opt/Xilinx folder exists and I've been able to generate bitstreams before. I've updated migen, misoc and artiq. Any idea what could be wrong?
This is probably my fault. Yesterday, I committed a patch to unconditionally set the source argument to the Xilinx ISE builder in Migen; building MiSoC bitstreams on Windows was broken without it.
I assume you're using a *nix, since Migen is looking for Xilinx in opt/Xilinx; my patch shouldn't have affected the functionality of the *nix version of the ISE builder (which would source to True even before last night). I have Xilinx and Linux installed on my netbook. I'll see if I can duplicate/fix later tonight.
I'm not sure if that was it. I tried checking out an older version of migen but that still gave me the same message. I'll try reinstalling my Xilinx stuff.
Try the vivado toolchain Option.
@r-srinivas Did you install ISE or Vivado?
Vivado. It was working before for generating the bitstream so I'm not sure what changed. I guess it was maybe when I uninstalled artiq from #361.
@r-srinivas ls /opt/Xilinx please.
And yes, if you want to build with Vivado, you need to add --toolchain vivado. ISE is the default, and if it is not installed, you get this error message that simply tells you it was not found.
This was after the reinstall.
If I try --toolchain vivado I get,
No error before the Python traceback?
There were some warnings before but nothing stopped it.
The relevant error is:
What does the generated Verilog (misoc_nist_qc1_kc705/gateware/top.v) look like? It should have module top( as second line.
I can paste the rest of the file if you want but it's a little long.
Uhm, there is obviously something wrong with module user_sma_clock_n(. Did you change migen, misoc or artiq in any way, or is this the original code?
I had checked out an earlier version of migen. I tried with the latest version of migen and get this error when trying python3.5 -m artiq.gateware.targets.kc705 -H nist_qc2 --toolchain vivado .
Right, @dhslichter did not test his patch. Let me fix it...
In the meantime, QC1 and Clock should be unaffected by the KeyError.
KeyError with QC2 fixed in 212ee8c.
Looks like it worked for nist_qc1, thanks!
I'll try for qc2 now.
Just for the manual,
Could
For KC705:
$ python3.5 -m artiq.gateware.targets.kc705 -H qc1  # or qc2
be changed to nist_qc1 or nist_qc2?
And in the
Preparing the core device FPGA board
section, could the --toolchain vivado option be added in the instructions? Thanks!
Done.
