I would like to have a function that tells me all about my jobs
activity
This would return a table of
job_id'
'backend_name',
'provider'
(for IBMQ hub, group, project)
'status'
'job_message' something human readable to add to the qobj of my job.
I would have all my jobs or show in order of last submitted the last 100 jobs (even completed ones so I can grab them back if I want)
If it is in queue i want the job_message to say in which queue and the priority
I think if we fix up #1065  then this is really just
with some extra information like provider and backend
I think this is solved now via #1082, which gives you handles to your jobs and you can get info from them.
Also the backend_monitor jupyter magic gives a broad overview of jobs run on a particular device in the past week, month, etc.
There is still a difference. This is for all the backends and jobs where as the last one is just the jobs I have sent to the backend.
This exists as the job_watcher.
