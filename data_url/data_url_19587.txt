For some reason I would like to have two boundary vertices for my surface code decoding graph. However, I tried the following repetition code decoding graph
The decoder outputs [1 1 1 1 0] instead of [0 0 0 0 1].
Update: I installed the incorrect PyMatching version (0.7). V2.1 does not have this issue.
