By packing contiguous memory address together, Concentrator could be more efficient. (Less permutation operations on shape).
Currently, the mechanism is:
We suppose that if a user inputs UnitRange, then it knows which part is contiguous, therefore there is no contiguous check for UnitRange, and we directly pack an address start from the start of UnitRange and has length length(::UnitRange).
However, currently solution can not handle the following conditions:
[1, 6, 5, 4, 2, 3], where [6, 5, 4] is actually contiguous, but if the input is 4:6, it will cause an error.
4, 5, 6 and 6, 5, 4 is different, we don't need to consider this anymore
