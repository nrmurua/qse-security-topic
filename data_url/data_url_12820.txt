Hi thanks for putting together the tutorials!
I got started following https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas#running-the-katas-locally-, the jupyter notebook tutorials use pytest for evaluation but it was not mentioned in the set up process. It was in the Dockerfile though.
True, our instructions for running the katas are rather outdated, I will be taking a closer look at them next week. (You might have a similar problem with matplotlib for "Exploring Grover" tutorial)
I wonder which flavor of the installation instructions did you follow when installing Q#? I think my Python came from Miniconda install which already included a lot of Python tools, but that was the previous version of Q# install instructions, the current one at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/ doesn't suggest Anaconda.
I'm on Mac OS, I installed Python3 via Homebrew, it is located at /usr/local/bin/python3 and version 3.7.4. For Q# I followed the first two sections of https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/index?view=qsharp-preview#develop-with-python. I have been using jupyter notebook for the tutorials. Hope it helps.
You're right, I just got to VisualizingGroversAlgorithm and I had to install matplotlib manually, thanks for the heads up.
Ran into the same issue before realizing I needed to install pytest and also have a similar setup: Mac OS, Python3 via Homebrew
Thank you for confirming! To my great embarrassment, I still have to carve out the time to update our installation instructions...
