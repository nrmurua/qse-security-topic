Returns 0,1,2,3 for non-Pauli, X-type, Y-type, and Z-type targets respectively.
This fixes a usability issue where, when you know the gate is a Pauli target, you need to call "is_x_target" and "is_y_target" and "is_z_target" to figure out what type, instead of just being told what type with one call.
