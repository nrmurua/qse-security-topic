Description
I am embedding a dimod.BQMs into a D-Wave processor. For this, I use a dwave.system.FixedEmbeddingComposite and an embedding found by minorminer. However, I find that if the bqm has disconnected nodes, the embedding won't contain a mapping for them. This raises a MissingChainError from the composite.
To Reproduce
Short example:
Expected behavior
Minorminer returning a mapping for each logical variable in the source graph.
