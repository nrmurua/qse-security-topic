See:
I don't know why the error is caused, if I didn't add test dependencies, can you tell me what to do before testing?
result:
I don't know how to analyze the segmentation fault.
I think it's probably due to a bug in the test source code, right?
From your provided info, it is difficult to state what the error causes. I can just state that the error does not lie in the AXK code because that test has run fine. It is something about H2O-rpa-cubic-lr.inp. We are testing the files regularly and do not see any issues.
Can you provide more info about your system (CP2K version, arch file, libraries, ...)?
Are you able to recompile the code? If yes, can you add debug symbols (-g)?
@fstein93    see:
It took me a long time to compile, but still the same bug, couldn't add -g compilation, and I didn't add test dependencies. Or some other reason?
Please remove "-g" in your make command. Can you post the output of "cat arch/linux-centos8-aarch64-gcc.popt" ? This prints the content of your arch file. It defines a series of variables (compilers, compiler flags, preprocessor flags, ...) . The "-g" flag has to be added to the compiler flags (usually CFLAGS, FCFLAGS) .
@fstein93 I didn't find cat arch/linux-centos8-aarch64-gcc.popt, but I found a popt file, do you see if it works?
It always makes the same mistakes.
Is there any progress on my current question?
Could you post the content of the arch-file linux-centos8-aarch64-gcc.psmp ? That should be the arch file you have used.
@fstein93 just wanted to write the same: since we deprecated the popt in favour of psmp there are still the aliases/symlinks (requesting a popt is being redirect to the  psmp).
@Tom-python0121 Have you found something?
@fstein93 No,I do not find,This question has been transferred here: spack/spack#21539 (comment) though I updated it, it still reported the same error, no progress.
@fstein93 the content of the arch file linux-centos8-aarch64-gcc.psmp is already there, pasted after the Cray file.
To have more information:
Can you run  make -j10 ARCH=linux-centos8-aarch64-gcc VERSION=popt test TESTOPTS="-skipdir QS/regtest-rpa-cubic-scaling -skipdir QS/regtest-gw-cubic -skipdir QS/regtest-rpa-lr -skipdir QS/regtest-gw-ic-model" ? If that runs smoothly can you try make -j10 ARCH=linux-centos8-aarch64-gcc VERSION=popt test TESTOPTS="-restrictdir QS/regtest-rpa-cubic-scaling -restrictdir QS/regtest-gw-cubic -restrictdir QS/regtest-gw-ic-model" ?
With the first command we should exclude errors from cubically scaling RPA which makes use of more advanced features and ensuring that anything else works. With the second command we just check for the other skipped directories.
Finally: Starting from your cp2k directory, can you edit the file tests/QS/regtest-rpa-lr/H2O-rpa-cubic-lr.inp and change the first section (&GLOBAL) to
&GLOBAL
PROJECT  H2O-rpa-cubic-lr
PRINT_LEVEL MEDIUM
RUN_TYPE ENERGY
TRACE
TRACE_MASTER
&TIMINGS
THRESHOLD 0.01
&END
&END GLOBAL
and run this input file?
This test might run a bit longer than usual but in that way the output will contain an internal traceback. Can you post the last few lines of this output file? (Definitely not the whole file as it will become huge)
