Tweedledum is updated recently https://pypi.org/project/tweedledum/1.0.0b0/#history
The current terra code fails to import the latest Tweedledum

output
Succeed to import it.
There was a new release of tweedledum that is not backwards compatible. Let me see what's the best way to solve this.
Last tweedledum version was tagged as yanked: https://pypi.org/project/tweedledum/#history This will avoid installing it "by default".
We still need to make sure that we set Qiskit req in a way that can handle breaking changes in tweedledum.
We need to specify tweedledum version on the requirements file. I will write code to make things backward compatible and follow the deprecation cycle in Qiskit.
