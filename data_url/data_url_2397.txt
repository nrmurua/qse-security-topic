E.g. see behavior in #1745
What is desired behavior?  I think in this case it makes sense that the disapprove should have to marked as stale in order to submit?
Code that would need to be modified if we change this is https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blame/master/dev_tools/auto_merge.py#L731
I haven't seen this behavior for a while now and I'm sure there were PRs with both request for changes and approval on them. Putting needs-repro on it, which will mark this issue stale eventually.
Per previous comment, this doesn't seem to be happening, and last comment is 1.5 years old.  Closing.
