I get this error when running the toolchain script.
cp2k-6.1.0/tools/toolchain/scripts/install_openmpi.sh: line 45: [: 19-18+deb8u10): integer expression expected
Full output of the ldd command:
If you don't want to use the latest git version of CP2K (please make sure to read the instructions in the README.md if you do), you can also apply the fix manually to your version using https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/commit/4ed24fb34dd79fd55e9045546a90279098d8bd73.patch
Thanks for the report!
