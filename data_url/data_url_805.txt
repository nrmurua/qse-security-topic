Programs can have specified inputs and outputs.
Input parameters can be useful for taking compilation out of the classical-quantum hybrid algorithm iteration loop. Read more here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/latest/developerguide/braket-jobs-parametric-compilation.html
Output parameters are also useful for iterative programs, and can be helpful for programs with mid-circuit measurement, where there are multiple layers of results and the user needs a map to understand which results correspond to what point in the program.

Circuits use FreeParameters to support unbound input parameters. FreeParameter has initial support in AutoQASM programs.
This task is to update the examples documentation to explain how to use inputs and outputs with AutoQASM, including the preferred FreeParameter usage style.
