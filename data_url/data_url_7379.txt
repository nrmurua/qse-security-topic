Currently the default setting for the type of eigenvalues to compute with the eigs function is :LM, i.e. largest magnitude (default setting of Julia eigs function). To find the low energy states it would be more apt to change it to get the smallest eigenvalues with smallest real part, i.e. option :SR.
