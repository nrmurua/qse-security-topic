When trying to create a random instance of a number partitioning problem, I get the following error

The core issue is that random_instance() is a static method and should be used as such:

The inconsistency is made worst by the fact that I can do the following, where the numbers I pass to the constructor are right away changed by the random_instance() method

#Solution
I am unsure what's the best way to go about this, but we should review the way that random instances are created across the pre-defined problem settings.
@vishal-ph and @Adirlou I think we can close this, right?
