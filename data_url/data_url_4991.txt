The following example (pasted here as a Mathematica literal)
is a one-qubit four-operator Kraus map which satisfies the conditions of being a completely positive, trace preserving map (sum k^dagger k = identity), exact to Mathematica's working precision.
However, it throws an error through QuESTlink of not being a valid Kraus map - this is an internal QuEST error, and is likely to be genuine to the matrices.
I suspect this may be a numerical precision problem; core QuEST's computation of sum k^dagger k is not accurate within REAL_EPS (as compared against), though is analytically correct.
This should be tested in core QuEST, and patched before v3.

Fixed!
