Being able to read the quantum state by keeping global phase.
If the quantum state is -|0>, then it should not be read as |0>.
We have an educational material used for 3-day long workshops, and the recent change in qiskit 0.12.0 (ignoring global phase) affects certain parts of our materials.
I am also having this issue with qiskit 0.12.0.
Global phase is not important for individual simulations in isolation, but can be important when post-processing results from multiple simulations.
I can expand on why this issue is important or post a MWE upon request.  For now, I am forced to revert to qiskit 0.11.1...
The simulator does not ignore global phase. This is an issue with the transpiler optimizing single qubit gates which does not preserve global phase, which you can prevent by using optimization_level=0.
See this issue in terra: Qiskit/qiskit#3083
Thank you.
As I have observed, in Qiskit 0.13.0 the default option is "optimization_level=0".
