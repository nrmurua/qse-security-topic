Now the serialization tests are available and passing, so a review could be considered.
However, take into account that the current serialization is quite poor, because of the existing constraints:
The message is: gates have to be refactored, sooner or later.
And the "plugin system" to give the flexibility to extend the framework (that for Qibolab would span drivers, and for Qibocal routines) for Qibo should both include backends and gates.
