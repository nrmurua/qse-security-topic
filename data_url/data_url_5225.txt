I get the following error when running make cleanall && make test.
I was concerned this might be related to my recent changes in cl-quil.tweedledum, so I ran a make clean in the quilc directory as well.
It looks like this error is maybe due to a missing :dimension init arg when instantiating the permutation-gate in the cl-quil:control-gate method. Likewise with cl-quil:dagger-gate.
Testing a patch now. PR forthcoming.
