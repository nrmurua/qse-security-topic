with Control(eng, ctrl_qubit):
is basically always equivalent to:
with Control(ctrl_qubit.engine, ctrl_qubit):
I think. Otherwise the code is wrong. So might as well pull out that value inside the control constructor:
with Control(ctrl_qubit):
Of course you need to check for lists, etc.
The idea behind this is to have eng as a first parameter for all with statements (to make it easier for users).
Alright
