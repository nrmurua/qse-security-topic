Anaconda packed uploads not working (was llvmlite-artiq 0.23.0.dev py35_4 doesn't exist for win64 making artiq uninstallable)
AFAICT I triggered the build, it was built and uploaded but now it doesn't exist anymore.
http://buildbot.m-labs.hk/builders/conda-win64/builds/250
probably hit the conda repo size limit. i deleted a bunch of packages on anaconda to get under 4GB
Was looking at the wrong package. Uploads still disappearing.
Uploaded manually but the problem (uploads disappearing) persists.
Since there is a workaround, it's not critical.
That's a bad idea.
In the past it was solved by conda update anaconda-client.
Pretty sure I had tried that on the buildbot.
No idea then. It also could be that the uploads failed at random, anaconda often has network issues, and by the time you manually uploaded the package that stopped.
I probably did five attempts at automatic uploading.
Hydra + self-hosted conda channel does not have such issues.
