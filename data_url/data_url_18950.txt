include statement is missing in spec/qasm2.rst line 675-683 and spec-human/qasm2.pdf page 21.
I've noticed this as well, it seems the include statement is not documented in the BNF at all.
I've just put it in with the main program so:
main: "openqasm" real ";" program | "openqasm" real ";" include program.
And I've given include its own definition as well:
include: "INCLUDE" id ";"
Seems to be working, but my parser isn't finished yet so I can't run the full test suite
closing as this should be fixed with openqasm 3.0 which we are moving towards
