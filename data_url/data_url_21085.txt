Hi - I cant seem to install QRL, I have attempted to install dependencies but this fails:
[user@software ~]$ sudo dnf -y install swit3.0 python3-dev python3-pip build-essential cmake pkg-config libssl-dev libffi-dev

No package libffi-dev available.
Error: Unable to find a match.
Edit: Upgraded to fedora 25 per the recommendation from qubes here, retried above to same result.
Edit: Solved. Install on Debian instead of Fedora if running Qubes - instructions in the comments.
As discussed in Discord, we will aim to provide support for Fedora 25 and upwards. The expect fix for this isuee should involve a docker configuration to run unit/integration tests in fedora
According to the discussion in Discord, it is already possible to have QRL running in Qubes.
Would it make sense to create a PR with a short text describing the steps?
In qubes, I was able to successfully install QRL by first upgrading the pre-installed Debian templateVM from Debian 8 to Debian 9. All the instructions for that are here, and it works pretty smoothly.
When you have a Debian 9 templateVM, make a new standalone VM from that template, increase its private storage allocation, and from a terminal, run the following commands exactly.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install swig3.0 python3-dev python3-pip build-essential cmake pkg-config libssl-dev libffi-dev
sudo pip3 install -U setuptools pip
sudo pip3 install -U qrl
start_qrl
Hello, I run qrl on fedora 27 docker image and I install it with this(maybe it will help you):
