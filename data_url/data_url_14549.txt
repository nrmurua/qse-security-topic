Hi @1ucian0, Can I work on this?
Hi @Ryand1234! This might not be the best choice for an external contributor, sorry - this issue is mostly a tracker for the core team, because we'll be making fairly heavy changes to the QASM 3 processing in Terra over the next few release cycles, and these changes will be part of it.  The changes needed for this issue are very major to a core deliverable in Terra 0.20 which will have quite a lot of activity, so it'll be a bit easier for us to manage if we keep this internal.
If you're looking for good issues, we have the "good first issue" label for issues that are good for first-time contributors, and the "help wanted" label for those with a bit more experience.  There's also "short project", and these may require a fair amount of physics knowledge to handle.
