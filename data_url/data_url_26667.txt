Running test case QS/regtest-spin-spin-1/he-polar-1.inp
the procedure calculate_vxc_atom in file qs_vxc_atom.F line 327 references the unassociated pointer drho_h.
You may easily double check it prepending CPASSERT(associated(drho_h)).
Fixed via #1309.

ssame bug resurfaced at line 694 of qs_vxc_atom.F
CALL fill_rho_set(rho_set_h, lsd, nspins, needs, rho_h, drho_h, rtau, na, ir)
where drho_h is unassociated.
while checking whether we can drop the POINTER keyword in some places I stumbled over the following (in xc_rho_set_get):

but the drho component itself is neither a pointer nor a target (which becomes obvious as soon as the procedure xc_rho_set_get is changed to take the rho_set as INTENT(IN) instead.

@vzecca do you know by any chance whether or not the "transitivity" of the POINTER attribute we see here (from the derived type xc_rho_set_type to its component drho) is standard Fortran?
Fixed (some more ;-) via #1333.
