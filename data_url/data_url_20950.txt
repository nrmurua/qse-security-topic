After running out of space, my QRL node stopped working. Even after backing up an older state, however, it still does not work. This may be correlated with me uninstalling the system version of protocol buffers, but shouldn't the pip version work?
The following is the Valgrind error log, as software encryption still hasn't been merged:

Speaking of Valgrind, these errors are everywhere, and I feel they should really be fixed to. I'm not very familiar with Swig, though, so it is a bit hard to figure out where to even begin with these myself.
This is the log from the last time it was working: https://happysmash27.me/Upload/qrl2.log.
This happens with both my backed up state and a fresh state.
Oddly enough, I think the original state actually worked, but now it is deleted.
Since you ran out of space, I believe this could be the reason of state corruption, as some of the essential state information were not written to your disk. I would suggest the following
1> Stop your QRL Node
2> try removing ~/.qrl/data and
3> Start your QRL Node
The thing is, I believe that is exactly what I did, both replacing it with a backed up state and deleting it entirely. I can try doing it again though.
It still has the same problems. Some relevant lines:
This is from as far up as Screen will let me scroll, in chronological order (I think).
Please do remove
rm ~/.qrl/data/known_peers.json
I'm pretty sure I did this a while ago (I have this issue all the time), but I'll try again...
I do indeed still get the same errors:
An interesting Valgrind message I didn't see before:
I don't even have a known_peers file, at the moment, because the node simply doesn't get that far.
You should try removing banned_peers.qrl and then restart the node.
does anyone have a .local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/qrl/core/qrlnode.py copy of this file i believe that the issue is from a altered qrlnode.py or is it possible to delete this file and aquire a new one?
@rahlfantasy If you are facing any trouble please create a new issue with the error that you are receiving, as well as your OS details, cmake, make, gcc versions.
