Hi, can we raise this as our korean hackathon project (feb 7 - 10), and is there anyone who can support us after we succeed in gathering a team?
Can I get some clarity on what documentation was needed for this issue?
Hey I am looking for a good first issue to work on. Is this still needed? If so can I be assigned to it?
For this one, I'm not sure exactly what @nonhermitian had in mind when he opened it back in 2019. But looking at https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/transpiler_passes.html there is really just a list of all the transpiler passes and not much else there. This could be expanded to include more details on working with transpiler passes with examples, and what each category means. There is some potential for overlap with https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/transpiler.html which provides the top level overview of the transpiler, some of the presets, and typical workflows.
That being said if you see room for how you can improve that page I can assign this issue to you so you can work on improving the documentation for that module.
I also do not exactly remember why I opened this.  That being said, the general feedback we get from people is that either they do not know all of the transpiler passes that we have available, or that they do not know what those passes do, and how to leverage them.  So in that vein I think there is room for improvement here, and how to go beyond the preset passmanagers in general.
Ok I am working a bit with that module at the moment :) So yes, please assign this one to me @mtreinish? I'm sure I can be helpful in generating a PR or two.
