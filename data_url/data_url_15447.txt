Adding qc.delay() to a circuit crashes qc.qasm() with the error: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
execute this program:
import qiskit as qk
circ = qk.QuantumCircuit(3,3)
circ.h(0)
circ.cx(0, 1)
circ.delay(400)
circ.cx(0, 2)
circ.barrier()
circ.measure(0,0)
print(circ)
print(circ.qasm() )
The output is:
Traceback (most recent call last):

I should see qasm output
The error message is unfortunately not very useful here, sorry, but the cause is that the delay instruction isn't directly representable in OpenQASM 2 - there's no way to attach the timing information in the output.
Depending on what you're aiming for, you may be able to use the OpenQASM 3 exporter (do import qiskit.qasm3, and then replace the last line with print(qiskit.qasm3.dumps(circ))).  OpenQASM 3 as a language is still in development, but it can represent these instructions natively.
After exporting qasm3 using qiskit.qasm3.dumps(circ), I'm wondering how to creating a quantum circuit from that qasm3 back into QuantumCircuit object? Or if it is possible?
We don't have an importer for Qiskit from OpenQASM 3 yet, but it is on our radar as a feature to add.
I'm going to close this issue now - #9953 made it so the given codeblock exports a delay instruction as opaque (which is imo a slightly controversial choice, but has long been Qiskit's position), and we do now have an OpenQASM 3 importer.  Feel free to re-open if there's more to discuss.
