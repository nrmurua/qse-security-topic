I'm running artiq on kc705 with qc2 hardware.  I have a couple AD9914s, which are clocked at 3.5 GHz.  When I set the output frequency as follows
, the actual output frequency is 100 MHz.
Have you set the correct sysclk in device_db?
Yes, here is the relevant entry in the device_db.  I've also checked on a spectrum analyzer that the actual clock going into the DDSs is 3.5 GHz.
Does this happen with all DDS cards or only one?
@whitequark The root cause of this problem is your compiler breaks when computing the frequency tuning word. This is easily reproduced by running print(2**32*400e6/3.5e9): prints 245426702.514285 on the device, 490853405.25714284 in CPython.
@dleibrandt Yes, that's actually expected, since all integers are by default 32-bit. (Arguably it was a bug in the old compiler that by accident provided correct result.) This prints the correct value:
It was not an accident, but requiring explicit size on all integers that require more than 32 bits is OK.
a9cf892 should fix the problem. @dleibrandt can you test?
@sbourdeauducq I'm aware that it worked because constant folding happened before inference of integer size. I still consider that a bug from language design perspective, because otherwise algebraically equivalent transformations would break code relying on that.
Yes, I just tested and the DDSs now output the correct frequency.
