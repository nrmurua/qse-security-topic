There are standard labels for gates like cx, ry, 'u3' etc. For example,  qiskit.compiler.transpile accepts a list of basis gates in this form. Currently the only way I know how to find out which label stays for which gate is to examine circuit library (and even there seems to be no clear mapping between labels and gates). It would be very convenient to be able to construct a gate from the corresponding label, such that for example qiskit.circuit.Gate.from_label('h') would give qiskit.circuit.library.HGate.
Hi, this looks like an interesting idea but in issue #5098 they wanna remove the label parameter from all the gates, so then this modification will be rendered useless, I think.
In this PR we rather mean name, not label. The name of a gate is unique so you can construct it via name, however the label is essentially just for plotting. The label is being removed via #5098, but not the name. I'll rename this issue title to make this clearer, thanks for pointing this out.
seems like an interesting and useful feature! I am interested in this if no one else has started working on it.
Sure, go ahead @eptru!
Is this being worked on? If not, I can pick it up.
I'm new to contributing. @eptru are you still working on this? If not, I want to take it up.
