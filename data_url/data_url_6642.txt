Hello,
I took up Liquid because I want to program the quantum algorithm of solving linear systems of equations. I found the built-in sample __QLSA just do this, but I have no access to the source code, nor do I have access to changing the matrix A and the vector b. Is that possible for StationQ to upload the source code of __QLSA? Even if the source code is not fully developed to the extend that allows users to use it as function taking arguments A and b, it would still help a lot because I can modify it instead of writing the codes from scratch all by myself.
I'm sorry, but at this time no further source code is being released. The algorithm is a fairly straight-forward implementation of HHL as documented in the User's Manual. Also note that there is no "good way" to invert the eigenvalues... so the implementation only works with solutions that are powers of 2 (inversion = reverse the order of the qubits). Doing an efficient and general QLSA is an ongoing area of research (and why this simple instance doesn't take A or b as input.
