After some initial debugging, I think the reason is that the dynamic version has this Rst operation which is presumably non-unitary, and also the dynamic version has intermediate measurements. These two factors led the code into this part (from line 70) of CircuitSimulator.cpp that ran singleShot() without ignoring the non-unitaries and gave the error.
Error message:
unknown file: Failure
C++ exception with description "Unsupported non-unitary functionality." thrown in the test body.

(Same error when using BitStrings in the constructor such as qc::BitString   const s = 0b10)
