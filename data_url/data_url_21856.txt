The suservo DDS channel numbers seem to be in a nonstandard order: suservo channel 7 is urukul0 channel 0, whereas I would experiment channel 7 to be urukul1 channel 3.
I am using the suservo example experiment (https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/examples/kasli_suservo/repository/suservo.py) and the following phy incantation:
Are you sure? Do you mean both profile settings and rf switch of suservo0_ch0 end up acting on urukul1, ch3? I just checked again with the code in master (gateware and example) and it's fine there.
FWIW, I didn't see this in my tests, although they do predate the new eem.SUServo code.
@jordens this was a experiment / device_db mixup at my end - not an Artiq problem.
