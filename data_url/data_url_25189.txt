When trying to edit qelectron related config options through the UI, it doesn't seem to save the modified settings even though editing other types of config works as expected.
@Prasy12 can you add this in?
@santoshkumarradha @kessler-frost - The current UI supports only the SDK and the executor portion of the settings to be edited. The others were kept as readonly as per the earlier requirements. Can you let us know what exactly needs to be editable from the Qelectron front?

@kessler-frost do the executor settings editing work ?
I tried editing the QiskitExecutor , IBMQExecutor settings and they both weren't working. I get a pop up saying the settings have been saved but when I reload the page it's back to the original default settings.
The classical executor settings like DaskExecutor were working fine.
