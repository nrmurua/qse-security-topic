Under a certain pulse sequences called involving DMA, the RTIO log becomes inaccurate.
When playing back a sufficiently long DMA sequence setting two DDS channels in rapid succession, then calling count(), the RTIO log does not display the correct pulse sequences. Monitoring the TTL/DDS channels on a scope, it appears that ARTIQ produces the proper signals, it is merely a problem with the RTIO log. This error only appears for sufficiently large num_pulses (see code), and if both Urukul channels are set. If only one Urukul channel is set, the RTIO log looks as expected. If count() isn't called, the RTIO log looks as expected.
Code exhibiting error:
If count = self.ttl0.count() is commented out, the RTIO log mirrors the pulse sequence that is coded. I would expect that including count = self.ttl0.count() wouldn't change this.
count = self.ttl0.count() commented out:


count = self.ttl0.count() included:
