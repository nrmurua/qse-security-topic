I'm simply trying to generate a QuantumCircuit object from different QASM files. Why can some files be generated successfully while others result in an error?
'''from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
qc = QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file("ae_indep_qiskit_69.qasm")'''
generate a QuantumCircuit object
No response
Please could you try and cut down your ae_indep_qiskit_69.qasm file to be as small as you can while still showing the error, and then share it here?
