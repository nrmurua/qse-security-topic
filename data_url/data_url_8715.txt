Hello,
I am trying to implement a paper on quantum internet. The paper states that if A, B, C are three nodes. B has two qubits out of which one qubit is entangled with A, other qubit is entangled with C. Now, if I create entanglement between two qubits in B, then automatically A and C are also entangled. I can send classical information from A to C directly without sending via B.
When I implemented the code in simulaqron, I am unable to create a connection between A and C and unable to send classical information directly from A to C.
Your help would greatly benefit me.
I am attaching the code for reference.
In the earlier code Alice.sendClassical("Charlie", [a, b]) is missing. I included that as well in the code. Please find the updated code.

Attached the paper for reference.

Hi @ganeshmylavarapu-qp! You cannot put all the nodes scripts in the same file since they will then block each other and cause a deadlock. The docs explains how to write an application and execute it. Also refer to the examples for more tips.
Great to hear @ganeshmylavarapu-qp
