I can reproduce the problem by the following codes:
where p1 is not giving correct result. Everything is correct using smaller N. The code also works fine on my server, so it seems to be environment dependent.
I am working on Arch Linux, Python3.6.1 with latest version of qutip from AUR (4.1.0-1).
Any suggestion of what I can try?
Thank you!
I am trying to track where the bug come from and find that it's the problem of scipy.sparse:
the multiplication of v.data is also not working correctly..
Should I close this issue?
This is the same error as #681.  It is an issue with the Arch linux package.  You should install another way.

Thank you for checking this.
FYI, I was tracking on what's wrong and it turns out qutip.cy.spmath.zcsr_mult is not working properly on my local machine. I don't have much knowledge on cython, preventing me from going further.
Just found that installing through pip gave the same problem.
Tried to build using gcc5, but it doesn't solve the problem.
Why not try installing via Anaconda?
It works on Anaconda, but Anaconda doesn't work well with my other tools.
Thank you for your help anyway. I can live with that, and I am just updating my attempts for people who will have similar problem.
