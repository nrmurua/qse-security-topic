I tried running the first example in https://quantumai.google/qsim/tutorials/qsimcirq, encountered the following error
I installed Cirq and qsimcirq less than an hour ago, and so it is the latest version from PyPI.
Python version: 3.10.5
Cirq version: 0.15.0
qsimcirq version: 0.9.5
OS: NixOS 22.11 (Raccoon)
This is a known issue with Python 3.10: #537. We are actively working on a fix, but in the meantime it's possible to work around the issue by using an older version of Python (e.g. using pyenv).
Closing as duplicate.
Thank you for the fast response! For now, I am using the Docker version gcr.io/quantum-builds/github.com/quantumlib/jupyter_qsim:latest, which uses Python 3.6 (already EOL).
