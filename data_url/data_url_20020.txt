Hello!
I am trying to compile liboqs for Windows ARM64 and ARMv7 with OQS_DIST_BUILD enabled, but both fail because the src/common/common.c does not provide implementations for ARM64/ARMv7 CPU feature detection on Windows. The build fails by failing to find the "<sys/auxv.h>" header, which only exists on Linux.
Thanks for the bug report. Indeed I'm not sure we have someone in the team using an ARM-based Windows. Is there a specific test (ideally CI) environment that you could point to for us to debug & test this? Could you possibly contribute such functionality?
