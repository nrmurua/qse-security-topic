The code shown below indicates there is a problem compiling selected permutation gates (DefPermutationGate). The code uses four methods:
to evaluate a circuit consisting of one X gate and one permutation gate.  The results indicate:
Output:
Note: the manual result "0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0" corresponds to state |110‚ü©, which I think is the correct result for the [5, 1, 2, 6, 7, 0, 4, 3] permutation.
The code was tested using quilc 1.26.0, qvm 1.17.2 (as pulled from DockerHub) and pyquil 3.1.0.
The attachments contain the compiled instructions (i.e. the output from qc.compile(program)) for two cases:
Repro with plain Quil:
Running this gives:
Repro without the QVM as a QUILC failure:
Found the bug. The compiler was compiling the inverse permutations. Fixed in #806.
Fixed in master.
