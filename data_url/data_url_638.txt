Hello,
I have a segmentation fault from getMeasurementStrings and getMeasurementCounts.
I installed XACC and plugings with pip on Docker images.
I am attaching the printing of a simple script and the script.

import pyxacc as xacc
import sys
def hello(acc="ibm",backendinput="ibmq_qasm_simulator"):
xacc.Initialize(["--compiler","quil"])
accelerator = acc
backend = backendinput
if name == "main":
@chMoussa Thanks for filing this issue. We're going to look into it today and see what we find. It may be that the Pip wheels need to be updated.
@chMoussa Your code ran successfully for me. I built XACC and the plugins from source, though, so I will try using pip and get back to you in a bit.
@chMoussa The xacc-ibm code currently on PyPI is outdated. We tried pip installing the latest version of the xacc-ibm plugin and your program worked, so we'll release the updated version to PyPI soon. Once we do that, you can run pip install -U xacc-ibm to upgrade.
@chMoussa I have uploaded an updated xacc-ibm wheel to PyPi. You can now run
Let us know if that gets rid of your bug.
Note you should see it upgrade to version 0.1.1
What is the new name?

Hey Charles,
Notice that you don't have the IBM plugin installed (does not say 'Installed plugin 'xacc-ibm-'). Also notice that your XACC install is in your ~/.local/ directory, so you installed the XACC wheel with --user. If you run pip install xacc --user, then you must run all plugin installs with --user.
I suggest
You should see that it downloads and install version 0.1.1.
I run the pip upgrade and it told me it was upgraded to 0.1.1.
But anyway I run your last commands and I finally got rid of the segmentation fault.
Can we do the same for rigetti ?

Hey @chMoussa I have updated the rigetti wheels as well. Go ahead and try to uninstall what you have and then run
Only pass --user if that is what you passed for XACC.
Note the version that you should see for rigetti is 0.1.3
Working well now thanks
