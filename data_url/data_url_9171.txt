Trying to install thewalrus with "pip install thewalrus" fails when using python 3.9.
Expected behavior: (What you expect to happen)
Clean install.
Actual behavior: (What actually happens)

I suspect this isn't necessary as the issue is lack of a wheel for python 3.9
Reproduces how often: (What percentage of the time does it reproduce?)
Every time.
System information: (include operating system version, Python version,
how you installed The Walrus, and anything else that might be relevant)
Python 3.9.1.
Windows 10.0.19041
Hi @SebCurrie --- You are correct, we have not made any releases for Python 3.9.
@SebCurrie adding support for Python 3.9 is on our todo list; in the meantime, I recommend downgrading to 3.8 (you can make a new  3.8 environment if using anaconda).
Alternatively, if you would like to have pip compile The Walrus from source using 3.9, you will need to make sure Cython is installed (pip install cython), and the C++ library Eigen is available on your system - there are some instructions for downloading eigen on the readme.
@nquesada @josh146 Thanks for the quick responses. I'm glad to hear there's support coming for python 3.9, and I've found a workaround for now. I can close the issue now, or leave open until the python 3.9 release, I'll leave it up to you. Cheers!
Glad to hear @SebCurrie ðŸ™‚ Letâ€™s leave it open until we have 3.9 support ready, so that others are aware.
As of the latest 0.15 release, The Walrus now supports Python 3.9 :)
