Hi, is anyone working on this issue ?
@taalexander if you still would like some help on this, I'd like to work on it.
The need for this has been removed with @nkanazawa1989 #4643. Thank you for your interest in contributing, please take a look at other good first issues.
Got it! :-)
Yeah, I have been going through the list of "good first issues"... is there any other open issue you'd recommend, where I could help? Maybe a high priority one?
This one may be a good first issue and is a high-priority to me #4872.
Sounds good to me, I can take care of it!
