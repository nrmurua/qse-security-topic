I am new in the field of QC Simulators and found Quest to be interesting. Can somebody guide me on how to implement Grover's Algorithm on Quest.
Hi there,
I've added an example of Grover's search here. All questions and feedback welcome! I hope to add several more examples before releasing QuEST v3.3.0 within the week.
