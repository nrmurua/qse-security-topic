Currently, the CMake CI has to be trigger manually on demand. With two build systems available, there is a risk of divergence between the two (see for example #2574).
Should builds in CI be triggered automatically, to prevent such divergences?

Yes, it should. I'll take care of it.
An alternative would be to write a script that scans the source tree and generates src/CMakeLists.txt.
The CI would then ensure that the checked in version is up-to-date.
We already use this approach in two other places.
It should be the developer responsibility to actually add the relevant lines in the CMakeLists.txt as it is easy to get the syntax of the CMakeLists.txt wrong (a missing '>' for instance) and second avoid including files that the dev does not want to be included.
I think make pretty sorts the list so the dev does not have to think about this. A script is useful to check if the CMakeLists.txt contains the src/*.F files though but I do not know if a cmake parser exists.
