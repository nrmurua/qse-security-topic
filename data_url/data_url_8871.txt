shortest_graphlike_error should produce helpful error messages in specific, common, stupid cases:
I could take or leave the last one, because hypothetically someone might find a use for say inserting only a few errors in a detectorless circuit and trying to find if they ever touched an observable?
Probably should do this for find_undetectable_logical_error as well
