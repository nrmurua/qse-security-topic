Hello,
I've updated QISKit to v. 0.7.0 but now, when I try to import circuits and registers via
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
I'm geting an import error
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
ImportError: cannot import name 'QuantumCircuit' from 'qiskit' (unknown location)
which occurrs in my PyCharm and in Anaconda Prompt. I tried changing import from above to
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
and the error changed to
from qiskit.qasm import _qasm
ImportError: cannot import name '_qasm' from 'qiskit.qasm' (unknown location),
but it still doesn't work. QISKit reinstallation didn't help.
What should I do or what am I doing wrong?
Hi, I had the same problem and to solve it I have to uninstall qiskit first and then reinstall (instead of upgrading). It is not due to qiskit-tutorial. Would you mind trying it first?
I will post the issue to qiskit-terra too.
Hi Ray,
it seems to have done the trick. Thanks.
Hi @rraymondhp and @Tomev
I have the same problem... which version do you have now?
I have python 3.7.1 and Qiskit: 0.7
ImportError: cannot import name 'IBMQ' from 'qiskit' (/Users/parfait/anaconda3/envs/Qiskitenv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/qiskit/init.py)
Many thanks
Hi,
I am having the same problem. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling qiskit, but it has not worked. I previously had it working but after some updates I am getting:
ImportError: cannot import name 'QuantumCircuit' form 'qiskit' (unknown location)
I am using Python 3.7.2 and qiskit 0.7.0.
EDIT: I just now realize the more relevant discussion can be found here Qiskit/qiskit#1599
The above link is the problem I was experiencing. I can delete this comment if needed, but I will leave it up unless otherwise requested.
