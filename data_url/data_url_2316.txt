Stable is usually behind latest which can cause some confusion depending on which version you are reading and whether or not you are using cirq-dev or cirq-release.
See: #1995
Hi, @vtomole,
As I was working on #2542, I realized this problem. So I can fix this one too (please kindly assign it to me).
When you say "mention", you mean in the document page (i.e. https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/(latest||stable)/tutorial.html), or in Cirq's README.rst? Or somewhere else?
If it's in README.rst, #2549 is a fix.
We should mention it on the README.
#2549 was merged, so we can close this
