Prior to release, all documentation should be reviewed for consistency with the current state of the code. Any example code in documentation (e.g. scripts, sample qsim/qsimh invocations) must be verified to work as written, such that a new user can copy-paste them directly into their shell and run without modifying the command.
@iamvamsikrishnad, one item explicitly requested in the email thread was documentation for setup.py - could you write something up? I think the main things we need to cover are any prerequisites for building the package and what each part of the build script is doing.

Disregard this, I was mis-remembering the thread. The request is for a description + long description for the package in setup.py, which I think you're already looking into.
Documentation was updated in #27. The only remaining item here is the descriptions for the PyPI package.
