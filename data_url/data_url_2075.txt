Hi,
When you try to create new gates using cirq.SingleQubitGate (in my particular case, dimension=3), pow() is not supported to create inverse operations.
I believe the only types of gates pow() works with out of the box are EigenGates. If you modify your gate class to inherit from EigenGate, pow() should start to work. The reason for this behavior is that raising a matrix to a general (non-integer) power isn't unique and although integer powers are unique, they are not special cased. EigenGate lets you specify the behavior of each Eigenspace of your operator so that raising the Gate/Operation to any real power is well defined.
Thanks for the response! I'll try this out.
