To work outside the jupyter notebook I am writing a simple widget similar to the subprocess widget. The widget is nearly complete, but I need to connect it to updates from the qcodes framework.
Currently I use a simple thread which calls station.snapshot() (see code below). What would be the preferred way to do this in Qcodes? I would like to update at least the values of parameters of all instruments.
This issue falls along some discussions I had here with @guenp.
And it is a great example for why we would like to have broadcast-messages from the stations / servers / whatever that is that runs in the background.
The idea:
On every data change at max some timestep the server should broadcast new values for instruments and status values, ala ZMQ or MQTT or related (One or more publishers, and one or more subscribers) Then whoever is interested could listen to all or specific data.
Which would allow you to have the widget as you describe without actively pulling data from the server.
Furthermore this could allow for safety measures, while the fridge broadcasts temperature and pressure and 'save-to-use-magnet'-data the magnet could listen and behave correspondingly, at the same time another status monitor could send me an sms...
API/hooks required so that subprocess widget can be used outside of the notebook environment.
