We need to make sure we have a documentation about the visualization. I think we can make this is the qiskit/basis and then convert here in sphinx
I have a WIP patch in progress starting this process here: Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#380
I need to write ones for plot_histogram() and plot_state() too
Lets put the plot_histogram and plot_state in a different tutorial.
Added a pr for the second one Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#388
