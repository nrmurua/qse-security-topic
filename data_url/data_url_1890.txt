Description of the issue
Quimb fails with version 1.2.0.  We should either require 1.3 or (ideally) fix whatever was broken in 1.2
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
cirq from HEAD and quimb == 1.2.0
It fails in rank_simplify. I think the fix is this line: jcmgray/quimb@4922015#diff-382c633ca92381427ca0bc74c1ac3081R3361 (line 3361 of tensor_core)
One option is to comment out state_vector.py:150 which calls rank_simplify. It's possible EITHER that (1) this will cause performance to deteriorate in a major way for gridlike circuits because lots of things can be fused ahead of any true contraction OR (2) contract already finds a path that does this so it's fine.
Instead of truly investigating this, I say we set the requirements to >=1.3.0 and if someone is desperate to use 1.2.0 they can patch out that specific line. What do you think?
So, it looks like this doesn't quite work in our favorite environment, since it looks like the version number is not super well specified.  Maybe it got pulled from master or something:
This is the error:
"invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0+unknown'"
I think it is fine for it to assume unknown versions are not compatible, but it should not error out.
