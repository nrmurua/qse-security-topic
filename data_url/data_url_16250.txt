There are some bugs drawing measurements in the circuit timeline drawer. Taking a simple circuit and a backend to schedule on:
The following scenarios have various errors...
1- One measurement with show_clbits=False
KeyError: Clbit(ClassicalRegister(2, 'c'), 0)
2- One measurement with show_clbits=True
The clbit measure seems off and starts earlier than the qubit measure.

3- Two measurement with show_clbits=False
TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'NoneType'
4- Two measurements with show_clbits=True
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'repeat'
Thanks for reporting this. I was aware of this issue 2 but the clbits are bit problematic because they are not transpiled with t0 nor delay (thus it always starts at t=0). In principle the program parser of the drawer parses the program for each bit and we need to update this logic to infer correct t0 of measurement instruction on clbits.
I need to investigate show_clbits bugs, but if there is anyone interested in solving this I'm also happy to review.
Ok the clbits may be a bit harder so if we could at least fix the case where we just plot the qubits (issue 1 and 3) then that will at least allow us to plot basic circuit timelines (we set show_clbits=False by default)
