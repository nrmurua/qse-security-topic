On the webpage
https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/hardware.html

See the annotated screenshot.

Access the website https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/hardware.html and scroll down to the section titled Quantinuum > Submission from C++
The quantinuum hardware should be targeted instead of ionq
