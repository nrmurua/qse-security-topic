Running a psmp regression tester for the current CP2K trunk version using the LeakSanitizer (gcc-7.5.0, openSUSE 15.2) returns the following messages
It is not clear to me, if these are real leaks or false positives caused by a buggy gcc LeakSanitizer.
These are well-known and on the compiler side. At the moment we suppress the reporting of these leaks.
@pseewald I have some vague memory of a discussion about this being a false-positive/compiler-optimization thing. The leak seems to be introduced by the compiler-generated copy-function.
