Description of the issue
I've seen this on #4157 and #4171 - for some reason the changed notebook tests just fails without any logs - claiming that the tests were running for 47 minutes. Both of these branches create new modules. Maybe something is wrong with the test collection there?

Locally it seems to pass.
It's not a flake...it seems to persist. It seems like Github Actions is timing out, given that this runs locally without an issue and the error is always 47 minutes.
The root of the problem is that all the notebooks are executed when any requirements.txts change. This is too broad a behavior - as the isolated notebook tests only tests notebooks against the stable releases.
I will restrict this behavior to only dev-tools requirements changes (dev_tools/requirements) - and while this is logically a sound behavior, it seems that we need to shard the notebook execution to avoid timeouts.
