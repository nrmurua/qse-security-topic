I do not seem to find the documentation of qiskit.optimization.applications.ising.common and this has been given in the portfolio optimization tutorial - https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/finance/01_portfolio_optimization.html and also gives no error when I use it.
Basically,
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/master/qiskit/optimization/applications/ising/common.py - The documentation of this is not generated.
This file should mention common in auto summary
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/master/qiskit/optimization/applications/ising/__init__.py
