Hi there while using the parser we notice the following circuit excerpt fails to parse
It seems like there are couple of unspecified cases in the logic to handle binary expressions?
That particular failure is slightly different; that's because the input OQ3 (that looks like Qiskit generated it) is not valid - it attempts to interact integers with floats (3 - _x_0_), which isn't allowed.  I'll move this over to the Qiskit repository because strictly it's a bug against the exporter.
That said, we currently don't have a path to fixing this with the current ParameterExpression model of Qiskit; those are symbolic parameters, and our current method of exporting them is pretty much "call str and hope for the best", because it's very difficult to work with the sympy/symengine tree in a coherent manner.
The way we will be moving with this is likely a pivot away from the ParameterExpression as the "default" type of parameter in favour of the explicit runtime expressions and variables (where appropriate) - see #10922 - and ParameterExpression will be more for places where a symbolic expression is required, with them expected to be resolved before attempting to interoperate with OpenQASM 3, etc.  The story on this isn't fully fleshed out, though.
Is this the same reason why loading a gate definition where a float is multiplied by a parameter does not work?
E.g. the following snippet cannot be imported if the RZ angle is float * parameter but it works correctly for int * parameter. I'm a bit confused about this, since it is only an issue in a gate definition. Using rz(float * parameter) outside works fine.
Here's a snippet:
