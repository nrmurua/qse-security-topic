Installed toqito via pip and tried to run pytest in the root dir and in specific folder:
ImportError while importing test module '/Users/bchass/Documents/Forks/toqito/toqito/rand/tests/test_random_ginibre.py'. Hint: make sure your test modules/packages have valid Python names.

I've reinstalled the package and tried to install with setup.py instead which yields the same results.
Pip list for the virtual env:
I'm not sure what I'm missing, but all tests throw an error.
The version of toqito on the PyPi server is going to be different than the one pulled down via GitHub. Specifically, the toqito.random path is now toqito.rand
You'll want to install toqito within the root of the project as:
Then you should be able to:

I see. I did a fresh install with pip install -e . and I'm still getting the same results. But if I do from toqito.rand import random_unitary in a python shell, it works just fine. This leads me to believe the virtual env is the culprit.
Some interesting discoveries - during the process of pip install -e ., cvx was never installed. Due to this, it also indicated pytest, pytest-cov, and scikit-image were not installed either automatically. Once I manually installed these packages, I was then able to install cvx manually and pytest is now working correctly.

@Bchass Yes, we are aware of this. #207 (comment)
Using poetry for installing toqito won't cause problems like this.
Closing this as the issue appears to be resolved partially. The unresolved portion has an open issue.
