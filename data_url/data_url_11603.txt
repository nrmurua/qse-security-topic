Running the PySCFDriver for three H atoms gives the following error
QiskitChemistryError: 'Failed electronic structure computation'
from qiskit.chemistry.drivers import PySCFDriver, UnitsType
atom = 'H 0 0 0; H 0 0 1; H 0 0 2'
driver = PySCFDriver(atom=atom,  unit=UnitsType.ANGSTROM,  charge=0,  spin=1,  basis='sto3g')
molecule = driver.run() 
This problem is reproducible for odd numbers of H atoms. For even numbers the driver runs fine. E.g. if one changes atom = 'H 0 0 0; H 0 0 1; H 0 0 2; H 0 0 5' with spin=0 the above code is fine.
No error, as this is a valid structure for the pysfc lib.
E.g. the same atomic config works using pyscf.
from pyscf import gto, scf
atom = 'H 0 0 0; H 0 0 1; H 0 0 2'
mol = gto.M(atom=atom, basis='sto3g',spin=1)
mf = scf.RHF(mol)
mf.kernel()
output
converged SCF energy = -1.03890122510099
The error is thrown on lines 79 of  /qiskit/chemistry/drivers/pyscfd/integrals.py, but the issue seems to be in the indices of the Einstein summation on line 210.
A pdb trace gives the following error in debugmode:
*** ValueError: operand has more dimensions than subscripts given in einstein sum, but no '...' ellipsis provided to broadcast the extra dimensions.
