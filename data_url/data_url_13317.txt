The function fold_gates_at_random may return a (folded) quantum circuit that does not use the same qubits as the original circuit.
Use the about() function to summarize information on operating system, python version and dependencies.

This is probably a consequence of #1085 that did not appear in my search for related issue. I will edit the issue description and will let maintainers decide if this should be closed.
Thanks @nelimee! This is indeed an example of the existing issue #1085, so I am closing this issue to avoid duplication.
Meanwhile, placing an identity gate on the idle qubit may be a workaround to avoid the problem.
