After uploading the arxiv paper, we could add a Cite page in the documentation, with reference to the paper, a bibtext snippet to copy-paste from code-block directive, and highlight this page in the top menu bar, after the change log and/or the references page.
I am actually going to add this page now, and then update it with the arXiv paper reference later.
