I am writing the teleportation program. The message seems to be teleported correctly (just need to add the correction gates only), but i get the wrong results when I measure the 0th and 1st qubits. Even though I get the correct waveform for the result, when I measure the qubits, I get different values.  Here is my teleportation program:
When I run the program, I don't usually get the right results. Some wrong results that I get:
Which I think is incorrect because both should return [1,1].
hey @rasa97, I'm not quite sure why you're having that issue with the [0,1] classical addresses. I also wrote up the teleportation program and it seems to work for me -- let me know what you think:
@rasa97 I think what you are noticing is that the wavefunction call actually includes the projections caused by the measurements commands that you make.  For example, if you look at the wavefunction of your program before measurement (rather than after):
You will see:
Which has components across all the different bit strings for the zeroth and first qubits.  Does that help?
Thank you for the answers!
I was able to resolve my issue by removing the qvm.run command. Instead, I typed in:
I understand that I made the mistake of measuring two different wavefunctions (one during qvm.run() and the next during qvm.wavefunction() )
