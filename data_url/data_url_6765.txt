Hi!
I have the following program :
The exported cirq program is as follows:
The gate cu1 does not belong to cirq's gate set and hence will result in an error if I try to run this program in cirq. cu1 or better still crz with an angle pi/2 (since cr2 is a controlled-RZ rotation with angle pi/2)  needs to be defined in order to make the program work. Same goes for cr4 and cr8.
Another issue I came across was with the gate crz. If I have the following program:
This outputs the following cirq program:
The used gate is crz which is also defined but the circuit is created with cu1. I think the circuit should be created with crz.
I will raise a PR with changes that I think will solve these issues. :)
Till then, please let me know if I am missing something or if there could be some other workaround. :)
