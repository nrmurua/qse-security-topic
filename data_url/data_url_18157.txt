The stable branch is ahead of master, which is not a good practice.
Make sure that stable only accepts changes that passed the tests. Also, master should be ahead of stable, and stable is behind master.
This branch is 20 commits ahead, 51 commits behind master. 
It's not a good practice, totally agree! But there are times when this is can occur temporarily, as is the case right now. We had to fix something in stable to quickly release a new version, this has broke synchrony between master and stable.
There's a new PR #407 intended to improve this situation though.
The changes are synced, and there is no conflict. We are temporarily holding some files around for various backward compatibility reasons. The situation will improve in a few weeks when we won't have to anymore.
