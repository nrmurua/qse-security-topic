Hi!
Even though Pulser is a python package, on first glance it seems that a large portion of the software is .ipynb files as opposed to .py files. This gives a false impression of the package being written in jupyter notebooks.
Not that it matters, I'm just being pedantic but would be nice to consider adding a .gitattributes file.
If one agrees, I'll be more than happy to open a PR for the same.

Not at all, I agree. Thanks for the suggestion, feel free to proceed with the PR.
Fixed in 698d1c6.
