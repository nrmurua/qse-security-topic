Describe the feature you'd like
When submitting a task/job it would be good to distinguish an python exceptions from Validation from other possible exceptions that can occur during the submission, for example:
which would error if discretized_ahs_program wasn't the correct type of object or shots wasn't an integer, or other failure modes that live deeper inside of AWS software stack that I am not aware of.
How would this feature be used? Please describe.
I would like to be able to safely saving validation errors without having to worry about catching non-validation errors.
Describe alternatives you've considered
I could parse the error message to check if it follows a particular format consistent with a Validation error.
Nvm, I just read the boto3 docs and I think I found the exception that I need.
