qiskit-terra version 0.6 supports setting noise parameters. It will be better if we can provide a tutorial on how to set the parameters, and how to use them to model noises.
When we do, we can link to it in answer to this.
This is noted in the #294 but it will take some time to make the tutorial.
Thanks! My colleagues in Keio and I will work on it asap.
I would rather wait until aer is out as we have not decided on the interface.
Okay, we will wait for aer. As it has already been considered, I am closing this issue.
