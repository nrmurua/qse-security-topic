I actually think the labels are probably there, but the visualization is getting clipped, either when the the latex is compiled or less likely when we convert the pdf to a png. This is not the first bug like this we've encountered (it seems like every refactor of the latex code introduces something like this).
I just tested this again, it looks like it's been fixed (probably by: #3243)
