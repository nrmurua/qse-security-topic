Installing ignis from source works, and the egg is in the site-packages dir, but the module fails to be found:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit.ignis'
try to import module
This also breaks the latest aqua as it seems they depend on ignis now by default.
I'm not able to reproduce this. I installed ignis from scratch in a venv with:
That being said I can't really do anything with it because we need to update the requirements to say it needs terra>=0.8 now since it's using all the quantum_info stuff now so when I try to run anything from the import it will raise an ImportError from terra.
So I did python setup.py install and it can not be found.  The latest Aqua master also fails to load because it cannot find the ignis module.  At least on OSX, the installed egg looks like a document and not a folder to the OS, so even though the file is there, it does not look like a module to Python.
This is resolved by zip_safe=False in setup
