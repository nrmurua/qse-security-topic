To follow through with our plan to deprecate qiskit.opflow, we need a clear migration guide, and most likely a new documentation sub-section called migrations (@1ucian0).
I am currently working on this guide on a fork of the documentation repo, and will open a PR once the content is complete. In the meantime, you can track the progress of the current WIP document here.
While we're still deploying the Terra documentation via the metapackage, this might need a little bit of extra infrastructure on that side as well because there's an assumption there that all the docs we want to display are stored in docs/apidocs in Terra (our build process is suboptimal haha).  It won't be too hard to do if we need to, though.
