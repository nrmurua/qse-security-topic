For these larger circuits see #4148 we need to have a simplified output. I would suggest if we get rid of the double line from the measurement and put the classical register number below the measurement box or in it and then on the classical register implement a black dot or arrow
to say that that a measurement has been assigned to this bit (or register). See my great PowerPoint art.

The only issue we have is if two measurements are assigned to the same bit what does this mean.  For example,

In general, a user should never do this but if we have this then we add a second arrow when the second measurement must occur after the first.
ℹ️ The behaviour in the screenshot is reproducible. I didnt quite understand the part where we need to add a second arrow when the second measurement must occur after the first so I just added the code and screenshot to make life easier :> Maybe this can be reassigned to another elf? :>


Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
Sorry for being confusing. I am proposing we need a new visual element when drawing quantum circuits that if measurements are done at the same depth location all the measurements can be combined so the circuit visualization does not take up too much space.
