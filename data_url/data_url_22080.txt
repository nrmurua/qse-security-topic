Error 1 is typo in artiq_corelog
Error 2 is arguments -p and --bind which are not supported by artiq_corelog.
This is not a typo. aqctl_corelog runs artiq.frontend.aqctl_corelog - the core device logging controller
@cjbe Thanks for the heads up. I see that controllers are now renamed in v3. (artiq/doc/manual/_build/html/release_notes.html). For some reason I did have aqctl_lda but not aqctl_corelog in anaconda3/envs/artiq3test4/bin. So I thought artiq_session was still using artiq_corelog.
I created a fresh conda environment, reinstalled artiq. aqctl_corelog is now where it should be. Resolved.
