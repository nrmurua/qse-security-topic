As discussed in #262, there is some kind of an import issue related to the functions in matrix_props.
Based on this discussion's example, the way is_square and is_hermitian are used among different functions in matrix_props could be causing circular import issues.

Specifically, in choi_to_kraus, the import at the line below is calling is_hermitian when is_psoitive_semidefinite also uses is_hermitian. Maybe this import is creating issues?


In addition, the below line's from some_module import some_func as another_name is most definitely an issue of how the functions are being imported in matrix_props.

Another possibility for the import issues is the functions and their files have the same name.
Without the hacky changes introduced in 4cd69fd and 532325a, tests fail due to kraus_to_choi and choi_to_kraus import errors.
1-5 were fixed by specifying the full import path.
6 failed to pass after specifying the full import path due to a circular import issue as stated in the issue description.
Try to use defer import: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1556429
Closing this issue as the problem is not related to matrix_props as I previously thought.
