Currently, the diagonalization of the propagator matrix in order to get floquet eigenstates is not accurate, since the eig function from scipy provides the right eigenvectors only, which are not guaranteed to be orthonormal.
This issue was discussed in a numpy thread here, and it seems (from my own experience, too) that using a Schur decomposition improves things dramatically.
Use scipy.linalg.schur for diagonalizing unitary matrices.
