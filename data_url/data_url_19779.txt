Qiskit/qiskit#243
@yaelbh can you check the changes I made to the measurement doc
@dcmckayibm - I think that the options seed_offset and align_cliffs should also be added to the RB tutorial: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/ignis/randomized_benchmarking.ipynb
Would you like me to add them?
I made them last night jn Qiskit/qiskit#243, thanks @ShellyGarion . Check them over if you have a chance.
