In transpiler. _transpiler.py, the transpile method invokes the run() method of the transpiler pass.  However, it does so only for side effects and ignores the return value.
See here
Use the value returned by run() as the new dag for subsequent passes.
Modify the above linked line to :
or similar.   The current implementation forces transpiler passes to modify the dag in place, which is restrictive.  OTOH it would be easy for passes which do modify the dag in place to accommodate the change.
The transpiler is being redone in #825, these comments would be very welcome there.
Thanks for responding.  This is a relatively minor change -- does it have to wait for the major overhaul described in #825 ?
Closing in favour of #825
