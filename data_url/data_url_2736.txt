It seems the rot_11_layer function in the tutorial is not doing what it is supposed to do.
In particular the second loop over the column terms does not conjugate by X operators.
Also the discussion of big endian needs to be better explained.
Also the reshaping for the fold function is wrong.
Fixed in #839
