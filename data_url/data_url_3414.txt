The example does not work with ProtoQuil, which is why it throws an error when using it like
since local_qvm starts quilc with the -P switch
As far as I can tell that is expected because LABEL doesn't seem to be part of ProtoQuil?
Is there a specification what ProtoQuil supports?
When running quilc without the -P option the program compiles like a charme.
Would it make sense to point out that with local_qvm()/-P/ProtoQuil doesn't work for this example because of the ProtoQuil issue?
Or maybe even drop the -P switch here?

I think the better solution would be to make local_qvm() more configurable! (IMO that function should also be renamed, since it manages both qvm and quilc servers.)
That sounds better!
Would be glad to propose something if you don't mind
