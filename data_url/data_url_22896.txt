Hello
Your library is so amazing and I woud like to know if it is possible to realize that the parameters of PID module can modify spontaneously according to the input to make the cavity more stable.And I am wondering that the code of which part should be modified if that is possible,the v file in FPGA or the py file in pyrpl?
Thank you so much!
