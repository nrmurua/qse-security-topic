This is some sort of follow up from #875.
It seems that, at some point, we broke circuit.definitions:
I think this is due to #1781 as this removed the gate definitions from the DAG, so when the AST is converted into a DAG the information about gate definitions is lost as it is no longer copied across.
A simple solution would be to create a definitions variable on DAGCircuit which is the same as AstInterpreter.gates and QuantumCircuit.definitions, but this rather defeats the point of #1781.
Thanks for hunting it down. Was that the intention @ajavadia ?
If #2014 gets merged., this can be closed.
