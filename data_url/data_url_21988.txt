Using Windows 10 artiq 3.2
Could you add the output of conda list?
Output of conda list in question.  Did I somehow end up with artiq 2.5?  I used "git checkout 3.2" on the cloned repository when creating my environment.
Conda installed packages and your git checkout are completely independent of each other. Also, artiq-dev 3+ is not available on Windows because we do not build the Rust components for it.
What are you trying to do exactly that you install artiq-dev?
Was trying to get around the artiq_flash issue #894 with the help of jbqubit by installing from source.
Just specify the binaries directory explicitly.
Explicitly giving path to binaries directory didn't work either.
