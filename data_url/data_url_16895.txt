I have tried to correct the irregularities in the width of wide gates like u2 and u3 in #3486 .
Hi @TharrmashasthaPV ! Does #3486 fixes this issue?
Hi @1ucian0 . Yes, the width of the gate boxes has been corrected so that it properly contains 'U3' and its parameters without having redundant extra spaces.
Great! I'm updating it. Thanks!
