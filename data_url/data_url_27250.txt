I slightly changed SIDH.h and makefile to build the web version using emscripten.
My changes here:
https://github.com/procoru/PQCrypto-SIDH/commit/539c0f2d5e14682d3cf1a893e4753423e0ce592a
Demo here: http://sidh.getforge.io/
Would like to express my extreme interest in this. Would a Node module be a possibility?
The link doesn't seem to work anymore.
