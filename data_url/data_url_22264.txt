Using 2.0.dev+563.gc4559fc on windows,
I get the following error,
If both functions get inputs of the same type, for example,
It runs fine and I just get the output I expect,
If I take off the @kernel decorator for the function I also have no issues.
Kernels must always be called with the same types.
Even in a case like this?
That gives me a similar error.
Yes, because the compiler processes your whole run function (not just the branch that ends up executed), since it's a kernel.
Okay, good to know, thanks.
