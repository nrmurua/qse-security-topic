Hi, I am trying to measure and simulate a circuit multiple times via statevector_simulator backend. I expect the first measurement to collapse the state, and subsequent measurement results should always return the same state. However, I see random outcomes.
This is expected - every time you run the circuit again, it starts from the beginning with a new random seed, so the measurement can collapse the state in different ways.  If you want multiple measurements in your circuit, you need to put them all in place before running the circuit for the first time.
Thanks for your response. For my particular use case, I was able to use it by passing the same simulator_seed for multiple simulator calls for the same circuit.
