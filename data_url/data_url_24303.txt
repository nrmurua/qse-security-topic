Extract splote of Y curves for BBQ
leverage existing code if possible
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.0587.pdf

Will need functionality to turn the imported data from the renderer (eg. Ansys) into a numpy array for easy use of numpy.gradient and numpy.imag.

Can I use the above to calculate the dimensionless bosonic annihilation (creation)
operator a_p and then just dagger it?

If so, what is our q?
Hanhee clarified that BBQ only works on a single qubit, and thinks EPR does that better.  Moving to backlog.
