Current issues:
slow start up of the video mode window (with keysight system, upload should be fast?)
digitizer cashes when switching from 1D to 2D window. Or when doing a measurement in beween that is not video mode.
video mode often crashes the whole python session, unclear why this happens (could be related to the triggering).
resolution argument for 1D scans does not work.
No support for virtual gates?
no clear way of setting time per point. setting the sample rate of the digitizer is not the way
QTT Videomode has been replaced by new tools. Closing the issue
