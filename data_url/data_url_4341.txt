I think an interesting feature we may consider including in Qibo is that of changing simulation precision not only between complex128 and complex64, but also enabling float64 and/or float32 in some cases.
This can be interesting for circuits where only real gates apply (e.g. Ry rotations and CZ), which happen sometimes in real-world applications, as in the case of the Text Quantum Classifier or the circuits studied by Carlos et al. in Scaling of variational quantum circuit depth for condensed matter systems.
