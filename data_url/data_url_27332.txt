Currently, BigInteger math is used for field mathematics. We should consider switching to a faster implementation:
Preferably, ASM math should not be used to avoid portability issues with the library.
We should be able to port the go-sike math implementation to Java which has good performance:
The algorithm will need to change slightly to accommodate new low level math.
Implemented in #10.
