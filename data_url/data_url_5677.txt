Performance degradation due to #1717 is happened in 0.12.0.
#1717 provides pybind for AER::Config. This class will help simulation of circuits that use param_binds (such as in Primitive), but not for general circuits. AER::Config lists all items for configuration even though which are not used in a specified simulation method.
Run circuits with small qubits.

The above results were measured with following codes:
No regression.
Not list all configuration items.
