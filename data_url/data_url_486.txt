We currently have a very old Quil Antlr Parser. We need to update that and ensure we have translation support too. We also have a QuilC Compiler implementation which will take Quil source files and run it through the docker image for compiling with quilc. We can treat that as an IRTransformation eventually, since it is an optimizing compiler.
So my goals would be:
Want to replace https://github.com/eclipse/xacc/blob/master/quantum/plugins/rigetti/compiler/QuilCompiler.hpp and use latest grammar file from https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/blob/7210fbe56290121c44da97b9ec6eea032fcdb612/pyquil/_parser/Quil.g4
