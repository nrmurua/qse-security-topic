Running pip install -e ".[braket]" (or pip install -e ".[braket,qiskit]") fails with a dependency error from pip.
Run pip install -e ".[braket]" in a fresh conda environment.
The Braket extras should install without error.
Perhaps braket or boto3 needs to be updated. Not sure.
It seems like this has been resolved in recent PRs. Closing this, until we encounter it again.
