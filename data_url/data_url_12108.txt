A user starting at the 1_start_here tutorial will probably go to the first link suggested: 1_getting_started_with_qiskit. At the end of 1_getting_started_with_qiskit, there is no link back to the table of contents in 1_start_here, nor is there a link to the next tutorial in the sequence (2_plotting_data_in_qiskit).  It would be helpful to give the learner some idea where to go next.
This applies to all the notebook tutorials.
Is there a way to jump to a spot in a jupyter notebook, rather than to the top?  Then we could send people to the table of contents found midway through the 1_start_here notebook, rather than make them scroll for it every time.
There is. You can see the way the TOC works in the fundamental notebooks and how it links to a div id

Cool, I got that to work by copying the paragraph symbol link at the end of a section title.
This is no longer needed as jumping to sections in a notebook is automatic when they are rendered in the docs.
