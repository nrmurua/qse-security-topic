Parsing RZ(beta-theta) 0 where beta and theta are the names of declared memory regions yields the parameter expression <MRef beta-theta[0]>, but it should be Sub(<MRef beta[0]>, <MRef theta[0]>)
For better or worse, this is intentional: Quil symbol names, like Lisp symbol names, are allowed to have hyphens in their middle. If parameter expression regurgitation is returning bad expressions (like beta-gamma) where it should be returning good expressions (like (beta)-(gamma)), then that's another matter.
@lcapelluto Were you able to run into this issue purely using pyQuil without writing inline Quil?
@tarballs-are-good yes:
p += RZ(beta-theta, 0) -> RPCErrorError: Reference to unknown memory region beta-theta
However, p += RZ(beta[0]-theta[0], 0) works fine.
Then it sounds like the serializer should space things out or add brackets.
