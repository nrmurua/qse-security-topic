The goal of this issue is to resolve #242 and #259.
Currently, pip install qsimcirq requires building qsim locally. This is fine for Linux, but (as seen in the issues above) often encounters difficulty on MacOS and Windows. In order to resolve this, we need to replace the current packaging with a portable wheel as described by PEP 513.
Comment from @Strilanc: cross-platform wheels may be tricky. Consider looking into cibuildwheel, which is how Stim builds for Mac and Windows.
Stim doesn't use cibuildwheels to make the wheels, it uses cibuildwheels to verify that the source compiles on other platforms. You can use it to build the wheels, but I'm not confident they will generalize beyond the build machines when AVX instructions are involved.
This has been resolved.
