On 64-bit OS and 32-bit Python we still try to install penaltymodel-mip (which uses ortools), instead of penaltymodel-maxgap.
An alternative to automated fallback is adding a possibility of "manual override": to e.g. prefer penaltymodel-maxgap.
Default "extra" would solve this problem. Unfortunately, it's far from being available.
As of version penaltymodel 1.0.0 penaltymodel only has one factory that uses SciPy.
