Currently a Program can contain multiple ParameterSweeps, each of which calls for a certain number of repetitions. I presume that if there are multiple sweeps, we just run each sweep one after another and then return data from all of them.
However, the Result type has a single num_repetitions field and then a single list of ParameterizedResult values. We can't just concatenate results from different sweeps into this list because they might come from ParameterSweeps with different numbers of repetitions. I think we need to either need to limit programs to one sweep, or else have separate "SweepResult" messages for each sweep, something like:
Doh, yeah.  Though I'm not sure we get much by using another level of hierarchy for Sweep, I think we could just do it at the ParameterizedResult level.
