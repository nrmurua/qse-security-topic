I was thinking of creating a test sub folder to put all the test files there.
For now we have:
src/kex/test_kex.c
src/rand/test_rand.c
Test functions are returning 1 for success and 0 for failure.
When for e.g.
make test
is run it shows failure because it expects 0 for success.
The tests should answer 0 for success and 1 for failure - it works for me at least.
e.g. in src/rand/test_rand.c, we have
return (success == 1) ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE;
Right.
I have to merge latest changes to my branch from master.
