I want to use pyrpl to drive a LC retarder as a noise eater.  These need a symmetric square wave drive, I think.   But I cannot find a way to modulate the amplitude of a square wave with a PID output?  I only have one input and one output free.  I don't have the space for an external square generator and mixer.
