Hi.  On the first page of the Cirq tutorial:  https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html the rendered energy function appears corrupt.  Actually, the first two equations that appear have the same issue.  This seems to only be on the HTML page, not what is in the github repo.  The items circled below should be removed.

Thanks.
Hey @td2014 that is the stable version of the docs and this has been fixed on the latest https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html.
PS: That error will automatically be fixed on the next release. Thanks for opening up this issue!
