On the linked page: https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/blob/main/doc/gates.md#gates-supported-by-stim, I think it would be nice to categorize the list of gates (maybe similar to how it's done in the section below) so that the list of noise channels can be clearly distinguished from the list of unitary gates.
