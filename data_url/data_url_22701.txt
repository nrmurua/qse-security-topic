On occasions modifications to ARTIQ require compilation of a new bit file. Upon startup artiq_master should check to see if the Core Device is up to date. If not prompt user to run artiq_flash.sh.
This is complicated (due to the problem of tracking which bitfiles changes are incompatible and which are not). How important is that?
I don't think we have to do any meaningful tracking and versioning of the gateware interface/runtime API yet. As outlined on the mailing list, having the host-side code query the embedded gateware git hash, the bios git hash and the runtime git hash and compare against its own would go a long way. Then reduce the mismatch error from something fatal to a warning if the pdb entry for the core device has ignore_mismatch which you could use during development.
I suspect versioneer might come handy here.
Low priority IMHO. Feel free to label as such.
Let me take care of this one, will be an occasion to touch the new comms code.
