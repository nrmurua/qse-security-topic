ddd.insert_ddd_sequences causes qubit mismapping for specific Qiskit circuits.
example.qasm.txt
The bug is that in the original circuit, qubit 7 is used (and measured), while qubit 6 is inactive. While in the resulting circuit having been passed through ddd.insert_ddd_sequences, qubit 7 becomes inactive and qubit 6 is used. This can be seen in the rendered circuit drawings circuit1.pdf and circuit2.pdf generated by executing the above python code.
conda list:
Manually using from_qiskit to_qiskit is not the expected usage. The expected usage is directly applying  insert_ddd_sequences to qiskit circuits as discussed in #1396
I am closing this issue in favor of the main bug discussed in #1396 .
