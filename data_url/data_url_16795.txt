Is there a way for me to extract the value of the Parameter of the current running circuit? For example, without Parameter, I can:
and for example change the number of shots depend on the parameter theta. But with the way it's now:
I can't change it. I tried t, t_val, t_val for t_val in t_range etc. into the ???? but it didn't work. Is there any way I can do it?
Normally, to have an execute argument vary with the value of your Parameter, you can do:
However, shots is not a parameter that can change within a job. The first approach you mentioned would still work with Parameters, but will still require multiple jobs.
It seems to me that this is a use-case for Qiskit runtime. I'm closing this as an answered question. Consider reopening if my appreciation is wrong.
