The sequence sampler added by #345 deserves the following features
It would then be possible to use it in the simulation module and the _seq_drawer() function.
I would like to work in this issue
Hi @arthurfaria! Thank you for your interest. The sampler is currently being reworked in PR #388, so this issue is not up do date.
We'll update the sampler-related issue after #388, you might be interesting in working on it after that ðŸ˜ƒ.
Very cool to know you're interested, @arthurfaria ! It is as @lvignoli says, we're currently reworking the sampler. I can always ping you once that's done.
This issue actually encompasses multiple working points, are you interested in any one in particular?
Hi @HGSilveri and @lvignoli, thanks for the reply. Well, right now I am more interested in the simple ones. I have lately grown very interested in your open-source and working on an open good first issue would help me very much to grasp better the ideas behind it. So among those tasks, which one do you think is the best to start with?
Excellent idea! Where to start will depend mostly on your current experience. In general, I would probably recommend writing the notebook because it will only require that you understand the code and use it. What do you think @lvignoli ?
Alternatively, I think issue #135 would make for an interesting entry point as well.
Sure, writing an example notebook is the obvious entry point to the code.
Probably #135 is a safer route, since it does not rely on current WIP.
In any case @arthurfaria your contributions are welcomed ðŸ™‚.
alright! thanks a lot
@arthurfaria Can you please leave a comment on issue #367 so that I can assign it to you?
Of course: Hi!
Of course: Hi!
Thanks, but can you do it on that issue #367 instead? It is more focused on what you'll be doing
Update on this issue:
With that being said, I think we can consider this issue concluded, so I'll close it.
