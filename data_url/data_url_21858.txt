Sayma SAWG frequency0.set(240*MHz) produces nonsense. Frequencies below about 150*MHz produce sinusoids.

@sbourdeauducq Do you see this on your hardware?
As pointed out elsewhere by Tom and Robert, SAWG tests are not relevant until further JESD204 testing and debugging.
I don't see any symptoms on my board suggesting JESD204b problems. I do see reproducible nonsense out of SAWG. Please take a look @jordens on Sayma in HK. Some additional examples...

This exact same pattern repeats from run to run and from boot to boot. This isn't a JESD issue.

@jordens Still broken using 5b73dd8.
