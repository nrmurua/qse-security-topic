Greetings all,
I followed the installation steps for Pyquil and encountered no issues during the process. Was able to input my API Key and User ID (I checked to ensure I entered the details during config-setup properly) . Tried running some short code to test the installation.
from pyquil.quil import Program
from pyquil.api import QVMConnection
from pyquil.gates import H, CNOT, MEASURE
qvm = QVMConnection()
p = Program(H(0), CNOT(0,1), MEASURE(0,0), MEASURE(1,1))
results = qvm.run(p, classical_addresses=[0,1], trials=10)
Upon entering the last command line, my console returned the below error.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
results = qvm.run(p, classical_addresses=[0,1], trials=10)
File "C:\Users\UF532PL\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\pyquil\api\qvm.py", line 136, in run
response = post_json(self.session, self.sync_endpoint + "/qvm", payload)

raise UnknownApiError(str(body))
UnknownApiError: {'message': 'Forbidden'}
The server has failed to return a proper response. Please describe the problem
and copy the above message into a GitHub issue at:

Would appreciate any help I could get resolving this issue so I can get on with learning about quantum coding.
Regards,
Is this error still occurring?
