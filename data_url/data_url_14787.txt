Serialization decoding of a circuit with qpy fails when qargs for a delay are passed in as a set and len(qargs) > 1. The error raised here is
and when running the circuit on a device, the job will fail with something like:
This should run regardless of the cases described.

This is a bug with QuantumCircuit.delay rather than QPY - it's the same thing as #11208 going on, where the initial QuantumCircuit is in a totally invalid state that's somehow not noticed.  It's because of our old "friend" broadcasted arguments.
As an immediate work-around, turn the set into a list and the circuit will be valid (and roundtrip through QPY, etc).
