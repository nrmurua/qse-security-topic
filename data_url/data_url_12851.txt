All Tests fail for any Katas in a system that runs fine with the erstwhile Quantum repository.
This is by design. Each test covers one task; as long as the task is not attempted or solved incorrectly, the test will keep failing, and it will pass once the task is solved correctly. Running Kata Tests explains this in more detail.
Hope that helps!
Thanks. Closed.
