The dnorm tests are sporadically (quite regularly) failing e.g.
I suggest we turn them off by not installing cvxpy for any of the test configurations.
We can turn them on again if someone can make an attempt to make the dnorm tests more reliable @cgranade
I will raise a PR for this now.
This has been the final straw. We have tried to keep dnorm supported. See #872 and the suggestion in #874
