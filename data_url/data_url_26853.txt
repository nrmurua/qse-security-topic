There seems to be bug in mpich's configure script. When they call configure in test/mpi/dtpools it fails because it can't find mpicc (see below). While dtpools seems to be a new feature --disable-dtpools  does not help either. Then it simply fails somewhere else in the test suite because it can't find mpi.h.
I guess, this problem did not appear in the CI because there mpich was installed a second time. I don't have more time to spend on this. So, maybe someone else could have a look, or we simply rollback to mpich-3.2.1.
Any reasons to use mpich by default. I do not think this should be blocking anything else, so it might be worth rolling back to the previous version of mpich since it is independent of the toolchain to some extend.
Locally, I cannot reproduce that error, even if no other mpicc is around.
Yes, it must be some weird corner case that only occurs in the rather empty docker environment.
@mkrack, do you have docker available and want to further investigate or should we roll back for the time being?
I have docker on my linux box (openSUSE Leap 15.0) and I will have a look at that problem, but I don't want to block any further progress, i.e. feel free to rollback.
Seems to work now #273
