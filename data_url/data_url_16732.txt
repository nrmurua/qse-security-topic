Using Registers in QuantumCircuit(), all qubit labels in the plot done with draw() get the exection number (how many times draw was run) inside the label.

See explanation screenshot.
No execution number in qubit labels, so just q_0, q_1, ...
In the documentation the use of Registers in QuantumCircuit is even shown (is expected to work).

Hi @HTransistor , this looks like the expected behavior. Both QuantumRegister  and ClassicalRegister accept a  size and an optional name. If the name is empty, it will default to qN or cN where N is an increasing integer (so if you re-build a register, the name will change each time).
To get consistent register names, you can use e.g. qr = QuantumRegister(2, 'q'). This doesn't presently show up in the documentation of the Register classes, so leaving this open as a documentation bug.
Closing this as expected behavior. Feel free to reopen if disagree to continue the discussion here.
