The circuit drawers (certainly the text one, prob fail if there is a condition on a Clbit that is not in any registers.
This happens with output="mpl" and output="latex" as well.
No error.
This is related to a previous issue (#6475), which included a few PRs to the drawers (#6261, #6248, #6259) to add single-bit classical conditioning, but perhaps this was only considering the case of single-qubit conditioning, whereas this is one step further: registerless single-qubit conditioning.
@jakelishman I can take a look at this for all 3 drawers. Just doing a quick change on 'mpl' I got this. Not sure what a label should look like for this, but I guess _0 is reasonable.

Honestly, I have no opinion on the drawers, and I'm generally prepared to go with whatever label you suggest seems sensible. I guess as long as it in some way matches the wire's label on the very left edge I'm happy. Thanks for taking it!
