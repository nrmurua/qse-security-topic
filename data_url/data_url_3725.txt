Working in MacOS. Even after sudo pip install pyquil twice (uninstalled after first time, of course), I couldn't find any .pyquil_config file in my home directory.
I got a HTTPError: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://api.rigetti.com/qvm
Finally had to create .pyquil_config manually in my home directory and add that to my bash profile
export PYQUIL_CONFIG="$HOME/.pyquil_config"
Was that necessary? I was under the impression that it would all be taken care automatically with the pip install itself. Is this an error because of my way of installation, or should we modify api.py script so that we can jump over this manual labour?
Plus, I cant find pyquil-config-setup in my setup.py
@rasa97 Yes you do need to create the pyquil_config file manually.  I've updated the docs in the above PR to help clarify this.
