When using a QuantumInstance with CompleteMeasFitter, the circuits passed to execute are mutated on this  line
This becomes problematic when e.g. using NeuralNetwork from qiskit_machine_learning, see example below.
The following code throws an error due to the bug described above:
The circuit list should not be mutated.
A simple fix is to instead use
