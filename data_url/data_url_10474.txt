Description
draw_chimera fails with text error:
/home/jraymond/PYTHON3-VENV/OCEANSDK/lib/python3.6/site-packages/dwave_networkx-0.8.8-py3.6.egg/dwave_networkx/drawing/qubit_layout.py:195: MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: Adding an axes using the same arguments as a previous axes currently reuses the earlier instance.  In a future version, a new instance will always be created and returned.  Meanwhile, this warning can be suppressed, and the future behavior ensured, by passing a unique label to each axes instance.
ax = fig.add_axes([0.01, 0.01, 0.98, 0.98])
To Reproduce
import dwave_networkx as dnx
chimera_graph = dnx.chimera_graph(m=4)
dnx.draw_chimera(chimera_graph)
Expected behavior
Should draw graph and not print error
