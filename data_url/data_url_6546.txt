Error logs:
This bears similarity to a recent Cirq issue: see Cirq PR #3572 and related issues. That issue was only partially traced before opting to turn down Python 3.6 support as an alternate fix.
The Cirq issue seemed to be related to this pip issue, but the qsim failure doesn't have the same log explosion signal.
Why do we need numpy~=1.16 in qsim? Can we relax that constraint? I think that's the root cause of the issue. With regular pip install cirq you get numpy 1.19.5 which works with pandas 1.2.0.
After a bit of digging it turns out RUN apt-get install -y python3-pybind11 pulls in numpy 1.16.2 and then pip3 install cirq does not override the version. Thus, I'd recommend using pip3 install cirq --force-reinstall to enforce the right numpy version.
