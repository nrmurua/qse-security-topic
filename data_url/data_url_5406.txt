When constructing a small qFlex circuit and running it with the default number of cuts (which is 2), the resulting state has a greater-than-unity amplitude. This seems to be due to smaller circuits being fully separable with 2 cuts and thus, as in this case, fully disconnecting parts of the qubit-grid. A simple work-around is to manually create an ordering with no cuts.
A minimal example:
This returns/prints the unnormalized state:
