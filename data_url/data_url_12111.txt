This line in qiskit/advanced/terra/1_advanced_circuits.ipynb generates an error:
Here's the error:
Run the notebook page.
No error, as in the current snapshot notebook on GitHub, which was running qiskit v0.9.0
Not sure. It looks like the JSON file was removed from the qiskit repository at some point?
this was a packaging issue. it will work if you install from source.
this PR should fix the issue: Qiskit/qiskit#3445
Thank you! ðŸ˜ƒ Looking at the PR, I'll probably just copy the JSON file from the "terra" project where its needed. I'm really just wanting to understand all the tutorial material, and run it for myself as much as possible. BTW, are there any plans to get https://hub.docker.com/r/qiskit/qiskit-tutorial up to date with the current cloud authentication API?
Docker does not have the security needed for token passing to the api so its use is discontinued
Closing this as no longer needed.
