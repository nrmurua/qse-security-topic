QGL2 gets qubits using QubitFactory. Should it instead use ChannelLibrary.new_qubit()? Or something else?
Fix QGL2 to use the 'right' way to get or create a qubit.
EG:
See pyqgl2/sequences, pyqgl2/test_cl, qgl2/qgl1
Per discussion: you should not create a new qubit within a QGL2 program. So something like the current QubitFactory is in fact correct. (May rename the function at some point.)
