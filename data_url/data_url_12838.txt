I am using Jupyter Notebook. In the BasicGates python notebook I saw few parameters as 'Î±'. One has to copy and paste this variable everywhere they wish to use.
Should we continue using variables like 'Î±' or should we rename them to 'alpha'?
I thought having Unicode Î± was cute, but, in retrospect, very few people will be able to type it in (I confess I just copy-pasted the character in this comment ðŸ˜„), and having a character that you have to copy-paste every time you need it is frustrating.
I agree this needs to be renamed, at least in the tasks (in reference solutions it's probably ok to keep it as Î±, though it can be done either way). Do you want to open a pull request to do the rename? If not, I'll get to it later.
Thanks for the quick reply. I shall raise a PR for this ðŸ˜„
