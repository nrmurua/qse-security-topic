Phaser-Upconverter LO configuration seems to be missing options.
I'm attempting to create a device_db for a phaser-upconverter. With the current coredevice driver, the registers inside the TRF372017 must be configured manually. The documentations references the TRF372017 data-sheet without further explanation.

From the data-sheet it seems like the following values must be configured to achieve a desired LO frequency:
For "fractional mode" the following additional options are used
If an external VCO/LO is provided the following options are needed:
All the options above should be exposed and the names should match with the data-sheet. (Naming already matches for the exposed options)
ndiv?
It looks like ndiv does indeed correspond to NINT in the coredevice-driver implementation.

Given the documentation is the data-sheet, it seems best to match the names from the datasheet. Especially, as NDIV is used for something else in the data-sheet.

No. That's exactly the same thing and not something else.
But do rename it.
