For example, https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/cirq.Moment.html has no list of the methods of cirq.Moment.
The relevant file to edit is probability docs/conf.py, which is the sphynx configuration code. For example, this is where the "skip member" method is defined ( https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#skipping-members ).
I recommend that, when testing changes, you temporarily reduce api.rst to only mention a single class. This makes document generation way faster. Taking seconds instead of minutes.
I've looked into this and it is really wonky.  One problem is that the skip method is not correct as it ignores the skip variable.  But even when you fix that sphix seems to run the skip method twice, and the first time it runs it ignores the result.  This results in generated every method for a class, even after correctly configuring sphinx to only keep some methods.
Going to poke around a bit more, but right now the only real option is either a) include all methods (which includes all possible dunder methods) or b) roll back the @documentation annotation to remove the skip logic.
I've confirmed that this was broken by #2659
