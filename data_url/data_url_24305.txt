Set up documentation to have example how-to create and analyze circuits as in qiskit

Update from discussions
Model after:

Would be great to show this in APS MM
Would be great to scoping as part of MVP
The following is a placeholder outline
Example thumbnail of a direct coupler for two transmon qubits

@ThomasGM4  can also help guide this
Example images for 2 classes of interest

@JeremyDrysdale-ibm  we should plan to see who can help build this up in the next 3-4 weeks to have it complete by ~20th of March
Update with example image

Update with example image

PRs #341, #344, #359, #364 added circuit library.  PR #385 added summer school lectures to the circuit library examples.  Added links to all the lectures for now, not to specific sections due to time constraints.
Lumped resonator capacitive not added, we do not have that functionality yet.
