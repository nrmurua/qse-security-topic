I am unable to find the list of states returned by the essolve function
For example:
Returns the message
but if I try to access the states
Should this contain a list of states like mesolve()? It seems a similar issue has been raised before: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qutip/st3i6STPrQY
Here's my environment details:
Yeah, looking at it, this functionality still does not exist.  The essolve function is pretty out-of-date (its last real activity was back in 2013), and may well be completely deprecated in an upcoming version of QuTiP.
Hopefully qutip.mesolve should be a near drop-in replacement for you (c_ops_list is now called c_ops, but other than that you're fine), and it may well be a lot faster as well.
@Ericgig, @ajgpitch: shall we commit to maintaining essolve and/or the eseries class, or issue a deprecation warning as soon as possible?  They're pretty unloved, and QobjEvo really is a far far more general way of specifying time-dependence.  My vote (should I have one) is for deprecation.
I'm always in favour of slimming down codebases if it doesn't remove useful functionality!
Come to think of it, neither eseries nor essolve have significant tests, and a quick grep through shows that eseries is completely untested, and essolve has only one very basic test.
Closing now as essolve and eseries will be removed in 5.0, and we'll issue deprecation warnings soon.  We're unlikely to backport a fix to the 4.x branch since it would require developer time that we unfortunately just don't have to support a very old, little-used function.  Sorry about that!
