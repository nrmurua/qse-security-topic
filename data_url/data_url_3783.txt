How to count time when I solve the large QUBO problem with qsolve on AWSï¼Ÿ
Hi @ZeroDesigner, can you provide an example of the code you wish to measure?
Are you looking to count the QPU time? or maybe some other info? This code may help to see more information
feasible_sampleset = sampleset.filter(lambda d: d.is_feasible)
print(feasible_sampleset)
print(feasible_sampleset.info)
print(feasible_sampleset.first)
