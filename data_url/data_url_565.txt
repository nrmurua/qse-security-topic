Sorry @DmitryLyakh, forgot to add you to the xacc-dev developer_notes slack channel. Just added you, it talks about why you saw this problem.
For anyone else in the future that comes here with this problem, here's what we wrote in that channel.
Alex - everyone I introduced a new plugin to XACC that requires MPI and Boost MPI. Note this is an optional plugin, so you don't need MPI to continue working with XACC. But I did have to update the boost-cmake TPL to use version 1.71.0.
So just an FYI for everyone - If you pull latest master into your local forks, you may need to re-clone the repo recursively (so basically start over with your local xacc repo) to ensure the build does not use/conflict with the old 1.64.0 boost-cmake version in tpls/boost-cmake.
Thien - If you have some local branches/stashes and donâ€™t want to re-clone the repository, you can try to delete the tpls/boost-cmake folder and then re-run cmake. It worked for me.
Solved.
