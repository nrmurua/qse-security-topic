So the statement "It should not come as a surprise that naive_hhl_solution is exact because all the default methods used are exact" is false
from qiskit import transpile
num_qubits = list(range(1,5))
a = 1
b = -1/3
i=1
naive_depths = []
tridi_depths = []
for nb in num_qubits:
matrix = diags([b, a, b], [-1, 0, 1], shape=(2nb, 2nb)).toarray()
vector = np.array([1] + [0]*(2**nb -1))
You can run the example shownat https://learn.qiskit.org/course/ch-applications/solving-linear-systems-of-equations-using-hhl-and-its-qiskit-implementation
