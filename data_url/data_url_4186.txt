I'm working on a Dockerized Qrack-ProjectQ-SimulaQron container and found that the requirements for the pip3 install projectq missed the pybind11 dependancy:

installing pybind11 before installing ProjectQ fixes this:

So methinks adding pybind11 as a requirement for the correct installation of ProjectQ is in place IMHO.
Which pip version are you currently using ?
pybind11 is actually listed as a requirements for ProjectQ (take a look at the requirements.txt) file.
Hi Takishima, thank you for responding.
pybind11 is actually listed as a requirements for ProjectQ (take a look at the requirements.txt) file.
Indeed: that what is so strange about this situation. As though the requirements.txt is ignored at that point. Pip3 is v9.01

However: I do pull a fork of your project in that Dockerfile ( https://github.com/vm6502q/ProjectQ ) but that one also has the pybind11 as a requirement in the txt file, I see no differences at that point.
I see this as a framework weirdness, outside the scope of ProjectQ.
Closing
