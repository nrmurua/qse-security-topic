On Perlmutter, NERSC's newest supercomputer, running the cuda-quantum container found here (https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/cuda-quantum) fails unless the user specifies -u 0:0
Run https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/cuda-quantum with Podman (or Podman-hpc: https://github.com/NERSC/podman-hpc) like so:
podman-hpc run --gpu --rm -it cuda-quantum:0.3.0
this will fail to run, exiting immediately.
running the following:
podman-hpc run --gpu -u 0:0 --rm -it cuda-quantum:0.3.0
will work.
Without specifying -u 0:0, the container should run as user cudaq.  This works in Docker, but not in Podman.  Podman supplies this flag to run a rootless container.  As a workaround, this works, except the user in the container is root instead of cudaq
Not a regression
No response
Tien, can you triage this one? Thanks.
This is no longer an issue. I'm not sure what the problem was but 0.3.0 is quite old and we've changed our docker images substantially since then.
Steps I did to verify:
On Perlmutter:
This was successful. Inside the container, I can run some simple tests, like:
