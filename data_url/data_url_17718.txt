The subplot for 'local phase angle' does not resize, leaving a barely readable figure, even when resizing as in #1356.
@filemaster
The 'local phase angle' image is only a legend, so it will not be resized with the graph. I you think it is small we could make it bigger or add a parameter to allow the user to define its size. Anyway it is not a bug.
I would call a visualization that you cannot read a bug.  I would just make it large enough to read if it can not be resized.
See: #1358
Now visible
