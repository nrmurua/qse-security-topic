The string format (e.g. '0 1 0') used for qubit measurement results returned using the get_counts method can be difficult to interpret and it is not clear from the API documentation how the string returned maps to the individual qubits.
The recommended approach for calculating measurement probabilities for a subset of qubits in a register requires several lines of code to be written by the user and can be error prone due to lack of knowledge in qubit ordering. Refer to code below:
Recommend this function be provided as a QISKit API call that encapsulates the knowledge of how to interpret ordering and improves the efficiency of the developer.
We have defined the ordering for qiskit 0.7 and documented it. I am closing this as it is no longer valid. If we need more tools for analysing the results we have made a module for that in quantum_info.analization
