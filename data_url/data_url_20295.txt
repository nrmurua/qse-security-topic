When building on ARM (#460), a few hacks had to be introduced in order to work around problems with autoconf.  In particular, see the hacks array inside scripts/arm-cross-compile.sh.  Each line there is something that should be fixed.
Deprecated after move to CMake. For ARM cross compilation see #618
