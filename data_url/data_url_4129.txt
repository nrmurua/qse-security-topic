(Thanks to Yury Biryukov for spotting the issue) In Clifford&Clifford 2017 algorithm B, x is sampled based on normalized weights w_i=|a_i,1|^2.
Implementation in v0.4.2 - Clifford2017.py sampling (https://github.com/Quandela/Perceval/blob/v0.4.2/perceval/backends/cliffords2017.py#L31) is incorrectly calculating this array. Sampling could only be correct for real unitaries.
should be:
