When importing qiskit from current master, an error is printed, even if the function can actually be imported and used correctly.
This seems to be related to the order of imports in qiskit/__init__.py introduced in  #874, which rippled back silently after #885 . The error message is printed during the import of circuit_drawer, as it tries to import qiskit.load_qasm_string, which is not available by that time.
