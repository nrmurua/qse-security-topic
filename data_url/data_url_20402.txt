Hey,
I have just runned scan-build from clang via scan-build -analyze-headers --use-cc /usr/bin/clang --use-c++ /usr/bin/clang++ make -j4, it found a few errors and I thought it may interests you.
This includes:

Having re-run this at this commit on master, there are 14 reported bugs. I'll investigate their validity as I move the build system to CMake.
Noting that an old PR, #195, contained some code related to doing this in our old build system.  May want to replicate that work when working on this issue.
Also closed by #1240
