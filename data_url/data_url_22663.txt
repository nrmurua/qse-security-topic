I spent a lot of time this weekend bringing the Penning lab up to speed with the changes to ARTIQ over the last month. There were a number of snaggles that took hours longer than necessary to debug. Mostly because python error messages generated using the old attr_device() with the new setattr_device() API were entirely opaque. A physicist-readable API change log would make it easier to know how to refactor experiments. Here's a start.
10/12 Migration to Python 3.5 is complete.
Note for other users of conda deployment. Due to ARTIQ's new python 3.5 dependency you'll have to create a new environment for python 3.5 and install ARTIQ in it.
10/12 Changes in configuration files: 97accd2
10/3 Changes in program files: 50a5a3b
This should be posted on the mailing list, not in a issue I guess?
The *db.pyon rename is only part of that change, set/get_result() and set/get_parameter() should also be replaced with set/get_dataset() (see my post on the list).
