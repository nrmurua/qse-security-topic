This is not urgently required but would be nice to have the ability for a user to define an arbitary unitary in numpy which cudaq recognises as a valid quantum operation.
Users may request many new additional gates in the future so would be nice to give them the functionality to do it themselves rather than it be a blocker in development.
Thanks team.
