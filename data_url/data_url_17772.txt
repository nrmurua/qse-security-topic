We should add a function for calculating the purity of a mixed state.
It should be added to quantum_info/states
There is a function in tools/qi which should be moved and test made to confirm it works.
Could someone provide more information about this?
@delapuente my assumption is that this a tracking issue for moving the purity function from qiskit.tools.qi.qi into the new qiskit.quantum_info namespace. But I agree it could use more details in the description
Yes and a real test for it.
