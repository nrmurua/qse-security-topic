Expectation: Phase relationship between DDS's on single Urukul board are constant from one run of an experiment file to the next. Observation: For program below, random phase between ch0 and ch1 from one run of the experiment to the next.
Note: The phase relationship between ch0 and ch1 remains well defined within a single experiment run even with multiple calls to set(). For example, if I were to make a loop stepping the phase of ch1 within a kernel.
Don't reset the DDS each time.

Thanks. Skipping .init() fixes the problem I saw. Looks like the following needs to be called once after powering on the crate.
Consider noting this in the docs so users don't run into the same problem.
