Hi! Can I work on this issue?
Sure! Assigning ðŸ˜„
@nonhermitian Can you specify the steps to produce the above mentioned pulse schedule for testing
@tgag17, I would try passing in a variety of values for dt into Schedule.draw for a schedule of different lengths. I think what is happening is that the x-axis values are being displayed with too much precision causing them to overlap if there is a long decimal component to the value.
closing this as it is no longer an issue with pulse_v2
