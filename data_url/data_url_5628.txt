pip install qiskit-aer fails on a Linux machine with aarch64 architecture.
Try running pip install qiskit-aer on a Linux aarch64 architecture.
The package should be installable from PyPI. v0.12.0 does provide the aarch64 wheel for Linux.
Upload the aarch64 wheel for Linux. I see that the corresponding deploy job indeed failed: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/actions/runs/5250760188/jobs/9485031521
Thank you for your heading up this issue. I created a PR #1867. If it works well, 0.12.2 will include aarch64 binaries.
hello, this is still not fixed. The aarch64 wheels are still not available through PyPI for 0.12.2, as discussed here as well: #1872
