Add support to DAGCircuit.apply_operation_back and .apply_operation_back that tracks the classical variables, adding read/write wires as appropriate.
Only Store and ControlFlowOp operations will be able to cause an effective write in the DAGCircuit structure right now, and ControlFlowOp will only be able to trigger a write on variables that are closed over in the containing blocks.
