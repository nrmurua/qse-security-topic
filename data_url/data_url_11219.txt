Are there plans to have directories except openfermion under it in the future?
I've often wondered the same thing. I think we should get rid of it and just have openfermion at the top level. @babbush can jump in if he objects.
I too have wondered this...
Here are the reasons. Openfermion opted for an src layout and as far as i can tell this doesn't really matter too much day-to-day.
