Can we release 10.9, to support older macOSes?
More details in dwavesystems/dwave-neal#71. In the meantime, wheel>0.34 says it has:
Added automatic platform tag detection for macOS binary wheels
I've tested this auto-detection and it seems it produces 10.9 wheels on our other packages (e.g. greedy), but not for minorminer. Might be we actually use something that requires 10.15?
I didn't set up builds for macOS and I don't use that platform myself.  I don't do anything terribly exotic on the OS side of things, I don't see why 10.15 would specifically be required.
Obsoleted by switch to cibuildwheel.
