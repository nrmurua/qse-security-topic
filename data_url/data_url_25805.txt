There is a way to do it described here #207 (comment)
The best way to do this is probably to enhance the changelog workflow to retrieve the commit author(s) from the push payload and write them to the changelog message. You might try to append the authors to the changelog_header in the workflow, so a changelog message looks like
Doing it automatically is better than having people type their handles into the changelog
I can give it a shot.
There are some changes going in #601 that will impact this issue. Once that PR is merged, changelog logic will live in a JavaScript action rather than a workflow file. That will be where you want to focus on automating the author names.
is the task is only need to modify one file .github/actions/changelog/index.js ?
is the lines below already automated by .github/workflows/changelog.yml ,
uses: EndBug/add-and-commit@v9
how to test the workflow if i work on this issue?
should we wait #601 merged first?

I'm not 100% certain but yes I think the only change will need to be in this JS file
is the lines below already automated by .github/workflows/changelog.yml
Not those lines specifically. They are added by developers by hand and parsed automatically by the CI to update the version number.

You should be able to test it in your own fork, but if you get stuck with testing LMK and I can help with that
should we wait #601 merged first?
Don't wait for the merge to get started working. You can branch off i-34 and work there. Or you can work off develop using the existing changelog.yml but it might break when #601 gets merged.
@divshacker would you like to try to solve this issue as well?
I have tried to search about this in the given link above and also read some documentation, but like yeah I still don't have a complete solution on how to implement this. Any guidance on other platform like discord would be nice for me.
