Previously the s-dagger and t-dagger gates were named sdg and tdg. This was changed to S_dg and T_dg, which means the drawers no longer display the dagger icon.
Both gates should display the dagger icon after S or T.
This can be fixed in qcstyle.py.
Yeah I noticed this too, if you could do the fix and tag it as stable-backport-potential that would be great.
It's a label change, not name change. Though I don't even know why the label was changed. @Cryoris @1ucian0 ?
We should have these render as a dagger in all places. Sdg, Tdg, SXdg
Right. Since the label takes precedence that's what is being displayed. I assumed labels were blank unless the user supplies? Pushed a change but can change it at the s.py, etc. level if preferred.
