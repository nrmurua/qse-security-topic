Hi,
I'm trying to get the networkanalyzer work. I tried to run the scripts in the document (see below), but the program stucks in na.curve().
If I set the timeout by na.curve(timeout=5), it raises an error after 5 seconds
I'm using python=3.6 and STEMLab 125-14. Could anyone share potential reasons and solutions?
Thanks,
Vincent
