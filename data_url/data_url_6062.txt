The results of running statevector simulator on transpiled and untranspiled circuit are different. Not clear if a simulator or transpiler issue, so reporting here.
When running, I get:
Assert should pass.
I think the transpiled circuit output is correct (i.e. sv2), so looks like the issue is with simulating circuits with gates other than ['u1', 'u2', 'u3', 'cx']
Actually, the two states are the same up to a global phase:
Still, not sure if this is desirable behavior.
This is a transpiler issue: certain transpiler passes not respecting global phase (for example the unroller when for certain gates such as rz to u1). There is not really anything that can be done about it in the simulator at the moment.
There are several issues related to global phase in Terra you can follow for updates.
