Example of get_solvers function has couplings__issuperset=[[0,128], [0,4]] but sampler = DWaveSampler(solver={'qpu': True, 'couplings__issuperset': [0,4]}) gives SolverNotFoundError: Solver with the requested features not available despite such a sampler being available:
I do not see couplings defined as a derived property, However, I do see a solver property couplers---was maybe your intention an example such as sampler = DWaveSampler(solver={'qpu': True, 'couplers__issuperset': [(0,4)]}) and the couplings a mistake (it is used for dwave CLI)?
Good catch, @JoelPasvolsky. Just use couplers. I've fixed the example.
