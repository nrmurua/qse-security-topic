Hi there,
I am trying to use PyZX to attempt reducing the footprint of some circuits I designed in Qiskit.
When trying to run pyzx.qasm on the QASM source generated by Qiskit, I was getting an error on import 'stdgates.inc', which I understand is a library of "standard" gates used by Qiskit.
I tried replacing the line with the content of stdgates.inc, however this results in TypeError: Arguments for custom gates are currently not supported: p(λ) a { ctrl @ gphase(λ) a; } on the very first "phase" gate in the file.
I could try downgrading to a previous Qiskit, however I was wondering if there is any way to support this out of the box, since anyway it seems OpenQASM 2.0 is considered deprecated.
I think this particular issue can probably be quite easily fixed with a hacky solution. Namely just acknowledging that import 'stdgates.inc' is a standard thing to do in QASM3.0, and realizing that p(alpha) is a synonym for doing a Z rotation. Do you think that this would be enough to solve your issue, or are you also using other features from Qasm3.0 that currently aren't supported?
Hi, @fvirdia,
Is there anything else you need? PR #151 was just merged which adds support for the OpenQASM 3 header format and the p gate.
PR #156 adds supports for OpenQASM 3 format. I tried some exports from qiskit and they seem to import just fine, so unless there are requests for additional qasm gates not covered by that PR, this issue can be closed.
