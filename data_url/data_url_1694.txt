Description of the issue
ASCII Art explaining quantum circuits is misformatted in Intro.ipynb  notebook for introduction to Cirq.
How to reproduce the issue
This issue is found on computers that use Japanese as the system language.
The introduction to Cirq ipynb notebook describes quantum circuits using ASCII art, however, all the ASCII art is moved to the right and mis-formatted for me.
Thanks for opening! Closing as dupe of #3998.
