Hey, thanks for the great work on this system! I'm trying to get the windows binary pyrpl-windows.exe running on a 32-bit Windows 7 machine and I'm getting an error message indicating incompatibility. Is there a version of the .exe which is compatible with my system? Thanks again!
Hi,
in principle Pyrpl should run on Win32 systems.
The file pyrpl-windows.exe was automatically generated on a 64bit machine provided by AppVeyor. They do not have win32-images in their portfolio, which is why we only have 64bit versions. I personally also do not have a win32 machine.
In principle, one could however generate such a win32.exe, given any available win32 machine. Two options:
Sorry I cant help you with less effort. If someone is around here with a Win32-System, would you mind to run the instructions of above link?
