As reported in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66644838/pip-install-r-requirements-dev-txt-error-command-errored-out-with-exit-st/66675330#66675330 SQNomad-0.1.0 seems uninstallable, at least on MacOS.
Thanks for the report; I can reproduce it. Looking into it now.
Fixed in repo.
I was actually under the impression that qiskit installed the individual optimizers, not the container package. I'll make Nomad optional: it takes a long time to compile (hence the use of numpy's build setup).
And released.
