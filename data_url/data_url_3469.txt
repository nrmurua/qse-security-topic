fails with the error message QUILCError: Condition CL-QUIL::UNKNOWN-GATE-PARAMETER was signalled.. Note however that replacing the PHASE gate with RZ works as a workaround and the CPHASE gate also works
This is actually a bug in quilc. I'll raise the issue/fix there and close this when that's merged.
Also, @jlbosse, you will run into an issue with the reference to gamma[1]. Quil is zero-indexed, so you'll want to write that as gamma[0].
Here is an example (which will run once the fix is merged into quilc):
Fixed in Quilc.
