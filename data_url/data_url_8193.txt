Hi, I'm wondering if it's possible to control the precision of 'predictor-corrector' solver of the photocurrent_mesolve? Seems like the 'tol' has no effect on the 'predictor-corrector' solver.
Here's my code. I was trying to use stochastic master equation to generate the outcome photon sequence from a CPT set up, but I got a diverged outcome sometimes.
And the result,

(The decline of the blue curve means the density matrix is no longer Hermitian thus diverge.)
The stochastic ode solver are not smart and do not adjust the step to meet a desired tolerance. You can manually increase the precision by increasing the number of sub-steps nsubsteps.
Since you don't have any c_ops, see if you can use mcsolve instead. It accept atol and rtol options and you should be able to rebuild the measurement from the collapse.
Thanks for your suggestion! I tried to increase the sub-steps, but the optimal (a tradeoff between precision and speed) nsubsteps is very sensitive to the parameter of the Hamiltonian (bias). To simulate a time-dependent bias, I have to set an extremely large nsubsteps then practical unable to complete. Mcsolve works perfect for this setup, but I also want to add some extra c_ops later. I would like to ensure if the nsubsteps is the only way to control the precision? If so, I will make things simpler and use mcsolve.
Yes nsubsteps and tlist are the only way to control precision with photocurrent_mesolve, mcsolve does not support a mix of c_ops and sc_ops so if both of them are needed photocurrent_mesolve is your only option available.
Thanks, this answers my question.
