Instruction.c_if overwrites the previous condition, regardless of whether or not a condition existed.  This means that chained calls do not produce nested if statements, but instead replace the call.
There's no longer any reference to the first condition, whereas the documentation for c_if says it adds a condition, not overwrites it.
Fix the documentation of c_if.  While a nesting behaviour would likely be more expected, there's no real need to do that since QASM 2 doesn't support it and we'd have to completely overhaul how conditions work. The new QASM 3-ish control-flow modes (#7123) are already coming, and they support arbitrary nesting.  In the long term, we can probably deprecate c_if.
