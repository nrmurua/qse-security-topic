Add a dedicated SummedPauliOp class to opflow, for efficiency and functionality, based on quantum_info SparsePauliOp.
The new operator class should be part of opflow and respect the pratice, design of opflow etc. Have operator math, and other operations commensurate with the rest of opflow.
In order to allow legacy operators to be deprecated and internal logic moved fully over to opflow addition function, presently supported by the legacy operators is required. This should includes such methods to check commutation
ideally also methods for truncation, rounding etc., based on a supplied tolerance value in the method, like are currently in the legacy operators.
Also Z2 Symmetry support see qiskit-community/qiskit-aqua#1029
Plus here is an nice to have qiskit-community/qiskit-aqua#1425 - I will link it but it could be considered separately later as an enhancement once the basics are in place.

Update by @ikkoham
TODO
I will make at least 3 Pull Requests for SummedPauliOp because this has a large influence.
I will note that deprecating the legacy operators, mostly the WeightedPauliOperator, needs a set of changes in the application modules as well to move away from using these - mostly in chemistry FermionicOperator. Once the SummedPauliOp is in place, with the Z2 symmetry support, then that code can be changed to use it and the legacy operators then deprecated.
I reopened. I will make 3 PR for this issue. (1/3 done)
