The choice of boundary condition for spline used in QobjEvo can have observable impact on the system, see #2063.
But QobjEvo can only use scipy default boundary condition.
Add the bc_type keyword to InterCoefficient and QobjEvo.
coefficient pass though kwargs from QobjEvo to InterCoefficient, but should be added to the doc-string.

Hi Eric, I would like to work on this issue. Can you give me a bit more details on this?
When QobjEvo is made using a numpy array (QobjEvo([qobj, array], tlist=tlist)), we use scipy.interpolate.make_interp_spline to compute the spline used in the evaluation.
We pass the keyword order:
QobjEvo([qobj, array], tlist=tlist, order=order) -> make_interp_spline(tlist, array, k=order).
But make_interp_spline also support bc_type keyword which we don't pass though:
If would be useful for QobjEvo to pass the  'bc_type'  along the order and tlist to make_interp_spline.
Hi Eric. Thanks for the info! So, I have gone over the code base and have identified the specific files that would be modified as a part of the change. I have listed them below:
Let me know if I have missed out on anything else?
Also, for the documentation changes, is there a specific example that needs to be specified? Or should I just specify details similar to the Scipy docs?
The list look fine.
For the docstring, you can just refer the the scipy documentation and skip some of the details.
Hi Eric,
I've created a draft PR request for the changes. I did try to generate documentation according to the steps mentioned in the wiki but am faced with the following error:
Do you have any suggestions on how to address this?
@awkwardPotato812 Hi. Your error is similar to the problem on this website . You may have to upgrade your numpy.
@tamakoshi2001 Thanks for the info! That fixed my error.
