Here are some NIST DRBG seeds that reproduce the failure seen here.
I didn't run tests for very long, but I only observed failures in the AVX2 implementation of HQC-192. I did not see any failures in the reference implementation of HQC-192 or in any implementation of the other two parameter sets.
I've done some tests with the first seed above (6518...).
The original HQC-192 code (upstream from PQClean) passes the encaps/decaps test with -O3 and segfaults with -O0. PQClean fails the encaps/decaps test with both -O3 and -O0, but does not segfault. The O0 segfaults make debugging fun!
The KAT output between upstream and PQClean is identical. Since some configurations of upstream negotiate the correct key, this means that the bug is in decapsulation. Based on the changes I made to get the code into PQClean the bug is probably in reed_solomon.c
I'll self-assign and make a fix in PQClean once I figure it out.
I'm also quickly getting failures in HQC-128 ("decapsulation failed") when I run multi-threaded tests. I'll try to get a seed.
weirdly enough, when I have NUM_THREADS 40 (https://gist.github.com/thomwiggers/c23e2c4e01971ccfd5496466b72a89c6) I immediately get decapsulation failed in HQC but when I run 40 parallel processes with NUM_THREADS 1 it doesn't happen. Might be on my end then.
