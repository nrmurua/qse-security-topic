I think it will be so helpful to introduce composite Hamiltonian  to qutip
It used frequently as in jaynes cumming model
I inspired it from qit toolbox
http://qit.sourceforge.net/docs/html/
My function
Not need nested list of ascending ordered Hamiltonians
Function found under
Utils.Op_list
That will so helpful in future to introduce Hamiltonian models
Closing as this is very specialised functionality that can already be achieved with tensor and/or expand_operator.
