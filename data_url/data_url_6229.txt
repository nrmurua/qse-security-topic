I want to compile the cpp_simulator.
Now, I want to execute:
python setup.py build
and get the error:
/opt/rh/devtoolset-7/root/usr/libexec/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/7/ld: /opt/xsite/cte/tools/python/3.6.4/lib/libpython3.6m.a(getcopyright.o): relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.rodata' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
I have build cmake, OpenBlas and Boost. After that, I have tried to execute:
python setup.py build
