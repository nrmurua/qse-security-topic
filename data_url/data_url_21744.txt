And trying to reduce Master to 1 channel results in this...
For some reason, it didn't crash the second time I ran it, and also the transceiver works correctly with only 1 channel.
no difference with and without high-resolution TTL clocking; single-channel master works in both cases.
no difference with Vivado 2018.3
Smells like a Xilinx bug. On a pristine master...
MasterDAC (with 2 or 3 links) is actually not affected, I had made a mistake when testing it the first time.
GTH Ethernet seems to have made this situation worse - there are many other numbers of channels that now crash Vivado, and GTH Ethernet itself is often broken on the master variant (but works on masterdac).
Hopefully Xilinx will fix this in the next Vivado release, otherwise this will be another PITA for Metlino.
Still a problem on Vivado 2019.1 (this had been reported to Xilinx and they were supposed to fix it, but did not).
Fixed in 2019.2.
