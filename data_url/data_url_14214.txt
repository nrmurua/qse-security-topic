https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.result.Result.get_unitary.html mentioned it is support for schedule, but it is kind misleading since the get method can take key, and result data dict can be just keyed on experiment programs which is either QuantumCircuit or Schedule (mapped through program name). It doesn't guarantee the retrieve result contains unitary.
However, it should be help for if we have a new method to compute the unitary matrix for pulses, it should require the device Hamiltonian, but I am not sure if the hamiltonian obtained by the method backend.configuration().hamiltonian is the device hamiltonian.
can I try this
