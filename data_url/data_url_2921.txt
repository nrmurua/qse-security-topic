Our allclose_up_to_global_phase method is an extension of numpy's allclose method. Numpy also has a useful related utility method testing.assert_allclose, which gives better error messages than a raw assert numpy.allclose(...). We should mimic this good idea for allclose_up_to_global_phase, create a testing.assert_allclose_up_to_global_phase method, then use that testing method in lots of places.
