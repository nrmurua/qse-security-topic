Is there any support for the "slow" analog inputs and outputs?
At first it seemed that the AMS module was what I was after, but the code gave me the impression that the Analog I/O is not really implemented?
(I'd like to use them to read out a PT100 sensor...)
It's not clear to me that RP had chosen to remove ADC support, it is still present in their SCPI server:

The ams module allows to set the slow analog PWM outputs dac2 and dac3. The other two, pwm0 and pwm1, can be found in extra modules - see an example here https://github.com/lneuhaus/pyrpl/blob/develop-0.9.3/docs/example-notebooks/pwm-example.ipynb
The slow analog inputs are currently only supported in the branch max_hold_no_iir of PyRPL. There you can find them in the ams module. The input voltage range is -3.5 to +3.5 V. I will soon merge this to master.
