The QAOA, StateEvolution and AdiabaticEvolution models require acting with operators of the form exp(-1j * a * H) to the state vector. In order to simulate this efficiently with our existing mechanisms (custom operators) and eventually to run it on a circuit-based quantum computer we should decompose this to (one or two-qubit) gates. Currently this is handled by the TrotterHamiltonian object, however this mechanism is specific to what is presented in Sec. 4.1 of arXiv:1901.05824 and it is also hard for users not familiar with this formulation to define custom Hamiltonians.
We should think of better and more general ways to define Hamiltonians whose exponentiation can be decomposed (either exactly or in approximation) to gates. As Diego pointed out in this comment this would also be relevant to combinatorial optimization problems. Ideally we would like a simple API for defining the Hamiltonian and the library handling the decomposition part automatically.
