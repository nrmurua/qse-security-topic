Hi Ben!
I've been having a lot of trouble lately with Squanch. This may very well be because I for some reason am blind to an obvious bug in my code, but this also may be because of a problem with the squanch CU gate, H gate or qsys.
What I'm trying to code is somthing pretty close to usual quantum teleportation. We start in the 5 qubit state
|p> - |+>  - |+> - |+> - |+>
Where p is some arbitrary state and |+> is the usual + state and - represents CZ entanglement (so the CZ gate was applied to neighboring qubits). According to 1 way quantum computation, you should be able to measure each qubit 0 to 3 (0 indexing form the left) in the X basis, getting the results s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3 and be left with the rightmost qubit in the state X^{s_1 + s_3}Z^{s_0 + s_2}| p >
I was able to implement this in pyquil. Here is the code:
But the same sort of implementation in squanch doesn't seem to be working. Here is my code for that:
I may just be using Squanch wrong, and so if that is so, I'm sorry for bothering you. Haha, I will be digging into this problem now in more depth, looking at the implementation of CU and looking at the matrices I am making more closely for the time being now, but I thought I would ask you to make sure that I was using Squanch correctly.
Also I apologize if my code is very messing, it is all scrap code. If you would like more comments or if you want a better organization of the code, just ask.
Thanks!
I'm on vacation for the next few days, so I'll take a closer look at this later if there's still an issue, but one thing that stands out is that this line looks funny: e_res = c.measure()
Ah...oops. Hahah I'm really sorry for bothering you on your vacation. It all works fine now!
By the way, writing up the code to compare implementations with, I realized how much more intuitive Squanch is than pyquil. Well done!
