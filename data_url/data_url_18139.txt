The current circuit initialize uses non-basis gates, preventing the use of skip_translation.
I don't think this is a bug. skip_translation by definition is not guaranteed to work with every input and every basis gate. When you use it, you basically take responsibility for ensuring your circuit has the correct gates for the backend you select. In this case, it is not hard to do since initialize creates cx, rz and ry gates. If you want to change that to the u1,u2,u3,cx basis, you basically have to replace rz(phi) -> u1(phi) and ry(theta) -> u3(theta,0,0)
Does QISKit provide a method to facilitate said replacement?
@hushaohan right now the compiler does those translations, something you want to avoid with the skip_translation flag. Once the transpiler (#422) is in place, you will be able to ask for just that part of the translation. For now, i think it is straightforward to just do a string replacement following the above rules. You should do this on the output of the compile, which is a dictionary.
