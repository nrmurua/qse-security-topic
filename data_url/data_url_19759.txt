There is no Makefile for Ignis. This is not consistent with the rest of the Qiskit project, where we use make style && make lint && make test for local development. I had to dig around to find that it is using tox. I think all repositories should be consistent, and if we move to tox, all should move and documentation updated.
Also I think tox should be in requirements-dev.txt.
I've pushed a patch to update the CONTRIBUTING.md doc, it was quite out of date and some things in there were never correct. This update includes clear steps on using tox. However, including tox in the requirements-dev.txt won't work there is a chicken and egg problem there. Tox builds a venv for testing different environments and installs all the requirements from that file as part of running it. I've reflected this in the update to the doc too.
But my original point was that all the other repos have a Makefile, and for someone who tries to develop on Ignis it is not obvious that this one is different from all the other elements. Why not just add a Makefile to this (in addition to tox)?
