The python 3 compatibility code in pyquil/setup/config.py seems to be wonky.  The try/except block can't be inside a function body for that to work. A better alternative: delete the try/except check and add ...
import six
input = six.moves.input
@gecrooks Thanks for reporting this. Would you mind wrapping your suggestion into a PR and submit it?
