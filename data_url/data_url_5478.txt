Should the configure file still exist in the source? Isn't it automatically generated?

Yes, it is automatically generated. However, if you don't have autotools installed, you can still install qFlex by running ./configure which has been created with standard options, hoping that you satisfy all the checks. It was just useful in the developing stage, but we can remove it.
I do not mind keeping it. However, my git was complaining about it when I did not stage the changed file.
If it's ok, I would keep it just to make the installation easier for some users (I like to find a pre-created ./configure when I need to install from scratch a package).
