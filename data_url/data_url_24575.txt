Implement a function make_parallel(pt1, ..., ptn) that takes n pulse templates gives it the must simple representation. Think of a clever way to make channel remapping easy.
Easy case: two table pulse templates are automatically merged into one
More complicated: Two repetitions of TablePulseTemplates with the same length are merged into one repetition of a two channel TablePulseTemplate
If no simplification is possible: create a MultiChannelPulseTemplate
Consider the following use case:
The output of channel A and B can be independently sequenced by the hardware. Which means they are bound to different AWG objects (The channels of one AWG follow by definition the same sequencing pattern).
Restrictions:
How can this be done currently:
Solution 1 is not scalable in a sense that there is no combined pulse template that we can use in other pulse templates.
Solution 2 is scalable in that sense but much more tedious to write and very hardware specific.
Possible solution: (Re-)introduce the MultiChannelPulseTemplate.
