Poetry should install required libraries (e.g. numpy, scipy, pybind11, qiskit-terra, cython...
But only qiskit-aer is installed.
Qiskit Aer 0.5.2 can resolve the dependency. (poetry add qiskit-aer==0.5.2 installs required libraries.)
pipenv can also resolve the dependency for Qiskit Aer 0.6.x.
This may be poetry's or pypi's issue.
Hmm, well the install requirements are set in 0.6.1 the same as in previous releases: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/0.6.1/setup.py#L101 we did change how that list requirements is built to be slightly different than in 0.5.x but it shouldn't result in any change like this https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/0.6.1/setup.py#L35-L53
I also checked the package metadata by downloading the wheel and looking at the https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/bc/80/8bc3aa424ba813a54e667cb5b01bda6c6f0e30378ab1c9a6b3bce4185dc8/qiskit_aer-0.6.1-cp38-cp38-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl unzipping it and looking at qiskit_aer-0.6.1.dist-info/METADATA lists the install requirements correctly as:
(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0491/#the-dist-info-directory and
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0345/#requires-dist-multiple-use are the specs around this)
If this isn't working how does poetry parse the dependencies for a package?
I think this is closable because the PR is merged in Poetry.
If needed, please reopen.
