Thanks in advance for any hints
Hi @katetsu. My suspicion is that you have a version of SBCL that doesn't support compression (compiled without zlib support). I suggest you either compile and install SBCL from source and configure it to use zlib; or alternatively get one of the precompiled binaries from the SBCL website: http://sbcl.org/platform-table.html
If you compile from source, you should run the following commands sh make.sh --with-fancy --with-sb-core-compression.

@katetsu If you're not interesting in getting a more featureful or up-to-date SBCL as @notmgsk suggests, then—as a workaround—you can safely delete this :compression t line from the build script: https://github.com/rigetti/quilc/blob/master/build-app.lisp#L51
After doing this, it should build and should not complain about zlib support.
I am going to close this issue since we now support SBCL's without core compression.
