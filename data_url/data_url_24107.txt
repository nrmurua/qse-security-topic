When the layer thickness is given as zero, the following errors occur:
Set the design.ls.ls_df["thickness"][0] = '0um', and then render the design normally in QGmshRenderer.
When thickness=0, the renderer should just draw a 2D sheet (rectangle in Gmsh)
We need check the thickness of the layer during each of the above operations and separate dim=2 and dim=3 stuff for each.
