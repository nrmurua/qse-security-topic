If I run dwave auth login and the target website has a problem (Something went wrong We apologize for the inconvenience. Check our...) the terminal hangs and does not time out (at least not for many minutes, beyond what one can be expected to wait).
The terminal is stuck in the following state and user control is not restored with CNTRL-C:
Expectation: should time out or CNTRL-C should work.
This is for a WIN10 OS. (Looks like CNTL_C works fine for Unix)
We have a support for timeout, but it defaults to no-timeout, at least for now.

But regardless of timeout, Ctrl+C should work, and it works on my machine (tm). ðŸ˜†
To close this one, no timeout is by design. I can't imagine what would be a reasonable timeout value for waiting user to authorize Ocean.. Maybe they first need to sign-up for Leap, maybe their MFA is not arriving, etc. The only reasonable option, IMO is to allow Ctrl+C (or equivalent on Windows/Powershell) to cancel auth, and we already allow that.
