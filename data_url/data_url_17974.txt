After merging #724, the license header for qiskit/tools/apps/optimization.py has been reverted to "old" one - was this on purpose? @ajavadia , @nonhermitian can you comment and take action if appropiate?
Labelling as a bug, even if the change is intended, the date should be updated to include 2018.
Yes, the old license was added accidentally it seems.
