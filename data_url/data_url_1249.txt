Description of the issue
_name is excluded from MatrixGate._json_dict_() and so is reset to None by serialization+deserialization
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
Accepted, though we have to be careful that old jsons without names are still deserialized.
What are the deliverables precisely required here?
@mustapha-saad-codeStar We want to update MatrixGate._json_dict_ method to also include the name attribute in json serialization, if the name is not None. This should be backwards compatible because deserializing a matrix gate without a name should work as expected as name has a default value of None.
