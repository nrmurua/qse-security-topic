Hello, I found that the lib with with numpy 1.22
Also other requirements like cirq are not up to the latest version. You might want to change the ~= to something like >=.
Hello @quosta, thank you for your interest in Mitiq!
If this is a bug report, please provide screenshots and/or minimum viable code to reproduce your issue, so we can do our best to help get it fixed. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can also ask us on the Unitary Fund Discord.
Hi @quosta, I removed the bug label since this is the current expected behavior.
We had several discussions on this in the past and we decided to pin the requirements. This reduces flexibility but improves reproducibility.
We will hopefully upgrade the requirements with more recent versions in the next month.
PS: This could be useful to force pip installing mitiq ignoring dependencies:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12759761/pip-force-install-ignoring-dependencies
Thank you @andreamari for your reply. It is indeed a sensible strategy to have a reliable working ecosystem (in a venv). I also like to have an updated version of all libs (often in conflict unfortunately) to try out the latest features.
Forcing the installation of mitiq, I find an incompatibility with cirq, I leave it here as a starting point for the future integration.
In #988 we are fixing this problem, including replacing cirq.channel with cirq.kraus.
Meanwhile, if this is urgent for you, you can try to install mitiq from source using the fork branch https://github.com/vtomole/mitiq/tree/patch-1 associated to #988.
