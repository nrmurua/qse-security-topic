If a gate is opaque but unparameterized, the estimator and sampler gradients can still construct the gradient circuits. Currently, this is not supported as e.g. the LCU gradients internally attempt to unroll the whole circuit to a fixed basis set. This unrolling can be restricted to only parameterized gates and (1) enable handling custom, opaque gates and (2) doesn't prevent any optimizations the compiler might do on abstract blocks.
