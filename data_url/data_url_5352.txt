Running the test for  lightning.qubit device produced the following error in tests/test_execute.py
Are the tests out of date or is this a bug?
The full log from pytest can be viewed here:

This is running in a singularity container and is produced everytime the tests are run.
Hi @JMuff22 thanks for reporting this. I am currently unable to replicate your issue locally, or in the CI test suite.
As there is a new release of PennyLane (0.28) coming tomorrow, I suggest retrying with the new release and seeing if that improves your issue.
If it still fails, feel free to add a code snippet that replicates your issue, and we can take a look. Given the proximity to the end of the year, it may be some time before we can investigate further. Thanks
Hi @JMuff22 I will close this issue since I assume the problem was resolved with the above suggest. Feel free to reopen if this is not the case.
