Currently, Stepper does not support polarized components. I would like to track the evolution of state vector even when I am using polarized components.
Hello,
I'm really sorry, we do not plan to work on additional support of polarized components. The main reason for this is none of our hardware works with polarization.
Best wishes,
Eric
