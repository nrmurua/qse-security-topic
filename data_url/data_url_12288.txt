You could add a Binder badge to launch the Jupyter notebooks in a cloud instance

binder builds cloud containers with repo2docker.
repo2docker will install from requirements.txt and/or environment.yml

Hi,
Thank you very much! This seems cool indeed. Would you be able to explain steps to do that? Perhaps writing a blog or an article on how to run notebooks in the tutorial here will be very nice to people who are not familiar to github and just want to run the tutorials.
( Ensure that binder (repo2docker) can install the necessary dependencies with an e.g. environment.yml )
( https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/master?filepath=index.ipynb )
(Near the top / 'above the fold' of the README?)
Many thanks! It seems to work pretty well and so easy!!
However, this notebook produces error when run with mybinder
1_introduction/getting_started.ipynb
Interesting. I jumped ahead to 2. "Superposition and Entanglement" and that seemed to work okay.
The given notebook seems to open in nbviewer just fine; so the JSON isn't a problem with whichever component versions are live on nbviewer.  IDK why there's a Unicode symbol \ufeff in the JSON? Maybe that's normal? I would need to get to a terminal with hexdump or xxd to take a look.
The complete error message from mybinder.org JupyterHub is:
https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/stable/1_introduction/getting_started.ipynb
It shouldn't be necessary, but one can install BinderHub locally (or just repo2docker) to test with. There may be a way to run the jupyter convert equivalent to runipy at container build time (e.g. after environment.yml or in addition to calling environment.yml) with repo2docker:

Thanks. It appears that the error is due to the file getting_started.ipynb that I fixed just now.

@diego-plan9 when we are finished with the tutorial rework can you look into this and see what we should do here.
done. A few things that would be good. To get the circuit_drawer working with python and qconfig handled better. These are all on the roadmap for qiskit so im going to close for now.
@westurner i got it working with the latex (binder is really nice) and i got the qconfig working by skipping it in the the header and using getpass. Thanks for the suggestions and let me know if you have more improvements.
