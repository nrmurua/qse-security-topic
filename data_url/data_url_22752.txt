One dock within the GUI will be showing logging messages from the scheduler, the workers, the experiments, the controllers, the core device. Probably, the master will act as a hub rceiving aggregating messages and then save them to files and re-emit them to the GUI. The GUI can then filter on severity, source, or other metadata within the LogRecord (like experiment name). We need to decide whether python-logging fits the requirements (metadata with LogRecords, networking, interaction with asyncio, lazy formatting) or whether we need to roll our own.
I guess that for v1.0, we can just redirect the standard output from all experiments into the GUI.
I have implemented this simple solution now.
The discussed features should be there now:
Finer filtering would be on the cartesian product of level and some notion of "source" plus the "source" hierarchy hierarchy. Sounds hairy to me.
I think the following comb will groom this beast.
