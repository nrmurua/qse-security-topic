Trying to compile a circuit with a customized gate, I get:
Define the new gate:
Then write some circuit with the new gate, and compile:
Do not crash. Perhaps I'm simply doing something wrong?
@yaelbh Hi!
Briefly: you'd have to use CompositeGate class.
In more details: I am not aware of current situation (Qiskit 0.7), but it was a known problem for Qiskit 0.6. Here is the answer I obtained in the Slack channel:

I don't really have time to explain everything right now but you have several examples of user defined quantum gates here: https://github.com/nelimee/quantum-tools/tree/master/gates .
Be warned that the CompositeGate API is known to be unintuitive and that it will eventually change (but we don't know when, it's been 4 months the API is in this state).
You can find more information in  #1230 and others similar issues.
Hope, it helped you!
Thank you!
It is important to note that the repository I linked in my answer (I am ad_su) has not been updated for Qiskit 0.7. Because CompositeGate changed, I am currently trying to figure out how it works and how I can update my custom-defined gates.
I think this can be closed via #1816. Feel free to reopen if that's not the case.
CompositeGate is deprecated and will be removed in v0.9.
Any Instruction can now be composed of other sub-instructions.
To build them, you construct a circuit then use
circuit.to_instruction().
