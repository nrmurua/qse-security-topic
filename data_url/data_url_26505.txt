Hi,
I found the a missing keyword generation in cp2k manual, which also generates wrong .xml file, see: https://manual.cp2k.org/trunk/CP2K_INPUT/ATOM/METHOD/XC/WF_CORRELATION/RI_RPA/GW/PRINT.html
This missing prevents correctly manual installation of pycp2k.
see: SINGROUP/pycp2k#15
@robinzyb Thanks for reporting the problem. It should be fixed by #2151.
