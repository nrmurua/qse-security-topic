plot_state_city() cuts off x/y axes tick labels
plot_state_city() is defined here
The axes tick labels should not be cutoff.

Yeah I would just add a tight_layout() call to the end of the function. That's normally how I solve the cut off label problem
For reference the output with the labels cut off looks like this: 
Hmm, actually I just checked the code we have a tight_layout() call in there already: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/tools/visualization/_state_visualization.py#L339 so something else is going on. I'll have to dig more deeply.
I think this issue has been resolved with #3123. At least for me the ticks are not cut off anymore. (The suggested solution from the stackexchange website to simply add a small offset
plt.subplots_adjust(bottom=0.15)
worked in connection with the tight_layout() call as well.)
solved via #3123. Feel free to reopen if that's not the case.
