I was following the documentation example for building a noisy circuit.
By running the following:
I get this:
I think is related to the new way to use the noise channels.
Yes, this is correct. latest documentation has the new way of implementing with_noise() method if you're using qibo from master. This old way still works if you're using qibo from stable version. After next release, it will stop working.
However, there is indeed something wrong with the latest documentation, in which the example is changed to the new way, but not the text. I'll fix that.
Also, there's a more complex issue that a method called with_noise() is only able to implement one very specific channel, but that's a different issue.

Ok, thank you. It makes sense, I use to work with the master branch and qibo installed in editable mode.

Is there any specific issue opened? I also can have a look.

I understand, you mean it should be better to generalize this feature to different noise models?

I'm already going to make other small changes in the doc, so I can just do it all in one PR.
