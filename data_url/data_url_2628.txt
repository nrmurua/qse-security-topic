Currently, passing in None instead of a lambda has this behavior. But this can result in duplicate logic when passing in the lambda or None and implementing the lambda.
Don't forget to update the argument type and to test the new behavior.
Hi @iamvamsi, are you still working on this? If not, I'm happy to do it.
@andbe91 Feel free to take over this one.
@andbe91 : I haven't yet started on this. Please feel free to take it.
