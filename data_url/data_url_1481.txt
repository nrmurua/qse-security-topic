Description of the issue
When doing a simulation run with multiple repetitions, we first simulate the unitaries and snapshot that state (ActOnArgs.copy()), then repeat the non-unitary portion only using clones of that snapshot.
Since those repetitions are serial, it should be possible to reuse the buffers rather than copy them for each repetition. Especially in density matrix, where it has three 4^N buffers, this could be a big time savings.
This could be a good first issue for someone. We just need to make sure the solution does not break backwards compatibility for any third-party ActOnArgs implementations. (Probably needs a new optional arg copy(reuse_buffer: False)).
Minor other things that could probably go into the same PR:
