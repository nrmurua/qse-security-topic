This circuit fails on my Lenovo laptop, but not on my spectre laptop. All screenshots taken on the Lenovo laptop.
Note inconsistency between the two qubit chance display and the single qubit chance display following it:

The issue doesn't appear when the apparently spurious X gate is removed. Moving the bottom part upward also removes the issue. Moving the top part downward causes strange effects, like 40/60 splits:

Initial guess is this is some kind of floating point precision issue in the texture lookup code. However, the issue also occurs in the two qubit amplitude and density matrix displays.
Post-selecting on the |1> state results in a bad NaN display:
