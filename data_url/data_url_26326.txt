I tried calculating a local DOS in real space using https://manual.cp2k.org/cp2k-2023_1-branch/CP2K_INPUT/FORCE_EVAL/DFT/PRINT/PDOS/R_LDOS.html
Unfortunately, I cannot see how this is supposed to work... I tried setting e.g.
LIST 1
ERANGE 0.14 0.18
However, no matter what I set for XRANGE, YRANGE and ZRANGE, the number of grid points used in the LDOS calculation stays the same (13824000).
In my understanding, "LIST 1" should specify that XRANGE, YRANGE and ZRANGE are measured relative to the position of atom 1, is that correct?
Why do the spatial ranges not change the result at all?
Unfortunately, I couldn't find any examples or test files for this problem...
Thanks!
