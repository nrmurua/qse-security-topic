QX-Sim allows natively running a Kernel multiple times with .<KernelName>(<iter>)
Can this feature be accessed from OpenQL with say, a parameter in
program.addKernel(<KernelName>,<iter>)
that would add the Kernel iteratively <iter> number of times to the generated qasm code, OR (better in my opinion), compile to the QX-Sim syntax to run the Kernel multiple times.
The obvious OpenQL workaround is
But since it is a feature in QX already, I think it's better to percolate it to the top layer of the stack (if it's not there already).
Done in 75f375f. You can mention the iteration count while adding kernel as p.add_kernel(k,5). This will generate:
or the scheduled one as:
