When running a loop and I press the abort button, There is a long traceback (especially for nested loops), I dont really need that so I was looking to remove it.
Now, it seems that the way how the looop is aborted is:
That is not really a graceful end of the measurement. Right? just raising a KeyboardInterrupt?
Or am I overseeing something?
I think there should be an abort procedure finishing the calls to the instruments, save the data well and whatnot, before everything is terminated.
You're right- although to support local loops where you'd really get a keyboard interrupt, we should raise this then catch it at the highest level in the loop (_run_wrapper?) and silence the error as we neatly close the loop - will also solve #137 although for robustness the fix there should also have the DataServer check if a measurement is REALLY running before it complains.
@alexcjohnson , yes, I just realized the connection to #137 as well...
@MerlinSmiles I'm going to have to play with this a little more and see if it's really working the way we want (and #137 implies that something is not working right), but at first glance:
@alexcjohnson could you explain to me how the dataset is cleanly closed?
I only see the loop doing _wait where it _check_signals and when that one has received the halt it just breaks, no?
Assuming this is gone
