In order to use Yao from python I have to install prerequisites on both sides, in julia and in python as well. I am starting from a  pristine python environment:
In julia (with Yao installed):
in bash:
pip3 install julia
ipython:
Please, could you check this?
Have you tried using Yao in a Julia REPL?
It is much easier to call python from Julia. The API for calling Julia from python is not well tested.
If this bug appears only in pyjulia, I suggest posting an issue here https://github.com/JuliaPy/pyjulia
@Roger-luo Do you have any comments?
Yes, it works properly. I also can call python from julia, but in order to suit our needs we have to use Yao from python. If you are sure that it is not a issue with Yao I will post the issue in PyJulia.
I've suggested our Python wrapper. Let me know if there is any issue on this wrapper.

@Roger-luo You should post the link: https://github.com/QuantumBFS/yao-python
@rdguerrero-1qbit From the error information, the error is not in Yao. If it happend again, and roger's patch does not work for you, please file an issue in pyjulia.
I'm closing this since I think this is not an issue on Yao side.
