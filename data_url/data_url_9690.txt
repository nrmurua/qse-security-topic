Application
I want to be able to see whether I set a hard or soft constraint on my CQM and what value of weight & penalty fo rsoft constraints.
Proposed Solution
Display as part of the dimod.CQM.constraint
Alternatives Considered
If that causes backward compatibility, maybe a new field. .
Additional Context
Output Le(QuadraticModel({'a': 1.0}, {}, 0.0, {'a': 'INTEGER'}, dtype='float64'), 3) gives no hint of the type of constraint.
If you want to check whether the constraint is hard or soft you can use
and that will show the weight and penalty
We should make that a non-internal method though, right?
