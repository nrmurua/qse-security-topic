Deprecation warnings are present related the to use of the deprecated qiskit.extensions.standard library in a couple of cells in the 4_transpiler_passes_and_passmanager.ipynb notebook. The new preferred library qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates should be used instead and is already used in other notebook cells.
There are also several deprecation warnings coming from the run method in the BasicSwap class defined in the notebook.
Addressed in PR #999. Closing.
