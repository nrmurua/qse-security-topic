The following compiler error from this line of code in src/framework/utils.hpp:1499
ss = std::stringstream(); // clear string stream
Building/installing Aer exhibits the error, but it seems(?) to be an issue only when building Aer with GPU support since I haven't run into this in the past, i.e.,
python ./setup.py -v install -- -DAER_THRUST_BACKEND=CUDA
I tried several versions of g++, 4.4<=>8.4, and none of them support this method of resetting the object to its default ctor state, i.e., "clearing the string stream." A more compiler-portable way of doing it would be to either scope it inside the {}'s or ss.clear(); ss.str(""); (see below).
No compiler error.
Scope it inside the {}'s or ss.clear(); ss.str(""); e.g.,
-or-
I see before gcc 9.1 the assignment operator was absent.

Fixed in #855
