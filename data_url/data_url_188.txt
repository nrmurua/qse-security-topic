There are many libraries in the runtime. For build targets such as testing, it will likely require that all these runtime libraries are both built and up-to-date before running the tests.
Presently, this is not the case. PR #953 is a temporary fix for this issue.
What would be better is for each library to add itself to a property in its own cmake files so that other components, like testing, can just reference the property and not have to maintain arbitrary lists of libraries.
