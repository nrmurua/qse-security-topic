Remove the mitiq.pdf in docs/pdf/, since we seldom update it (recently it was also giving some issues). We can just use the one generated by Read the Docs if we want to attach it to the Github release. We should update the release guidelines eventually, if that uploading that pdf is cited elsewhere.
