Description of the issue - include code snippets and screenshots here
if relevant. You may use the following template below
Link "request access" on https://strawberryfields.ai/ and in the documentation should work.
The link is broken.
Every time.
Not relevant.
The broken link points to https://xanadu.ai/request-access, while the correct address seems to be https://xanadu.ai/access
This seems to be fixed now. Thanks for reporting @lneuhaus.
