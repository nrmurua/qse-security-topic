We had this requirement because of matplotlib, but I just tried uninstalling python3-tk from my machine and then plotting stuff and it worked.
Note that we did switch to a more recent version of matplotlib: #1684 . But in my testing the old version also worked..
tkinter is packaged with the Python 3+ installs. Seems like i wasn't the only one having problems reproducing this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25905540/importerror-no-module-named-tkinter.  I'll remove this as part of the "Remove Python 2 support" issue.
