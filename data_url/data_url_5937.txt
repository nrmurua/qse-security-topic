0.6.1 fails:
Package build is performed without internet connection for security reasons. All dependencies should be pre-installed.
I do have nlohmann-json installed, so it isn't clear why does it try to download it.
How to only use local packages for dependendcies?
0.5.2 was building fine.
Hi @yurivict
Right now we use Conan as a dependency manager to deliver (some) needed libraries. The possibility of disabling Conan and use installed dependencies is being implemented In the ongoing PR #877.
In the meantime, to try to find a solution, can you give us more information about your system? Regular pip installation of qiskit-aer for win64, mac and linux shouldn't need conan.
I am trying to update the FreeBSD port. It uses cmake for build.
I see, the aforementioned #877 PR was also opened to be able to do packaging on Linux. In the meantime, maybe you can follow the suggestion in this issue: conan-io/conan#2197 to try to make an offline installation of the conan packages needed.

I'll just wait until you'll bring back a regular dependency management.
Thank you,
Yuri
OK. Thanks anyway for raising this! I'm closing this one as we already have the issue #757 opened to track the non-Conan build.
