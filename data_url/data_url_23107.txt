starting to look into this again:
@SamuelDeleglise: is it possible that you hook up a redpitaya at your place for online testing? if you want, I'm near your place tomorrow afternoon and we can try together.
Currently, other things are failing:
Python 2.7:
Python 3.5 makes it into nosetests. Then:
Python 3.6:
python 3.5: need to add quamash to dependencies, must find a way to not bother python2 requirements
ok, 90 more free builds:
Hi Leonhard -
Thanks for your email, so sorry to hear about the issues fixing up your tests. I've gone ahead and given you 90 more free builds, so you're back up at 100. Hope this helps! Of course, if you end up needing a couple more, just let us know.
Also, if there's anything we can do to help you with troubleshooting this issues, please feel free to contact us any time. We're always glad to take a look at your build and see if we can make some suggestions.
Thanks again!
Anna
OK, so the redpitaya is plugged... Let me know what ports I should forward
tests are mainly working now (travis-related issues are fixed, the only thing we can do is speed up the testing (currently > 1h per python version), see #227
