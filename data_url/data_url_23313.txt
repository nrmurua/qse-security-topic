Regardless of which qcodes release(tried with 4 different qcodes version)  I use whenever I  want to have trace data of network analyzer, N5249A, I get could not convert string to float: 'S21' error. My code is simple. I first set the required parameter for the network analyzer and then try to get trace data: data=qc.Measure(vna.trace).run(name='test')
my code is:
and it returns this error:
I'm not very much familiar with that driver/instrument but i think vna.trace is just the particular S-parameter that you are interested in. The actual data is available in .magnitude and .phase parameters, see the example notebook here https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/driver_examples/Qcodes%20example%20with%20Keysight%20Network%20Analyzer.html.

thank you for your comment. Actually, in that way, I could get data but since I am sweeping voltage from some other instruments, I have 2D loop, to be able to make all my instrument work at the same time I need VNA to work via qcodes.Measure function

i'm not sure i understand why. I wanted to suggest that instead of data=qc.Measure(vna.trace).run(name='test') one needs to use data=qc.Measure(vna.magnitude).run(name='test') because vna.magnitude parameter acquires the data while vna.trace parameter jsut allows you to select which S parameter you're interested in.
anyway, did this issue get resolved? if so, please close it :)
I agree on using  vna.magnitude. However, this time I get unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray' error.
data=qc.Measure(vna.magnitude).run()
@bugusan a side question - do you absoltely need to use qcodes.Measure? Couldn't you use qcodes.data_set.measurements.Measurement context manager as described in this doc https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/DataSet/Performing-measurements-using-qcodes-parameters-and-dataset.html ?
I couldn't figure out why the "unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'" occurs, perhaps, Loop and Measure are not smart enough about parameters which return numpy arrays of data. You could ask this question on our Slack channel, perhaps other people from our community know - do you know how to access the Slack channel?
@bugusan just send an email to Mikhail.Astafev(at)microsoft.com and I will invite you to the Slack channel
