A quick fix seems to be removing the SIDH/SIKE family from the generate.yml file and comment out the following line for the python dictionary in the generate.py script:
Thanks for the bug report. Looks like I switched too fast from "Pre-release" to "Release" :-(
@opencrypto: Please confirm #394 fixes your problem.

My initial response would have been no about re-release, because I would have said that only we run oqs-template, not external users. But since this was found by an external user, obviously I don't understand how people are using this. Let me ask: @opencrypto what led you to run this script?
