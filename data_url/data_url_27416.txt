This is an issue that only seems to crop up under certain situations which I have yet to pin down.
When performing a measurement with a DCSweepParameter that sweeps 1 gate, the problem can arise that the expected shapes is not correct and can't be broadcast into the data array.
Once I have more information I will come back to this and fill this issue out a bit more clearly.
I believe it is related to the setpoints and may have been introduced from #272.
