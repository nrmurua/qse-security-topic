from @AdriaanRol discussion in #38
I noticed that the parameter class is located inside the instrument folder. Previously this made sense but I think that in recent PRs #39 and #40 we have made the notion of a parameter more abstract and indepenent of the instrument. Would it make sense to separate/refactor this?
Yes, yes it would make sense
Possibly to be fixed in. #403 !
