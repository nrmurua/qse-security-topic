I would like a feature to create overrotation error in quantum circuit
This can be done by getting the schedules for the basis gates on your backend and e.g. modifying the pulse amplitudes away from their calibrated values. Would this work for you?
Hi thanks for your interest and apologies for the slow response! We are currently in the process of reorganising the Qiskit Tutorials, archiving this repo and moving the existing tutorials to the main qiskit repo or other appropriate projects. During this transition we will be focusing on maintaining/improving our existing content and are not able to take submissions for brand new tutorials at this time
Thanks anyway for your feedback and helping us make Qiskit better! ðŸš€
