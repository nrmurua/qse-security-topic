The QAOAResult object stores information regarding the QAOA optimization routine. This result object can be accessed post optimization through the QAOA workflow object via the following steps:
Add a method under the QAOAResult class that computes some statistical quantities for the measurement outcomes.
The QAOA object can store measurement outcomes (i.e. counts) from each circuit evaluation in the QAOAResult object.
An approach adding statistical tools to understand QAOA results better
