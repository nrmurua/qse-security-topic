Metlino and Sayma have different Si549 with different addresses
Si549 on Sayma has address 0x55, on Metlino (LVDS version) it's 0x67. Kasli will also have LVDS version.
Choosing Si549 type during compilation? Trying both addresses?
We can test both addresses at runtime, it's not very difficult, and the Si549 is the only thing on the I2C bus so there will never be any conflict/ambiguity. I suspect future Sayma may also use other Si549 addresses...
Not really a problem for now so closing.
