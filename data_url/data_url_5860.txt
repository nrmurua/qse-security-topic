When I run Aer simulator of a 4-qubit circuit and measure only one qubit,
the statevector class in Terra gives a probabilities vector of length 2 while Aer's simulators give a probabilities vector of length 16.
Which one is correct?
The output is:
In addition, when I run this test locally:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/test/terra/backends/qasm_simulator/qasm_save_probabilities.py
I get the following errors (due to different outputs dimensions):
Terra's statevector class and Aer's simulators should give the same probability vectors (of the same dimension).
Aer's test should have detected these errors.
closing since uninstalling qiskit-aer and installing it again seem to make it work :)
