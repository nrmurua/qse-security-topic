There are 2 built-in parameterized gates, U(θ, ϕ, λ) and gphase(γ). The definitions of these gates are explicitly 2π periodic in all the parameters except for θ, for which U is instead 4π periodic. The spec implies that U() is defined for
θ in the interval [0,2π), but also says that the inv modifier can operate by replacing inv @ U(θ, ϕ, λ) by U(-θ, -λ, -ϕ). Unfortunately this is not correct when considering global phase: ctrl @ inv @ U(θ, 0, 0) c, t; is not the same as ctrl @ U(2pi-θ, 0, 0) c, t; but rather needs an additional p(pi) c; to correct.
I can see a few options to resolve this:
I think any of the options 2-4 could be acceptable but I lean towards option 4 even though its a bit embarrassing to have to revisit this and obsolete the paper.
Also, all options 2-4 only differ in the presence of ctrl modifier, and all can be inter-converted by judicious use of gphase instructions

Decided by TSC 2022-08-19 in favour of option 4.
I will open a PR to implement, and we should consider pushing a revision to the paper.
Resolved by #393.
