a user reported the following failure when building COSMA with the toolchain:
This error gets triggered by an older MPI which doesn't have the MPI_CXX_BOOL (check the MPI standards/OpenMPI errata). The interesting thing is that the user actually provided a newer OpenMPI release:
And looking in the cmake.log reveals:
For some reason not all packages (in this case COSMA) in the toolchain pick up an MPI implementation just from the $PATH. This can potentially be very bad as packages may enable different kind of codepaths for different MPI implementations and versions, leading to link- or runtime failures (at best) or data corruption (at worst) when built against one MPI version but link against a different one.
We need to:
This may be related to other build issues we see, like #1274, #1275
While working on ELPA I noticed that quotes around the library directory don't (always) work. In my case -L${mkl_lib_dir} worked, but -L'${mkl_lib_dir}' didn't. Since we generally use those quotes in the toolchain, this might explain why sometimes the wrong libraries are picked up.
Do you think the problem is in the quotes, as suggested by @oschuett or on the COSMA side? I just want to collect and fix all the problems in the next release that we are preparing soon.
