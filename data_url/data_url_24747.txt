The user wants to distiguish and group the measurements into groups that i.e. share a common physical parameter. PulseTemplates should be able to rename the measurement windows of their children.
Example:
The user defines a parametrizerd SequencePulseTemplate P(x) which consists of the TablePulseTemplate 'T(x)' and a measurement pulse M: 'P(x) = [T(x) M]'
M contains a measurement window with the name 'mw_name'
The user wants to repeat P while ramping x from 1 to 100 and give each measurement_widow another name:
This pulse S is than repeated 300 times.
Measurement windows with the same name can than be given to the currrently used acquisition library as a mask.
Implemented with 230bc33
