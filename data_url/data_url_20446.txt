Hi Dr. Stebila,
I asked my question/possible bug in the code here initially to see maybe if I am wrong or not. There at crypto.stackexchange they suggested the new repository might have the issue fixed but it is not. It would be great if you could look at my question and see if I am missing a point or not. In the question, there is a link to SageMath code to verify my claim.
Thank you,
Amir
Entries in that table are little endian in terms uint64_t words.  Notice how the last word in each row increases until it reaches 0xFF...FF, and then the middle word increases until it reaches 0xFF...FF, and then the first word.
