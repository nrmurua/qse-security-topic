In the following example, I would expect setting invert_mask to True to make these two circuits equivalent. They are deemed equivalent by cirq.testing.assert_circuits_with_terminal_measurements_are_equivalent(), but lead to different measurement results.
This produces the following output:
It looks like the fast simulator doesn't invert but the slow one does.  If you append an X to the first circuit it gives the correct result.
I have a fix for this.
