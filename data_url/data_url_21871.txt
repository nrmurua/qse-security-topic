get_adc uses self.gains, which is not carried over between experiments. As with other similar cases, this should be noted in the docs.

It is noted and adjustable through the device_db.
True, I'd forgotten that it's documented there. Do you think it would be worth adding a note in get_adc as well (in practice, it's easy for a user to forget to go back and look at the constructor docs)? If you strongly feel that this is redundant/pointless then I'm fine with that.
