This is a really cumbersome way of checking the equality equivalence of two programs --- furthermore, it doesn't take into account programs with the same DAG but different temporal operations list.
A useful feature would be to overload the Program.__eq__(self, other) special method, in order to perform the nx.is_isomorphic check (similarly to that done in CircuitSpecs.compile, but also taking into account parameter values).
That would allow us to simply do assert prog1 == prog2 in the tests.
It would also help provide useful tracebacks, by indicating which gates and/or parameters differ

This has now been coded up in tests/frontend/test_circuitspecs_chip0.py (see below). The next steps are to:
Move this function over to program_utils and write tests
Write an additional function, program_equality, which is stricter, and returns True if and only if both programs contain the identical commands in the identical order (by looping through cmd1, cmd2 in zip(prog1.circuit, prog2.circuit)).
