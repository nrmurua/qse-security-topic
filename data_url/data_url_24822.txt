The pulse class hierarchy intends to let PulseTemplate objects control their translation to waveforms via a hardware-dependent Sequencer object. It is not yet clear, how the interface of Sequencer and the interaction of PulseTemplate and Sequencer must look like. Specifying this is crucial for implementation.
Part of #13 .
A prototypical interface with the temporary name PulseHardwareUploadInterface (instead of Sequencer) was specified. Exact handling of conditions/triggers for branching is not yet finally clear but the current interface should provide a framework to solve this.
