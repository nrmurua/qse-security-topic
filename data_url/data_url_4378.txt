I was trying to fix the MVC branch previously and I have created MVC 2.0 branch to do so.
Unfortunately, build (macos-latest, 3.9) fails though the Windows and Ubuntu versions work. Can you advise me on what are the potential things that I should look out for?
@shangtai I have restarted the failed job, please have a look: https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/actions/workflows/deploy.yml?query=branch%3Amvc2.0
Thanks @scarrazza  I did the same thing for QAP as well, should I open a pull request for the branches to be merged?
Yes please.
Completed.
