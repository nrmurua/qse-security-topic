With #841 we added interactive notebooks with Binder.
However, currently the binder image gets updated against new commits on the master branch.
This means that, given the high frequency of commits merged on master, many users will experience a new build of the image from scratch, instead of finding the saved image that Binder uses when it is on par with the latest HEAD.
There are two solutions for this that come to mind:
Note that also in options 2a and 2b we could add an action to be fired up every time there is a change, to be sure the waiting time goes down to the minimum.
My proposed solution, even if it may be short-lived, is to change the  master branch with the release in the binder link). We should do it after the next release, as that one contains the binder/ folder and fast-build instructions.  Then we assess how to change the policy if/when we leave the release branch format.
This is likely what will address this issue: https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action
We would for each release, build and push a docker image to Docker hub and then cache it on mybinder.org for the fastest possible spin up. I would also consider enabling this on PRs so then it can comment with a link to use a cached binder image from the PR's latest commit: https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action#cache-builds-on-mybinderorg-and-provide-a-link
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
