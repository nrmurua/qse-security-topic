Unable to use pre-compiled binaries for lightning.qubit. Running the code keeps falling me back to default.qubit with the above warning. I have both Pennylane and Pennylane lightning installed. Pennylane version is 0.28.0. Current pennylane-lightning version is 0.28.0.
I tried following the instructions on here https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning to try and build from source as recommended by the error.
However, I keep running into issues after this line pip install -e .

Hi @QuantumFall
Thanks for reporting this. It appears that for Windows the compiled libraries are not available on path.
This looks to be a Windows-specific issue. We will look into a fix, and get this fixed as soon as possible.
Hi @QuantumFall We have updated the released wheels for PennyLane Lightning to correct the above issue. Can you try upgrading your installation (python -m pip install pennylane_lightning --upgrade) and letting us know if this fixes the issue you had?
Also, just a note, building Lightning under Windows is not as easy as under Linux or Mac, due to some additional steps required to ensure the wheels build successfully (e.g. a working Visual Studio installation, up-to-date Python version with all supporting libraries, and some additional Powershell scripting once built). If you would like to compile Lightning from scratch for development purposes under Windows, I would suggest using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (wsl) instead, as this offers a much better development experience.
Thank you, that fixed it for me!
