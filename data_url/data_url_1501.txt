Description of the issue
Subcircuits allow negative repetitions, which cause each gate to be inverted. This inversion is not performed when gatesets iterate the subcircuit.
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
0.14.0.dev
Kind of annoyingly, one could even populate the gateset with the specific measurement gates (with measurement key repetition id prefixes) and it will fail unless the subcircuit is fully unrolled (including repetitions). Or maybe unrolling it completely is just the right thing to do.
Personally, I think negative reps is a bit of a misfeature and could be removed. It seems to me that "inverting a circuit" is a big operation that should not be hidden behind a sign in the number of repetitions.

From discussion on the Cirq sync: the issue exists in the interaction of Gateset and CircuitOperation. As @daxfohl suggests, the correct behavior would be to fully unroll the CircuitOperation to correctly identify the operations it contains.

Supporting negative repetitions is convenient for recursively-defined circuits, where a given CircuitOperation may need to be inverted multiple times before finally being executed. That said, I don't have an example of such a use case offhand (and such cases are likely at the edge of NISQ anyways), so I'm not deeply opposed to removing the behavior in favor of readability. That said, I think that change is separate from the issue here.
