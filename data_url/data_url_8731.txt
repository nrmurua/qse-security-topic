When I try running the example here: https://softwarequtech.github.io/SimulaQron/html/ConfNodes.html#starting-a-network-from-python I get an error.
When I do 'python test.py' in the terminal, it prints:
Do you want to add/replace the network test in the file /home/liam/MEP/simulaqron_exercises/testexample/tempvenv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/simulaqron/config/network.jsonwith a network constisting of the nodes ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']?
When I type yes, it prints the same message 6 times in a row.
If I type yes after that, it gives the following:
Hi @shyadow!
Ah right, I forgot the the code needs to be guarded by the __name__ == '__main__' gatekeeper check. The code should be:
Note that I also added a call to input since otherwise the network will be closed whenever network goes out of scope.
I will update the example in the docs. Let me know if this works for you in the meantime.
The original issue doesn't occur anymore. I do get errors if I try to use the nodes with cqc though.
For example, using your code to start the network:
gives the following error:
@shyadow try to set the argument network_name in the CQCConnection as:
That seems to work.
