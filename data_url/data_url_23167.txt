one reason: constant writing to config file by pyrpl
I am not sure what would be expected, for instance, when I change asg0's amplitude in the config file, this doesn't affect the value of p.rp.asg0.amplitude unless I reboot the software. Do we expect a live tracking of the config file values while the software is running ?
Concerning the constant writing to the config file: it was indeed the case when the na was running because of a bug during iq widget creation (_autosave_active was reset to True eventhough the iq was slaved)---> solved
For the rest, after discussions, I believe we have converged towards the following solution:
The config file is not supposed to be touched while the software is running, but there will be a special button  "Edit yml" in the GUI. This opens a text edit dialog with the yml code and a "validate" button.
I suggest to add a menu per module (this would become--->load/save/erase/edit yml)
The menu "edit yml" then allows to edit either the current state, or one of the states saved in memory.
we have agreed that the yml-editor of each module is responsible for managing the updating of pyrpl from the config file. directly touching the config file while the program is running is not recommended any more
