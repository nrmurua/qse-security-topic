Currently, we are exporting some one-letter objects e.g X, Y, T, H. It's convenient for simple cases, but can be troublesome for more serious development especially when using Yao inside other packages. e.g
In Julia it's quite often to use T or S as a TypeVar, however, it's quite easy to get a strange error if someone happens to forget the declaration of where and the linter/compiler cannot recognize this error since it's a legal expression.
The new interface would look like ConstGate.H, ConstGate.T etc. (we only export ConstGate module instead), users can still use these one-letter objects by using ConstGate if they feel that's more convenient but will be on their own.
