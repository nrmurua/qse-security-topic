Disabling both signature schemes result in a compilation error. To reproduce:
This is fixed in how we handle algorithm enable/disable in the new SIG API on nist-branch, as far as I can tell (for example https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/nist-branch/src/sig/test_sig.c has no array with entries dependent on #ifdef's).  So I'm inclined to ignore this for now since it will be fixed when we switch to the files from the new API.
Sounds reasonable.
