As the component developer can't influence which junction they want, since that is from the front end user. The component developer merely has that there are multiple junctions via add_qgeometry, but they aren't able to specify which junction_cell goes to which add_qgeometry since that is a value they don't have access to
Thinking something using a list and some further tweaking for add_qgeometry would handle it though.
A possible solution is to have add_qgeometry within a QComponent process the list, and make individual add_qgeometry entries to QGeometry "junction" table.
Users can provide a list rather than a single junction
Add word gds so we can search on this issue.
Spoke with @thomas , we need to discuss with early adopters what their needs may be for the quantum devices they are developing.  If the users don't need this, we may not add this feature.
The issue was for consideration of  qubits like "xmon squid", and "fluxonium qubits".
