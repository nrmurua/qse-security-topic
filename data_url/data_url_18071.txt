The tests are use-cases and they should show the proper way of instancing the objects. Furthermore, creating Qobjs from dictionaries was used as a transition and should be deprecated.
@ewinston what's the status of this issue?
@delapuente working on this now. Is this independent of the from_dict method referenced in #652?
Yeah, actually, I think this is the same as #652 and we could close it. There is one legit use in the test cases and we should remove it by fixing #721.
Ok, I did some updating of the tests to use 0.6 methods as described in the issue description. If those look good maybe we can close this PR with that? Beyond the from_dict methods, which seemed mostly reasonable, there didn't appear to be any dictionary defined qobj.

Are those changes in a PR yet?
@delapuente  I believe these changes have been updated in another PR. Shoud we close this?
Which one? Is it merged?
Seems this issue is solved - Qobj.from_dict() seems to be only invoked a couple of times in test_qobj.py and test_schemas.py, which are legit use cases. Please reopen otherwise!
