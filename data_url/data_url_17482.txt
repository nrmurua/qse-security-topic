When indexing a QuantumRegister, indexing can be done recursively and therefore infinitely.
My first suggestion would be to restructure the QuantumRegister as a list of some inner Qubit object. Since these objects are only used for book-keeping on the qubits, it would make more sense to separate the collection functionality and the qubit functionality into two classes.
See also #1647, which raises a similar concern with the usability of QuantumRegister.
@kdk The fixes that would address this issue would also address my issue. Should I close/delete this then? They're not exactly the same but the fix for #1647 would also fix mine.
@Woody1193 Great, I'll close this then.
