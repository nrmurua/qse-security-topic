The pulse CmdDef essentially reads in assembled schedules provided by the pulse backend. Currently, the CmdDef from_defaults method is essentially a pulse disassembler. This functionality should be offloaded to a true disassembler.
@taalexander looks like @lcapelluto deprecated CmdDef here 1f9fb32 and from_defaults method moved to PulseDefaults class constructor.
Do we still need disassembler?
I think it would still be very much appreciated! The CmdDef was deprecated in favour of the InstructionScheduleMap (May being renamed see #3593 to track) and the defaults.cmd_def and defaults.pulse_librarywere replaced by an instance ofInstructionScheduleMap, defaults.circuit_instruction_map` (also may being renamed).
We are closing this since we anticipate that the provider will be responsible for this
