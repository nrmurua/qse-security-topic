Things should keep working
Notebook fails with socket related connection issues from Tornado and ZMQ.
Regular internet (browsing etc) is flaky too
We suspect that sockets are leaked and not cleaned up. This may be in the VISA driver of
network instruments such as ZNMB20 VNA

One way of reproducing this it to use both PYQTGraph and matplotlib using the qt5 backend.
This is probably because two different qt event loops are started.
Doing:
Seems to be sufficient to get
Not sure why it is needed to create a Mock Model?
A bit more investigation. This can be shortened to
The Mock model starts a server process so using the multiprocessing so thats probably where the issue is
The output from netstat -tnl contains a number of localhost sockets that I believe
are coming from the Jupyter ZMQ internal communications.
Shutting down the notebook after a crash ends up in something like:
These sockets never seems to be fully closed
This is probably caused by a combination of the fork and the fact that the qt eventloop sets up additional sockets

So I suggest, Rewrite mock instruments to not depend on Model. This has the added benefit of making the tutorial simpler.
Add a warning to the QCodes process to ensure that we catch any unintended use of multiprocessing remaining (there shouldn't be any thats not behind the config option)
It's also possible to reproduce the issue without qcodes or QT.
Simply start a long running background process and try restarting the notebook before joining it.
@jenshnielsen  closing this as we at least removed multiprocessing.
Agreed. For the record there may still be issues with the pyqtgraph remote proxy thread. So if we see something like this again, that would be where I would look
