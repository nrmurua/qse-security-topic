When trying to draw a QuantumCircuit object using .draw(output='mpl'), I'm getting AttributeError: 'Instruction' object has no attribute 'label' in qiskit/visualization/matplotlib.py. The circuit draws fine using the default text drawer.
The code is adapted from the linear_systems_of_equations HHL tutorial notebook. Here's a (probably non-minimal) snippet to reproduce:
No errors, and the circuit is drawn correctly using Matplotlib.
Not sure - I don't know whether this could be a Terra visualization problem or an Aqua circuit design problem (or just a problem with the code above).
There is already a fix in progress for this issue: #4389 It's caused by certain gates (or circuit library elements that were converted to gates or instructions) missing a label attribute which the mpl drawer incorrectly assumes is always present.
Hi, is there an ETA on a fix for this?
This should be part of the 0.15 release which is scheduled for two weeks. #4389 is fixing this ðŸ™‚
Awesome, thanks ðŸŽ‰
