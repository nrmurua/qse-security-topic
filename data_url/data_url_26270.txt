Given a quantum channel, determine if it has the property of being unitary. For more information on the definition of a unitary quantum channel, consult example 2.14 in this textbook.
The gist of how to implement the main idea of the function can be performed by first checking if the input to the function is in the form of a Choi matrix. If so, convert it to its corresponding list of Kraus operators. If the length of this list is equal to one, the channel is unitary.
The functionality for this should be created in channel_props/is_unitary.py with corresponding unit tests found in tests/test_channel_props/test_is_unitary.py. The docs should also be updated in /docs/channels.rst under "Properties of Quantum Channels" with toqito.channel_props.is_unitary.py
Hi @vprusso, I will try to do this feature this week :)
Hi @victor-onofre. Cool, have at it, and have fun! Looking forward to your contributions.
I have made a pull request for this function. I will wait for any comments.
Thank you @vprusso!
Looks great! Just a few small comments posted for you. Thanks again for your contributions, @victor-onofre!
Thank you so much for reviewing my code @vprusso. I have made the changes to the function.
Awesome, merged! Thanks again for the contribution! :)
Closing as per #72
