I run this example in my Windows 10 environment.
seems that Version: 0.2.10 is deffer with the https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/qbsolv/en/latest/intro.html documentation.
How should i find correct document for the Version: 0.2.10?
or is it the bug of Version: 0.2.10?
Hi @pererahasitha , I believe this should be fixed by the latest release of dimod https://github.com/dwavesystems/dimod/releases/tag/0.8.6.

Try running pip install dimod --upgrade and let us know if it resolves the problem
