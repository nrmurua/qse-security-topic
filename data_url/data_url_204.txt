Most HPC centres use singularity or apptainer and not docker.
One can convert docker containers to the ones mentioned above.
Can we please have instructions on how to do this in the documentation?
Thanks team.
We used Apptainer for the QAL workshop, so we can share our experience here. As mentioned in the issue, Apptainer can convert docker images to Apptainer images, but we did encounter few obstacles during this experience which are worth noting:
First, creating and running the image - This is the command I used to generate the Apptainer image from the docker image:

To run the Apptainer in VSCode’s Remote Shell, I changed the following settings:
Then, I added the following to the SSH config file
