Hi all,
In the specification, omega value = 49, psis  = sqrt(49) = 7
However, when I tried to replicate the pre-computed table, i see there you was using psis = g = 7 to generate omegas_bitrev_montgomery table.
In addition, by looking at omega content, one can spot that omegas_bitrev_montgomery and psis_bitrev_montgomery share NEWHOPE_N/2, which mean psis_bitrev_montgomery include the omegas_bitrev_montgomery table.
Is it suppose to generate like this
No security issue here obviously, is this an optimal implementation purpose ?
Please let me know.
Thanks.
Thank you very much, you're absolutely right! I pushed a change that fixes this with both changes to the script and the naming of the constants.
