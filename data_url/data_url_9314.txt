Describe the bug
In the Waveforms portion of the documentation there are references to kernel functions for the smooth method but clicking on them brings the user to a Github 404 page.
Expected behavior
Each of the kernel functions should have its own "panel", like smooth and the other functions under Waveforms. Furthermore, if a user clicks on one of the function names anywhere in the page it should jump to the corresponding panel.
Kernel function documentation now appears properly in the Waveforms section ðŸ˜Ž
