When #97 has landed, it would be goodness to find out why everything slows down by at least an order of magnitude if a Rainbow L3 algorithm is activated.
After checking this one can be excused for being surprised the system doesn't slow down more than a factor of ten when Rainbow is active: Keygen (done during test and install) is about 3 orders of magnitude slower than reasonable OQS sig algs --> Suggest to disable Rainbow for good by default -- also along the lines discussed here. Objections, @xvzcf @dstebila @christianpaquin ?
Closed for v7 with #105 ; oqs-v8 doesn't enable Rainbow by default any more. oqs-demos also updated accordingly.
