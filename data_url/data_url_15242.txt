Currently to add circuit drawing styles one needs a setup file that sets the default path to the styles, eg something that looks like this:
However when doing so one looses access to the builtin options, save for default.  It would be nice if the settings.conf file appended styles in a dir to a set that includes the default rather than changing the path.  That way an user has access to both builtin and custom.
This is a bug, the intent of that was it was an additive path as you're describing. If it's excluding the defaults (assuming there isn't a name collision) then that's a bug in the config file handling.
I'd like to work on this
I'm not sure I understand what the problem is here. If I have settings.conf with
on my local and there's a file in .qiskit called user_style3.json, this circuit,
produces

which comes out of the styles dir. Following that with
produces

which comes out of the .qiskit dir and is correct for that user style.
Hmm, let me try again, could be my mistake
If I do qc.draw('mpl', style='iqx') then I get
/Users/paul/mambaforge/envs/qiskit/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qiskit/visualization/circuit/matplotlib.py:163: UserWarning: Style JSON file 'iqx.json' not found in any of these locations: /Users/paul/mambaforge/envs/qiskit/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qiskit/visualization/circuit/styles/iqx.json, ~/.qiskit/iqx.json, iqx.json. Will use default style.
self._style, def_font_ratio = load_style(style)
which I guess I assumed was due to messing around with the paths, but it looks like the JSON files for the default styles are not found on any of my machines.
This might have something to do with #8306. The styles dir was moved to visualization/circuit. You might still have a styles dir under visualization, but not sure why they would not have been moved.
If you moved the directory the json files lived in you'll need to update the manifest file: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/MANIFEST.in#L9 That file controls non-python data files we include in the package.
@mtreinish Yep, that's it. Second time that file has caught me. Do you want me to do a PR to update the manifest file?
