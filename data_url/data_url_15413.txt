The example code for HHL from the docs
works if a backend (quantum_instance) is not passed toHHL().  It says explicitly that a statevector simulation is done in this case:
quantum_instance: Quantum Instance or Backend. If None, a Statevector calculation is
done.
However if one passes a statevector simulator sim = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator') then the example above fails with: ValueError: Expectations of Mixed Operators not yet supported..
do the above
it should work
