See the bug reported in #3008 . The implementation of ParameterTable and the associated binding machinery operate under the assumption that a given Instruction instance will appear in only one gate in a circuit, but this isn't guaranteed.
e.g. a user could write:
Users of Instruction.repeat would see the same problem.
#3013 worked around this by forcing deepcopies of instructions when broadcasting, but this doesn't resolve the general problem.
