Not very sure to be honest, but here is my code. I am very new to this so please forgive my vague answers:
It's just supposed to run at least once properly.
max time of the algorithm could be changed?
IBMRuntimeError: 'Failed to run program: '400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://runtime-us-east.quantum-computing.ibm.com/jobs. {"errors":[{"code":1217,"message":"Session has been closed.","solution":"Reduce time between submitting subsequent jobs in a session.","more_info":"https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/quantum-computing#error-handling"}],"trace":"ci3hdtm1o26hu34621sg"}''
This is discussed here https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/C7SJ0PJ5A/p1686610666043249
As I pointed out to you there, there is max time limit for usage - for open usage on a real device this is 4hrs which in that thread is about the time that your code ran before its Session was closed. Maybe break the loop and do it as different jobs on different Session/Estimator.
There is not a problem with VQE, as such, more that Runtime is limiting the usage - hence I am closing this.
