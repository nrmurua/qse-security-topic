Logging tests weren't being executed because of missing init file. After adding an init file in #389 they are failing CI.
Done. Fixed in PR #393
closing since it was fixed in #393.
I reopen this issue since logging tests continue to statistically fail, in various environments:
Python 3.8 tests, see an example here:
https://travis-ci.com/github/Qiskit/qiskit-ignis/jobs/349549848
Windows Python 3.6 tests, see an example here:

Python 3.6 Tests on OSX:

@mtreinish thanks for looking into this and adding the temp dir solution in PR #424. I didn't know that tests run in parallel, this explains... and I agree, using a mock FS is what we need here.
Matthew, @chriseclectic, I'll work on the mock FS solution
