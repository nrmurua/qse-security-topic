Hi, I would like to import Standardon qiskit.aqua.components.qfts. But I am facing a 'No module named ...' error.


import the method Standard as qft
I guess that the structure of qiskit.aqua.components has been changed. Could you please guide me where could I find a Standard or qfts?
The QFT was moved to the circuit library in Terra https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/tree/master/qiskit/circuit/library/basis_change and you can see the published docs for it here https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.QFT.html#qiskit.circuit.library.QFT
Hi @woodsp-ibm, thank you for your reply. Oh, I see. Then, I will look into the document. Thank you. :-)
