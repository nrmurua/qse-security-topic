Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/main/cirq-core/cirq/experiments/qubit_characterizations.py practically implements single and two qubit clifford groups in order to do sampling. However the implementation is inefficient taking ~3s to sample 1000 cliffords. that's because the clifford groups are implemented directly as matricies and operations are done as matrix multiplication, inversion or mapping to/from index.
Describe the solution you'd like
update SingleQubitCliffordGate 
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
the single qubit case was done in the linked PRs. the two qubit case is not needed for now but we can revisit this decision when there is a use case
