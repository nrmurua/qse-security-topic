The pulse Snapshot command should align with the circuit Snapshot. This means:
name should be changed to label. As all Instructions may have a name this can be made an optional kwarg. If name is not supplied it should default to label.
snap_type should be changed too snap_label and it shoud be made a kwarg with default value statevector.
As there is currently no simulator, I believe it is safe to make these changes without a backwards compatibility shim.
Hi taalexander, new to the community. I found the pulse Snapshot object, but where is the circuit Snapshot object you're referring to? Just for reference. Is it extensions.simulator.snapshot?
That is the one ðŸ˜„. Welcome to the community! Please feel free to access any additional question you may have.
Looks like the snap_type equivalent in extensions.simulator is snapshot_type. Is that what you mean instead of snap_label?
If so, here's the proposed __init__:
I'd also add the (new) name param to __eq__ and __repr__:
I'd also add a @property label function to match, and it looks like there are a couple of changes to be made in converters.pulse_instruction and a test script as well.
This looks great @chowington, thanks for taking this on!
No problem! I think I'll not print name in __repr__ if it's the same as label, as that's still a valid definition and is clearer to the user who didn't provide name:
I'll get a PR up!
