In order to improve compilation times, parallelize circuit compilation would be a great addition.
I wanted to open this issue to discuss ideas and ways of implementing it in our current architecture.
The goal is to land an implementation for 0.6.
I made #701 fixes this issue and it seems the conversation is happening there.
