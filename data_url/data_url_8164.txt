Hi.How could I use the Hamiltonian in mesolve.I mean for time dependent Hamiltonian I need to know the elements of  Hamiltonian that mesolve use.
Please give more details, e.g. a simplified version of the problem you want to solve or an example of code. QuTiP has tutorial notebooks and documentation that you can refer to for function API.
