I have a question on the definition of the readout fidelity for the TensoredMeasFitter (see TensoredMeasFitter docs ). It is defined as the average of the diagonal entries in the individual calibration matrices. But this does not reflect the fidelity of the overall system. This also means the fidelity is not equal to the fidelity we can when we project a full system onto components and then put the components in a TensoredMeasFitter . A minimal example
The output is:
Is there a reason for the current definition of the readout fidelity in the TensoredMeasFitter? Or would it be better to refine the fidelity to be more in line with the CompleteMeasFitter?
