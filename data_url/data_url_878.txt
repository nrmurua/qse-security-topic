Describe the bug
Additional context
QPU_REGIONS does not have an entry for the new Aspen-9 device (active while Aspen-8 in maintenance).
(Eventually, it would be preferable to not hardcode the regions of course)
I'm currently fixing it by re-initializing the QPU_REGIONS of the AwsDevice class and including the missing arn.
I imagine there is also a way to instead configure the region via an AwsSession but I got stuck trying to do that (please let me know if there is a nice way to do it).
Screenshots or logs
Full stacktrace:
I wasn't able to reproduce the issue, and from the stack trace, it looks like a boto3/AWS problem rather than a Braket SDK problem. Do you have a region in ~/.aws/config?
I just set a region in ~/.aws/config and:
That's really strange, because as of #207 QPU_REGIONS isn't even necessary anymore; Device.__init__ will search other regions until it finds the device in question. What does your .aws/config look like? It should be something like this:
With a corresponding entry in ~/.aws/credentials:
What error are you seeing now when you've set your region to something other than us-west-1?
My ~/.aws/credentials did not have a region in it (I had followed the instructions here, which also don't show a region line in ~/.aws/credentials)
When I add the line, so that my config and credentials look exactly like the ones you pasted, my stacktrace looks like this:
When I change the region line in credentials and config to us-west-1, the Rigetti device now works.
Btw, I'm running 1.5.9.post0 but that's just two days old so should fine?
Thanks for your help!
I still can't reproduce the issue, but regardless, a change (#215) is in the pipeline to remove all hardcoded ARNs. Feel free to use the feature/region branch until this change is merged.
Might also be worth rechecking your version from within Python:
The line numbers in your stack trace don't line up with those in the code:
In fact, if you look at the the AwsDevice changes in #207, you'll see that lines 330 and 355 in the before column line up exactly with your stack trace. The last version with these lines was 1.5.8.
#215 has been merged into main
Hmmm strange, braket._sdk.version is indeed '1.5.9.post0' but let me do some investigating and get back to you

Okay cool so actually things now work when I have a region in ~/.aws/credentials !
Feel free to close.
