Hello,
qBraid currently flips the qubits order when transpiling Qiskit, Braket, and Pyquil circuits to and from Cirq, and Pytket. Transpilation within these 2 groups {Qiskit, Braket, Pyquil} and {Qiskit, Pytket} preserves the order.
Example: Qiskit to Cirq
This outputs
Now transpiling to Qiskit
This outputs
I realize that this is not really a bug but rather the transpiler was designed to reverse qubits in some cases (using the rev_qubits argument). But as a user, I expect the circuits to not get flipped. It is not a major issue but I thought I could open an issue to discuss whether it is a judicious choice to have the qubits flipped.
Hey @mmlouamri, thanks for bringing this up. Qubit indicies are sometimes flipped in the circuit drawings because of the different ways the packages index qubits with respect to a given unitary matrix. For the qiskit and cirq circuits you gave above, if you calculated and compared the unitaries, you would find that they are equal. But if you instead constructed qiskit and circuit circuits that produced the same circuit drawing, the unitaries would not be equal, e.g.
So this is where the trade off comes in. We can either (1) choose to maintain equivalence of circuit drawings
Or (2) choose to maintain equivalence of unitaries

We initially chose unitaries, but for many, this gets confusing, and the circuit drawing being the same is important. Maybe we could take a poll on our Discord and see what other community members think?
