When I try to run
from grove.amplification.oracles import basis_selector_oracle
it returns the error:
After downloading the file from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/quantum-grove/1.2.0 , i find that there is no utils folders inside the grove folder.
Thanks for flagging @rasa97 . We'll take a look at this!
@rasa97 When I install from a source distribution, I don't see this error. When I install from pypi, I do. (As you said)
This should therefore be fixed in the next release. Thank you for the bug report!
I have the same issue and I installed mine using pip. Is there a current workaround before the next release of grove? Should I just manually download the utils folder from here and place it under grove?
Thanks
@ogamel One option (the one I've been using) is to clone the repo, and use pip install -e path/to/grove.
Sorry for the inconvenience! (We should be releasing a new version soon...)
@rasa97 @ogamel We just pushed a new release to pypi. This should hopefully address this install bug.
@ogamel @rasa97 I verified on my MacOSX and Ubuntu16.04 that this works now:
