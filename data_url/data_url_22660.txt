What's the proper way to handle multiple tcube devices? I have 7 tcubes in the Penning lab. My understanding is the intent is for each device type to share the same port (3255) But this doesn't seem to work. I have 7 tcubes in the Penning lab. Example device_db.pyon.
One controller per tcube device (as you did) and if they are on the same machine, you need to use a different port for each. The default ports of controllers are just for demonstration purposes or simple setups, and the port allocation should be adapted to particular laboratory configurations.
