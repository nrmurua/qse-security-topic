Following QISKit Basics tutorial. This import failed:
ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
 in ()
1 import numpy as np
----> 2 from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
3 from qiskit import execute
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit'
It looks like you have not installed qiskit. Did you try
yes, but it works now, using:
pip3 install qiskit
great. Yes, it only works with python 3.
Same error here as well, I have Python 3.7.4 and I am using Jupyter notebook to execute Qiskit. However, I am getting the same error :
I have done the pip install qiskit and pip install qiskit[visualization] commands both.
I have added the path to qiskit folder that is created under Python3, which strangely has only 1 file inside it to the path variables as well.
Any insight as to why this is happening? Your help is much appreciated!
