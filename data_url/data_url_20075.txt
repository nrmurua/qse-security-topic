As per a comment by @baentsch on this PR, do we want to add constant time checks for aarch64?
That does seem like a good idea. We'll need to run those test suites on an ARM machine though, since it's a runtime test.

Yes. FWIW/reminder: We have an aarch64 VM at AWS that's regularly running profiling on that architecture and which might be used for this, too.
