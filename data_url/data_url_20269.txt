The circleci nigthly build  has been failing since the merge of PR #547. The build times out after 10min. I suspect the 8 new algs (compressed SIDH/SIKE param sets) tip the compile time above the limit.
We should see if pushing the limit solves the issue; this circleci support article explains how.
@dstebila, is that something you can change on the circleci test?
Let's see if 0fd5556 fixes it.
0fd5556 does fix it.  Closing for now.
