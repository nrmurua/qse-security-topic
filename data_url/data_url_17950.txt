The Pauli operators from qiskit.tools.qi.pauli are the canonical Pauli matrices, but qiskit uses the convention |up> = |1> = [0, 1],  |down>=|0>=[1, 0]:
which gives incorrect results since the standard gate set is defined for the basis |up>=|0>=[1,0], |down>=|1> = [0, 1].
This, for example, gives an incorrect result when plotting a density matrix on the Bloch sphere, as pointed out by @chriseclectic.
See above.
The expectation value of the Pauli ops on a density matrix, or equiv a state vector, should return the correct eigenvalues, or equiv the correct vector on the Bloch sphere.
The Pauli ops from this module are used elsewhere, e.g. aqua, so we need to think a bit.
Closing as off topic.
