You write:
test/v1x/python/test_condex.py fails to finish very often
Can you be more specific:
Many thanks for the comment, Hans.
GitHub Actions don't give much information about what's happening. Since pytest is being run without much verbosity on, you don't even know what test case within test_condex.py is causing the problem. You only know that test_condex.py never finishes. The Test step for the Python/MacOS job simply gets stuck at that point.
Since I don't have a MacOS machine, I will see if I can reproduce this issue by compiling with clang++ on my Linux/x64 machine. If I cannot reproduce it that way, I will add more verbosity to pytest and run this specific job through GitHub Actions to get some more insight.
I can imagine a lot failing, notably in the mapper. The mapper may depend on a random number taken. But we should only start suspecting the mapper when we know that it is consuming its time there. Because Pablo also took care to take the randomness out of the mapper.
Looking forward to the results of your bug hunt.
I could reproduce the issue yesterday in my personal laptop. The test case that is never ending sometimes is the last one, the Toffoli one. I haven't dedicated more time yet to debug it.
