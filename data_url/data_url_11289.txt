Succeeds with python-2.7
Hmm, haven't seen this one before. You run into this while trying to install the develop branch?

No, it's with version 0.4.
@yurivict Would you mind trying again after replacing the line
with
in setup.py?
@yurivict wait... I just realized you can't do that if you're installing from pip; you'd need to get the source code (for instance, by cloning this repository) and install it from source.
The problem seems to be that on some systems (including @yurivict 's), Python uses the ASCII encoding by default to read files, but we probably didn't limit ourselves to a 128-character alphabet when writing the README. So perhaps we should update setup.py to explicitly specify reading with UTF-8 (by making the change I mentioned above).
If you make that change and Travis doesn't complain, I'll happily merge.
@yurivict would you mind trying to install the develop branch and letting us know if @kevinsung 's PR solves your problem?

Wow it turns out that Python 2.7 does not support the encoding keyword argument to open. How did my PR pass Travis?!
Wait this can probably be fixed with __future__. Incoming PR...
@yurivict would you mind trying to install the develop branch one more time? PR #291 may have resolved it. I cannot replicate this error on my machine so your input is crucial.
Yes, now the problem is gone.
Excellent we'll close the issue then. Thanks @kevinsung !
