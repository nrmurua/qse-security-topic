Description
The draw_chimera function takes a NetworkX graph as input. The docstring says "Should be a Chimera graph or a subgraph of a Chimera graph" which can mean either that its edges must be a Chimera lattice subset or that the NetworkX graph must be generated by chimera_graph, it's unclear which is the intention.
Assuming the former, if the NX graph is missing some chimera_index attributes, the function returns the obscure NetworkXError: Found infinite path length because the graph is not connected error because draw_chimera tries to calculate the graph's diameter in 
To Reproduce
If I either add the chimera_index to nodes in the two-tile NX graph or stick to the nodes of a single tile (due to
