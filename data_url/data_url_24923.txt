If I create a ParameterSweep object and plot the spectrum using dressed_spectrum from sweep_plotting.py, the spectrum is generated correctly. However If I attempt to impose my own ylim values using say dress_spectrum(sweep, ylim=(4,5)), the minimum y value is correctly taken into account, however the maximum y value is ignored, and the figure still plots all the way up to the maximum eigenvalue generated by the ParameterSweep object.
Thanks for catching this. This is fixed with c0463fc
