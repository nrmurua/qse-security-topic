The names of the variables could be obtained from pinfo.get_all_variables_names()  as set of strings. It would be nice to see a function like  pinfo.getValue('var name') to return the value(s) of the variable name(s) of the HFSS model obtained from the previous command. This could be something like functions get() and put() used in C++ sort of classes.
I wanted to use get_variable_value(self, name) function in class HfssProject(desktop, Project) from ansys.py. I had problem in getting handles for desktop which I tried to get from class HfssDesktop from the same ansys.py. The function get_variable_value() has also set_variable(var, value).
Not sure I completely follow. You can post minimal working code if you want.
We will have a working group meeting for pyEPR soon:
