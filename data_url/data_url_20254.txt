@drucker-nir, the new BIKE code from #576 is failing on our continuous integration system in some AVX512f-related code; see https://circleci.com/gh/open-quantum-safe/openssl/1192 which contains error message:
Are you able to assist?  I don't have a machine with AVX512f on it.
Another build failure as well in https://circleci.com/gh/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/3189:

This one is unrelated to AVX512f and could be fixed by making rotate256_big static.

Thanks Franziskus, have tried it in PR #592.
Fixed by #593.
