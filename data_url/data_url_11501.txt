When running the qsvm tutorial with the latest scipy (1.6.0) the tutorial fails in the qp_solver module trying to run cvxpy to solve the quadratic programming problem with a mismatched dimension error:
Run https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/machine_learning/01_qsvm_classification.ipynb with scipy 1.6.0 installed.
The tutorial works without error
It looks like this is being caused by a mismatched dimension between P we pass into cvxpy as part of the quadratic programming solver and when cvxpy tries to make a sparse block diagonal array with the input it errors because the dimensions differ, probably (n, 1) != (n,). We should either fix the issue in qp_solver, or if it's an issue in cvxpy's internals report this upstream and try to get a fix.
We run that same tutorial on the Aqua CI and it passes on python 3.8. For a recent run:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/runs/1824072555?check_suite_focus=true
Also, our CI saves the tutorials as artifacts that can be downloaded. I downloaded the artifact tutorials3.8.zip and looked at the notebook in question and it seemed fine to me. Our tutorial CI is using scipy 1.6.0:
Requirement already satisfied: scipy>=1.4 in /opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/3.8.7/x64/lib/python3.8/site-packages (from qiskit-aqua==0.9.0) (1.6.0)
There is a problem with cvxpy 1.1.8 installing on python 3.7 and we pinned this to !=1.1.8
The difference in the qiskit/qiskit CI is that it runs on released aqua and not master  (since they are run to verify that the versions in the metapackage are compatible and don't regress/are backwards compatible) Looking at the git log I'm wondering if 739e330#diff-373b76176a94d6c7d7584735fbb83cfde7d8b4f678431361d7ae85958f5b323a fixed this issue. I know we're in a weird place being in the middle of a transfer but maybe we want to push that out as part of a 0.8.2
I'm also working on trying to fix the CI jobs in qiskit/qiskit, the numpy 1.20.0 release and cvxpy 1.1.8 release broken things have it stuck pretty good. But, once it's working again I can try removing the constraints pin and seeing if the job works
@mtreinish Did you get a chance to check as per above?
No longer relevant
