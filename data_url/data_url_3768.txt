@tarballs-are-good Any clarification on the error and what triggers it?  Thanks!
@rallim, thanks very much for the bug report!
There is no problem with your code. The problem actually was that there was some stray debug code that accidentally found its way into production some time ago that wasn't caught. (Funny that debug code caused a bug.)
It's fixed now. I've tested your example and it should work fine. To verify, cxn.version() should now give 0.5.1.
