It seems like one needs a delay of 500 us between dds.init commands for different dds'. If not, there is an RTIO sequence error. I tried sending init commands through the dds_bus.batch but also got an RTIO sequence error.
For example,
with self.dds_bus.batch:
self.dds0.init()
self.dds2.init()
Any idea why the delay is necessary?
dds_bus.batch is for sending regular set commands and cannot be used with init. The delay is necessary because the DDSes are initialized one by one and you need to wait (mostly) for the end of the DAC calibration.
So the DAC calibration is about 200 us for a 2.4 GHz reference clock. Between the dds_init commands I need a delay of about 250 us which seems reasonable. However, that was the ref_period argument of "core" in ddb.pyon was set to 1ns. If it is set to 10 ns (assuming 100 MHz reference to core device), I need 2500 us between dds_init commands. Why is this the case?
Also, why can't dac calibrations be done in parallel across DDS'?
ref_period should be 1/8 of the clock input period on KC705 (and the internal clock is 125MHz).
Calibrations can be done in parallel but this is slightly more complicated and I see no use for this feature.
