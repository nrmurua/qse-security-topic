When using the transpiler "compile" function, with multiple circuits (a circuit array), on a real device (such as "ibmq_16_rueschlikon"), the following error is returned:
MapperError: 'initial_layout qubit q0[0] not in input DAGCircuit'
This error does not happen when compiling only one circuit, or when compiling on a simulator backend.
I think this is related to some of the errors in the complie that I posted as #704. Ie I think we are using the layout from first circuit and in later ones the gates are not supported on the layout.  Thanks for pointing this out itâ€™s a good test and we try to fix it with the other errors in #704
Do you have an idea to work around this issue in the meantime? Without having to run N seperate jobs, and thus having to wait for the ibmqx5 queue N times.
Yeah by giving it the layout you want to use for all circuits.  Let me try to prof of concept and I post here later.
Thanks!
I believe that if you explicitly name your quantum register, e.g. name='q', the same for all circuits, then it should work.
Yes @nonhermitian is correct.  I thought the cX was changing by one each time. Which also would fail
Indeed, explicitly naming all circuits quantum registers with name = 'q', and specifying an initial_layout seems to work. Thank you very much for your help!
Great.  This will be fixed in the next update.
@nonhermitian can you move the example into my #704 so we track it and use it as a test with the transpiler work and I think we can close this now that @tibaloo has a solution.
Closing this now.  The fix has been added and tested in #704.
