Describe the bug
When I create (run) a quantum task on Aquila value of my queue position is larger than the value of the device queue depth.
Might be true for other devices as well, but haven't checked.
To reproduce
Expected behavior
Task queue position on a device shouldn't be greater than the total device queue depth.
System information
Hi @ryanhill1 - thanks for raising this issue. This has to do with the update frequency for the queue depth. We will look into exploring options to improve the UX here.
Hi @ryanhill1, we've flagged this process to be improved internally. In the meantime, we're going to improve our documentation to let customers know that these numbers are approximate.
