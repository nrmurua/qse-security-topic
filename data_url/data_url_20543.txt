hello
i want to use tls connection with falcon signature with openssl 1.1.1 (server) and openssl 3 (client).
after this open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider#125 i can not use this signature (falcon).
please update the falcon (O)IDs in openssl 1.1.1.
Thank you in advance!
Thanks for this reminder. Could I ask you in turn to chime in to this discussion? What are your arguments for keeping maintaining OQS-OpenSSL111? What is it that you cannot do with OpenSSL3+oqsprovider?
