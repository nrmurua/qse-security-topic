I am trying to install qiskit through pip on IBM DSX (Data science experience). Running Python 3.5 with Spark 2.1 Notebook.
Following the steps on the QISKit main page ( https://www.qiskit.org/ ) and here in this paper - https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/stable/1_introduction/running_on_IBM_DSX.ipynb
I always get to the point where I need to install qiskit:
pip install qiskit
Every time I try the installation fails with the following error:
running install_egg_info
Copying qiskit.egg-info to build/bdist.linux-x86_64/wheel/qiskit-QISKIT_VERSION.data/purelib/qiskit-QISKIT_VERSION-py3.5.egg-info
error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'qiskit.egg-info'
Failed building wheel for qiskit
Running setup.py clean for qiskit
Also tried to clone the repo and rename the install.py.in file to install.py and run pip install ./qiskit-sdk-py/install.py but the error comes up.
Hello @pep3e ,
there were some changes in the build system for the latest 0.4.9 release that might the cause - however, I'm having some trouble reproducing the issue. Could you paste the output of these commands in your environment, to try to narrow down the issue?
Also, could you confirm if the following line you pasted has been copied verbatim (ie has not been modified by you when writing the issue)?
The reason for asking is due to the last line of your comment - the file setup.py.in is not meant to be copied and renamed manually, and that copy and rename might be causing that particular error. Could you try running in a new folder:
and attach the full output on your reply, in case it fails to install again?
Hello Diego,
The problem was that I didn't have cmake:
pip install cmake
fixed my issue. Thank you for the help
Glad to hear, @pep3e ! For the record (and for reference if the same problem is encountered by other users), on the upcoming QISKit releases, cmake will not be required for installing via pip - it was a temporary byproduct of the latest changes.
Hi @diego-plan9, I'm currently reworking the DSX install instructions and am having this problem as well. This is the error I get when I try pip install qiskit, even when cmake is available:
running install_egg_info
Copying qiskit.egg-info to /gpfs/fs01/user/s048-114a05d8c2ea2f-aeaae8f7ca3a/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/qiskit-0.4.9-py3.5.egg-info
error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'qiskit.egg-info'`
Do I need to specify a particular version of QISKit?
Hi @attp let me jump in with @diego-plan9 permission.
I have just uploaded a prebuilt binary package compatible with DSX. Try to install again:
... and let me know if somehing is wrong.
Thanks @atilag - it works now. :)
pip install cmake ,is works fine!!! and then pip install qiskit
