Recently, a printout of the stress tensor components has been added to the CP2K output. I observe the following issues:
Is this issue still present?
Yes.
The output you pasted is produced by two different routines: write_stress_tensor and write_stress_components.
As you correctly assumed, only the former takes the cell volume into account.
The cell volume is also missing here when atomic pressure is enabled.
So, I guess we should fix both occurrences.
Fortunately, in f77_interface.F and motion_utils.F we seem to have gotten it right.
