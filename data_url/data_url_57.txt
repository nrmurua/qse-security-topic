The following code only passes in emulation, but not in library mode. The bug is a qpp dimension issue (more triage needed to determine what impact, if any, on nvidia backends), meaning we will likely need to update somewhere along the function stack of qpp::applyGate.
Runtime error:
Run the above code with nvq++ test.cpp && ./a.out
The behavior should match the output of nvq++ --target quantinuum --emulate test.cpp && ./a.out .
Note: the reason this is an issue only in library mode is because of the compiler passes that are specific to emulation. They will redefine the multi-controls as two qubit gates, circumventing the dimension issue.
Not a regression
