For statevector simulations we can use faster classical evaluation schemes for the gradients, as proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02823 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02991. These methods are significantly faster than the current ones as they (1) asymptotically scale with one less power (linear for gradients, quadratic for natural gradients) and (2) have no overhead from constructing circuits and going via primitives.
The code for these methods is implemented using Qiskit in https://github.com/Cryoris/surfer. The gradient version works for any circuit, but the QFI code doesn't currently support repeated parameters.
Solving #9053 first would simplify this PR and avoid more refactoring afterwards, putting this on hold ðŸ™‚
The gradients part is tackled in #9287 but the QFI is not yet there, relabelling this issue for 0.24.
