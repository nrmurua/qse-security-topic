some comments for your consideration. no blockers, happy to merge.
will need to review again but just very small stuff so far
what does this do?
magic. see previous comment here and/or mypy docs here.
tl;dr it's an escape hatch provided by mypy to allow you to import a module when you need the types only for type checking purposes, but importing the module at runtime would result in an import cycle.
