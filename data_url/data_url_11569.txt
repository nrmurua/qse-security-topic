Only some pathways of generating the circuit in GroverOptimizer add measurements, meaning an exception is thrown when trying to inspect the simulation result.
Take the Grover Optimizer tutorial notebook and run with qasm_simulator rather than statevector_simulator.
The algorithm should terminate with the same result as when using the statevector_simulator.
When generating the circuit within GroverOptimizer.solve(), make sure both branches can add measurements.
