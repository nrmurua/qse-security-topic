The teleportation.py tutorial in the examples folder is very outdated, and uses functionality latest seen in v0.11.0 (e.g. the strawberryfields.utils.scale function). It should either be updated or removed.
It can be found here: https://github.com/XanaduAI/strawberryfields/blob/master/examples/teleportation.py
Running it with any later versions of SF causes the following error to be raised.
Good catch ðŸ˜¨
it also contains  Coherent(1+0.5j) | q[0] which causes ValueError: The arguments of Coherent(r, phi) cannot be complex
newbie here this was actually the first example I tried to run, this error is an easy fix but I also wanted to print the circuit and can't find a way to actually do it, prog.draw_circuit() causes UnsupportedGateException: Unsupported operation Coherent(1, 0) | (q[0]) not printable by circuit builder!
