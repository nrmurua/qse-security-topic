It seems that all the commits in PR's done recently in ignis (e.g. last week or so) fail due to failing tests for tomography (not related to the PR's themselves).
Since the code for tomography in Ignis has not been changed recently, maybe it's due to some change in Terra?
All of these tests seem to fail due to the same error:
This is fixed in #333 but the tests still fail because the statevector simulator might produce a statevector that does not pass is_valid (e.g. array([[0.77015115, 0.22984884]]) has norm 0.9999999972600072 instead of 1)
#333 was merged, this issue can be closed.
