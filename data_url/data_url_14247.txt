backend.max_circuits returns None for V2 backends
I would naively expect that this would return the same value as the V1 backend (900 in this case):
No response
According to BackendV2 documentation:
The maximum number of circuits (or Pulse schedules) that can be run in a single job.
If there is no limit this will return None
Maybe there is no limit for fake devices?
