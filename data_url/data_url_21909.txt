On a freshly started coredevice with artiq_run and nothing else running:
Now starting aqctl_corelog:
And reattempting the experiment:
Persists after killing aqctl_corelog:
But after a while (in this case ~5 minutes) it recovers:
Experiments submitted through artiq_master and artiq_run are also different. On artiq_master the RPCs take ~5ms while on artiq_run they are around 2.5ms
That's probably because of moninj. Moninj, session, and corelog all compete for CPU time, and since we use a round-robin scheduler without any kind of readiness notification mechanism, adding one more thread increases the average latency by poll time plus schedule time plus (in case of corelog) two context switch times.
And poll time plus schedule time plus two ctx switches are 400k cycles? Or is that the scheduler tick?
The scheduler is cooperative so it doesn't have ticks. It switches to the next thread once the current one blocks on something.
400k cycles were spent rotating the log ring buffer in place. I am now observing exact same performance with or without aqctl_corelog.
@whitequark Please fix this in release-3 as well.
Ah sorry, didn't notice the milestone.
