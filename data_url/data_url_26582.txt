Hello devs,
Would it be possible to add conjugate gradient as method for solving diagonalization-based SCF? CP2K farms this step to programs like lapack, so it doesn't seem like it would be hard, but I'm not sure.
Thanks.

Hi
with DIAGONALIZATION / OT and MINIMIZER CG you can request a conjugate gradient diagonalization using an orbital transformation scheme to handle orthogonalization. It is not exactly what is usually done in CG diagonalization, but is very close.
I see Juerg, this makes sense. Thanks.
