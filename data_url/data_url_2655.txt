Calling copy.deepcopy on a Circuit object fails because the __deepcopy__ method of a Circuit does not take a second argument. Also, it looks like this method is actually attempting to perform a shallow copy.
Would it make sense to get rid of the __deepcopy__ method and just use the default deep copy operation?
Moments are sorta-kinda intended to be immutable; that's why the deep copy looks like a shallow copy. But perhaps if someone is calling deep copy they're violating that expectation (which isn't really written anywhere...) so point taken.
