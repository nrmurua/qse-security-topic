Fails saying the shape is (2, 2, 2, 2). If you use an empty circuit (and specify the qubits) you instead get shape (4, 4).
Good catch.
I think numpy is smart enough when you reshape tensors, but I assume we should always do (n, n) for density matrix or (n,) for state.  Should we consider adding versions of these that return the tensor form of these?
I think we should always do (n, n) for now.
Ah note that you are doing out.final_simulator_state.  That's the internal "simulator state".  The right way to get this is out.final_density_matrix.
So yeah the issue here is that the public facing stuff should be in trial results and step results, but not in the "simulator state".  That way you can't do it the "wrong way" without considerable effort and using "_" classes.
Fixed in #1678
