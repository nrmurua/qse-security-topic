Register parameter always uses paramtype='numeric' when creating the ParamSpec, regardless of the type of parameter to be registered. This is problematic when we try to register array-valued parameters.
A proposed solution is to check the parameter type. As a side note, using the ArrayParameter is undesirable as the shape of the array needs to be specified beforehand; this is a different, albeit related issue.
A work around is to use ParamSpec directly and not use 'register_parameter'. We can add the ParamSpec manually to the data set.
I think this is indeed a bug, but let me add a bit of background before we turn everything back into arrays.
At some point we agreed to convert ("unravel" was the word, if I remember correctly) arrays into numbers to avoid having binary blobs in the database. For a 2D sweep of, say, V1 and V2 with a signal Y, that entails converting what would be a table
into a table more like
That's probably good to keep in mind when solving this issue.
I would also add to this that MultiChannel parameters dont currently work with add_parameter, also perhaps this is written somewhere but is there a function to get the data out of the database if it is saved as a binary blob? get_data and get_values didn't work for me? mention of both also in #1200
