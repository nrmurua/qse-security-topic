When I try to simulate the circuit qiskit Aer throws a type error (via qiskit/validation/fields/custom.py from sympy/core/expr.py)
TypeError: can't convert complex to float
Here the screenshot of a code that reproduces the issue:

Simply initialise the state vector to the given numpy array
I don't know where the problem lies.
Interestingly it works if I use
BasicAer instead of Aer:
@Croydon-Brixton I can reproduce this error on Aer 0.2.3  / Terra 0.8.2, but when running your example code on Aer master / Terra master it seems to already have been fixed.
The reason it was working on BasicAer before was that initialize isn't a basis instruction for that simulator, so it was being unrolled to a state preparation circuit of u1,u2,u3,cx gates.
