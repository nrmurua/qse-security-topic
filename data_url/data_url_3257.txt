We should benchmark v4 and v3 to quantify any potential performance improvements
This has been done, at least as it pertains to the v4.0 milestone. Will find a place to publish the benchmarks, but in short pyQuil v4 shows distinct advantages in parsing and serialization of programs, execution, equality checking.
The only slowdowns that were observed was in building programs from pure Python. This is likely due to the compatibility layer between pyQuil and quil, as well as the fact that Rust is safer in its mutation patterns. Many things that operated on mutable references in v3 don't fly in Rust and necessitate making a deepcopy of the data. In many cases these differences are minor, and others can be worked around by using things like in-place addition.
