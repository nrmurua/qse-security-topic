Lists of params are not parsing in the readthedocs auto-built documentation, e.g.
http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/forest.html#pyquil.forest.Connection.bit_string_probabilities

The docs seem to build fine locally with the params properly parsing.

@pkaralekas You did a little digging on this. Did you find anything of note?
