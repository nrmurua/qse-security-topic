I'm running the following code (with varied values to shots and backend_options):
This code runs a circuit which terminates in a Pauli expectation values, and, because of a bug in Aqua (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/issues/1015), also appends measurement gates to all qubits at the end.
Here are run times (in seconds) on my machine with Qiskit 0.19.3:
With Qiskit 0.20.0:
I didn't verify that the circuit (before and after transpilation) remains the same in the two versions of Qiskit. So in theory this could be an issue in Aqua or Terra. I suspect Aer because we recently modified the sample measure mechanism.
I see now that the circuits are somewhat different between executions (because of the randomization). Nevertheless I argue that this does not explain the run time results.
My guess is something changed (either in Aer or Aqua) to prevent measurement sampling getting applied in 0.20
I double checked and measure sampling should still apply with snapshots in the circuit. However if Aqua changed to append unused measurements in 0.20.0 the difference could just be the overhead of the measure sampling itself.
Aqua added the unused measurements already before 0.20.0
If the findings described here are still correct, then we need to fix it (a fix in either Aer or Aqua). I'm adding this to my list of tasks.
I created a simple circuit with measurements, and checked the run time of the statevector simulator for different numbers of shots. I don't see a significant difference between Version 0.19.3 and the current version. So I vote for closing this issue.
