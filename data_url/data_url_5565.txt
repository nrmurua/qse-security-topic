I am writing code to do noisy simulations using the Aer simulator. When I execute my code in my local jupyter notebook, I will get the error.
The Kernel crashed while executing code in the the current cell or a previous cell. Please review the code in the cell(s) to identify a possible cause of the failure.

However, if I put my code on the online IBM-Quantum-Lab, I won't have this issue and my code can be executed normally.
My noise model contains depolarizing_noise and thermal_relaxation_error. I tried to remove the thermal_relaxation_error out from my noise model, and my code can be executed locally without any problem.
The code example above should be executed.
I found that if I change `method='statevector'' to 'method='density_matrix'', the above code can be executed. However, the execution time will be far longer.
I reproduced this issue on my Macbook. This is from installed BLAS (heevx) problem because this is not happened in Linux environment though their inputs are the same. Anyway, I would like to find workaround.
I have the same issue on my mac.
