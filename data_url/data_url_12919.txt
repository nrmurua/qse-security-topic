On the travis CI it looks like tests are only being built (cmake -DTWEEDLEDUM_TESTS=on && make run_tests) but not run (./tests/run_tests). Travis sees this as success.
Locally, doing ./tests/run_tests is throwing the following errors:
Thanks for the heads-up. This is actually a known 'problem'. What happens is that those benchmarks were written in an older version of tweedledum and never really updated. The discrepancy on the results are due to bug fixes.
At some point I think I did change this hard coded magic numbers, but seems I never pushed the commits and now I should go back to double check them. The annoying part of checking stg_from_spectrum is that tweedledum cannot verify the synthesis result on it own, it requires using an external simulator.
