with parallel: time error with loop
I have a question about the with parallel. If I use some loop function, the output time sequence is incorrect, while it is corrent for the "regular experssion".  How to solve this problem when using a loop function?
Please see the code below
the loop expression is
the result of which is

the regular express is

In a parallel block, each statement is inside an implicit sequential block (this should be in the manual). This includes the for loop statement.
This behavior will be changed in NAC3 ARTIQ (most likely ARTIQ-8) where only function calls in a parallel block have an implicit sequential, and it will do what you want.

Thx a lot!

@sbourdeauducq this appears to be a breaking change to the parallel context as discussed in #1555, where I strongly advocated against such breaking changes because of the impact on legacy code.  Why is this occurring?  The compromise discussed in #1555 was to make a separate context (e.g. deep_parallel or something).  Can we discuss? I propose discussion be carried out in #1555 and not here.
