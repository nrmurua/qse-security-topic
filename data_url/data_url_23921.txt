This is really weird, but I would say that 'drag' shapeFun is not applied to q2(qubit) even though 'drag' is selected in ExpSettingGUI and ChannelParams.json file looks right. I have both q1 and q2 set up with drag. When a qubit pulse is plotted in jupyter notebook, I see  only q1 with DRAG pulse, not q2. q2 shows only gaussian waveform. Also, in real measurement, I verified that the DRAGCal does not work, indication there's really no DRAG on q2.  I even tried adding q3 and q3 doesn't work with DRAG, either.
I am currently using this branch for QGL : https://github.com/Plourde-Research-Lab/QGL/tree/JPM. Also, I attached a zip file that contains json files (ChannelParams, Instruments, Measurements, Sweeps, and DefaultExpSettings).

The amplitude of your drag correction is set by the dragScaling parameter. It is set to 0 in your ChannelParams, so I think that's why you're seeing a simple Gaussian.
You are right; the dragScaling was set to zero in the json file attached. However, even if I put non-zero dragScaling, the plot for q2 in jupyter notebook looks the same---gaussian.  As I mentioned, the DRAGCAL in qlab during which the dragScaling is swept just fails with q2. I know there is nothing special about q2, but only q1 works with drag. :( Because the plot is already wrong, this looks like something to do with QGL.
@jaseung were you able to find where the problem was? Sorry for letting this slip, but it's not always easy for us to debug on a different fork
