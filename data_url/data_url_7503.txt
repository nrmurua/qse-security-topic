I try to define a density matrix \rho on a register and apply a quantum circuit. However, directly use the function "ArrayReg"
get wrong solution
I wonder if there is any way to apply the quantum circuit on a general density matrix in Yao?
Thanks for the issue. Could you please paste the code as a code block?
FYI: Github uses markdown editor. The Syntax highlighting section is about how to paste code.

Or you can quote reply (top right corner) to see the source of this reply.
BTW: a quick answer to your question. Yao's register can not simulate density matrix.
The best you can do is simulating on the purified matrix. (waiting for your code...)

I have uploaded the code. Sorry for the delay...
No worries!
The purify will perform eigen decomposition.
If it is too costy for you, there is a hacky way to do this using the relation rho_out = U rho U'.
BTW, the reason why your code does not work is, the default constructor view the second dimension of your matrix as the batch dimension rather than the environment. The correct constructor is
You will see the first type parameter (batch size) is 1 now.
I'm going to close this, but feel free to open a new one if you have other questions.
