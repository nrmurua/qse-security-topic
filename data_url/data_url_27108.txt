Dear developers,
I am a beginner of dcore and I came across the following problem.
First I install dcore, triqs, triqs_dft_tools properly. (No error prompt and all modules can be imported)
Then I copy the example of 2D Hubbard model from the documentation web (dmft_square_pomerol.ini)
No problem in running
dcore_pre dmft_square_pomerol.ini
But when I run the True DMFT loop with
dcore dmft_square_pomerol.ini --np 1
it stops with the prompt
I saw the following message in the output file
Could you help me figure out what does this message mean and how can I solve it?
Thank you very much in advance!
Best regards,
SH
Hi, what is the version of TRIQS? Can I have a look at the full error message?
Hi, I encountered the same error message when trying to run the main loop of dcore. Is there a recommendation how to resolve this issue? This is using triqs-3.1.x and running the example of srvo3 (using the alps/ct-hyb solver). Happy to send log files if useful.
The error message is the same as above (only last python error quoted here):
File "/.../triqs/lib/python3.6/site-packages/triqs/gf/gf.py", line 135, in delegate
assert isinstance(indices, (type(None), list, GfIndices)), "Type of indices incorrect : should be None, Gfindices, list of str, or list of list of str"
AssertionError: Type of indices incorrect : should be None, Gfindices, list of str, or list of list of str
Thank you for the report.
I will work on it.
the alps/ct-hyb solver means this one?
https://github.com/ALPSCore/CT-HYB
yes, that's correct. It's initialised in the .ini file as follows:
[impurity_solver]
name = ALPS/cthyb
timelimit{int} = 90
exec_path{str} = /.../ct-hyb/bin/hybmat
compiling the impurity solver and running its tests worked without any problems.
I somehow failed to reproduce the issue:
I'd appreciate if you describe how you installed triqs and DCore.
There may be something to do with Anaconda, I guess.
Could you install a development version and set the following environment variable?
This forces DCore to use the internally bundled version of TRIQS.
Thanks a lot, installing the development version with the environment variable worked fine. Is there any disadvantage in using it like that?
In case it is of any use, if I don't set DCORE_TRIQS_COMPAT to 1, I get the following error messages in the output file (replicated once for each MPI task), which is the same as above:

For the triqs installation, this is pulling it from the GitHub repository and compiling it myself. The compilation goes through fine and passes all tests for triqs (i.e. make test shows no failed tests).
Is there any disadvantage in using it like that?
As far as I tested myself, there is no disadvantage.

This is weird... I have no idea.
Hi. I have same problem with examples here:

but this doesn't help me

Hi, how did you build the triqs/cthyb solver?
The solver must be built with -DLocal_hamiltonian_is_complex=ON -DHybridisation_is_complex=ON.

I used the following command:
sudo apt-get install -y triqs_cthyb
does it have to be installed via the sources?
does it have to be installed via the sources?
I think so. I am using my own ALPS/CT-HYB regularly.
Dear developers,
I try to run a DCore calculation on ISSP supercomputer System B (ohtaka) by MPI job using following impurity solver 'ALPS/cthyb'
[impurity_solver]
name = ALPS/cthyb
exec_path{str} = /home/issp/materiapps/intel/alps_cthyb/alps_cthyb-51cf6b6715ced29cb1f9c1266556691490a035b7-gcc/bin/hybmat
timelimit{int} = 300
For the example of 2D Hubbard model, it works well. But when I apply it on a real material, the calculation is stopped by an error 'Thrown exception Acceptance_rate_global_shift was measured on only some of the MPI processes.' in 2nd iteration, which can be checked in dcore.log or output file in work/ directory.
And in dcore.err, there is an error
File "/home/issp/materiapps/intel/triqs/triqs-3.0.0-0/lib/python3.8/site-packages/h5/archive.py", line 211, in getitem1
raise KeyError("Key %s does not exist."%key)
KeyError: 'Key Sign does not exist.'
Operators of ISSP said they found no problems with System B and suggested me to report the error in here.
Is it possible to solve this problem?
If you need more information or error messages, please let me know.
The error message indicates that the total simulation time is too short or one Monte Carlo step took loo long to accumulate Monte Carlo results. Do you have more log messages from the solver?
Yes, there is, but I could not find the difference of log messages comparing with successful calculation.

Thank you. I need to check the omitted message. Could you upload the full log message from the QMC solver as a zip file?
Thank you very much!
I just notice that I can upload files in the comments.
These are files that were used to report error to ISSP including input files and output log files.
I hope their are useful.

The simulation time seems to be too short. Could you increase the total simulation time?
Perturbation orders just before and after measurement steps are 26.4284 and 45.2751.
These two numbers should match roughly.
Thank you very much!
It worked for a low precision, cheap calculation. I am trying another a little heavy calculation.
