qc2 = transpile(qc, backend)
it should work
No response
You likely need to reinstall with pip install -e . to trigger the setuptools entry points to register the unitary synthesis plugins.
I cannot just work in the dir anymore?
You can once you've re-run pip install -e . once - the new unitary synthesis method registers an entry point for plugins, and the default plugin (and the AQC) needs to register itself with that.  That only needs to happen one time when a new plugin is added, and after that you'll be able to work as before.
Ahh cool. Thanks for the info.
