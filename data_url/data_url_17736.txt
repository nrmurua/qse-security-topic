When attempting to draw some circuits which contain barriers using the circuit drawer, an error is produced.
Should produce the error "Error during Latex building: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1} \\\\barrier{1'" .
It may be worth noting some other circuits, such as the one below, do not have the same issue and they circuits can be drawn.
So the underlying issue here is that the drawer is trying to draw 2 barriers next to each other the on the q[0] bit line in the same column of the qcircuit xymatrix. This is breaking the regex used on measure when looking for a \barrier{} string to adjust the spacing for the measure box: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/tools/visualization/_latex.py#L972 so instead of returning the string 1 it's returning the string '1} \\barrier{1 While I can try fix the regex so it doesn't fail on this the output circuit won't be right because it'll look something like:

because we'll be drawing 2 barrier lines right on top of each other.
Instead of the desired:

This means that this is actually a duplicate of #1124 which is about things not being spaced properly when there is a barrier. So I'm closing this issue so we can track the fix there.
