need to setup CompatHelper for this repo. I need to check how subdir works for CompatHelper.
Hello @Roger-luo! I would be happy to work on this. Could you please assign me?
I'd like to work on this as well. Can you kindly assign me to it?
@ACE07-Sev there is already a PR trying to fix this (but it is not working) if you also want to work on this you can submit a new PR, but I'd encourage you to take a different issue
@Roger-luo I have updated my PR to also include subdirectories inside lib to scan in CompatHelper. Could you please review it?
@manulpatel I don't think it works https://github.com/QuEraComputing/Bloqade.jl/actions/runs/5127411880/jobs/9223001629
@Roger-luo Yes I have made changes and opened up a new PR. I hope this should work. It seemed prior had issues with "" quotes in subdirs.
@Roger-luo. I have opened a fresh PR, which setups CompatHelper only for main repo i.e. at top dir. For subdirs I tred to follow this but there are errors when scannnig inside lib dir. Your insights on this would be very helpful.
@manulpatel reminder that if you get this issue closed by June 20th, you'll be eligible for the unitaryHACK bounty!
Thanks @natestemen for reminding! Actually I am stuck on this and not able to pass the CI tests for my changes.

I just did that I'm not sure if this works or not, please let me know if it doesn't.
