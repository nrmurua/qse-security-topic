Deferred after 0.7.
My vote is to keep the folder structure (with the known changes mapper -> transpile) and removing unrollers and then just have aer, aqua and ignis added into the structure at the correct places.
Since we decided aer lives in qiskit.providers.aer I don't see why we need this renaming. Let's close this.
