Lack of feature parity between Quil <-> pyQuil (along with things like CONTROLLED and DAGGER).
Also, Program maintains gate definitions separately from the "executable code" (Program.instructions). Perhaps this would also be appropriate for circuit definitions?
@kilimanjaro do you think that the current behavior (maintaining gate definitions separately) is useful? I know it's caused some headaches in terms of copying Program objects before, and I don't know the original reasoning behind it
