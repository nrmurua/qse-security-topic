the newest mkl(Math library for intel) version(2019) can not work on QuTiP 4.3.1. I rollback it to mkl(2018.0.3), the qutip.testing then work well.
If using mkl(2019.0), there will MKL read problems, like:

Can anyone repeat this?
Yes, I have seen similar errors on my windows when running the tests. Looks like memory error

And replacing the last MKL by MKL2018 does not fix the problem for me.
Any more robust solution?

How can I  rollback it to mkl(2018.0.3)? I just use "conda install mkl=2018" but the test still return errors.
I met the same errors as you described.
I also have this same issue, even after re-installing Anaconda3 and qutip from scratch.
Rolling back to mkl=2018.0.3 did not help.
