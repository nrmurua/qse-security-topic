I expected something different.

Did the cvxopt package install for you ok? Its there in pip list where you are attempting to run the above. The pre-built pkg for cvxopt on PyPI is for Python Win 64 bit system only. I have seen before someone attempt to use 32 bit Python and there is no cvxopt for 32-bit. Since I do not see python37-32 in the path I would assume it was 64-bit but checking.
CVXOPT for Windows requires a special build of Numpy. You need to download and install a relevant numpy wheel in the following link.
