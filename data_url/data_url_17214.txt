@dcmckayibm can you add some more details on what's required here? I can help implement it, but I'm not sure what is really needed for either bullet point.
Oh, I kind of forgot I left this open. I think this has been solved in the simulator itself. See cells 8 and 9 of https://github.com/dcmckayibm/qiskit-aer/blob/openpulse/example/pulse_sim.ipynb
