@nathanshammah I recall that you were looking into something for this? Did you have suggestions in mind?
For the main documentation, I don't know.
However if we want a list of tutorials/examples/implementations which are automatically executed this is great:
https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html
For example this is a typical result:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/
The source of each example is just python script with comments. The rest is automatically built by sphinx-gallery.
@willzeng In the comment to  #72 I meant that I think it is already done, as we have doctest as extension in the conf.py file. But building it and playing with the python block, I do not see a clear error message. So I will investigate this further.
@andreamari I really like sphinx gallery. We are currently adding it to QuTiP. I did not include it here as extension as it was giving some error in the conf.py but I think it would be amazing to include it, will look into it and ping you if I get stuck.
Ok, so there are basically three tools that help with this: mainly doctest (python core) and then  pytest, which that does testing in general, and sphinx, which builds the docs.
It took some time to disentangle this, and I am not completely sure of the findings, but at least happy of what's somewhat clearer now:
Currently, I added a dummy example in factories.py on a private branch, to check what was happening, below is copied the quite long error message. Basically the modules need to be implicitly imported for doctest to properly run the script.
This is just an update, while I keep working on the solutions.
Closed by #105.
