examples/pdb.pyon is missing from github. artiq_run.py errors without it.
And, all the examples are broken. Example below
It's examples/master/pdb.pyon and you should run the examples as artiq_run repository/xxx.py from the master directory. Works fine here.
The other problem is purely LLVM related and should be discussed in issue #50 as I believe this is where the problem is coming from.
I see #50 is resolved and a new build is finished (build 1228). I've updated but still get the same error.
It is not resolved.
And there has been no new build. Packages are still broken in relation to issue #50.
#50 is reopen, I'll have a look.
