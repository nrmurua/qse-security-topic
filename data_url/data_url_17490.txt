You can not use an initial_layout when circuits with differing numbers of qubits are input to compile.  This is true even the circuits are smaller than the size of the layout passed, i.e. the layout is valid for the subset of qubits in the smaller width circuits.
MapperError: 'initial_layout qubit q[2] not in input DAGCircuit'
Given that we allow compiling circuits with different widths, I would expect that we can supply initial_layouts to these circuits.  If we are not allowing this, then terra should throw the proper warning before trying to compile the circuits.
The issue about extending initial_layout and coupling_map as a list continues in #1945 (comment). For this issue, I will fix the "terra should throw the proper warning before trying to compile the circuits" part.
