Thanks for the previous fix. Now, I start to run bigger circuits.
Here is a test case to show steiner is 100 times slower than swap.

Though I don't characterize that as a bug yet, it looks unusual.
Would you please comment on the issue?
I run these:
We are aware of this issue. It arises because we do an additional layout optimization before the steiner mapping, but it can be disabled:
Basically after we generate an initial layout, we do a "hill climb" by repeatedly swapping two qubits in the layout and running a simulation of the steiner mapping algorithm. This gets quite expensive for a lot of qubits, so we have an option to disable it. We only did this for the steiner mapping as the initial layout seems to have a greater effect on the final cx counts  for this algorithm than for swap.
We're hoping to go back to this problem and find a more scalable solution, but that's getting into active research. The layout optimization was a nice stop-gap that gave a boost of performance for small circuits where the scaling isn't an issue.
Very nice. Thanks.
