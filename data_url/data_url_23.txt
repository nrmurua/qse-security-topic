This issue was introduced with the update to pybind11 2.11 (appears to be a pybind bug). pybind version 2.10 and below work. Easiest fix would be to lower to pybind 2.10 until a fix appears in a future version. pybind 2.11 (appears to be a pybind bug). pybind version 2.10 and below work.

Looking at changelog, pybind11 v2.11.0 introduced pybind/pybind11#4631 and pybind/pybind11#4623. These changes recursively check if a type is movable.
Previously pybind11 relied on std::is_move_constructible, now, it has own implementation.
Refer test case: https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/blob/master/tests/test_copy_move.cpp#L383
qview is copyable but, qvector and qudits are non-copyable and non-movable. Also, not sure if related, but, std::span isn't supported in default bindings. (pybind/pybind11#4177).
Attempt to reproduce the behavior stand-alone:
