The method _get_layered_instructions in qiskit.visualization.utils.py makes the assumption when placing gates into layers for display that all conditions and all measures are on registers only. Using bits will crash all 3 drawers as shown in the circuit below.
The following circuit
Fails with,
Other errors occur with differing circuits.
Code shouldn't crash.
This will require a fairly complete rewrite of the layering code for the drawers to account for both registers and bits being conditions and measure targets.
Yeah, this seems like it's another manifestation of the old assumptions that registers were the primitive, and bits were purely an element of a register.  That's the case in all the drawers for the purposes of picking labels as well:
I think we probably need to make sure we're all on the same page that registers are now just "a handle to some bits", and then perhaps look at the drawers (and plenty of other places!) with a high-level view that we need to change some assumptions.  Thanks for finding and reporting this - it's good to try to stay on top of these things!
Yeah, I feel like a lot of this transition has been a bit ad hoc. A high-level overview of this would be helpful with some clear guidance on how we want to present it qiskit-wide. #6761 is the next level that may not work in some hidden places.
Can you assign this one to me?
Sure thing, thanks for all the work on this stuff!
