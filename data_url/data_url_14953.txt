This is likely because the named gate (DiagonalGate) is not explicitly supported in the gates in the following code branch: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/e9f8b7c50968501e019d0cb426676ac606eb5a10/qiskit/qpy/binary_io/circuits.py#L282-L289
The error message should have said that the DiagonalGate is not supported when it is not covered by the if-else checks in the _read_instruction.
No response
The traceback:
Thanks for the report.  The fix should be a case of adding the string "diagonal" to the check of line 282 in your code link - DiagonalGate is an old gate that has its constructor and params fields behave in slightly different ways to most Qiskit gates.
Let me resolve it by adding diagonal
