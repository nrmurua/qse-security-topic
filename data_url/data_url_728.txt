The staq issue has been fixed.
It turns out that the qpp has a similar issue. If you use the QEngine to execute this simple file, i.e., a file with a comment line without a newline/linefeed at the end, the engine will hang.
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg a[1];

@DevelopDaily thanks! Q++ has code from staq, I'll modify it accordingly.
@DevelopDaily Done
