Hi everyone,
I got this error message when sending a problem to DWave's Leap Hybrid CQM Sampler. Any clues on what could be happening / who is the system admin?
Thank you!
Hi @gumix97, this seems to be an internal error (or perhaps a bug) on server side. We'll look into it and get back to you.
In the meantime, if you have a code to reproduce it, and can share it, that would be great. If you share the code, maybe we'll be able to suggest a workaround to unblock you in short term.
@gumix97, looks like forward slashes (/) in constraint labels are not handled properly, and that's causing this issue.
Until we fix this, a temporary workaround is to avoid the use of slashes in your constraint labels (during CQM formulation).
Hi @randomir, thank you for your response. Does it include every way to express a division (**(-1),...) or only the slashes? I've been trying with other expressions and I unfortunately still get the same error.
@gumix97, you can still use whatever (supported) operator in your expression -- just don't include / in your constraint names.
For example, don't do this:
Not sure how exactly you formulate your problem, but if you're generating constraint names automatically, e.g. from some dataset of labels, check you don't have slashes in that dataset.
Thank you @randomir! I will review al the code to see if there are still any slashes going unnoticed.
