You published this  nearly a year ago. Any updates on benchmarks?
You pointed out:
The most likely explanation is that the former [QuTiP] uses sparse matrices during computation, whereas the latter [Quantum++] does not.
The fundamental data types in Quantum++ are non-sparse vectors and matrices.
My questions:
Do you know by now the QuTiP outperforming Quantum++ in that test is indeed attributed to the sparse matrices?
Could you please elaborate a little more on why your design decision favors non-sparse vectors and matrices considering the apparent performance benefits of using their sparse counterparts?
Thanks.
I did not re-benchmarked the system. I decided to use dense vectors mainly because of simplicity of implementation, and also because for non-trivial (not very small/shallow) circuits, the state vector becomes relatively dense quite fast. I believe that indeed QuTiP sometime over-performs Quantum++ due to the fact that it uses sparse matrices.
