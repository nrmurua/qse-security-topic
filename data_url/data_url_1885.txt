Description of the issue
I'm doing some tutorial jupyter notebook, and I cannot import anything from cirq.google, not just XmonSimulator. I'm running lubuntu 18.04, python 3.8, jupyter_core 4.6.3, and cirq 0.8.2. What can I do?
How to reproduce the issue
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
 in 
4
5 from cirq import Simulator
----> 6 from cirq.google import XmonSimulator
ImportError: cannot import name 'XmonSimulator' from 'cirq.google' (/home/doki/miniconda3/envs/mycirq/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cirq/google/init.py)
Cirq version
0.8.2
XmonSimulator was removed: #1993. Please use cirq.Simulator instead.
Thanks @vtomole  - based on @mx73's thumbs up, this seems to be the solution. Closing.
