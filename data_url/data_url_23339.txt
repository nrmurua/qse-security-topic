Since both functions and parameters get delegated as attributes in the same way, it should not be possible to add a parameter with the name of an existing function of vice versa.
The function gets ignored in favour of the parameter. I found a comment indicating that this is by design https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/cfc97ec2090ed3620634affa3177419dddb6abae/qcodes/tests/test_instrument.py#L75. I don't think this is such a good design decision.
Maybe just get rid of the functions altogether?

So far as I understand the only usefullness of the add_function is to add a VISA command that does some action on the device, say STARtMEASuring, right? since implementing a bound method is not a big deal at all, I would agree with removing add_function.
