spin_op currently dump the qubit number it acts on after each of the Paulis, for instance
If you're trying to parse a Pauli string, it makes it difficult to do so in a general manner if the number of qubits jump in place value (for n= 9, 10, 100 qubits).
get_qubit_count (Python) or n_qubits(C++) already tell you how many qubits you have, so the qubits # are not really needed. Additionally, this will make interoperability with other libraries a little easier.
