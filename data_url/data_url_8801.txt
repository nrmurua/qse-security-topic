the last line should either throw an error, or send qA_0 to Bob, let Bob perform the cnot, and send it back.
Right now it will entangle qA_0 with qA_1 instead of qB_1. Assuming qA_1 and qB_1 have the same ids.
(It will have undefined behaviour if the ids of the qubits are not known)
Also Simulaqron should send an error message back in this case:
It now throws an error in both of those cases.
Sending it to the other node and back is infeasible. Explicitly send it using the send command if that is desired.
