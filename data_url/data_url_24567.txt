Removing multiple programs from the Tabor AWG via hws.remove_program takes a long time. For some reason removing the first few programs seems fast and the time required to remove each consecutive program seems to increase. When removing 10 programs, the first few took about 5s each, the last one took 60s (even though the programs were qualitatively similar, i.e. charge scans with same length just different range).

After deleting all programs and uploading a new one, removing this one program also takes a long time.
Can you track where the time is lost? If its during SCPI commands there is little I can do about it.
