this should be something more useful
For those following along at home, you need to compile your programs into executables
yeah that's what you need to do, but maybe we could say that if they provide a Program
If only Python made use of all those typehints...
Is there an agreed-upon way forward with this? We can do a check for a Program and give an informative error, but then should we check for all other possible inputs? Seems like a bandaid, covering up imperfect design?
Yes, real types would be nice.
The resolution for this would be to explicitly check for Program objects and emit a nice warning message as this is the most common failure mode. We don't want to do anything overbearing that prohibits duck-typing.
