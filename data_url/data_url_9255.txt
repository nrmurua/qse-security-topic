Describe the bug
The visual called for Bloqade.plot(AtomList(**)) is insanely large when adding an intermediate number of atoms-- on my laptop, about 100,000 times larger than my screen-- zooming to 1% does not even see the dots.
To Reproduce
atom_positions = [Random.rand(2) for x in 1:500]
atoms1 = AtomList([tuple(x...) for x in atom_positions])
Expected behavior
An insanely large svg output

Add any other context about the problem here.
seems due to this https://github.com/QuEraComputing/Bloqade.jl/blob/master/lib/BloqadeLattices/src/visualize.jl#LL137C1-L139C54 the size of the figure is calculated based on the number of atoms instead of a fixed size. I think a more robust implementation that I used in Python is to rescale the atom circle radius based on the number of atoms with a fixed figure size.
cc: @weinbe58, @johnzl-777 should be an easy fix if any of you want to spend some time on this.
