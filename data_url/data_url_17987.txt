Now #697 is merged, we should take advantage of it. My proposal is as follows:
Before doing anything, we need to rely on the recorded sessions. For that, I've created #803 which will monitor the rate of the recordings going out of date so we can learn how reliable they are or how often we need to update them.
Previous steps are incomplete also, they show the golden path and we need to decide when to fail or pass the build according to the test results.
@atilag @diego-plan9 @1ucian0, thoughts?
The sequence make test_recording followed by make test_mock not always work smoothly. Some ibmq.test_ibmqjob.TestIBMQJob tend to fail (usually those involving filter). I think it would be better to improve the filter interface to increase the cassette hitting ratio before. I'm not sure how easy/doable is this tho.
oh! And test_registration.TestIBMQAccounts.test_pass_bad_proxy fails because of kevin1024/vcrpy#352 (fixed in 284ee18). We need a way to detect when new tests break the VCR, like in this case.
Right now, there are only two tests using network:
Yeah and those are the only two tests marked as slow_test. Can't we close this issue?
Yes, go for it!
