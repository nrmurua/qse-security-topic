Bug: When creating a SimConfig with temperature 50ÂµK, the temperature is output in K as "4.9999999999999996e-05".

Origin of the error: The error seems to come from our handling of the temperature in post_init: the temperature is multiplied by 1e-6.
Proposed solution: Dividing by 1e6 seems to solve the issue. See https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html
