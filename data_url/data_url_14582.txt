Derived classes of BlueprintCircuit will let the user modify the circuit without comment, for example by adding gates or registers, but anything that triggers a rebuild of the circuit will behave unpredicatbly, often overriding all modifications.
This issue is a follow on from a previous discussion: #6828 (comment).
Example taken from @Cryoris' comment:
The Hadamard has gone missing.
We shouldn't be able to get ourselves into a situation where our modifications will be overwritten without warning.
Possibilities:
I'd prefer option 1, because it doesn't include implicit casts to ordinary circuits ðŸ™‚
Edit: Also, this would further separate circuit library building blocks from the general circuit object which can hold many of these blocks. Maybe, in the future, we'd want the blueprint circuits to be more gate-like so the compiler can do some optimizations on them (like selecting a better QFT decomposition if the QFT is followed by measurements).
