qaoa uses expectation as a loss function.  We would like generalize the loss function for qaoa.
As of now, the loss function is based the expectation, can a user use their own loss function for QAOA such as cvar?
Describe the solution you'd like
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
Perhaps a function that let us pass in a loss function so that QAOA can optimize based on the loss function.
To customize the loss funcion, I am thinking of performing the following changes:
In line 408 of variational.py, we introduce another argument, perhaps a string or a number, to let the user change the loss function and change the output:
and add some alternative loss functions in the hamiltonians.py.
One possibility is to:
@shangtai can we close this?
Sure, I will do a pull request when things are more ready :)
