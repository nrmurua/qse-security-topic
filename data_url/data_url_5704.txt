During the installation of "requirements-dev.txt", I encountered the following error.
Complete the installation without any errors.
Checking the installation logs, it appears that the numpy installation did not go well during the cvxpy installation.
We suspect that this is because the version of numpy that cvxpy is trying to install is a version from before Apple released the m1 chip, so the build is not going well.
It looks like it's trying to build qdldl from source (a requirement of cvxpy), but you don't seem to have a working C compiler.  Have you installed the macOS command-line tools (xcode-select --install)?  You'll need a working C/C++ compiler to build Aer even once the dependencies have been built.
Oh, sorry.
I misunderstood that it was installed, but it wasn't.
Fortunately, the installation of "requirements-dev.txt" was completed with xcode-select --install.
However, I followed the next step, run pip install., then I encountered the following new error.
This error looks like your C++ compiler isn't configured correctly - it's saying it can't find a standard include path. You can try completely removing the _skbuild directory from the repository and re-running the installation, but beyond that, it just seems to be a system compiler issue that I'm not sure what to suggest for, since I don't have this kind of Mac.
