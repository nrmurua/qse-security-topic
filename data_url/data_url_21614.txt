installing artiq via conda seems to install an incompatible version of binutils-or1k-linux
After installation, experiments cannot be submitted via the artiq dashboard. Instead, an error appears when trying to submit experiments.
Experiment runs

conda install -c m-labs binutils-or1k-linux
The following packages will be UPDATED:
binutils-or1k-lin~      artiq::binutils-or1k-linux-2.30-0 --> m-labs::binutils-or1k-linux-2.30-7
This fixes the problem.
You don't need =5.
The conda dependency manager is so broken that we are working around it by proposing only one possible version to conda.
Is it correct that the binutils package gets installed but then ARTIQ doesn't find it?
Why are you using conda and not Nix as recommended for Linux?
=5 is just for clarity, the error is the same without it.

To me it looks like the version on the artiq channel is older than on m-labs
I'm using conda simply because this is what people (non-programmers in our group) are used to. I am considering switching to Nix though...

The question I was asking is: when you used the original instructions, did it install the binutils package (as it should) but then ARTIQ did not find binutils?

Sadly, Anaconda Inc are putting a lot of marketing effort into peddling their low-quality product to scientists, with success. A bit like Microsoft with Windows...

I'm not sure how you want me to check this. The package is listed as installed in conda list, as you can see in the .txt file.
I don't know anything about this package, can you give me more detailed instructions please?

So it was there already before you installed it manually? That's all I need to know.
Yes
The binutils package itself seems to work...
Works on my machineâ„¢ with all of artiq_compile, artiq_run  and artiq_master. Probably the usual conda non-reproducible nonsense. Just use Nix or your workaround.
