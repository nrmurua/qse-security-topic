Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The current steadystate solver requires a time-independent Hamiltonian. This is obvious because a time-dependent Hamiltonian cannot have a steadystate.
However, if the Hamiltonian can be decomposed in a time-independent part H_0 and a periodic time-dependent part cos(w t) * H_i, the system reaches a stroboscopic steadystate. If the perturbation is small, this stroboscopic steadystate fluctuates so slightly that it can be considered as a real steadystate.
Describe the solution you'd like
I rewrote the Matrix Continued Fractions method implemented in the Quantum Toolbox for Matlab to fit with python and qutip objects. It is 100% working, with running times lower than the second with an Hamiltonian 40 x 40.
I'm ready to do a pull request (this is my first time). I understood that I have to write an issue first right?
Hi albertomercurio, it's not needed to open an issue first but always nice to know it's coming.
The feature seems interesting, thank you for contributing.
I took a quick look at your steadystate-floquet branch, the function look good.
Have you added new tests for it?
Please open the PR when you have time, it does not have to be final.
Hi Ericgig, i tested it with a Rabi Hamiltonian. It returns the steadystate immediately! This is the plot of the master equation time evolution with the direct steadystate expectation value.
