Description of the issue
cirq-pasqal imports numpy, etc but it's requirements.txt is empty.
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-pasqal/requirements.txt
cirq-pasqal depends on cirq-core which depends on numpy, thus transitively imports it.
cirq-core isn't in requirements.txt either.
I thought it would be in setup.py - but it is not, so this is a bug indeed, I will fix it soon!
