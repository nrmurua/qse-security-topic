Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Cirq-FT currently has a notebook to perform phase estimation of the walk operator as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03662. However, phase estimation is an important and useful primitive for quantum algorithms and different versions of phase estimation exist that should be implemented as part of Cirq-FT. The goal of this task is to (a) Define a common interface for phase estimation gates and b) Implement (with tests) different phase estimation gates in Cirq-FT. A list of different phase estimation gates that we'd like to implement are as follows:
 Kitaev phase estimation: This is the textbook version of phase estimation originally introduced by Kitaev in 1995 (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9511026). See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_phase_estimation_algorithm for an easier description https://quantumai.google/cirq/experiments/textbook_algorithms#phase_estimation for a tutorial on implementation using Cirq. The goal of this subtask is to implement Kitaev phase estimation as a GateWithRegisters in the Cirq-FT repository.
 Phase estimation with resource states for Walk operators: As described in Fig2 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03662 and implemented in https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-ft/cirq_ft/algos/phase_estimation_of_quantum_walk.ipynb
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
I can work on this.
