String form QobjEvos cannot be created.
The error is due to a missing file: intdtype.h is missing from /home/xavier/anaconda3/envs/qutip5-bench/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qutip/core/data/src/.
I was expecting a string form QobjEvo object to be created.
Qutip was installed using pip install git+https://github.com/qutip/qutip@dev.major in a conda environment.
The file intdtype.h should be created by setup.py. How did you build your version of QuTiP 5? Perhaps something is missing (e.g. maybe MANIFEST.in needs to have a line that reads recursive-include qutip *.h (or perhaps just directly only the intdtype header file).
I used pip install git+https://github.com/qutip/qutip@dev.major  to install it.
I tried creating a new environment, cloning the dev.major branch and running setup.py install which didn't work either.
Adding recursive-include qutip *.h to MANIFEST.in before running the setup solved the problem.
Interestingly it solved it for the qutip5-bench environment as well. So I created two new environments to see if the problem would also be solved in those, installing dev.major with pip in one and by cloning and using setup.py install without adding recursive-include qutip *.h to MANIFEST.in in the other. The QobjEvo object was created without any problems in both environments.
Fixed in #1971.
