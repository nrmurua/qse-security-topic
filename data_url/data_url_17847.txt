We had chinese and korean translation of qiskit installation that were not updated. We need a mechanism to make sure that the translations are updated appropriately (or marked otherwise).

@rraymondhp Hi Rudy, what's the status of Korean installation guide?  I saw the current version and it seems in a pretty good shape (I didn't check all details).
I am closing this and making a new issue. For continuing discussion please go to that.
