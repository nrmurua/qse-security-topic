Hello,
First of all, im sorry for my bad english
I got this problem when i want to configure openssl oqs into my VirtualBox Linux Ubuntu 18.04, it said that the file include/openssl/evp.h cant read "include <oqs.oqs.h>", it happen in "make -j" command
And also, before the "make -j" command, i run the "cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<OPENSSL_DIR>=oqs .." some error said that "Could NOT find Doxygen (missing: DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE)" Does this has the connection problem with the oqs folder?
Here is the detail of errors
Thank you for your amazing work.
@Richardo4039 Thanks for your interest in OQS. When looking at your command above
"cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<OPENSSL_DIR>=oqs .."
is it possible that you did not replace '<OPENSSL_DIR>' with the full path to the actual folder where you are building openssl? The real command should look something like
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/openssl-src/oqs ..
(replacing "/opt/openssl-src/oqs" with the actual folder you're working in). Also, there clearly is one "=" sign too many).
The Doxygen error means that you have not installed doxygen on your Ubuntu. But this seems like a secondary issue.
Im sorry, i made a typo with the "=" when i upload this issue.
for the cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<OPENSSL_DIR>/oqs .. command, i already change the OPENSSL_DIR into my own directory, like
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=PA/oqs ..
i saved liboqs folder and my openssl-dir (PA) in same folder, it is not a problem if i saved these 2 folders in the same place, right? Or i have to saved these 2 folders in some specific folder? I didnt find that i have to clone these 2 folders in specific folders in QuicStart guide.
Ow, alright then, i thought Doxygen is already included from this repository. 'Cause i started to learn oqs a month ago, forgive my ignorance..
You can git clone the two folders of liboqs and openssl wherever you like. But the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX path above must point to the location where you downloaded openssl to (probably ending in '.../openssl/oqs'). The path 'PA' doesn't look right. Best have a full path there.
Oops, okay, got it, it work, thanks a lot for your explanation and help!
