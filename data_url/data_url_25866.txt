Make the covalent status method more robust by checking the server status from a heartbeat file in addition to checking the existence of the dispatcher/ui.pid files. This will ensure that we provide the correct status when the server crashes and the pid files has not been deleted.
UI:
Design [WIP]:
Add heartbeat.txt to config file so that itâ€™s created when covalent start is called.
Heartbeat object
Then we need to create a global instance of Heartbeat which can be used by covalent CLI tool everytime a server is started or shut down. Also this will be used to determine the covalent status as well.

Other questions:
Edge case:
@FyzHsn I think this is out of date since we migrated to supervisord. Can it be closed?
@FyzHsn still relevant under current implementation?
I believe it's still relevant, but if we have answers for the questions and cases in the description then we can document those answers here and close it
@Prasy12 not sure if this is already there, if it is please feel free to close the issue
@santoshkumarradha We don't have this currently.
