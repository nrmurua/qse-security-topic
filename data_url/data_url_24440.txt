From @zlatko-minev
We need an orientation video that walks a new user how to install, configure, and run metal.
Status update: I completed video candidate 1 over the weekend (single video). I shall share the path after I gather enough feedback and identified the best method for publishing between youtube, webserver or box. I will share internally the resolve project package for easy future edits/adds
Video completed and shared a few weeks ago. Might need some updates to the video and some extra video content, but at this point this issue can be closed
