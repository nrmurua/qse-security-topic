There're currently ~20 TODOs in the repository.
For example:

We should link to the corresponding issues alongside these TODO comments or create the issues and then link them if they don't exist.
Assign this to me
@cjcarey Creating 20 issues at once might be too much. Open 5 for now. Link to this issue when creating.
@vtomole I created 5 new issues and made a new pull request for the spelling error. When should I have the rest of the TODO statements completed
@cjcarey Creating that many issues at once was not as spammy as i thought it would be. How about we finish it all right now?
I think I got everything.. let me know if I missed something!
@cjcarey That's it. Thanks for doing this.
A lot of the issue titles don't make sense out of context
Hey @cjcarey, please add more context to the issues you created. It's a good exercise in learning the code base.
We need to reaudit these todo issues.
I went over all TODO and added issues for all of them.  I also edited the issues to make sure they were clear on the issue.  Closing.
