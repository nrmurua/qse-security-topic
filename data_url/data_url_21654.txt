Name of conda repository typically includes build number and snippet of git commit hash. This is no longer the case.
Installed ARTIQ using conda. conda list tells me the version of ARTIQ that is installed is
There is no git commit for ARTIQ including this hash snippet.

Github search not working or not used correctly?
8ca1fea
Indeed I can checkout 8ca1fea using my local git client. So not an ARTIQ problem.
Looks like this is a github.com search bug. Annoyingly, github.com search interface also fails to find the full hash  8ca1fea161f50bf9ffc683127a7410b806af572e.
I submitted a support request to github.com for whatever that's worth.
Word from github....
It looks like that commit is only on the release-5 branch but not on master. This is why the commit isn't showing up in the search results. So if 8ca1fea is ever merged to master, then it would show up in commit search.
"When you search for commits, only the default branch of a repository is searched. In most cases, this will be the master branch." (link)
For reference, just typing the URL manually woks, even with shortened hashes (https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/commit/8ca1fea).
