The sha2_ossl.c and sha3_ossl.c files make references to the EVP_MD_CTX_{create|destroy} functions, which were redefined in OpenSSL 1.1.1 to be macros pointing to EVP_MD_CTX_{new|free}.
For various reasons, liboqs has kept the original names and modifications were made to OQS-OpenSSL-1.1.1 to retain the original create/destroy functions. Given that these modifications can be problematic in some situations, and OpenSSL 1.0.2 is being deprecated at the end of 2019, it is perhaps time to rename the functions to be consistent with the OpenSSL 1.1.1 API and drop liboqs support for 1.0.2 altogether.
