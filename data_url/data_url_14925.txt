When transpiling (level 2) a circuit with a large multi-cx gate (see doc: here) with a large numebr of qubits (e.g. 28) the commutation analysis pass crashes.
Run this python script:
Produces this output and error:
I would expect the optimizer to skip the pass if too large to optimize and leave it unoptimized.
I would skip the optimization pass when the number of qubits is too large (precise threshold to be determined based on ram memory of the current machine).
@MattePalte, thanks for reporting the problem. You probably want to update your example by adding another gate, something like:
otherwise there would be no possible commutation relations to check.
I have pushed a simple fix in #10495, though instead of limiting the number of qubits for the pass I am only limiting the number of qubits for individual matrix-multiplication checks.
