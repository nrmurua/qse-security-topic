fcl stands for frustrated cluster loops. however the code inside generates loops given a graph without clustering.
I think a good solution would be to add frustrated_cluster_loop generators as well. Is there a paper that defines them somewhere that we can use to add them?
for chimera, clusters are defined as unit tiles. can do the same for pegasus - use chimera unit tiles.
