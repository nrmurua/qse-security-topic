Rev. fd9f2fa from branch jg-freebsd-cpu-features
FreeBSD 13.1
The branch "jg-freebsd-cpu-features" has been merged and deleted. Please run again with branch "main" from https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs
That said, there seems to be another error: @Martyrshot FYI:
@yurivict Please test again on latest liboqs:main. If failing, please let us know what to do to reproduce.
Once I switched from the jg-freebsd-cpu-features (now deleted) branch to the main branch this doesn't fail any more.
Thanks for the reconfirmation, @yurivict and thanks for the fix, @Martyrshot
