The CDR method needs a near-Clifford simulator to be efficient at scale. Currently, this is sort-of placed on the user as an argument to execute_with_cdr. It would be good to have such a simulator available in Mitiq for this purpose.
The function should be able to efficiently simulate near-Clifford circuits, i.e., circuits where most operations are Clifford except for a small number (possible zero) of operations. Such near-Clifford circuits are generated by generate_training_circuits in CDR. The simulator should input a near-Clifford circuit as a QPROGRAM with computational basis measurements and return measurement samples, for example as a dictionary {bitstring_1: counts_1, ..., bitstring_n: counts_n}.
