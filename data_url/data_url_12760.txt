Example: Open the "InsideQuantumClassifiers" tutorial on Binder:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/main?filepath=tutorials/QuantumClassification/InsideQuantumClassifiers.ipynb
When executing the third cell, the following error appears:
I believe this is because the Dockerfile currently doesn't pre-build any Katas that depend on Microsoft.Quantum.MachineLearning, which means that package does not get downloaded and cached in the image. Since the Dockerfile then disables all NuGet package downloading, the package cannot be retrieved at runtime.
I expect the fix for this is just to add a command to the Dockerfile something like:
Good catch! Binder execution of this kata is rather slow, so I've been treating it as a read-only (and only checking that it works locally).
The fix might need a bit of experimentation: ./scripts/prebuild-kata.sh might be rather slow and time out Binder builds. When this tutorial was standalone, RUN dotnet build QuantumClassification in the Dockerfile was sufficient to keep the Binder functional, but we'll need to double-check this.
I won't get to it in the next couple of weeks, so marking this as up for grabs.
@tcNickolas That's a good point. In fact, I believe just RUN dotnet restore tutorials/QuantumClassification would be all that's needed for the packages to get cached in the image and therefore for the notebook to work properly.
