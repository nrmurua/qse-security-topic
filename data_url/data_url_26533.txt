Hello:
Hello!
I tried to install cp2k 9.1.0 on my cluster, which uses CentOS 7.5, gcc 9.3.0, cmake 3.22.1, python 3.6.1, openmpi 4.1.1.
I install and compile it successful, but when i test it with "make -j 28 ARCH=local VERSION="ssmp psmp" test", the ssmp version is passed successfully and psmp failed. the error log shows many "TIME OUT", what can i do to fix it?
I have already had a similar issue. Can you try to run the following command?
make -j 28 ARCH=local VERSION=psmp test TESTOPTS="--maxtasks 4"
In my case, the compute times reduced significantly.

thanks, now i have passed tests of psmp.
however, when i run it, it shows error massage:
`By default, for Open MPI 4.0 and later, infiniband ports on a device
are not used by default.  The intent is to use UCX for these devices.
You can override this policy by setting the btl_openib_allow_ib MCA parameter
to true.

and what can i do to fix it?
the make using -j 1, only 1. and Timeout: 400 s.   OpenMP threads: 2 not the 4  I have set.
It really confuses us, confuses users.
