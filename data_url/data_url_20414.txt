Hi,
In the McEliece implementation there are a number of places where integers are expressed as uint64_t that should either be signed, or the project conversion to unsigned integers completed (the tables are already converted).
Ex. uint64_t mask = n; mask = -mask;
It looks like someone did a "replace all" on long long's during a conversion attempt, but the task was never completed. If it compiles on C, it is only because the compiler is substituting the correct integer type, but this will not compile on C++, due to the more rigid standard.
To the fix this, you could rename those integers to int64_t.. but IMO, I think the right choice would be to complete the conversion process and thoroughly evaluate the changes.
Here are the places I've identified the problem:
fft.c, butterflies, out array
fft_tr.c butterflies_tr, tmp array
pk_gen.c, pk_gen, mask variable
encrypt.c, gen_e, mask variable
bm.c, into_vec, out array
There may be others..
