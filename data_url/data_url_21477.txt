artiq-beta channel finds 7.7871.f0c50c80.beta instead of the hydra build (python3.8-artiq-7.7907.bbac4770.beta).
It seems that the artiq-beta package index https://conda.m-labs.hk/artiq-beta/index.html is not up to date. All the boards are not up to date either. The stable channel package index https://conda.m-labs.hk/artiq/index.html seems to be up to date.
Installs latest artiq build (bbac477) when running conda update artiq.
Installs f0c50c8.
That's because the conda-artiq-board-kasli-unb build consistently fails due to FPGA timing problems (Cc @occheung).
At some point we should overhaul the bitstream build system which has scalability issues.
@fanmingyu212 in the meantime you can just install the old version and then overwrite packages with individual builds downloaded manually from Hydra.
@sbourdeauducq thank you for the fast reply and helpful workaround!
I think the original issue is solved (artiq-beta channel in conda is up to date now). This is probably solved by removing building of the unb variant starting from evaluation 3250 of Hydra though (2022/01/05), so the issue described in the title is unresolved.
Vivado update fixes this.
