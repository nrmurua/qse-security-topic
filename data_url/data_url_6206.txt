There are a few tests that were in Terra when the simulator was there. These are now being removed. We should move those to this repository. They can be found in:
qiskit-terra/test/python/aer_provider_integration_test/
Chief among them are
test_aer_qobj_headers.py
test_multi_registers_convention.py
These are being removed in Qiskit/qiskit#2201
Hello, I would like to help contribute to the project and thought this might be useful to work on, is this still unaddressed?
Hi guys! @Riuchando are you currently working on this? I don't see these tests in qiskit-aer yet so I'm assuming this issue is still todo?
@ajavadia if this issue is still valid, and if Riuchando isn't working on it, could you provide some more info on this? E.g. where would make sense to put these tests and what might need to be done to get them running successfully? Thanks!
I think this issue had been addressed for some time
