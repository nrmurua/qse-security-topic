Once March Meeting etc. are over, we should rename the spurious mode in the Zero-Pi qubit from chi to zeta. That is easy to do in the library, but may affect a large number of notebooks we've been working with. (Maybe there is a simple way to provide backwards compatibility, i.e., allow both.)
This has been implemented.
