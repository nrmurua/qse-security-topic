This issue is related to the PR #1270.
The file covalent_ui/api/v1/utils/file_handle.py uses a loop to concatenate strings. I think "".join(list_comp) is a more pythonic way and much faster when the list is very long.
Change: lines 36-38
list_str = ""
for obj in unpickled_object:
list_str += obj
To:
list_str = "".join([obj for obj in unpickled_object])
There is no issue here. I am suggesting to use a Pythonic best practice.
Dissolve the loop to Python API join()
Use "".join(list_comp) instead of the loop.

Hi @mohantyrohan3,
Unfortunately, I do not have the privileges to assign you to this issue as I am a first-time contributor.
I guess this should be closed since the corresponding PR is merged already.
