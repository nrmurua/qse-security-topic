I'm a student using qutip.piqs for the first time, don't know if there is an example of this kind of problem, for the time-dependent Hamiltonian  call the function liouvillian() of the Dicke class
Dicke class does not support list based time-dependent Hamiltonian.
But if the Hamiltonian is a QobjEvo, it should work: qutip.piqs.Dicke(N, hamiltonian=qutip.QobjEvo(H_td), emission=...)
Otherwise you can use the Dicke class to compute the dissipation part and use mesolve:
For more help, please use the google groupe: https://groups.google.com/g/qutip.
