For this noise model:
from mitiq.interface.mitiq_qiskit.qiskit_utils import initialized_depolarizing_noise
noise_model = initialized_depolarizing_noise(noise_level=0.001)
The annotation of this function says:
Args:
noise_level: The noise strength as a float, e.g., 0.01 is 0.1%.
Why 0.1% instead of 1%? Commonly, 0.01 is used to present 1%.
