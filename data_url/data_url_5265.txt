This adds "d" postfix to *.so files names. I.g. _cppsim_mpid.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so.
But this module is imported in Python by its natural name _cppsim_mpi and so in Debug version it cannot be imported.
Do we really need this postfix?
We can remove it to make it easier to run the libraries in debug mode. That was something I had in another project.
