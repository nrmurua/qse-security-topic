Describe the feature you'd like
PauliString("IXY").to_unsigned_observable returns TensorProduct(I('qubit_count': 1), X('qubit_count': 1), Y('qubit_count': 1)).
Currently, PauliString.to_unsigned_observable only returns observables for Paulis (ie., X, Y, Z). For Pauli string like "IXY", it returns TensorProduct(X('qubit_count': 1), Y('qubit_count': 1)), which does not include the identity. I understand that the the Observable.I() does not affect the expectation value, but it makes the number of qubit match the size of the Pauli string.
How would this feature be used? Please describe.
The current behavior is especially inconvenient when there are have many Pauli strings, "XYZ", "IIZ", "XXI" etc, at the same time. One needs to manually catch the Pauli strings that include the identity, and then manually adds them to the correct qubit indices.
Describe alternatives you've considered
PauliString("IXY").to_unsigned_observable remains the current behavior.
Add a new method PauliString("IXY").to_unsigned_observable_include_identity that includes the identity.
