With the recent changes to the gate fusion algorithm and including SIMD we should re-evaluate the default threshold values for enabling OpenMP, and for enabling gate fusion for the different qubitvector based simulations States (Statevector, DensityMatrix, Unitary, Superoperator) to ensure good default performance.
I guess that the current thresholds are not so bad. Because best thresholds depend on machines and circuits, if performance is required, users can calibrate parameters max_parallel_threads, max_parallel_experiments, and max_parallel_shots.
We may need to continuously define default values of thresholds for each release.
