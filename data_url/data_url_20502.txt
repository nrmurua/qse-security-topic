The information about which algorithms are enabled by default is slightly wrong. It is mentioned that
all Rainbow variants are enabled by default
where in reality only the classical variants are actually enabled (referring to oqs-template/generate.yml).
Thanks for this report. You're right and we fix it with #84.
