Hello. When I run "pip3 install -U tensorflow-quantum" I get the following error (reproduced on a Windows and MAC OS device):
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow-quantum (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow-quantum
I was able to resolve the issue by installing TFQ using the Windows-Linux Subsystem WSL2 for Windows 10.
