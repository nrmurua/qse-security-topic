If I import qiskit a console window is opened and closed many times. It is due to the execution of
in qiskit\version.py (line 29, in _get_qiskit_versions)
Import qiskit with the following command:
Qiskit should be important without side effects.
The issue seems to be the same as described in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6390394/executing-subprocess-from-python-without-opening-windows-command-prompt, however the sollutions suggested there do not work.
Can you give #2497 a try to see if this fixes this. The latest commit I just added to the PR (1f786fe) adjusts how we call subprocess to run the pip command for __qiskit_version__ to be the updated way for the git commands being added there. I think that might fix the issue (since it nukes the env except for what's needed) and want to see if it actually fixes this (since I don't have simple access to a windows environment).
@mtreinish Seems to work. (I did run some commands manually, as I cannot compile qiskit-terra on my system)
@eendebakpt ok cool, then I'll add a fixes tag to that PR to mark that once that merges it'll fix this.
