After the discussion with @ingoroth, @igres26  and @stavros11 we decided that it is highly useful to have gates which are native for specific platforms implemented in qibo.
The gate describing the native operation of the quantum chips used in TII is a RX rotation with an additional phase.
The matrix representation has to be looked up and implemented, dependent on the rotation angle and the phase (which is a virtual rotation around the Z axis)
I was working out the math and went to add this gate, however I realized that we already have it as GPI2. Looking at IonQ documentation (search for GPi2) it seems that they are applying single qubit gates exactly as we do. @igres26 @wilkensJ can you please confirm?
If yes, I will modify the qibolab transpiler to use this as native gate instead of U3.
