We leave batch dimension in the default implementation of register: Register. But its related interface and method is not defined yet. This issue is for the discussion related to the implementation of batch.
an iterator on batch can enable a for loop over a batch, an naive implementation would be:
view_batch here means get the view of a batch element dimension here. It should return a subtype of AbstractRegister
We now have batch supported in Registers. I'll close this.
