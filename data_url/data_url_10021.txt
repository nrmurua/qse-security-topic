Right now in dimod there is 'dimod/higherorder.pywhich supports higher-order Ising problems. But as this is proving to be a more common use case, we should consider creating a properHUBO` (or similar)
class.
We could also define a Sampler ABC similar to Structured, to signal samplers/composites that support HUBOs. These would then implement a sample_hubo method.
Added a deprecation warning for now.
this also effects #330 and #372
