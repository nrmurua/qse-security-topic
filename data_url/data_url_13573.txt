As @andreamari comments here we could make our PEC decomposition test suite even more robust by actually verifying that the decomposition is equal to the original operation, using for example mitiq.pec.utils._operation_to_choi.
@andreamari @karalekas How critical is this for PEC? Should this be in the 0.5.0 milestone?
This is not critical in the sense that it is not blocking any other issues.
However I think it is quite important since it allows to distinguish between probabilistic failures of PEC (bad results due to random fluctuations) with respect to intrinsic problems of representation dictionary.
