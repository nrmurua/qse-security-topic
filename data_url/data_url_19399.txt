An error appears when defining the Hamiltonian with imaginary values in the symbolic representation.
Code to reproduce the behavior:
If you put t=1 it works perfectly, but when I define it as a complex number I get an error.
In case it is a bug, can be fixed asap? Thank you!
I manage to do some engineering to surpass the problem, so no rush in case it's a bug.
Thanks for reporting this. It is a bug which should be fixed with #410, please check if this works for your example when you have time.
Regarding this particular example, if I am correct t is a global multiplying factor (can be factored out of all terms), so an alternative way to do this would be to create the symbolic Hamiltonian without it and include it as
Exactly, that's what I did to fix the problem, thanks Stavros. I'll check it out soon and tell you something.
