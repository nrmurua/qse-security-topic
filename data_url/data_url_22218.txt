using phaser branch, commit b14fcd4
Following produces phase-locked sinusoids with a phase offset of 2pi*0.2 rad. Expectation is phase offset of 0 rad.
I don't understand your logic behind the reasoning of what you expect.
All set_*() ops are zero-duration.
Please check your code and verify that you want to set the same phase twice on the same channel at the same time.
Oh and please stick with the earlier know working commits, i.e. https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/tree/c428800caf52a77a22a9be0d967715cccb4e0b63
