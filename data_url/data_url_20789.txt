On other platforms (MacOS and CentOS) tests pass...
@mkannwischer it indeed seems that there is some out-of-bounds memset happening. When compiling with Clang there are no complaints.
Compiled with Clang, -fsanitize=address (on Ubuntu 20.04) and valgrind (also on Ubuntu 20.04) also seem happy, weirdly enough. Overflows on the stack are poorly detected by these tools....
This is indeed a bug as this function doesn't support O2 > O1 which is the case with the new parameter sets.
I've ported a fix from upstream (fast-crypto-lab/rainbow-submission-round2@b3519fb) and I'm re-running some tests. Should be ready later today.

Yes I concur. :-(

Thank you!
