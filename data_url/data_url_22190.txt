@jordens from your email I resolved the second two
Regarding test mode... Do you intend to dump test mode here forward?
There should be a jtagspi_init 0 /path/to/bscan_spi_xc7k325t.bit after the init.
Test mode was removed in the move to rust. I did like it and miss it as well but it was a bit tedious to maintain and hard to test itself.
We can bring back test mode if there's enough interest, there's no fundamental reason for its removal.
Ah, thanks Robert.
I've found the Test Mode useful in a number of circumstances and would miss its absence. This is in part a result of familiarity with that path for configuring MAC/IP and doing simple LED/IO toggle tests. I can see that openocd is a clear alternate path for setting MAC/IP.
