Here are two QASM files. I expect them to produce the same final states, but they don't. Could you please comment on them?
This file produces the correct state:
Its result is:
But, this file doesn't.
Its result is:
Well, it is almost correct -- the probabilities are correct. The phases of the state seem to be wrong.
The second file basically uses the ctrl[0] to control the other qubit. Since the ctrl[0] is 1, the two circuits should be deemed identical.
Thanks! Related to #70 , we ended up implementing rz as described in #70, but didn't do this for crz. will modify and document shortly
@DevelopDaily Fixed, please let me know if there are still problems with it.
Hooray! Like a charm.
Thanks.
