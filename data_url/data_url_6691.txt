I assume bin folder and suo files are accidentally committed. You should try to gitignore these

The bin dir is there for real (this is a binary runtime distribution with source code on top of it). The suo isn't really needed. We'll throw in a .gitignore (or get rid of anything unnecessary) - thanks!.
