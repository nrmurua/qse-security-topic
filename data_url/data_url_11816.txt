A base class for several types of Operator classes: MatrixOperator, PauliOperator (system for grouping for commutativity wip), FermionicOperator, etc.
Continuation of #311
From my understanding, most of the aspects of the Operator class that make it a mutable object come from changing its representation.
It sounds like this enhancement would place the ability to change representations within Operator as opposed to the child classes MatrixOperator, PauliOperator and FermionicOperator, etc.
I think this would open up the possibility to make each instance of the child classes immutable (also see #579).
My premise of the mutability of the Operator class may be wrong though, I haven't used all of the functionality of the Operator class yet.
Operator refactoring has been done by #593
