This is very weird... Big LaTeX formulas look like this indeed in the first few seconds after the notebook is opened, while the earlier formulas load, but they get formatted very quickly after that, I cannot reproduce this unformatted view showing for longer than that...

Hi @tcNickolas , looks like the issue got resolved. The Latex is rendering properly both on binder and local Jupyter Notebook.
