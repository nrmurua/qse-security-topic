On Windows 7 64-bit, Artiq version 2.4.  When I try to run artiq_flash -t kc705 -m nist_qc2 it fails with an "Unknown flash device" error:
You'll need to make ually downgrade openocd to a version that was current when 2.4 was released
@jordens can you delete (or move to the dev channel) the buggy openocd versions? If course they are the ones that get installed as per Murphy's law...
@sbourdeauducq It's not buggy openocd versions but incompatibility between the proxy bitstream shipped in the old board packages and the new openocd versions. Moving openocd won't help.
@whitequark suggested that the old versioning scheme was causing problems with conda so I changed it and I'm now using the build number to pin openocd. Before (and certainly not in 2.x) there was little constraint on the openocd version. Ergo the old releases won't work as long as any newer openocd gets installed automatically.
Downgrading openocd to version 0.10.0 build 1 fixed the unknown flash device error.  Running artiq_flash -t kc705 -m nist_qc2 using artiq version 2.4 now complains that it cannot find the binaries directory though:
Is it possible to build the binaries and add them to the version 2.4 conda repository?  I'm going to try copying the binaries from the 2.3 environment to the 2.4 environment.
Copying the binaries directory over from 2.3 worked.  Are there any differences between the 2.3 binaries and artiq 2.4 that might cause problems doing it this way?
There are no gateware or firmware changes between 2.3 and 2.4, so no.
Trying to run an experiment using version 2.4 on windows 7 64 bit now fails with the error:
Working on it.
Thanks.  I made a separate issue #935.
@philipkent Are there still flashing problems?
