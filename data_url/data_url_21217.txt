for i in range(a, b, c) on the ARTIQ kernel does not cover all values in [a,b[.
Try for example [i for i in range(3, 4, 2)]. The result on the host is [3], whereas the unexpected result on the kernel is [].
But for example [i for i in range(3, 5, 2)]. The result on the host and on the kernel is now correctly [3].
The iteration should produce the same result on the kernel as on the host, covering all values within the range (a inclusive, b exclusive),
The iteration on the kernel stops prematurely, excluding the last value, which is still within the range and is therefore expected to be included.
