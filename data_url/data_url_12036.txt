When trying to run the optimization notebooks 01_quadratic_program and 05_admm_optimizer, it results in a error message "AttributeError: 'BinaryVarType' object has no attribute 'one_letter_symbol'".
Open either notebook in the Quantum Lab of IBM Quantum Experience, click on Kernel, and then the option Restart & Run All. Then, the third cell in 01_quadratic_program and 05_admm_optimizer produces the following error:
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
 in 
14 # load quadratic program from docplex model
15 qp = QuadraticProgram()
---> 16 qp.from_docplex(mdl)
17 print(qp.export_as_lp_string())
/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/site-packages/qiskit/optimization/problems/quadratic_program.py in from_docplex(self, model)
561         var_names = {}
562         for x in model.iter_variables():
--> 563             if x.get_vartype().one_letter_symbol() == 'C':
564                 x_new = self.continuous_var(x.lb, x.ub, x.name)
565             elif x.get_vartype().one_letter_symbol() == 'B':
AttributeError: 'BinaryVarType' object has no attribute 'one_letter_symbol'
The expected behavior is no error, that both notebooks run all cells and produce the expected output.
Probably fix the input given to the call qp.from_docplex(mdl), but otherwise I'm not sure.
This is a known issue and fixed in the release that just went out
Okay, thank you for the update. I'll close the issue now.
