The scale kwarg to circuit.draw() does not work well for the mpl drawer, because it does not scale the text font size.
Default scaling is fine:

Scale up:

Scale down:

May I take this issue?
Does anyone know how to view images on the Azure pipeline logs? I keep getting errors stating that the drawings produced by the code does not match the reference images. This is especially intriguing as I have directly replaced the reference images with the drawing that is produced when running the test code. However, the similarity ratios for the outcomes of the tests once I run the tests are still ranging from .9 to 1. One way to recognize if there is any difference in the image would be to view both images when the test is running on the Azure pipeline.
Ok I have finished this. I just need a code owner's review.
This issue was fixed by #4572 and reintroduced by #4616 .
The current effect can be observed here:
