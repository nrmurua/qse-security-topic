I do not know why readthedocs is pointing at out of date documentation. Selecting 'stable' will point to the correct documentation. I will wait a few days for it to resolve itself, but if it doesn't I will update all of the links.
@arcondello when I try the link I get latest RtD from May 24 -- maybe it's a cache issue on your side?
