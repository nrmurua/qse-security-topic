I'm receiving this error (after having run my code several times succesfully for some reason now its giving this error after a few succesful steps). I suspect its a similar problem to this given that I'm also using QAOA and VQE. Also the link given for download is not working:

Hi @mauromsoler, thanks for taking the time to open an issue. I've fixed the link on the other page, it should be pointing to this page: https://www.rigetti.com/forest but had previously had a relative link reference leading to a 404 on github.
It looks like you are still on pyQuil 1.X, and you will have to migrate over to Forest 2.0. Here's what you'll want to do:
In particular, it looks like you're using qvm.wavefunction which is no longer a method of QVM. This page about the WavefunctionSimulator will be helpful to you: https://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/wavefunction_simulator.html
