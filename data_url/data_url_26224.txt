Some of the dependencies in pyproject.toml need to be pinned.
Related to this comment in #197.
If an editable version of Toqito is installed by using pip install -e., the latest version of one of the installed packages leads to test_state_metrics/test_matsumoto_fidelity.py::test_matsumoto_fidelity_default failure.
The same failure does not happen if all packages and their versions are installed by using the code block in the previously linked comment.
probably an issue related to poetry and jsonschema?
Hmm, is this perhaps an issue with the version of poetry being used? That is, should poetry be updated here?
poetry 1.6.1 is the latest version.
poetry does not have jsonschema as an official dependency but one of the dependencies must depend on it.
https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/master/pyproject.toml
Ah gotcha. So maybe we should pin jsonschema<4.18.0? What do you think?
yep! Tried it just now. jasonschema is not the issue, apparently. The test discussed in the issue description is still failing.
https://github.com/vprusso/toqito/blob/master/toqito/state_metrics/matsumoto_fidelity.py#L6
matsumoto_fidelity can't import is_density due to some ImportError.
This is because is_density can't import is_positive_semidefinite due to another ImportError.
https://github.com/vprusso/toqito/blob/master/toqito/matrix_props/is_density.py#L4
I will dig deep into what's causing this then attempt to pin the dependencies.
Hmm, interesting. Out of curiosity, what is the ImportError with the is_density function?
For return is_positive_semidefinite(mat) and np.isclose(np.trace(mat), 1) in is_density:
Interestingly enough, if I run all the tests in toqito/tests, only Matsumoto fidelity fails as an AssertionError.
But if I run all the tests in toqito/tests/test_state_metrics, more tests fail for the same reason. This makes me think there might be a bug with pytest-cov also.
Edit- UPDATE: I checked this in a working environment (of Python 3.11.5) where all tests pass. Similar behavior as above.
For the above code block, all tests pass (identical to all github workflows). But if I do the following, I see the tests fail due to the same TypeError.
I think it might be better to verify the tests in all folders.
Seems like the issue could be in is_positive_semidefnitie, is_hermitian and/or is_density.
pytest should have caught these failures when all the tests were run at once. But it didn't.
Occasional Error Failure
Figure out why test_matsumoto_fidelity_default will fail in a brand new virtual environment created for toqito.
The test fails because the calculated value for the test is 0.89 when it should be 0.99.
Output of pip list for the testvenv
Installed versions of another venv where all the tests pass. It should be noted that this environment also has jupyter notebook installed. working_env_dep.txt
Tried adding cvx  = "0.1.3" to pyproject.toml. Still the same AssertionError failure mentioned at the beginning of this comment.
On the bright side, this assertion failure is a different issue. Before it was due to module not found error.
In addition to cvx, an editable installation by pip also does not install scikit-image. The newest version of cvxpy is also not the issue. Github runners install it and the test passes.
maybe pip is a bad dependency resolver.
