Issue
When creating a simply workflow, graph build does not recognize the input arguments to an electron when they are exactly the same.

Some debugging notes:
When the multiply electron is called, connect_node_with_others is called to connect each input node to the multiply electron. However, when same electron is passed to both arguments, they have the same node_id, and since the transport graph is a DiGraph, not a MultiDiGraph, only one edge is added between the input electron and the multiply electron.
Thus the transport graph should look like

but actually looks like

The edge gets a y label because the second invocation of add_edge replaces the x edge between r1 and multiply.
