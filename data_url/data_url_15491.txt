coupling_map (Union[CouplingMap, List[List[int]], None]) â€“
Coupling map (perhaps custom) to target in mapping. Multiple formats are supported:
CouplingMap instance
List, must be given as an adjacency matrix, where each entry specifies all two-qubit interactions supported by backend, e.g: [[0, 1], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 5], [2, 5], [4, 1], [5, 3]]
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.transpiler.CouplingMap.html:
Nodes correspond to physical qubits (integers) and directed edges correspond to permitted CNOT gates
Edit suggestion:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.compiler.transpile.html:
Directed coupling map (perhaps custom) to target in mapping. If the coupling map is symmetric, both directions need to be specified. Multiple formats are supported:
List, must be given as an adjacency matrix, where each entry specifies all directed two-qubit interactions supported by backend...
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.transpiler.CouplingMap.html:
Nodes correspond to physical qubits (integers) and directed edges correspond to permitted CNOT gates, with source and destination corresponding to control and target qubits, respectively
I am looking for a first issue.  Could I work on this?
Absolutely, thanks!  I'll assign you so others know you're working on it.  Feel free to ask questions here, and one of the community team will help you.
