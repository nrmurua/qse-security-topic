I have also tried installing without the simulator using
`(C:\Users\pc\Anaconda3) C:\Users\pc>python -m pip install --user --global-option=--without-cppsimulator .
C:\Users\pc\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\pip_internal\commands\install.py:243: UserWarning: Disabling all use of wheels due to the use of --build-options / --global-options / --install-options.

ERROR: Directory '.' is not installable. Neither 'setup.py' nor 'pyproject.toml' found.`
To install without the C++ simulator, you should not include a period at the end of your pip command:
According to the error message above, the installation process cannot find a working C++ compiler. Do you have Visual Studio or the Visual Studio Build Tools installed on your computer?
Hi thanks for the comment about the period. After trying that out, I have installed projectq without the simulator. However i wish to still get the simulator version. I have installed Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 on my computer (version 16.2.4). So i am not sure why I cant get the faster version of projectq installed. Should i do something more than installing Build Tools?
You probably need to have the Windows SDK installed as well.
Were you able to solve your problem? If not, what is holding you at the moment?
I'll be closing the issue since it is inactive. Feel free to open a new one if the problem persists.
