I'm trying to simulate a simple two-level system with a sinusoidally varying external magnetic field. The code is given below:
The Hamiltonian of the system is hermitian, and theoretically, we don't expect such decay in the amplitude. So, what is happening in the above program that is leading to such a strange evolution?

As soon as I increase the value of B the decay is even faster!?
It appears that the coefficients in your Hamiltonian are large, and the time-dependent part of the Hamiltonian oscillates very rapidly, The result is that the solver does not by default take small enough time steps when evolving the state. You can fix this by specifying a max_step to the Options:
With this max_step the solver correctly evolves the system for me.
Closing this for now, but please feel free to continue the discussion here as needed.
