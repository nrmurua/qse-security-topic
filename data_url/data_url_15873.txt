I'm trying to apply QAE to this circuit but I don't know how to get an actual value out of it, it just outputs this statement. Am I missing a parameter? Also, is num_eval the number of qubits in the circuit?

You could check out one of the finance tutorials that use amplitude estimation: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-finance/blob/main/docs/tutorials/03_european_call_option_pricing.ipynb.
All the algorithms take algorithmic specifications (like the number of evaluation/QFT qubits, that determine the accuracy of AE) in the initializer, and then have a method to execute the algorithm which takes the problem specifications (like the state preparation). For example, if you're A-operator is just an RY-rotation
The number of evaluation qubits, num_eval_qubits, specifies how many auxiliary qubits the phase estimation circuit uses and determines the accuracy of the algorithm (have a look at the original AE paper https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0005055 to see how it affects the accuracy). So the total number of qubits is the number of evaluation qubits plus the number of qubits in your A-operator.
Thanks this is really helpful. Just one more question. I see an array of values; what are these values of? I guess I'm just asking what QAE actually calculates
The result contains a bunch of information, see https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.algorithms.AmplitudeEstimationResult.html?highlight=amplitudeestimation#qiskit.algorithms.AmplitudeEstimationResult for the documentation.
Is there an attribute in particular you have a question about?
Nevermind I figured it out. Thanks so much for your help
