Qiskit Terra version: master
Python: 3.8.3
**OS: ** Windows 10 Enterprise
What is the current behavior?
As there is a limited number of experiments one is able to run on any of the IBMQ computers, it is sometimes necessary to combine qiskit.result.result.Result objects. This used to be possible using the '+' operand, but now apparently is not supported anymore. It would help a lot if there was either a larger number of experiments available or combining result objects was possible again somehow.
Steps to reproduce the problem
error message:
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Result' and 'Result'
What is the expected behavior?
The two result objects are merged into one. Without this, we cannot use all information from the experiments to pass it to methods that take in result objects.
Suggested solutions
Support adding result objects; what would be the problem with that anyway?
@JelenaMack The IBMQProvider has a JobManager for handling this. It automatically splits off your job to fit the backend limit and combines the result for you. Please see the documentation: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.ibmq.managed.IBMQJobManager.html#qiskit.providers.ibmq.managed.IBMQJobManager
I'm closing this, let me know if this doesn't solve your problem.
@ajavadia But as far as I've understood this gives me the results in the form of an "managedresults" object and I can retrieve one result object with managedresults (jobnumber).
But I need one result object with all experimental data, not one object from which I can retrieve the individual results. I want to combine all result objects into one because the tomography fitter takes in one result object.
You can use managedresult.combine_results() to get a single Result object:
