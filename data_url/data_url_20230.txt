Hi, I tried to install the liboqs but on ninja run_tests it fails on tests/test_style.py::test_style at 97%, after that i tried the command ninja install but it returns the following error:
But running the same command with root it works:
Honestly I don't even know if is correctly installed but my main reason to install this library is to use it with the python3 wrappers liboqs-python, so after I clone the the project I ran the command oqs/oqs.py and it returns the following message No liboqs shared libraries found.
I have very poor experience on installing/compiling libraries, would appreciate if anyone could help me or guide me to install liboqs successfully so i can use liboqs-python.
Thank you.
With respect to test_style failing, what does the output say? Do you have astyle installed?
With respect to the rest, if an installation prefix is not specified, it defaults to /usr/local on UNIX-like systems. That's why when you run ninja install it attempts to copy liboqs.a to /usr/local/lib. It probably fails without root because you lack the permissions to copy files there.
If you'd like to install the headers and libraries to a directory of your choosing, which, say, is <DIR>, you have to pass the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR> option. For more information, see the CMake documentation for CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
To use liboqs-python, you have to build liboqs as a shared library. This is controlled by the -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=[ON|OFF] option. The build steps would therefore be:
Once liboqs is installed in <DIR>, follow the instructions here, and make sure to correctly specify the LIBOQS_INSTALL_PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables.
Thank you for your response! the problem of test_style failing was indeed the astyle, but after installing it another test fails tests/test_namespace.py::test_namespace.
The <DIR> in -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<DIR>, what should the location be to successfully install, I currently have the project under my user folder...
Once I installed the liboqs, the liboqs-python should be in any specific path, and to specify the LIBOQS_INSTALL_PATH i only need to run this command LIBOQS_INSTALL_PATH="/usr/local/bin/liboqs.so" with the correct path to the liboqs.so correct?

<DIR> can be any directory of your choosing. For example, to avoid permission issues, you can specify it to be ~/oqs. The correct path to liboqs.so would then be ~/oqs/lib/liboqs.so
Once I installed the liboqs, the liboqs-python should be in any specific path, and to specify the LIBOQS_INSTALL_PATH i only need to run this command LIBOQS_INSTALL_PATH="/usr/local/bin/liboqs.so" with the correct path to the liboqs.so correct?
Once you have the correct path (say <path>) to liboqs.so, to set this environment variable, you can run export LIBOQS_INSTALL_PATH=<path>. Also note that you have to set PYTHONPATH; see the "Running" section here for the full list of instructions.
Closing for now. Please re-open or file a new issue if the problem persists.
