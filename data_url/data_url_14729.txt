The assembler does not raise an error if outside of the backends acceptable values.
See https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/2aecdcd7a9c412e5d6fd756e6cc3276ea285e957/qiskit/compiler/assemble.py#L288 and rep_times below.
If rep_times or rep_delays is set, an error should be raised if an unacceptable value is provided.
Raise an error if this scenario is encountered.
