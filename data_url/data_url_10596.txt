Add generators of EnergyScaleWarning, TooManySamplesWarning and TooFewSamplesWarning warnings.
I am a bit worried about providing TooManySamplesWarning. without knowing the ground states of a problem creating a warning about drawing too many samples is not a great idea.
What if the first excited state is highly degenerate and you need a billion samples to see the ground state? - regardless of how we implement this specific Warning, it will throw an error for this specific example which is extremely misleading.
There is a case to be made that that's a very poor QPU problem, though I agree distinguishing that case will be very difficult.
I disagree with that comment. It may simply be a hard problem with a hard landscape that other heuristics will fail too (possibly worse than the QPU).
Fair enough, and it is definitely true that there will be many heuristics worse than the QPU at that problem. In any case, there is no way (that I know of) to detect that case, so maybe better to leave "too many samples" as a research topic.
#255 adds EnergyScaleWarning and ChainStrengthWarning
do you want me to wait for this to be merged before adding TooFewSamplesWarning
#255 has now been merged
so another question, the samples related warnings are applicable to classical solvers as well... you think they belong to dwave.system or dimod
Let's keep them in dwave-system for now
