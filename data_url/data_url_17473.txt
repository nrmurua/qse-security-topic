Two unit test failures related to the optimize_1q_gates pass were uncovered while working on #1815. These were marked as expectedFailure since they weren't caused by the DAGNode PR, but they should be fixed.
I think the issue with the second test is somewhere in the pass the constant pi is being converted into 3.141592 so when the comparison checks if the two nodes are the same, the parameters are not considered to be equal.
