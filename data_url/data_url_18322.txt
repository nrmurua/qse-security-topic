Wow! And what does "No good" stands for?(!)
I am just reading your ph-est... manual and I see an opportunity. If it solves the full time dependent case  could it be used to approximate what happens in the case of a chain of say, copper atoms when subjected to a strong abrupt Stark term? (I am talking of including your work in a serious publication not just playing around with it so I must be sure what kind of approximation we are talking about in such a case. I will probably need your help in that.)
I used No Good for some files I wanted to delete, I didn't mean to upload those files  in the first place
I think the Trotter approximation is super general and you could use it to solve any quantum evolution
for which H is independent of time. If H depends on t, I'm sure you can do a very similar approximation. There  is also the second order Trotter Suzuki which I didn't implement in the software but is  more accurate and is easy to implement too. I will add it into the software in the near future. Take a look at Suzuki's papers They are very easy to understand
Great application
I am trying to simulate the H2_ground_state circuit. How to setup the simulation file? I attached the file
phase_est_iterative-Copy1.pdf
sensor1,
As originally set up,  notebook phase_est_iterative.ipynb simulates a 2 qubit circuit. But you replaced that by
file_prefix = 'chemistry/chem_io_folder/H2_ground_state'
which is an 8 qubit circuit. But you are still using an initial state vector for only 2 qubits
init_st_vec = SEO_simulator.get_standard_basis_st([0, 0])
I changed it according to the remark and I have a state vector now. Do you have tricks and tips. The software is very impressive and opensource and therefore more possibilities than liquid. I hope to use it in the IBM experience in some way.

Thanks sensor1. Keep in touch
