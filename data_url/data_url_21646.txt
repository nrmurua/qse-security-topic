Artiq_dashboard -s cannot connect to the artiq_master's PC
I am very new to the artiq and I have a basic question about using artiq_dashboard remotely.
I was trying to use artiq_dashboard in different computer from where the artiq_master is running.
I got the correct IP address of the PC running artiq_master and I can ping it but my artiq_dashboard still cannot access that PC. Below is the error information I got when I run artiq_dashboard -s [ip address of the artiq_master PC]:
I opened the default TCP port (3250, 3251, 1067) for artiq_dashboard on both computer but the error still remain. I will much appreciate it if you can look into this case and give me some advice!
Did you launch artiq_master with --bind=<desired IP address>? It might only listen on the loopback interfacec by default.
