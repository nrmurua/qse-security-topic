Calling hafnian on a poorly conditioned matrix should produce something close to the correct answer.
An incorrect answer is produced. For example, on an 8 x 8 matrix of ones with a single off-diagonal entry equal to 1,000,000, an answer of 0 is produced instead of the correct answer of 15,000,090.
The behavior seems to be deterministic.

I suspect that the trace algorithm is unstable for poorly conditioned matrices. Perhaps it would be good to add a check to revert to the recursive algorithm in this case.
Hey @jacobhilton! We're taking a look at this — will get back to you as soon as we can!
@jacobhilton we think you may have found a bug, but it appears to be a relatively extreme edge case. There is likely a deeper numerical research project that needs to be done here.
It might be worth you checking out this page on matrix conditioning or elsewhere to see if you can find a criterion for which this can be dealt with as a special case.
Thanks. Upon reflection, I think the condition number is probably not a good criterion. For example, all three methods work fine on a matrix of ones, which is singular. I don't know exactly what criterion would make sense as I don't understand the trace algorithm well enough and haven't tried to debug where it's going wrong in this particular case. I wouldn't be surprised if there's some intermediate matrix involved that needs to be well conditioned. For my use case, I will probably just stick to the recursive method – I just thought you'd want to know about the issue.
@jacobhilton thanks so much for bringing this to our attention! I think we'll leave the issue open, as we didn't / haven't come to a satisfactory solution. That said, we're not too concerned with the behaviour since it's an edge case.
