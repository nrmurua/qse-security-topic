I found this bug :
when creating a quantum register with create_quantum_register or create_classical_register, if one gives a name starting by "qreg" or "creg" then subsequent execution of a program using this register raises an error.
Here is an example code to reproduce the error :
Thanks for the report, @ChristopheVuillot! The parser seems indeed to lack robustness when handling tokens that start with reserved QASM words - we will look into this issue.
Closed via #83 - as usual, thanks for reporting and don't hesitate on reopening on filing a new issue if needed!
