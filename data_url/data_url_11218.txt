The Read the Docs site only displays the submodules and nothing else. Same is true for the PDF version, which implies that it's not just a browser issue. (I'm using Chrome version 80 on Ubuntu.) Searching for anything (on the RTD site) yields no results.
Hmm the docs are building locally for me.
I switched Read the Docs to use Python 3 instead of Python 2 and now the docs build fine.
