Currently we only have one example on Error Mitigation which is written with Qiskit as the frontend. PennyLane users would find it useful if we had the same example implemented with PennyLane as the frontend.
The guidelines for the example are:
Hi, I noticed that Pennylane already provides an example of ZNE using mitiq in their documentation.
Should an example for another technique be provided instead (with a link to the ZNE example in the docs)?
Hi @JLenssen, our aim is to translate this basic ZNE example to all supported frontends, so I would keep the current ZNE + PennyLane issue in the current form.
On the other hand, additional examples for other error mitigation techniques (e.g. PEC/DDD/CDR) are welcome too!
