These Katas just try to avoid the problem of endian, which just makes me more confused. Some place (I forget where, I even can not find endian information from the API reference like ControlledOnInt) says it is little endian. Below are my understandings, are they correct? (I use row vectors for column vectors)
Different katas use different notations. UnitaryPatterns says explicitly that it uses little endian; Superposition says that it uses big-endian (in the task 10 in which it relies on bitstring-to-integer conversion).
Most of the katas use Dirac notation and thus use big-engian implicitly: |01⟩ is 1 and |10⟩ is 2. This corresponds to what you get if you convert Dirac notation to tensor product notation:

Library operations use mostly little-endian - ControlledOnInt definitely does. I agree that API documentation should mention this more prominently!
