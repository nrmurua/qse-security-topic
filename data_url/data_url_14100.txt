A known-issue in qiskit-terra 0.19:
When running the BasisTranslator in isolation with the target argument set to a Target object, where some single-qubit gates can only apply to non-overlapping sets of qubits, the output circuit might incorrectly include operations on a qubit that are not allowed by the Target. For example, if you ran:
output will have RZGate and SXGate on qubit 0, even though this is forbidden. To correct this you can normally run the basis translator a second time (i.e. output = bt_pass(output) in the above example) to correct this. This should not affect the output of running the transpile() function and is only an issue if you run the pass by itself.
From #11317 (comment):
In practice it only comes up for manually constructed targets though, it's not a real issue as none of the backends I'm aware of have heterogeneous 1q gates.
therefore, priority: low.
@1ucian0 ,  am I allowed to try this one?
the issue is a bit ambiguous. I think it is worthy to have a look on how a fix might look like. Feel free to try, just be open to possible frustration if the PR gets rejected.
