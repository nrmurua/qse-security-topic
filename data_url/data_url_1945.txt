In a fresh virtual environment, the required mypy version, 0.701.0, fails to install, with the error below. The latest version of mypy installs fine though. Is there a reason we shouldn't upgrade?
I recently got this for python3.8 - do you see this for python 3.7 as well?
Agreed, that there is no other solution then to upgrade mypy (python/typed_ast#124).
I see no objections yet, so I'll try 0.770 in CI and we'll see what breaks :)
I tried it locally, we'll need to review these issues to upgrade:
This was fixed in #3216.
