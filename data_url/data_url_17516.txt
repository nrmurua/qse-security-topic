Implement a command definition object from the cmd_def as specified in the Openpulse specification which will be used to schedule quantum circuits to pulse schedules. This will depend on the underdevelopment openpulse API for terra (#1901) and will be implemented as outlined in #1713.
Closed via #2263.
