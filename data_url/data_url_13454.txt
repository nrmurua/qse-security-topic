When we passed from cirq to cirq-core, a lot of deprecation warning appear each time we import something.
E.g. if a user tries to run:
The following long message appears:
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Message: "Can't import cirq.google: "
Arguments: (ModuleNotFoundError("No module named 'cirq_google'"),)
The same problem also appears in some examples in the docs. See e.g.:
https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/simple_landscape.html
https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/maxcut-demo.html#define-the-qaoa-cost-hamiltonian-using-cirq
** Proposal **
Temporarily require the full cirq package, until the warning disappear?
They will probably fix this at some point: quantumlib/Cirq#4106
@rmlarose
+1.
The warning showing up in docs is not good. Thanks for noting this. I'm fine with listing cirq in requirements to fix this. Alternatively, we can list cirq-google in dev_requirements and that will get rid of the warning in docs.
Note that the warning will be present until Cirq 0.14 (https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-core/cirq/__init__.py#L584-L594), which may be a while.
When we passed from cirq to cirq-core, a lot of deprecation warning appear each time we import something.
E.g. if a user tries to run:
The following long message appears:
This I'm not too concerned about. If they want to get rid of the warning they can install cirq-google in their environment.
I like the proposal of having back again cirq in requirements.
