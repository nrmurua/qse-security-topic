Description
Multiple (~60) tests of AutoEmbeddingComposite, EmbeddingComposite, LazyFixedEmbeddingComposite, etc fail when having dwave-neal installed during unittests.
To Reproduce
Install dwave-neal and run unit tests.
Expected behavior
Tests should pass.
Additional context
When dwave-neal is installed, dwave.system.testing.MockDWaveSampler will use neal.SimulatedAnnealingSampler instead of dimod.SimulatedAnnealingSampler.
Partial error output
Should be fixed when a fix for dwavesystems/dimod#694 is released.
The reason why the bug in VartypeView.relabel_variable is manifested when using SA from neal, and not from dimod is because neal relabels variables to sequential integers (required by the c++ annealing code).
Embedding composites (embed_bqm in particular) return a BQM view when smear_vartype differs from source_bqm.vartype.
Fixed with dimod==0.9.6.
