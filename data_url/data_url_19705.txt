Hello! I've used the following code to simulate a Ramsey experiment: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/4229e505d3fc5917bef8173c142657a4a18035d7/tutorials/noise/2_relaxation_and_decoherence.ipynb (actually I'm planning to use it on real backends). My question is: how can I observe the Ramsey fringes at very long decays? Or, in other words, how can I observe the fringes in the image below beyond 30 microseconds. I've tried messing with num_of_gates in the code and putting more (changing it from (10, 300, 50) to, say, (10, 1500, 50)), but it distorts the fringes. Is there another way?

Hi! It's nice to see that you are interested in ignis.
The github issues are mainly used to report on bugs or suggest new features and code enhencements.
For questions you may use the ignis slack channel (in Qiskit workspace):
https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/CGZDF48EN
How do I join Slack? It seems like I need an invitation or something.
I think that you should only sign in: https://slack.com/intl/en-il/get-started#/
and join qiskit.slack.com workspace
I've signed in and tried to join qiskit.slack.com, but every time I go to that url it says that I have to enter an e-mail adress and a password for the workspace, which I don't have. The page suggests me to contact the workspace admin and ask for a new account. Should I go for it?
See: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ignis#contribution-guidelines-1
I've finally figured out a solution, for those who want to know: I used the code in https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/docs/guide/wwwq/decoherence and, in the Ramsey experiment part, I changed phase = phase + 6*np.pi/len(exp_vector) for phase = phase + 18*np.pi/len(exp_vector), and it measured three times longer. You can even put 12 or 24, I just made sure it was a multiple of 6 so the experiment doesn't fail, but I don't really know the theory behind it.
