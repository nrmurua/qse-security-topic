Following the instruction from https://qiskit.org/documentation/contributing_to_qiskit.html#install-install-from-source-label
I got error in installing qiskit-aqua
git clone https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua.git (OK)
cd qiskit-aqua (OK)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt (OK)
pip install -e .
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement scipy<=1.4.1,>=1.4 (from qiskit-aqua)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for scipy<=1.4.1,>=1.4
I expect to install qiskit-aqua
The file requirements.txt and constraints.txt are not compatible.
With fixes #1557 now is working fine.
