I cannot debug the issue properly because all the objects are multiprocessing objects. A minimal example showing the issue:
#87 fixes the example, but there are still some funny things going on. The AModel object works, but I have no idea where the data is stored and how I can access this data.
This probably has to do with the ServerManager object and multiprocessing.
PR of @alexcjohnson pending
Closed by #261 (and the whole issue is close to moot already)
