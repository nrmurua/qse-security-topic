Transfer the CNOTDihedral Operator class from Ignis to Terra quantum_info/Operators,
so that it can be useful not only to Randomized Benchmarking, but also to other applications.
The code is currently located in:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ignis/blob/master/qiskit/ignis/verification/randomized_benchmarking/dihedral.py
And the CNOTDihedral class already inherits from the abstract BaseOperator class.
The following functions should be moved:
