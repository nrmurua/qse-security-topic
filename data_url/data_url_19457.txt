As discussed in the meeting this morning, we could have the QAOA built-in in qibo, which may attract potential users. Here is my code (if you find it acceptable as a first version, I shall open a pull request):
import numpy as np
from qibo import models, hamiltonians
from qibo import optimizers # this is not currently used
class QAOA(object):
 """ This class implements the QAOA algorithm."""
At the moment, time evolution in qibo must have positive time increments, otherwise the code throws an exception. This is why this snippet of code implements a restricted or constrained version of the QAOA. My view is that there is nothing wrong with negative time increments in time evolution, as this simply means evolving backwards in time. As Stavros pointed out, this is irrelevant for the time evolution model itself, because it suffices to multiply the Hamiltonian by -1. However, it does matter if one is to develop applications like the QAOA, where the Hamiltonian is fixed. I don't know what your views on this are.
The SLSQP optimizer however does not seem to work, as it returns the same initial parameters right away. I've seen on the internet that other people run into this very same issue with this minimizer, but none of the proposed solutions worked here. So now I'm trying to understand how the mystic library works. Still, I decided to share the code so that you can tell me what you think (on the other hand, if we allow for negative time increments, there is no need to use constrained optimization).
I will try to have a go and check this snipped, thanks.
