Hi.  I'm working through your tutorial on using Forest (thanks for offering it out): http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#installation-and-getting-started
I wanted to clarify a usage convention.  In the section on the Quantum Fourier Transform, the state is prepared for use with a 3-qubit QFT function.  However, the state is only initialized for qubit-0 before being passed to the execution section:
wavf, _ = qvm.wavefunction(state_prep + qft3(0, 1, 2))
print(wavf.amplitudes)
However, in the section just above this, there is a comment:
"We can verify that this works by computing its wavefunction. However, we need to add some “dummy” qubits, because otherwise wavefunction would return a two-element vector."
I might be misunderstanding the meaning in the documentation, but I'm not too clear on when you are required to pass in the fully defined state-vector (all states defined, even if you need to use dummy identity operators etc.) and when just a single one will work, even though you are applying it to a 3-qubit function for example as in this case.
Thanks for any clarification.  Once again, thanks for open-sourcing out this great set of tools and capabilities.
Thanks.
Hi @td2014, The dummy qubits are required only for visualization of the 3-qubit register.  Without adding the dummy variables the following pyquil program
would print 1.0 + 0j|1> instead of 1.0 + 0j|001>.  The reason for this is that the QVM aggressively tries to minimize the number of qubits required to execute a Quil program.   For example, the following code would also return a 1.0 +0j|1>
What happened was that QVM relabeled qubit 100 to qubit zero.  QVM will always try to use the minimal resources required to simulate the behavior represented by the Quil program.  For example, running
returns 1.0 +0j|11>.  By padding the original program with Identity on qubit 2 and 1 we ensure the QVM allocates a wavefunction for 3-qubits.  We only do this to "visualize" the 3-qubit register. Mathematically, X(0) on a 3-qubit register is |001> but the QVM doesn't implicitly know you're operating on a 3-qubit register.
