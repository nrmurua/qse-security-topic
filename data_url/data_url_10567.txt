Current implementation of dimod.Sampler.from_qubo and dimod.Sampler.from_ising uses dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel as an intermediate BQM sent to .sample. LeapHybridSampler subclasses dimod.Sampler and inherits these methods.
Consequently, submitting (say) a large dict QUBO to HSS via LeapHybridSampler.sample_qubo creates a throwaway BinaryQuadraticModel before it's converted to a fileview-compatible BQM (e.g. AdjArrayBQM) and uploaded to SAPI.
Ultimately, we plan to update dimod to default to AdjVectorBQM, but before doing that (major change), we can implement LeapHybridSampler.from_ising and LeapHybridSampler.from_qubo to use AdjVectorBQM.
