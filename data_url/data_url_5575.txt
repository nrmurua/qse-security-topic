One may think of a random quantum channel without knowlege of some parameters. Because there is no implementation of such an error channel in Qiskit I provide such an error channel, based on the paper Generating random quantum channels by R.Kukulski et al.
The function random_kraus_error(num_kraus, num_qubits, prob, seed) generates an arbitrary number of Kraus matrices with random normally distributed complex entries, which are then weighted by a probability prob of the error. If we choose just one Kraus matrix (num_kraus=1) we get an unital channel. If we additionally choose prob=1 this corresponds to a unitary transformation. For $\mathrm{num}_{kraus} \gg 1$ the channel approximates a depolarizing channel $\mathcal{E}_r (\rho) \rightarrow  (1-p) \rho + p/d$
Perhaps you are interested to implement such a channel in Qiskit.
