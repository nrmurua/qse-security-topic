It would be desirable to write a set of shell and Lisp scripts that exercise tests on DQVM using mpiexec on various processes from the command line.
The idea would be to have something similar to https://github.com/marcoheisig/cl-mpi/blob/master/test-suite/parallel-tests.lisp
Eventually, these automated tests could be run on spot instances on AWS.
