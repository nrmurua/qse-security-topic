When using numbers as atom ids, they are converted to strings when going through the serialization and deserialization. The consequence is that the outcome will differ from the original value.
For example:
This is due to json converting object ids to strings. This might lead to undesired behaviors, because we never know what consequences we might meet by having strings instead of integers for the ids.
I can find two solutions:
I think the idea of having all qubit IDs be strings is worth considering, since this is not the first time this has posed problems.
However, I think it is not something that can be done quickly, so as a fast workaround I propose we change the BaseRegister._to_dict() method to use the from_coordinates() classmethod upon deserialization. This will allow the qubit ids to be stored in a list, so they will keep their type in serialization-deserialization roundtrip.
