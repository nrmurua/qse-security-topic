I think this may have been mentioned before but it is now becoming a bottleneck for two different ongoing projects that I am involved with. Ideally, one should be able to provide a vector as input. I realize this isn't something that can be done with an actual quantum computer as the backend but it is something that people expect of a simulator.
This was already added recently:
http://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projectq.backends.html#projectq.backends.Simulator.set_wavefunction
For code examples, please see the docs, the tests, and soon (this week) we will upload a new tutorial for the simulator...
