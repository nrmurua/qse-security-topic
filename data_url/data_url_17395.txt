Currently the cx_direction pass uses Hadamard gates to reverse the direction of a CNOT.  However, this then requires another unrolling pass to the basis set of gates.  Instead, cx_direction should use the U2(0,pi) gate for the Hadamard (which of course are the same thing) so that the final unrolling is not needed.
