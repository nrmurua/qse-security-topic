The background measurement process is not closed properly when show_progress is set.
I can only reproduce this on windows with real instruments connected, I will not investigate this further The new multiprocessing architecture will probably fix this, or give insights into what is happening.
Possibly related to #175 .
Also what is hanging exactly ?  this m=qcodes.get_bg(); ?
@giulioungaretti The m=qcodes.get_bg() returns a Measurement, which means the background job is still running. When I insert a matplotlib.pyplot.close('all') at the end of the qcodes.Loop the issue seems to go away, but I have no idea why.
oh, what a clusterfuck, anyway. wontfix is the right label :D
Closing the issue since multiprocessing was removed.
