This should be raising an error:
Instead it returns malformed data:
I'll take a stab at it. Can you please assign it to me.
I propose to do it as follows:
LMKWYT ?
@Strilanc : Can you please let me know if this sounds okay ?
That is not sufficient, because operations may be appended into circuits dynamically via append, iadd, etc.
We can either enforce this at the circuit level by checking at all edit points or at the simulator level by checking at all entry points.
I do think we should check in Moment's constructor, as a sanity check.
Thanks @Strilanc
I am almost finished with the coding. One question I have before submitting PR is:
how to deal with measurements when the key is not provided (as I can see that the cirq.measure doesn't need key as mandatory arg and populates it using _default_measurement_key when not provided).
I see unit tests like :
which are currently passing, but would fail. What should be done in these cases ? Is the failure okay or any other behaviour is expected?
