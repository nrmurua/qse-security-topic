Matplotlib 3 now raises an ImportError instead of a RuntimeError when Python is not compiled as a framework under MacOS X so the code we have in place for detecting this failure and skip the affected tests is working no more.
Some tests are failing informing about Python not being compiled as a framework:
Can not reproduce in local but you need MacOS X and Python somehow not compiled as a framework, then:
The tests are skipped under these circumstances without raising.
Catch both RuntimeError and ImportError to keep backward compatiblity until we deprecate support for Matplotlib prior to version 3.0.
It'd be convenient to pin dependencies.
