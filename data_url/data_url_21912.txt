doing a conda install install -c m-labs/dev ... artiq and expecting the latest 4.0.dev version doesn't work because old versions (for artiq 3.x) of openocd/bscan-spi-bitstreams are confusing it.
installing a specific artiq=4.0.dev=... version works.
AFAICT this is currently only an inconvenience. Fixing it would involve breaking earlier 3.x (removing the old openocds and fixing 3.x+1) or adding an epoch to the openocd version (and depend on that in 4.x).
