Description of the issue
the wrapping of the modulo operation in EigenGate._equal_up_to_global_phase_ makes it dependent on the sign of the difference between the exponents. As a result cirq.equal_up_to_global_phase() depends on the ordering of its arguments when the two gates' exponents differ by a negligible factor (see below)
i think all it would take to fix this is adding an abs() to the linked lines, e.g.:
or alternatively replacing both with linalg.tolerance.near_zero_mod()
