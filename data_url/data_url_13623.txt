Very often one is interested in qualitatively "seeing" the best fit generated by a ZNE factory.
Currently it is possible to do this by hand: by extracting data from the factory and plotting it.
Maybe it could nice if Factory objects had a self.plot() method which directly produces a plot of the best fit with a some nice and fixed style.  Perhaps we could also include additional data in the plot legend  (e.g. zne limit, error, etc. ). In this way one would get a compact visualization of the full error mitigation process.
This idea is inspired by the lmfit package in which a similar feature exists. See, e.g., https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/examples/example_emcee_Model_interface.html
Possible drawback:  need to add matplotlib to the requirements.
+1.
Note matplotlib is already a requirement of Cirq https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/requirements.txt#L6.
Agreed, especially since we already have the dependency with cirq.
