When we implemented some of the latest new features, such as the TrotterHamiltonian from symbols or the circuit depth calculation, there were several bugs in the code that were not captured from our tests but were indentified by some application examples. This is not how it should normally happen and the tests should discover as many issues as possible.
With that in mind, I would like to review our tests and modify them so that they follow the "unit testing" idea more closely. That is have tests for each small function that exists in the code. Some features such as the circuit fusion or how the gates are "compiled" for distributed execution are currently only tested globally and not function-by-function.
Along with the test review, I think it would also make the code better if we had look at #148. These issues may be considered lower priority compared to adding features needed for applications but we should keep them in mind.
