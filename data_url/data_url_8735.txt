Would it be possible to add a qiskit backend? I'm not familiar with the codebase, and I would be open to contributing to this feature, but I'm curious about the feasibility of it.
Hi @aThorp96!
Sorry for the late response! One can definitely add qiskit as a backend. What one needs to do is to implement a different quantumEngine, see for example how the stabilizer backend is implemented here.
Let me know if you have further questions.
