When attempting to create and run a custom noisy simulator using noise.thermal_relaxation_error, the code below outputs the following error:
Specifically, I create a noisy simulator for thermal relaxation errors on Mumbai by setting each t1, t2, and time value for each qubit to those given by noise.device.thermal_relaxation_values(backend.properties()) and attempt to run a simple hello world circuit on the custom noise simulator.
The code above (with valid provider information added back) should run and output counts generated with the custom noise model.
Not sure but this will run as expected with both Sim = AerSimulator() and noise_sim = AerSimulator(noise_model=NoiseModel.from_backend(backend, readout_error=True)) so it seems to be related to the custom noise model.
thermal_sim = AerSimulator(noise_model) should be thermal_sim = AerSimulator(noise_model=noise_model).
That fixed it, thanks!
