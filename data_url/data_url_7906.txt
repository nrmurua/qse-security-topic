Hi again,
In the documents there is an example of how to do an animation of a Bloch sphere by saving the frames of the movie using a for loop like so:
With b.clear() we erase the points and vectors in the image, which is nice for updating the data, but What if I want to update also the attributes of the Bloch sphere?
To give an example let's say that I want the viewing angle of the Bloch sphere to smoothly change throughout the animation. I can define a function like so:
This function changes the viewing angle across time from the initial [azim_0, elev_0] configuration to the final [azim_f, elev_f] configuration in a linear manner.
So I thought that by doing
My animation would had that change in position of the "camera", but the result is just as if b.view wouldn't update.
The only way I can make this work is by making a new bloch sphere on each iteration and defining all the attributes again and again (which I find highly inconvenient in terms of speed), like so;
Could Qutip be modified so that attributes (such as viewing angle or the color of vectors) can be updated in the way I showed before? So that we don't have to create a new bloch sphere on each iteration of the animation?
