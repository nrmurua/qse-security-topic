We are going to split the tutorial into three sections.
We are going to add to a WIP PR that i will set up and if you want to help in the rework that would be great. Either you can help by commenting here or helping in the content. The names are the assigned people that are going to coordinate the different sections.
To help out please commit to https://github.com/jaygambetta/qiskit-tutorial.
@jaygambetta  Would you mind updating the getting started QISKit tutorials?
@dtmcclure  Do you think you can complete the random benchmarking within this week?
@adcorcol  Do you think you can complete the rest of tutorials for approximate quantum computers
@rraymondhp I believe others are still working on adding functionality to the SDK's tools.qcvv module to enable a randomized benchmarking notebook to be written. I'll be happy to help out with the notebook once that's ready.
I started the Merge #118 . I am going to close this so that we can make little prs to fix the remainder of issues. The new version is in master and i have made the old version another branch that we can keep around until we are finished.
