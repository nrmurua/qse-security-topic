Would you be able to upload an image of just the board as one piece?  I'd like to have it made by printplaygames.com, but need a single image that I can upload there.  If The Game Crafter will have an option to buy just the board, that would be great as well.
Thanks!

@admiral142 Does this work?
Perfect!  Thank you!
