Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
We need explicit tests and extensive tests for the functions in tf_utils and qt_utils. Code coverage is not given by the current tests and several functions are not curretly working, correctly, e.g. tf_superoper_average_fidelity.
https://github.com/q-optimize/c3/blob/dev/c3/utils/tf_utils.py#L802-L807
As those functions are the backbone for all calculations good tests would be essential for all computations.
Describe the solution you'd like
Write tests
Describe alternatives you've considered
Additional context
Some tests for tf_utils functions were added in #99
