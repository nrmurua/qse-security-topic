helloï¼Œ I want to know the specific code representation of the quantum phase estimation gate.
You can see the code for the gate in the corresponding decomposition rule. You can find it in the following file: projectq/setups/decompositions/phaseestimation.py
Hi, i know this file.  i've seen this before.  i don't know how to realize the square root of U(It's acting on the qubits of the system ), the fourth square root of U on projectq.
