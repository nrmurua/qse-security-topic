It takes ~minutes to build the docs from scratch. It really seems to get bogged down reading and writing the autodoc generated/ files. However, other projects seem to get away with using autodoc and at least as many functions that need documenting without these long build times. I'm worried there's a lot of custom processing hacked into conf.py that could be slowing things down
Confirming my suspicions; blanking out the contents of api.rst makes everything go nice and quick
I will close this issue if that's okay, please reopen if you don't agree.
