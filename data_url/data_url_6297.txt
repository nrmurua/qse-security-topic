I'm not sure whether QPager is capable of effectively doubling capacity (for 1 extra total qubit) by using as many USE_HOST_POINTER pages as VRAM-only pages.
Hypothetically, it might turn out it definitely can't, depending on the direct memory access controller ("DMAC"). However, this might depend on whether the GPU/accelerator involved has sufficiently modern DMA technology.
It's worth looking into.
In effect, this has been achieved by the environment variable QRACK_QPAGER_DEVICES_HOST_POINTER, as its purpose and usage is explained in the README.
