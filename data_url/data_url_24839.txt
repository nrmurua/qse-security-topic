Implement a test in MATLAB which
Preferably the acquisition device should be a (moslty) generic (buffered) SM channel so that oscilloscopes can also be used.
To test higher level functions of the interface to AWGs, a virtual AWG/scope that closes the loop without going through hardware could quite be useful.
The current test does not rely on smrun, since we wanted it to have minimal dependencies and just test the drivers.
Makes sense, though you can still use the generic driver functions.
I think this is no longer relevant and does not refer to this project anyway.
If still relevant, the issue should be re-opened in the pulsecontrol repository.
