GST should give us an estimate of the readout error in the circuit, by giving us a single POVM measurement operator. In the current implementation in qiskit, this POVM operator seems to be a perfect projection.
Following code runs a GST on a simple basis set, using a noise_model that includes readout noise. GST should be able to give us an estimate of that readout error.
The above code should not return a perfect projection [[1., 0.], [0., 0.]] for result_gates['E'].
This was a whole missing piece (thanks for catching it!), fixed in #408 .
