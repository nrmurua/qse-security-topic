#issue discovered together with Antonello Aita, Luca Crippa and Robert Loredo
This is because it is not listed in the Aqua requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt, or setup.py.
I am transferring the issue.
cvxopt was changed, by request, to be a completely optional install that requires the user to manually install this pkg in order to run any function, like QSVM, which uses it. An error, with a message telling the user the required install, is raised if it's run without.
I have also encountered the same problem, when I run QSVM example.
@sassan72 As stated above this was requested to be removed from the install so that it was completely optional and would hence require a separate installation outside of installing Aqua in order to ensure that package was availble. If it is not installed an error is raised to inform that it needs to be installed to run the particular code being used.
