Rolling back to last version known to be good. Continuing phaser testing using M-Labs code.
Observation: It takes > 50 seconds to load demo_2tone.py. Not sure when this regression occurred.
Expectation: Loading in about one second.
After long delay the output on scope looks as expected.
Likely not a problem with the latest version.
That one you are reporting about is before a lot of TCP fixes.
Sure. I can believe this got better with TCP fixes. In light of #769 what version do you recommend for continuing phaser testing?
With recent updates repository/demo_2tone.py loads in < 2 seconds. OK.
Note that if you use artiq_run, a good part of those 2 seconds are from setuptools (pypa/setuptools#510). Master-run experiments are not affected.
