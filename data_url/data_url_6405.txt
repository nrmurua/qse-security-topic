OpenCL kernel compile time has become a significant slowdown and should be reduced. General use cases when wrapped in ProjectQ or running on a Raspberry Pi are significantly impacted.
One way to reduce minimum compile time is to load kernels on specific demand for an operation. Kernels can also be pre-compiled, potentially as part of the libqrack.a build process.
Where is the time charged right now? Startup in first engineer creation?
Not keen on amortizing it across operations.
How much time are we talking about?
Yes, the full compilation happens the first time a QEngineOCL is instantiated. I understand not wanting compilation-on-demand, to an extent, but SimulaQron freely kills the ProjectQ execution entirely, if it restarts nodes, forcing recompilation if the kernels. The compile time is also significant, when instantiating a QUnit on the Raspberry Pi 3. I think we can pre-compile, but the compilation probably has to happen for all devices on the system when the library is built.
It could be about a minute, on the Raspberry Pi.
I'm working on a draft, right now, of a precompilation option for the OpenCL kernels. This will turn the compilation time into a one-time cost, when a utility is invoked, and by default at compile time. I should have a draft complete sometime Saturday or else late tonight.
See #169 for the resolution to this issue.
