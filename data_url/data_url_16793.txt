Similar to as was added for Registers in #2288, the QuantumCircuit constructor should test if a provided argument can be cast to an int before it raises an error.
For reference, here is where Register does the check:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/2ee7a3a/qiskit/circuit/register.py#L39
and where QuantumCircuit makes new Registers from the provided int:

@1ucian0 have you made progress on this? I'd like to give it a go if not (I'm new to qiskit and open source and this looks like a nice first issue to try out!)
Sure! Go ahead!
Yay great I'll get cracking! Is there a corresponding test file that needs updating as well?
Yes, tests should be added (maybe in the files we already have?). You can use the code from OP for that.
