Hello.  I'm trying to create a simple C++ program with which I can create and execute a quantum circuit.
I'm adding include paths, but I got to a point where I need variants.hpp, but I see multiple versions in my built xacc local git clone.
Can somebody let me know which file I should be using?
Better yet, give me an example makefile or cmake setup to do what I'd like to do?
My ultimate goal is to implement some nuclear physics algorithms on multiple platforms (IBM, Rigetti, etc).
Thanks.
Hi,
This is a typical example of a CMakeLists.txt to build an XACC-based application:
https://github.com/ORNL-QCI/xacc_application_example/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt
At the very minimal, we need to find_package(XACC REQUIRED) and  link to xacc::xacc.
Also, that git repo is a very good example to get started.
Hope that this may help you.
Thanks!  That's exactly what I needed.
