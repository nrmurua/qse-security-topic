System information
A description of your system. Please provide:
Thanks for reaching out. This probably has something to do with upgrading boto3 to have the braket client. Please run
pip install boto3 --upgrade
To troubleshoot further, please make sure that you can call get_device in boto3: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/braket.html#Braket.Client.get_device
Let us know if this has solved your problem.
Thank you for the answer.
I upgraded boto3 and this did not solve the problem, I have the same error when I call the get_device() method.
My version of boto3 is 1.14.46.
pip freeze | grep boto3
Thanks @jmp-aws, I'm still unable to reproduce the error. I think it's due to the AWS CLI not being up to date, because the get_device API isn't able to be called.
Another option is to uninstall and re-install boto3.
Or, to start from a new virtualenv and run:
pip install amazon-braket-sdk
Still unable to reproduce the error.
Have you tried running:
aws braket help in the command line and seeing if get-device appears in the list of available commands?
If not, the version of the AWS CLI you have needs to be updated.
working on trying to remove braket definition of aws cli installation
@NicoSchwaller does removal of any aws cli models, uninstallation, and re-installation help resolve the issue? These are the commands that solved the issue for myself

Yes, this did solve the problem, thanks a lot!
