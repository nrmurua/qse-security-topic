When using list(get_qubits()) as input to run_and_measure the list is sometimes ordered and sometimes not, as get_qubits() returns a set.  From the documentation the ordering of qubits in the returned results was not quite clear to me and this also added to that confusion. Maybe it is more intuitive (and from my experience one potential error source less while evaluating ðŸ˜„) if get_qubits() returns a sorted list and/or the results are always returned in ascending order.
Example code (I am using pyquil 1.8.0 and python 3.6.2):
output:
run_and_measure will now measure and return results for all qubits on a device
