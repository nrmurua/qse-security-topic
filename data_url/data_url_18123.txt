I can create a circuit for generating arbitrary quantum superposition with initialize() function.
I know there is a call to inverse() function within the initialize(). So, it should be easy to do that (just do not execute that call to inverse()).
But I cannot find a way to inverse a circuit I obtain from the initialize() nor for any quantum circuit that I have.
Access to inverse() function, or, at least an example of using CompositeGate that supports operation to invert the gate.
There seems to be no test case and examples of using CompositeGate from the initialize().
QuantumCircuits are not in general reversible (could contain measure or reset). CompositeGates are reversible, and a simple call to inverse() on any CompositeGate should do the trick. InitializeGate is just one example of a CompositeGate.
As for tests, they are added in #573. I agree we should have more examples for the CompositeGate and make it easier to use (see open issue #316), but I think this current issue is resolved. Feel free to reopen if your problem persists.
