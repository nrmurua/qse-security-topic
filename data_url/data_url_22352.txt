Regarding step:
@jordens Your scientific spinbox design modifies the coefficient part by a fixed amount (whatever the exponent) when the arrows are clicked. ARTIQ/Qt has a step parameter that modifies the floating point value by a fixed amount. What shall we do?
I had put a couple thoughts on that general topic in comments in the code in the scanwidget. I would like to consistently link the four sources of "step/resolution/tick/snap": the ticker step, the spinboxes value resolution, the spinbox step size, the ticker step modified by npoints. But I have not decided yet what the best approach is and whether it is actually doable.
The current implementation looses the unit suffix most of the time when ctrl- or shift-wheeling on a spinbox.
An intuitive coupling of singleStep and relativeStep with the ticker step is still desirable but not urgent.
Forked issue.
