Implement the the TablePulseTemplate class (and maybe find a better name while at it) which is the atomic element of pulse definitions. Implementation should include all methods required to define a pules using the class but not yet the translation to waveforms (see #20).
This also includes the implementation of the abstract base class PulseTemplate as well as ParameterDeclaration and auxialiary classes.
Part of #13 .
Requires clarification of the issue #28 .
Mostly done (cf. #31, #30).
