In the last ${TBD} hours prior to publicizing this repository, we should lock down code changes and run through the following checks on at least two different machines:
Additionally, we should ensure that all incoming changes (regardless of source) pass through the review process before being pushed to master:
Finally, a general "repository cleanliness" sweep should be run:
Not sure if it belongs here, but we should get contributions right on the file headers. Only the people (very) originally involved appear, and many missing: Orion, Alan, Alexandru, etc.
We should get contributions right on the file headers.
Agreed. Given that this is now a decently long list and CONTRIBUTORS.md (#136) documents it, should we do like Cirq and attribute the work to "The qFlex Developers"?

Here there is a NASA related issue. We cannot change the headers for those files where I put the NASA copyright (which are the original [or almost the original] qFlex files). This accounts to:
For the other files, I'm ok to change the headers.
What I can do, it's to add a field contributors in each of the NASA files that says:
Create #156 to discuss about headers/contributions.
Remove dead branches #157.
Update from 9:30 meeting: once all required PRs are submitted (currently includes #155, #140, and #154) I will send out a "PR freeze" notice. At this point, we will run the required checks:
Once all checks are complete and an hour has passed since the start of the PR-freeze, @s-mandra will officially open-source qFlex :)
All checks are complete. qFlex is ready for open-source!
Good to go.
