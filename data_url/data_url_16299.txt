When printing the (not-yet-released) version number of qiskit components, i.e., the release+revision number, please print the full SHA1 of the revision so that it's unambiguous/easy to recreate a specific mid-release build (e.g., remove the :7 below)
I'm not sure I understand the need for this, using the the short sha1 is a pretty standard pattern for dev package versions and git can understand it natively (you can use the short sha1 for any git command that wants a sha1 and it will work fine). The full sha1 is 40 characters long and that seems excessive to include in a version string.
Are you hitting an issue using the short sha1?
Hello,
