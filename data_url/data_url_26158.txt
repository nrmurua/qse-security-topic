The following would allow one to create an n-dimensional cyclic permutation matrix.

Part of me thinks this should go into matrices/ instead of perms/ as I think perms/ will eventually be refactored to include less "matrix-specific" definitions.
I'll take this one on
Sounds great, @Bchass !
Have fun, and let us know if you encounter any friction when implementing this. Thank you for the interest in toqito, and excited to see what you are able to put together!
