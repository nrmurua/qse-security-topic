The following code snippet, which is also available in the README.md file, is returning the error as mentioned in the title:
from qiskit import *
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure([0,1], [0,1])
backend_sim = BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = backend_sim.run(assemble(qc)).result()
print(result.get_counts(qc))
The traceback is as follows:
_RemoteTraceback                          Traceback (most recent call last)

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

BasicAerError: 'qasm_simulator encountered unrecognized operation "h"'
The qc.h(0) part of the code is causing the error. When I commented out qc.h(0), an output of {'00': 1024} was returned.
Just run the above code snippet.
As per README.md, the output should be {'00': 513, '11': 511}.
Honestly, I have no idea how this bug can be resolved by someone like me.
See discussions in #4625 and #4759.

Thanks for mentioning my issue there, @enavarro51. There seems to be a conflict of opinions regarding the resolution of this issue.
I updated the title to cover updating the README so that the examples are all valid code. The issue of whether BasicAer should implement H can be discussed in #4625 .
