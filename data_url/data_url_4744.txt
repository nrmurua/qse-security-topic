Creating a DeviceSpec object involves specifying a target device at two distinct places:
It is, however, not checked if these two values are equal. Therefore, in certain cases, different values are accepted, making it a (rare) edge case for DeviceSpec creation.
Expected behavior: (What you expect to happen)
The target values contained in a DeviceSpec object are the same.
Actual behavior: (What actually happens)
These target values can differ.
Reproduces how often: (What percentage of the time does it reproduce?)
Rarely: the user has to explicitly pass a target different to the target defined in layout.
System information: (post the output of import strawberryfields as sf; sf.about())
SF 0.15.0
The solution could involve removing the target argument and deriving target from the layout specified. This might be a breaking change to the stack though.
Perhaps a short term solution is to simply include validation on Spec creation, to ensure that the two target values are identical?
This has been fixed in #656. The DeviceSpec object uses the target value in the device specification dictionary. There could still potentially be two targets in the specification dictionary (in the layout and in the target field), although this is related to the device specifications on the platform and not an SF issue.
