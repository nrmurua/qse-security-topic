Hi @ggardet, thank you for pointing out this bug. The team will work on finding a fix.
Hi @ggardet , would you be able to check if you can build the branch from #296?
#296 on top of 0.16.2 fixes the build, but it fails on test on aarch64:
And also on ppc64le:
Thank you for checking @ggardet !
Closing this since it should be fixed in the latest release. The Walrus no longer contains any C++ dependencies, and should work fine on all platforms. @ggardet Let me know if you're still having issues.
