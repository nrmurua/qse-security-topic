unclear where this is to be done in current code
Simply add the attribute's name in the list _callback_attribute
--> this will call module._callback() whenever the attribute is changed
--> by default, _callback just calls setup()
But in general, if this is an iq module for instance, this should probably be done at the iq level itself
indeed, input should have call_setup=True in all relevant modules!
