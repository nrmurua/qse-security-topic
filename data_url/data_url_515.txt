I have been reading and following the documentation for a while. However, I haven't managed compile anything in C++. The xacc Python package works fine though. E.g., how can I compile the first C++ code snippet in doc->Basics->Accelerator? (I used the docker so the files should be in standard locations.)
Hi,
There is an example (building an app executable based on XACC library) here that you might find useful:

That solves it. Thanks! I really think this should the first thing in the doc after installation.
