Includes the hardware ones (with ARTIQ_ROOT).
OK to skip the timing tests that involve network round-trips if they fail due to VM slowness.
The problem is not VM slowness but concurrent execution. VMs are near native speed (at least network-wise; copy-on-write disks are somewhat slow), but they are easily CPU-starved.
Unittests on Windows are now run by CI.
