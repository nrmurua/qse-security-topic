Description of the issue
When I was trying to run the following, I find cg.optimized_for_sycamore not only cancel out the gate and its inverse but also delete the qubit.
Original circuit:
After optimized:
And sometimes it happens and sometimes not. For example, for the following circuit, cg.optimized_for_sycamore only cancel out the two H gate and corresponding qubits, but leave two Toffoli gates.
I don't know if it is supposed to be like this.
Cirq version
0.10.0
optimize_for_sycamore is not meant to be a general purpose optimizer for any quantum circuit. Rather, its main job is to convert circuits to use the gateset supported by the device, which is why it is decomposing the toffolis into native gates. It then runs some simple cleanup optimization passes, such as consolidating single qubit gates where possible, which is why things like successive H gates get removed.
First case looks good:
So does the second case:
I suggest we close this issue.
