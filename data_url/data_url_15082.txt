If one uses tox4, the environment is recreated each time one switches from the black to lint environment, or vice versa.
See above
Environment should not be re-created
Several options of how to fix this:
I reckon option 1 is probably the best, but with the caveat that I don't know the precise reason we're specifically not doing that right now.  I suspect it's a space-saving optimisation, but @mtreinish will know.  If that's the reason, I'm probably ok with just using the extra venv storage space for people that want to use that environment - if we reduce the dependencies right down to just black[jupyter] at the right version, it probably shouldn't even be too heavy.
Option 2 I think ends up with hard-to-read code when the environments are actually separate, and the formatting env (it probably should actually include doing cargo fmt as well) probably doesn't even need to install the package (unlike the lint one), so if we're optimising we'd maybe want to do both of those.  (I like the generative environments when there's only minor differences, it's just that this isn't one of those cases.)
Option 3: I'm not wild about adding a plugin that specifically calls itself out as experimental, and at the end of the day is effectively deliberately re-instating a bug into tox.
