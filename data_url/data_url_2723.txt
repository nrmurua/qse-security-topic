test_controlled_op_to_operations_concrete_case fails on my machine due to an accuracy issue:
E       assert [(cirq.Y**-0....dQubit(u't'))] == [(cirq.Y**-0.5...dQubit(u't'))]
E         At index 0 diff: (cirq.Y**-0.5000000000000001).on(cirq.NamedQubit(u't')) != (cirq.Y**-0.5).on(cirq.NamedQubit(u't'))
@dstrain115 you were looking into this, correct?
Yeah, it should be fixed.  Do you still see it manifest at HEAD?  If not, we can close.
Just wanted to close this issue.
