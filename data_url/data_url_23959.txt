Hi everyone, i'm trying to install qiskit_metal in windows. i've followed the step in the documentation : creating a repository on GIT and cloning it in a folder on my pc. Then i navigate in the folder

cd-> folder but when i write "conda env create -n <env_name> environment.yml" gives an error : file not found. Of course the file enivrronment.yml is present in the related folder. Any advice ? thanks.
Have you try to replace the <env_name> into your environment name you want to make?
For example try conda env create -n METAL environment.yml to create your environment with name "METAL".
Ditto on @q-inho 's suggestion
