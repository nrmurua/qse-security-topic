I would like to start a computation with an initial state whose is the ground state of a particular Hamiltonian. That can be done easily with Qibo once I have the ground state. However, my issue is that I do not see an option to generate the eigenvectors (given the Hamiltonian). Instead, I see the one that delivers the eigenvalues (K.linalg.eigvalsh(self.hamiltonian)). I tried to implement it myself with K.linalg.eig(self.hamiltonian) but I am facing data type errors. Anyway, I think it could be a nice feature to have in Qibo.
Okay, I just fixed the data type error by adding an 'h', K.linalg.eigh(self.hamiltonian). Anyway, it would be great to have the option directly from hamiltonians.py in Qibo.
