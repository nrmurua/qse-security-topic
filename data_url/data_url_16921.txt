Not sure of the cause, but from qiskit.providers.ibmq import IBMQ, IBMQBackend in qiskit.tools.monitor.backend_overview is raising following #3325
I'm able to reproduce this locally, in the test when I give it credentials. I think it might be caused by the import changes made in #3325 https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/tools/__init__.py#L61 so that the __init__ of qiskit.tools had things defined to autosummary. It might be causing weird import race condition because of namespace packaging. The IBMQ imports in the backend overview aren't fatal if they're missing: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/tools/monitor/backend_overview.py#L24 moving the import as done in #3325 is probably causing backend_overview to get imported before python uses pkgutil to resolve the namespace packages for qiskit.providers with pkgutil. So if ibmq hasn't been added to the namespace yet this just catches the import error and passes and those module level imports are never defined.
I'm thinking a way to workaround this is to make the import a runtime import (although I'm generally not a fan of that, but it's probably a necessity here unlike the pylint circular import checker) so that we try the import only after all the imports are complete which should give us enough time to resolve the namespace packaging and add ibmq if it's present.
