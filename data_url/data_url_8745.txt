On step 13/14 of the Dockerfile in https://github.com/SoftwareQuTech/SimulaQron/blob/master/Dockerfile the cd command fails.

Therefore the cargo stuffs can't be executed.
I believe this is fixed on the Develop branch. All the libraries got kicked out and the Dockerfile only got updated yesterday. I expect @AckslD will eventually merge into master.
In the meantime, a workaround is to use the Dockerfile from Develop (just download the individual file).
ok - tnx
