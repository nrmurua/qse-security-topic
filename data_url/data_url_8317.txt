Since the update to version 4.4, calling mesolve without collapse operators prints a message "no collapse operator, using sesolve" to stdout. Is printing this message really necessary? It breaks our examples for the krotov package, see e.g. the notebook https://krotov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/01_example_simple_state_to_state.html, where these messages show up in the notebook when it runs with qutip 4.4. Of course I understand that the message is technically correct, and we could work around the problem in krotov, but it was nice to be able to use mesolve as a catch-all for either a Schrödinger equation or a master equation. We'd have to start routing different cases to mesolve and sesolve manually, otherwise. Personally, I would argue that this kind of message should be emitted as logger.debug instead of print, if at all.
As #1049 has been merged, I’m going to assume this will be fixed in the next release. Closing.
