When trying to perform a Loop in the background with a  VisaInstrument I get a pickling related error. (so this might be related to #53). The error message I get is ValueError: ctypes objects containing pointers cannot be pickled.
A minimal example is included below. I cannot see anything in the example that cannot be pickled, so I my best guess is that the VisaInstrument itself has issues.
Might be related to #53
Yes, this is exactly #53, and is the whole reason for creating instrument servers. Aside from the logistical issues with pickling, there's a more fundamental issue: in as far as instrument objects hold state (which you want them to, for snapshot and other cases you just want the most recently set or measured value of some parameter) you should not be duplicating them, or the states will diverge. With the instrument server you have one real copy of the instrument, all the others just proxy it.
@alexcjohnson Ok, making at most one copy of an Instrument makes sense. The error messages are quite confusing though. In the long term we need logging on the server (so one can see error messages on that side, also see #98). In the short term, how about adding something like
to the Instrument class?
@peendebak @alexcjohnson just randomly stumbled upon this one, I think it should be closed as in the documentation is (although not yet pushed)  clearly stated.
Actually I quite like the idea of __getstate__ returning a useful exception. Sorry for not looking at your comment earlier @peendebak - I'll add this in as a fix to this issue.
I am happy with PR #254, I will close this issue.
Haha, merging #254 would have closed this automatically... But I will take this as a ðŸ’ƒ for it!
