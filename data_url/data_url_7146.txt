Match h3 and h4 tags that have id attributes and place a “section” icon in the left gutter that is a hyperlink to that heading. This will make it easy to bookmark or copy the link for pasting elsewhere.
This was solved many moons ago. Instead of a “section” icon (§) on the left gutter, this now exists as a “hash” icon (#) on the right gutter edge. All h2, h3, and h4 tags within main are processed—if they do not contain an explicit id attribute one is automatically generated and applied based on its innerText content. Then an anchor hyperlink is generated for the gutter edge; for the user to either click on or copy the URL from. This is done in other/navigation.js: https://github.com/stewdio/q.js/blob/master/other/navigation.js#L253-L269
