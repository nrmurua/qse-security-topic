When creating a control-flow instruction with the new builder interface, the QuantumCircuit bodies used in the params cannot be copied with QuantumCircuit.copy.  This is because the builders interally store the qargs and cargs as tuple (since they should be immutable), but QuantumCircuit.copy assumes that they'll be list.
The copy should succeed here.  This is needed in Aer 0.10.
The simplest is just to make the builder interface output lists instead of tuples.  We could change qargs.copy() in QuantumCircuit.copy to be tuple(qargs), but right now that will have some performance implications, and it's pretty likely that there are other places that assume that the args are lists.
Personally I would prefer us to change the QuantumCircuit.data element type to be (Instruction, Tuple[Qubit], Tuple[Clbit]), but that's a much bigger change than is necessary right now.  It's currently best to be consistent.
