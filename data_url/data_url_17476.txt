Circuit:
This works:
This fails:
I would expect that the new pipeline works like the old one.
This isn't a bug. If you add these two passes before the StochasticSwap, it works.
The assumption with the way passes are set up is that the embedding stage is itself made up of a few stages (find some good subset of qubits, then mark the other idle qubits as available ancillas (add ancillas to the virtual circuit too to correspond to them)).
The reason we haven't made all of this one pass is we want to keep open the possibility of doing more intelligent ancilla allocation.
