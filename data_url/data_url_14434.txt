backend.run(...) fails to parse the parameter_binds argument (at least for the case of using a ParameterVector). The same code runs OK when backend is an AerSimulator.
The parameter_binds argument of backend.run() can give a nice speed up of simulations. Ideally, execution should be backend agnostic so users can switch between testing their code on simulator & real backends with confidence. So fixing this would be helpful.
Output:

...

The parameters should be bound successfully for the real backend like they are for the simulator backend.

Actually this behavior does match the documentation. Maybe that disqualifies it as a "bug," though it's still surprising.
Both AerSimulator.run() and IBMQBackend.run() accept a kwarg parameter_binds=, but they have different formats.
AerSimulator.run() wants a list where each entry is:

IBMQBackend.run() wants:

Would it make sense to require backends use a standardized form of this argument?
In case it's helpful for anyone else hitting this issue, here's some code that I think converts from the AerSimulator form to the IBMQBackend form, at least for the simple case of a length-1 parameter_binds argument for AerSimulator:
