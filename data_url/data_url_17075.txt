composite gates (i.e. without classical registers) work fine, but with classical registers it cannot be drawn. The logic is here:

latex and mpl can do this.
Example code?
It this the expected output?


Error. I agree needs to be fixed.
No mpl and latex also need to be fixed. The box needs to extend over the classical registers as well. But at least they draw something. I would say text is priority since that's the default drawer.
