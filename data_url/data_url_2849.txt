Injects a gate after the measurement. Probably shoudn't do any at all.
Also it should perhaps be called DephasingChannel.
Let me know if you think this is obsolete, given the new approach.  Otherwise, I will fix this, since it might take a while for the new approach to be done.  (I will keep the name the same for now though)
I think the issue is still relevant, but that it should be delayed because of the new work on noise. It will be properly obsoleted at a later time.
@Strilanc Does the recent work on noise obsolete this?
This is obsolete, although oddly prescient of running into the same issue with the new models. But there's already a bug for that.
