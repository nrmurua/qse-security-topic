When using the aer_simulator_statevector with execute there are no counts nor state vector returned in the results. This works if instead you use
When wrapping the same backend in a QuantumInstance and using its execute method, a state vector is returned as expected.

This is expected behaviour - the implicit snapshotting of the statevector was removed quite some time ago, in part because it causes more problems when people want to make mid-circuit snapshots, and expanded the memory cost of results for the more common use-case of not needing statevectors (especially for large circuits).  BasicAer and QuantumInstance are largely unmaintained, and QuantumInstance is fully scheduled for removal.
You can make the statevector available by running QuantumCircuit.save_statevector() in the place you want to make the snapshot.
