Ethernet fails if a 10/100/1000 (RGMII) SFP is already inserted when Kasli is powered on.
Ethernet works.
No Ethernet link. Funnily enough, the Ethernet link LED is on when the RJ45 cable is unplugged and off when it is plugged.
Removing and reinserting the SFP with the Kasli powered up works around this bug.
Problem is not present with 1000BASE-X SFPs.
Not tested on Kasli 1.1.
Just tested on a Kasli v1.1 by flashing 6.7515.3f631c41.beta and the issue is reproducible. Am looking into the issue and trying to fix it.
Should be fixed with m-labs/misoc#105 now, at least tested on a Kasli 2.0.
