Since #6392 we explicitly check for unfiltered DeprecationWarning but other types of warning do also indicate an issue that should be investigated, and might be missed due to all the text scrolling past during a test-suite run. (This happened for #6553 (comment))
If the performance hit isn't too terrible we might consider running the test suite in python development (-X dev) mode to enable some additional more-expensive checking.
