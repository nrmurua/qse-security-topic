Github Actions is free for public repositories and allows up to 20 concurrent runners per repo. We should consider migrating from Travis CI to use Actions instead.
Some sample conversion steps can be seen here, and the full documentation for workflow config is available on the Github help site.
@Strilanc - following up on offline discussion. In my personal experience, Github Actions are very user-friendly: you can pretty much write a script and the matrix of conditions to run it under, and Actions will happily trundle through them.
