In the process_tomography tutorial notebook, running this block of code:
leads to this error:
ValueError: object arrays are not supported
This is the full stack trace:
I'm testing the tutorial with all of the other qiskit elements also in their most updated version from master.
Run through the process_tomography notebook in qiskit-tutorials/qiskit/ignis
The code block should run and give the fit fidelity.
Not too sure. I checked through qiskit.quantum_info.state.measures.state_fidelity() in both stable and master and could not find a difference that I thought would cause this issue. I also don't think it would be an issue within the scipy library as I tested the notebook in both Qiskit 0.8 and Qiskit 0.9 and in 0.8 it ran, but I had the same version of scipy during both runs.
@gadial any idea? Can you reproduce on mac?
This is just because the tutorials need to be updated...they will be when I merge Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#589
Generally it's not expected that the tutorials work with the master branch, but with the pip version. However, since we are releasing a new version this week the tutorials will be updated.
Should be fixed now.
