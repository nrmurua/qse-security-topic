The tests test-[0-6].cpp give no indication what the tests are testing. Rename these tests to something more descriptive.
One possibility: names like issue_89.cpp while not descriptive in their own right would at least provide a cross reference to the GitHub issue.
I want to work on this, please assign it to me. Certain test file point to same issue.
