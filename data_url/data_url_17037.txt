The concurrence doesn't always give the correct result.
The issue is with the diagonalization of the matrix A. eigh is used, but the matrix A is not always Hermitian.
Change
with
w = np.sort(np.real(la.eigvals(A))
The eigenvalues should be real and positive in general, but they are returned as complex numbers, and need to be sorted by ascending value.
