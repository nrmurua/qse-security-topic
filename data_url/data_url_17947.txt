Giving the following situation:
The type of the last is qiskit.extensions.standard.iden.IdGate (see circuit.data[0].__class__) while the content in the definitions collection where id is defined is an AST node qiskit.qasm._node._gatebody.GateBody (see circuit.definitions['id']['body'].__class__).
I find this inconsistent.
What do you think it should be the expected behaviour?
I think the elements in definitions should be instances of objects in qiskit.extensions.standard.
If #2014 gets merged., this can be closed.
