I can confirm I don't see the issue if I use a pass manager with just Collect2qBlocks and ConsolidateBlocks, but running with the optimization_level=3 pass manager, and printing the dag between passes, I think this is a ConsolidateBlocks issue:
I'm not sure why we don't see it when we just run the two relevant passes.
