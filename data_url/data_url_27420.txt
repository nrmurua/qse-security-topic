In the interest of having old code in somewhat working order before it becomes defunct, I would like to wrap up a few issues in the NMRParameter. This will be a rolling list as I encounter things.
Trying to make a list of problems I'm finding with the old NMRParameter (which uses the analyse_flips_oldanalysis function)
On the topic of removal of this old code, we should think carefully about how this might affect re-analysis of old data.
From raw traces any analysis should, in theory, be fine with either the new or old analysis code, the main difference is being able to reproduce the analysed datasets.
What about just getting rid of it altogether, is anyone still using it?
I was using it temporarily, because I was having issues with the NMRCompositeParameter at the time.
I guess there should be another issue/PR where we consolidate the new version into the NMRParameter at some point.
I'll leave this here until a decision is made about this + while the bug still exists.
Sorry for the late reply, basically there was a severe issue with the Picoscope's acqusition memory which limited the number of electron shots per read and the number of samples in a single NMR acquisition.
This problem was compounded with the fact that with the NMRCompositeParameter the analysis hasn't been written yet to determine flips from a single up-proportion. Because of the limited acquisition memory and the readout fidelity, it was easier for me to look at only 1 ESR line with more shots per read than 2 ESR lines, hence I had to use the old NMRParameter.
I'm working on the picoscope driver to hopefully get streaming mode working properly, but single up-proportion flips still needs to be implemented. I'll raise a separate issue for this work, and once that is completed I believe we can remove the old NMRParameter code.
