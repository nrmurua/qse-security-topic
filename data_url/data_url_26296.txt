QuantumCell's call method has following implementation
Hamiltonian calculation is apparently missing the constant of -i (or the documentation in the line above is incorrect).
Can you please confirm?
Thanks for the comment. The imaginary unit (-i) is already included in the definition of self.delta_t in the constructor of the class. Instead of having to undertake multiplications -1j * H * delta t, every time (this is one of the most called functions in the while code), we just have two multiplications H*delta t, where delta t is redefined once at the beginning before any calculations to include the imaginary number
Completely missed that. Many thanks.
