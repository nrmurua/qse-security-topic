The transpiler can expand certain (trivial) gate identities, while it fails for others.
For example: rz -> (rx, ry) works while rx -> (ry, rz) does not work.
Since these are symmetric problems, I would consider this behavior a bug.
The following code can reproduce the observation.
Isomorphic problems should lead to analogous results. Instead of a TranspilerError, the second experiment should yield the corresponding gate identity like for the first experiment (or at least a warning that a reformulation is advised).
