When running VQD with primitives, the program fails to validate parameter values when calculating fidelities for k > 2. The ground and first excited states are found successfully, but when the algorithm gets to the second excited state, the sampler used for the fidelity fails to validate the parameters when VQD passes the parameters to  the run() method of ComputeUncompute. This seems to have slipped past unit tests because those for VQD only test for k=1 and k=2.
The following code reproduces the issue:
This produces the following traceback:
Algorithm completes successfully.
I am still looking into why this occurs, but my guess is that because the fidelity for the first excited state is computed successfully, there might be some error in the arguments that VQD passes to the run() method of ComputeUncompute on line 357 of vqd.py that is only problematic when len(prev_circs) > 1.
