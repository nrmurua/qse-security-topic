liboqs build failed on Objects of target "oqs" referenced but is not an OBJECT library. I am using the Dockerfile of Python Buster
I am trying to install all the debs through https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/blob/main/scripts/fullbuild.sh
It seems that Python Buster using older CMake https://discourse.cmake.org/t/objects-of-target-x-referenced-but-is-not-an-object-library/3857
Is there a way to fix this issue?

You're welcome to provide a PR to liboqs that would permit using an older cmake version, but the core OQS team doesn't have the bandwidth to support all possible platform combinations. You do touch on a code line in liboqs though that I think warrants updating. This also already led to excess/unwarranted work in the liboqs CI environment: That PR may be instructive as to how to solve/work around this issue @vkosuri : Just upgrade cmake.

Thanks for the workaround, The cmake Docker build process very slow almost 10M, I found through search another workaround using pip which very quicker.
Can I make PR here https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/ci-containers/tree/main?

Thank you very much for teaching an old dog a new trick, @vkosuri ! I'd never have thought to use python to install cmake... Yes, PR's to improve our project(s) are always welcome.

Thanks, Will make PR by EOD.
@vkosuri Are you still interested / able to make the PR to resolve this issue?

The workflow pipeline is failing due to unable to do docker login https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/open-quantum-safe/ci-containers/124/workflows/45ec5c46-e4b3-42e7-bd8b-15dfc8d920e5/jobs/794
can anyone help here?
Resolved by using correct cmake (fast install in open-quantum-safe/ci-containers#70)
