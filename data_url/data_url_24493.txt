The addPPT_dataset function creates a new qtplot which is added to the .plots list and hence not garbage collected. Therefore up to 100 plots are kept in memory
@dpfranke I see the issue. The addPPT_dataset  function has an argument customfig that you can use to pass a QtPlot object. You can then reuse a single QtPlot object, or pass a new one and delete afterwards (something like qtplot.win.close() and then del qtplot).
Other options are: reduce the size of the list in qcodes.QtPlot (there is a config option for that), add an extra argument to addPPT_dataset to close the newly created plot after it has been sent to PPT or throw away the elements in QtPlot.plots manually.
Will one of these work for you?
