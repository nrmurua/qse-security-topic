I did the exact installation steps and I got this error when I tried to verify that it is working:
python -c 'import cirq; print(cirq.google.Foxtail)'
output
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
ImportError: No module named cirq
could you please help?
Do you have a log of the command line output during the installation?
My best guess is that you installed it in a different python environment than the one you are running (e.g. installing with pip3 then trying to run with python2).
I found out that I should activate "env" first in every time I use criq otherwise it won't work,
Activation: by going to the working directory then type " source env/bin/activate"
Thank you @Strilanc
@marsscout22 Glad you go it figured out. If you don't have anymore problems with this, may  you please close this issue?
I'll close it.
