See #162.  I believe that the error occurred when the user interrupted fetch_cache while it was writing out to disk.  This can be addressed by atomic file operations -- by saving to a temporary file, and then copying that file once the contents have been written out.  This should be done for both the LRU index and the individual cache files.
Solved in #187
