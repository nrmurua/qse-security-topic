I am not an expert in quantum computation.
I am trying to convert Shor's example by changing the MainEngine with the following:
eng = MainEngine(IBMBackend(use_hardware=False, num_runs=1, device='simulator'), setup=projectq.setups.ibm) 
I got the following error:
Hi,
The error you received is due to the fact that the compiler setup loaded by projectq.setups.ibm does not contain the decompositions rules for all of the math functions defined in projectq.libs.math. But Shor's algorithm requires these math functions such as CMultiplyByConstantModN mentioned in the error message.
The reason for currently not supporting the math functions in the compiler setup for IBM (projectq.setups.ibm) is that these math functions require far too many gates and hence it would anyway not be possible to run such an algorithm on the current IBM device. While the IBM simulator backend might be able to handle Shor's algorithm for small input, we currently don't provide a default compiler setup only for that simulator because it is faster and easier to use the local ProjectQ Simulator for that purpose.
Let me know if you have further questions.
