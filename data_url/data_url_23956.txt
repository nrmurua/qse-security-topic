The latest Travis build is failing because the q1q2 channel is shorter than the q1 and q2 channels.  This is because q1 and q2's physical channels are initialized to 1.2Gs/s.  However q1q2 is not setup  and so defaults to 1GS/s. A possible solution is to just leave q1 and q2 at 1GS/s.
@blakejohnson I imagine this works locally for you because you have a q1q2 channel in your ChannelLibrary with a 1.2GS/s sampling rate.
Fixed in 17e36c9.
