I am trying to understand the inner working of SimulaQron to create a plugin and I can't quite grasp how the qubit operation messages are mapped into backend engine operations.
From the cqc.py file, I understand that the single qubit operations are packed using the sendCommand function, and is forwarded to the cqc server. How will this invoke the apply_onequbit_gate function; which ultimately carries out the operation for the projectQ backend? Specifically, where in this codebase is the sendCommand message received and processed so that apply_onequbit_gate (from say, apply_X function) is called?
Thanks.
Hi @rasa97 !
The (cqc) message is firstly handled by dataReceived which calls _parseData and in turn handle_cqc_message. If the message is of type CQC_TP_COMMAND the corresponding (handle_command) message_handler will be called and in turn _process_command. Depending on which command is specified the corresponding commandHandler will be called, in this case cmd_x.
I hope this helps, let me know if it's still not clear.
Thank you for the explanation @AckslD! It would be wonderful if this is elaborated in the docs. Surely new contributors would find it helpful.
