It would be nice to have an example taking Mitiq and applying it to a result in the research literature where zero-noise extrapolation, ZNE, is applied. It could also highlight differences between the unitary folding approach and what is there in the literature.
This could be an example for the documentation, or a notebook (how to integrate notebooks in the repository  is something being discussed).
The Kandala et al. paper, with a simulation or real hardware, could be an idea.
I think it is more feasible to bump this to the next milestone, as I am pretty full next week and haven't started yet.
Just added notebook to mitiq-internal which reproduces Fig. 2(a) of the Kandala paper. As such I will close this issue.
The real issue now should be to decide on / create an infrastructure for hosting such examples, as mitiq-internal is UF exclusive. I think notebooks are by far the preferred format, especially for community contributions, so we should think of how to do best do this.
Fixed via https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq-internal/pull/15.
Just wanted to mention that @elmandouh volunteered to look into this. Maybe he could add some features, such as running the experiment multiple times to obtain error bars?
I think that's a great idea @nathanshammah.
We'll have to figure out something for access. cf. #450.
I took a stab at reproducing fig 2(a) here. Next I will try to implement @nathanshammah's suggestion.
Edit: I wasn't aware that I can get access to the IBMQ backend that easily (never attempted). So I think it will be more appropriate to make a new one using Qiskit and the IBMQ backend.
