Make sure Aer's CONTRIBUTING file stands on its own, so Aer's install doc can be removed.
We want to synthesize install instructions for all Qiskit packages into a global Install Qiskit doc section, where the global install doc refers Qiskit contributors to each package's CONTRIBUTING file for details on how to install from source.
Currently, Aer's doc includes 'Install from Source' instructions here. This was an initial (incomplete) attempt to hone the current instructions in Aer's CONTRIBUTING file.
Aer's CONTRIBUTING file should be updated to stand on its own.
After Aer's CONTRIBUTING  file is updated, the Installing Aer section of the doc will be removed.
I think this is fixed in #119
