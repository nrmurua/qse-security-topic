I don't particularly like "Cycle" because it makes it sounds like the operations themselves are being repeated. What about "Tick"?
Cycle seemed to be the thing people liked at the meeting. Maybe we should make a big 'ol bikeshedding email thread. ;)
Cycle is also overloaded from graph theory and group theory.
After discussing this with Dave, I feel that Moment works better than Cycle. We'll leave it as is for now, and see if external partners are bothered by the name.
