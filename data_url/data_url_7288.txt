I think it would be useful to include a direct steady-state solver which computes the solution of the system A x = 0 in an exact way, just like QuTip steady-state method.
For instance, using Pardiso.jl, the steady-state can be found as
which is just slightly slower than the iterative method but requires fewer allocations and is more exact.
Here you can find a working example for the steady-state of a "pumped cavity": https://gist.github.com/labay11/66934e15e648d06d8511fc557c259e59

probably you can pass a function as an iterative method even if that solver is not iterative
