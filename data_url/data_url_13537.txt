Currently, there isn't a clear way for the community to propose substantial new features to Mitiq. They could file a generic issue and discuss, or use the request feature template which has the implication that the dev team will implement it.
As discussed in Engineering meeting and Mitiq community call, we can add a new issue template called something like "Feature proposal" or "Feature Design Proposal" and use a template there to help form complete and reviewable proposals.
It was also discussed that linking to a Google doc may also work, as that has the benefit of a better commenting system.
The downside to this is that there is a potential to lose the data and that sharing permissions need to be managed by the submitter, as opposed to the Mitiq team.
An example of a fully public language design process can be found in the  Q# language design repo where they use a similar issue template system.
