Some nice features to have for qsim might be:
In particular, item (2) is high priority for the qsim-Cirq interface as well. Given that it's a requirement for both TFQ and Cirq, the implementation should live in the C++ code.
Cirq doesn't have the ability to sample from a state, does it? I have some code for sampling. I'll add it.
Cirq does have code for sampling from a state, but for usability I think it makes sense for qsim to provide this behavior directly. Thanks for looking into it.

@sergeisakov, do you have an update on this? I'm starting to hit this requirement on non-TFQ integration work.
If you want you can copy the sampling code in TFQ to keep things moving and then improve it when a faster implementation comes along

Just a thought :)
The features discussed here are now available in core qsim. #65 tracks adding explicit sampling support in qsimcirq.
