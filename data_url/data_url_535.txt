Some of IBM backends have switched to the new gate set: ibmq_5_yorktown, ibmq_16_melbourne, etc.
Premium backends (e.g. ibmq_manhattan) seem to stay on the old u3-based gate set for the time being.
As discussed, we probably need to have some bigger architectural updates to support the accelerator's native gate set efficiently.
For documentation purposes, this is my local workaround to handle mixed gate sets at the moment: 1tnguyen@519656d
We also need to audit IBM-related plugins, e.g. IBM noise model (native impl.), to make changes if necessary.
