does not change the circuit at all.
The reason is that the "ConsolidateBlock" pass has some logic around ignoring blocks of length 1. I'm not sure why that's there. If I simply add an H gate to qubit 0, then the block size becomes 2 and the pass does indeed consolidate that into a Unitary, and the rest of the basis translation works as expected.
Closing as this is a duplicate of #5967 and #5203, it is being fixed by #6024
