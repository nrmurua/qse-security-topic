qiskit-terra version: 0.17.3
While digging through the qiskit/circuit code I found multiple smaller issues, none of them classifiable as a proper bug:
Can I work on this?
@ishworii Sure! Thank you.
Thanks for looking in to these @TimAlexisKoerner ! A couple questions to clarify:
qiskit-terra version: 0.17.3
While digging through the qiskit/circuit code I found multiple smaller issues, none of them classifiable as a proper bug:
This is intentional as we are deprecating the .register attribute on Bit instances, but you're correct that it does leave us in an awkward position during the deprecation period where some Bit instances will have a .register and others won't.
The QiskitError on L163 should be QiskitIndexError, or something else?
I'm not sure what's meant here. Can you provide an example?
I believe this is intentional, in that labels are generally set on individual Gates and not carried when that Gate is modified or repeated. To be consistent with Gate.control though, it might be good to add a label kwarg to Instruction.repeat. (N.B. That setting labels on Instructions is currently being added in #6626 .)
I believe this can be raised from either from Delay.__init__ or Delay.validate_parameters, but you're right that it's unusual that we document these here.
Thanks again, these will all be great improvements!
@kdk thank you for the clarifications!
Here is 0.17/qiskit/circuit/instruction.py#L295
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/fa05da3fd8bd5ae95fc8dad08139edfa85378f93/qiskit/circuit/instruction.py#L295
There is no comma. Same with the rest of the lines. In any case, probably is because of black.
If I understand this one correctly, #6639 should fix it.
This has been stagnant for a while now.  I believe that the actual issues are either fixed or duplicates of other open issues, and the points about the coding style are entirely handled by black.  If that's not the case, please feel free to open a new issue (for bugs that's preferably one issue per bug, with code to reproduce the error).
