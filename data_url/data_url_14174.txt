If documentation is built at PR-time to make sure that changes do not break it. When an exception is triggered, the PR is blocked. However, when the exception comes from Jupyter notebook itself, CI is not detecting it. Take #10677 as an example where the _repr_jpg_ call raised.
While I understand these situations are rare, it would be great if CI could account for them as they also affect the documentation output (following the previous example: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stable/0.44/tutorials/circuits_advanced/04_transpiler_passes_and_passmanager.html  )
To be clear, the problem here is when an exception is triggered by an implicit IPython call during a cell output's rich-display resolution, which appear not to be propagated up to our actual execution context, but are silently displayed inline.
