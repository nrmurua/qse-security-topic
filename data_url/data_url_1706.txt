Description of the issue
Hi, I'm an undergraduate student currently using Cirq in a quantum computing class. I was poking around in the docs, and on the cirq.ops.CCNOT documentation page, the link "Quantum chess" (under Used in the notebooks > Used in the tutorials) leads to a 404. Not sure if the notebook/page got moved, or if it's just a dead reference.
This is also replicable on other pages that link to the Quantum chess docs, like the cirq.ops.CNOT page.
More than happy to try to resolve this issue since it's a quick docs fix, just want to make sure I'm not making a mistake or anything!
How to reproduce the issue
Go to the cirq.ops.CCNOT documentation page and click "Quantum chess".
Cirq version
N/A
Thanks for opening @mattxwang - this is indeed an issue - we are aware of it and working at fixing it - the automation  behind the "Used in notebooks" section is going wrong somewhere.
This is now fixed. Thank you for your patience!
