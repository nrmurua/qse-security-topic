Most of the time when I search on Google for qutip [something] first hits are on the old documentation:
http://qutip.googlecode.com/svn/doc/2.0.0/html/index.html#
This is misleading, since it is:
How about adding a header "Check the new site (Version 2.2.) - http://qutip.org/" or something like that (too make newcomers less confused)?
We could put a disclaimer in the html of old versions (building the docs is a pain).
The latest documentation can now be found on http://qutip.org/docs/latest so this partly takes care of this old problem on googlecode.
@ajgpitch mentioned we could even ask google to ignore old versions in results.
So, I did a lot of digging around trying to add the banner for all the older documentation to point towards the latest. But it was a pain to modify and add manually a message on each page to point towards the latest docs. However, for future releases, we could use the cannonical_url option of sphinx_rtd_theme which makes search engines index the latest links to the documentations
https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/canonical.html
Coming soon! I did more digging and modified the sphinx_rtd_theme to add this warning message.

@ajgpitch At this moment, do we rebuild the old docs or add this message manually to them?
Also, for the future docs, how are we going to make sure that everytime we make a new release, the old documentation gets this warning message? Maybe we make some release-documentation notes similar to the release notes, and add this as one of the steps.
When you build new documentation, you also have to rebuild the older version and change the conf.py file to include the warning message.  I poked around a bit and could change the sphinx_rtd_theme so that we can have something like
and the documentation inserts this message based on this value.
@quantshah Great work, this seems like exactly what we need.
We already have a section in the release-distribution document about building the docs, so we can add a bit about rebuilding the previous version docs with is_latest = False and uploading.
I don't think that it is feasible to rebuild all the old docs. Would be a lot of work, as we would have to recreate working envs for the versions. Would seem more feasible to edit the HTML - I guess we could script this, as each guide file would need to be fixed. We could also consider just removing some of the older versions.
When I search for, e.g., qutip sesolve, I get the latest docs now.
