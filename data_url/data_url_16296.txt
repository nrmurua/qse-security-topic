(missing definition equation)

I just came across these by chance. Is there a linter or warnings from the doc build we can look at to find issues like these automatically?
Hi @kdk
I'm happy to look into this. Should be an easy fix if I can get some local format validation working.
And I'll see what I can find R.E. docstring linter or warning.
I believe I've fixed the formatting issues. However, I haven't been able to find a linter that is able to detect these small syntax issues in docstrings. If you have any suggestions please let me know.

Awesome, feel free to open a PR. Automated detection can be left for another issue :) .
