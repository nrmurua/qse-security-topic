MonInj seems to break when we have more than 64 TTL channels to monitor, see https://forum.m-labs.hk/d/207-moninj-failure-and-disabled-outputs .
All TTL channels work fine with MonInj, both for Kasli and KC705.
Both for Kasli and KC705, the error shown below occurs when starting the dashboard which initiates the MonInj connection. TTL outputs of the device become unreliable, rendering the coredevice useless. When MonInj is not started (i.e. using artiq_run), the gateware runs fine. I would expect this is some addressing limitation somewhere, causing a 6 bit address to overflow, but I am not familiar enough with the firmware/gateware to point out the exact lines.
@SidaChen1999 Is there anything in the core device log (Kasli UART) when the problem occurs?
Sometimes it will show an error ERROR(runtime::moninj): moninj aborted: unexpected end of stream as he suggested. But not always.
