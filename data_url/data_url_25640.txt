When the number of electrons in a workflow scales to double digits, a significant degradation in the runtime is noticed when the workflow is dispatched to the Covalent server.
The performance degradation can be noticed when the number of electrons in a workflow begins to exceed 50.
The runtime performance of dispatched workflows should remain stable with increasing number of electrons.
