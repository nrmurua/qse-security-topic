Description of the issue
repr(measurement_gate) prints the wrong repr when using a nested measurement key of the form a:b:c. This is not catched in the json serialization tests because we explicitly call MeasurementKey.parse_serialized(key) in the _from_json_dict_ function of MeasurementGate class.
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
0.12.0.dev
eval(repr(measurement_key)) is also broken.
