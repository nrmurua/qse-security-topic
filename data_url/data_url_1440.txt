Describe your design idea/issue
There's a dependency between ActOnStabilizerChFormArgs, StabilizerStateChForm, and CliffordState, and they all kind of do similar things differently. Note this isn't an import cycle, just an odd mesh of runtime dependencies.
Currently:
Better to have a unidirectional thing:
To make ChForm self-contained, we should move all the _x() etc methods from ActOn to ChForm, and call them apply_x() etc. Then everywhere ChForm currently uses ActOn, we can have it call the appropriate apply method instead.
While we do this, we should do the same for CliffordTableau and ActOnCliffordTableauArgs too and make a base class StabilizerRepresentation that contains all the abstract apply_ method declarations.
Once this is done, the rest should fall into place pretty naturally.
