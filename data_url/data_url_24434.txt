Allow Ansys/pyEPR to handle arbitrary junction angles besides at increments of 90 deg
Users may want non-right angle junctions
Spoke with @dwang429
Priti: Presently, AnsysRenderer has hard coded the angles of Josephson Junctions (JJ) to be at 90 degree intervals. I could change it, but, am guessing there are downstream affects now, for not just pyEPR simulations. The angle of for JJ may be also effect hfss-eignmode and hfss-eigenvalue simulations.
Dennis: I hard coded it that way at the time because one of the notebooks or .py files in pyEPR (I forget which) explicitly classified junctions as rectangles, and rectangles as defined in Ansys must be positioned at 90 deg increments. Objects of type ‘rectangle’ and those of type ‘closed polyline’ have different methods associated with them (for example, renaming). In summary: JJ’s can be converted to closed polylines (see how in render_element_poly() within ansys_renderer.py) but you must be careful that renaming and other properties remain intact.
Update:  make_rlc_boundary() within ansys.py (in pyEPR) takes in an axis argument that, as currently written, can only be ‘x’ or ‘y’, regardless of whether you’re making the junction a rectangle or closed poly. So that function also needs to be rewritten with something other than ‘axis’.
@ThomasGM4 Do we still need this issue to be addressed? Or be closed?
Hmmm, practically speaking, junctions are at consistent orthogonal angles to each other (as the shadow evaporation won't work otherwise).
We could close this unless we start getting requests for this again.
