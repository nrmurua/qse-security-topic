Right now, all the examples in the documentation are hard-coded such that the output of a function is manually inserted.
For example, the to-be calculated values of channel_fidelity are already in the docstring.

We want to instead move toward calculating these whenever the documentation is built. Might need a new Github Actions workflow.

That's a great suggestion. Would be good to make sure that the examples in the docstring actually work and stay up-to-date.
