Set to true for all algorithms. Is this really correct? Maybe need to document what this really means. Possibly drop it if it simply means we've run test_constant_time (which we do weekly). Maybe change to false for algorithms which we had to exempt from weekly testing.
The intention is that captures algorithms for which test_constant_time passes.  I know there are some we exempt from weekly testing, but we still test these before a release, so they can still be included.
Thanks for the explanation. Then it's correct. Just re-ran successfully over all algs (now also incl. both new s/ntrup1277).
