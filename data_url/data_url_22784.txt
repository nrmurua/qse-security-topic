How do I install flterm? The following instructions don't work.

You can compile flterm by typing the following from the MiSoC top of tree:
make -C tools
Then to run flterm you can do ./tools/flterm
You can add the tools directory to your PATH variable if you want to avoid typing the path each time
Works!
I'll ask SB to add an absolute path to flterm to the instructions.
