In check_auto_merge_labeler we only pull the first page of events. For longer PRs this makes it seem that Github is inconsistent - https://api.github.com/repos/quantumlib/cirq/issues/3227/events doesn't contain any of the events for labelling with automerge - but CirqBot expects it - maybe we can improve the error message here.
We need to implement paging logic.
