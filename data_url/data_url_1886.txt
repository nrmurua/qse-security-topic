Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
we are in the process of transitioning from readthedocs.io to the TF DevSite documentation. We have constants like GRID_ALIGNED_PATTERN that we document using our own mapping that we use during the sphinx site generation. These are public constants that are helpful to document for discoverability. Now, with the transitioning we lose the docs on these constants.
Describe the solution you'd like
It would be great to have support for adding docstrings to global constants that are literals - e.g. list, tuple, dict, numpy.ndarray on devsite as well.
Additional context
This feature requires changes on the devsite infra. The internal tracking issue for it is b/166663013.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
This is now supported!
