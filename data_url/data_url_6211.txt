Enabling the measurement optimization for the extended_stabilizer method doesn't change the execution time.
optimized_time should be significantly smaller than the unoptimized time. However, currently, both options perform roughly the same.
The bug seems to be introduced in line 290 of the src/simulators/qasm/qasm_controller.hpp
and indeed, passing disable_measurement_opt in backend_options gives the expected behaviour. So either this line or the documentation needs to be updated to make the option name consistent.
Good catch @padraic-padraic. One question: is this measurement opt here different or equivalent to the sampling measurement opt used by the other simulation methods? If it's equivalent we should just have a single option "disable_measure_sampling" that can be set to True to disable sampling on all the qasm simulator methods.
It does function the same way i.e. it forces each shot to be resampled, and thus reruns the monte carlo method.
However, as I think came up in #98, disabling this option is required to get good results if simulating circuits that have some 0 probability amplitudes, so it's probably best that the optimizaiton is disabled by default for extended_stabilizer. This makes it slightly different from the other methods, where the optimization can be pretty sensibly turned on by default.
Lets just have one option for now then "extended_stabilizer_measure_sampling" with default of False so that to enable you have to do backend_options={"extended_stabilizer_measure_sampling": True}.
