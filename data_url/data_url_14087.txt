The qiskit-ibm-provider package is currently planned to be deprecated and removed at some point, with all its functionality moving to qiskit-ibm-runtime.  When that happens, we should track through any extant deprecation warnings (especially in the 0.46 release) and make sure they suggest qiskit-ibm-runtime, not qiskit-ibm-provider, as alternatives / a potential provider when needed.
At the time of writing this issue, the only uses are in qiskit/__init__.py, but there may be more added during the 0.46 cycle.
When removing, we should search for references to qiskit-ibm-provider (the normal way the PyPI package is spelt) and qiskit_ibm_provider (how it's imported) to check for use in any code blocks.
See Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime#1285 for more detail.
