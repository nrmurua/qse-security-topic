Currently, the method to add a new gate to a quantum circuit is the following:
There is no way to add a gate directly. For instance:
which leads to
Can we add a check to see if the input to add_gate is a Gate object and unpack it to add a new gate ? Or, have some kind of a sanity check if the given input is in a correct gate input format. (name, targets, controls).
Sounds like a good idea to me.
You mean check if the first arg is a Gate, if so then no need to create one, just add it to the circuit
Well, deepcopy is one option but since the add_gate function asks for a limited set of input arguments, a naive way to do this is to check if supplied gate is an instance of Gate class and unpack the parameters. Minimal change in the existing code can be something like:
@ajgpitch What do you think of this approach ? If this seems fine then I will open a PR.
The change will be made here : https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/qutip/qip/circuit.py#L175
