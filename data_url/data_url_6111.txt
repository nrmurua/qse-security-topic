Running the T1 example from pulse sim breaks with the error:
I was able to get it to run successfully with python setup.py install --with-openpulse but I am unclear if this actually resolves the issue as it is difficult to bypass all the skbuild framework.
Note that this example was the only one I had when building the simulator, so I can guarantee that this used to work as expected.
Looks to be related to this: gammapy/gammapy#2453
I can confirm that, with the removal of all mpl calls, that it is related to this: matplotlib/matplotlib#15410
@nonhermitian Can we close this issue if it's not specifically related to pulse simulator?
Yeah, sure.  It is a generic bug that will affect anyone on OSX till march
