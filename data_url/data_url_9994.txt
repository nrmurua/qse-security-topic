Modeled after Python's slice, we could make picking top/bottom/middle n samples easier.
SampleSet.truncate(n) could be expressed as SampleSet.slice(n).
Top n samples by energy would be SampleSet.slice(-n, None).
Reversing the sample set, according to a custom weirdness vector would be expressed with: SampleSet.slice(None, None, -1, sorted_by='weirdness').
