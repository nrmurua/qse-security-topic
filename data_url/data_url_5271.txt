Hope HiQ GUI could support Jupyter (or something like an interactive terminal), so many people love it ðŸ˜ƒ!
Jupyter-Github
(It's just a problem about GUI instead of the Simulator itself, but I still address it here )
Another problem with HiQ online platform is that the result may be missed due to an unstable network if the code requires a long time of running for a big project.
Usually, I will leave the task running after deployed a computation task on HiQ. However, sometimes, I can't receive the result (printout) since the web session is timed out or disconnected due to an unstable network. It really limits the usability of the HiQ cloud service.
Maybe a result saved in some text files is a better solution for user experience.
Best Regards
