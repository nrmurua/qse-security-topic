Executing the below circuit using the mock Guadalupe backend gives different results for the exp val returned by the instruction and doing so directly from counts.
The instruction says the expval is 0.10888671875 where as doing the same calculation from the counts (using the Ignis expectation_value function) gives 0.060302734375.
I would expect these to be the same if I am interpreting the usage correctly.
If you measure qubits, then compute an expectation value you are computing the expectation value of the collapsed state. You need to put the save instruction before measurement.
The expectation value will also not include effects of any readout errors in noise model. Only gate errors in the gates before the save instruction. Since readout error the error is also only applied to classical bits in the case of the above example if you have a readout error so a '0' is recorded as '1' for example, the quantum state is still collapsed to 0, which is what will be used for the save expval instruction after the measurement.
Ahh so I cannot use this as a way to do exp vals from an ensemble of shots data.  Ok got it.
