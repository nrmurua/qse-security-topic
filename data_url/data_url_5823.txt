The time to compute a kernel matrix is orders of magnitude larger with sample-based simulation than with full statevector simulation. In light of #1229, I also compared with BasicAer, though this appears to be a different issue since BasicAer is slower than AerSimulator(method="statevector").
It is possible that this is desired / expected behavior due to the overhead of sampling; in that case, any suggestions on how to compute large kernel matrices with sampling noise would be appreciated.
Output:
Changing to a higher qubit count and fewer circuits (n=16; m=10;) gives a smaller, but still significant gap:
The cost of sample-based simulation should be comparable to the cost of simulation with full statevector, as the same simulation method is used internally.
N/A
The slowdown is not due to simulator being slower, but due to the fact that QuantumKernel has to run only m circuits in statevector case, but m**2 circuits for automatic.
