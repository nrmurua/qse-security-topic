Description of the issue
When using line qubits and crossing gates in a single moment; the output on printing the moment is confusing and does not show the overlap correctly, unlike the output obtained on printing the whole circuit.
How to reproduce the issue
Another Example:
Cirq version
0.11.0.dev
Agreed, this is a case that was not covered seemingly in #3403
@tanujkhattar Is this still relevant ?
@MichaelBroughton This issue is still relevant as of Cirq 1.1.0.  I recently discovered this confusing print output while debugging.
The behavior is similar but transposed if you use NamedQubit.
