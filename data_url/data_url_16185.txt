Currently, Aqua's (now Terra's) algorithm section only supports a couple of quantum machine learning algorithms, including QGANs, QSVMs, QNNs, and more. It would be super cool if we could add some more algorithms like (but not limited to) the ones mentioned in the title.
I plan to work on these, so in case someone is already working on building any of these into Terra, please let me know!
Closing this since I created it before I knew only the core algorithms were to be moved to Terra.
