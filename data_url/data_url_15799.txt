Now we have snapshot testing for other graphs besides circuits (thanks to #6672), it should be extended with other graphing functions, like plot_coupling_map and plot_gate_map (introduced in #6751).
Can I work on this one?
Sure, I'll assign it to you so others know you're working on it. Feel free to ask questions if you need help!

Thanks. I'm very new to contributing. It would be better if you could give me some pointers.
It depends a little on what you need to know.  If it's git basics, then GitHub have some good guides on all levels of it (https://guides.github.com/).  What they call the "GitHub Flow" is the same way you should make a pull request here.
If it's about Qiskit contributing specifically, we have a Qiskit contributing guide in the documentation.  That's quite long and detailed, so don't worry if you miss something or forget it - we'll spot it when we do the code review (nothing to worry about) when you make the pull request.
If it's about the problem, you'd need to ask a more specific question.  There's quite a lot of context in the two issues that Luciano linked up at the top, to get you started.

Cool, got it!
Hi @Quant02 there are also some specific guidelines on snapshot testing in the terra CONTRIBUTING.md file that will be useful for this issue specifically: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#snapshot-testing-for-visualizations

Thanks! This is being really useful.
I have committed some changes. Snapshot testing, using binder, is successful for plot_coupling_map(), but there is some issue with plot_gate_map(). I'm assuming that it is because of the fact that plot_gate_map() requires a real backend. A review of the changes and suggestions to get over this problem can be really helpful.
