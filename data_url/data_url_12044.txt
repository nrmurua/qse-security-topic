Tutorials for  Circuits - Summary of Quantum Operations -  chapter: Basis vector ordering in Qiskit - https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/3_summary_of_quantum_operations.html
I think qiskit uses little endian bits and qubits ordering with LSB coming first. But documentation mentioned above claims that qiskit uses big endian with MSB coming first. As and example this documentation describes the case of two qubits |10> where 0 is state of first qubit and 1 the state of second qubit (so it is from right to left and it looks like little endian).
Maybe I am missing something, Please correct me if I am wrong (I am learning this stuff).
If my thinking is right, I have proposed pull request #1051.
