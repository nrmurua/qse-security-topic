I am going to guess we will use a bunch of try/catch blocks in init to download a precompiled wheel for the proper OS
Working with hyphen to get a general Haskell wrapper. Seeing if they want to add it to pip, but planning for if not.
The hyphen team is open to it, unfortunately python at the time did not alow it.
I think I'll start by trying to get this to run without that package in pip to see if it's possible.
I just want to wrap it and as time goes on lower the dependency on the haskell.
