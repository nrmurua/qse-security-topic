Currently, PAULI_CHANNEL_2 is 10x slower than DEPOLARIZE2.
An idea to try is, if the operation is applied to enough targets, create an alias sampling table for the probability distribution over the non-identity part of the channel. Then use rare-error sampling to decide which qubits to apply the alias sampling to.
Not high priority enough to keep.
