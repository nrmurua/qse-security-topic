The plus sign in front of the imaginary part of a complex number disappears in the latex_source output of a parameter.
The call to pi_check returns this
The equation output from latex_source is
Note the missing plus in the second U1.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but angles can't be complex, right? And I don't think the draw function should check for correct circuits. Maybe some check on the gate?
Edit: Well, anyway, the bug is not related to that gate, so may affect others. It's when in QCircuitImage.latex() calls _truncate_float() in the following line:
It's line 180 for version 0.19 of qiskit.
Thanks. You're right. I was just using U1's to test pi_check values and got a bit carried away. I thought it was probably in the regex you showed above.
The original example cannot be reproduced because we improved the parameter validation. In which setting complex numbers are printed?
If the Latex drawer displayed params on initialize (which it probably should since the other 2 drawers do), that would be a place where complex numbers might be displayed. The regex above grabs the + and in the call to _truncate_float it gets cast to a float, so the + gets lost.
initialize! Thanks! Renaming to get more specific...

Hi, I've been reviewing
the code and I would like to give it a try.
This is the progress that I made so far:

In qiskit.visualization.latex.QCircuitImage._build_latex_array()
there is no special section for the initialize instruction to show its parameters, but there are for the other gates.
hey @smiling-monkeys, the progress so far looks great! any updates on this? i'd love to help out if there's anything i can do!
Hey @Ahasan20, how are you? I was waiting for the response of any of the members in order to continue with the fixing without stepping on somebody's toes, if you want we can try to solve it together, is it ok @1ucian0?
