I want to define a gate like
Although _TurnGate is documented as "A gate with exactly two eigenvalues", I think it actually works for Gates that have this property within a two-dimensional subspace and act as the identity on the orthogonal space. So it's allowed to have a third eigenvalue which is always fixed. The only method of _TurnGate I don't completely understand is trace_distance_bound but I'm pretty sure that's not a problem.
