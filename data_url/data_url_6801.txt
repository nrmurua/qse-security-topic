The possibility of having time-changing gates (I mean gates like the X^t) is very useful.
However, sometimes the varying is too fast to appreciate some features.
Would it be possible to add an option to change the rate at which the gates change?
Ps: great tool!
What exactly did you have in mind in terms of the rate?
It's actually very easy to change... in code. There's a single global config value that determines the cycle time of all gates. What's hard is picking a good rate. Right now I have it in a middle ground where sometimes I feel it's too slow and sometimes I feel it's too fast. Probably a lot of gates would benefit from increasing the cycle time as they got larger, but otherwise it's pretty decent.
Generally I prefer to avoid adding options like this to the UI, because it will quickly become overburdened. The toolboxes are already very daunting to new users, without adding a bunch of sliders on top of that. And there's the question of whether to associate the setting with the circuit or with the session, which I think will be confusing to people.
I think the ideal rate really depends on the case, so what I was talking about was a way to change it from case to case.
I understand what you mean in that you want to avoid complicating the UI. What about adding it as gate-dependent option, to be changed via right clicking on the gate? Or if just a global option, as something to be changed via an option in the menu?
Otherwise, can I change it easily via the console in the chrome development tools (or equivalent)?
Yes, you can change it via the console. If you type in
(including the $ sign) then the cycle time will be set to 20s instead of 8s.
probably, it would be a good solution to hide all config options from UI and to give an access to it using only one button + modal popup. Or tabs.
I agree that UI can be overloaded. In my opinion, this is the case for the app now. Some rare buttons can be hidden with popups or tabs.
