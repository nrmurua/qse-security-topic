Why do we have a fail on macOS not caught by Travis?
@smashra Can you take a look?
More generally, I think that from my tests when I set up travis, doing
did not allow to catch all the errors. @smashra, could you please ensure that it fails correctly if any of the tests fail?
Thanks.
Fixed after building static ntru library.
