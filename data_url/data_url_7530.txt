I'm trying to run this code
but get the following error:
Note that the following code is working:
I can't reproduce the error on my laptop, but it seems to be fixed in LuxurySparse now.
OK, I did a bit investigation, this is error is triggered by control gate on a matrix representation. This should be fixed by the patch in LuxurySparse.
Yeah, this is a bug, with the master branch of LuxurySparse, it should work now.
(By typing ] dev LuxurySparse in a Julia REPL).
Now the performance of controlled large block is not fully optimized, it calls into the matrix representation of target block, which will cause allocations. use cache to avoided invoking mat multiple times
please let us know if you want it be more performant.
