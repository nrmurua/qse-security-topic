It would help if the compiler error checked pulse parameters.
Example: It is called "shape_fun", not "shapeFun". Giving the wrong name causes an error deep in the qgl1 compiler (in this case, and index out of bounds error in PulseShapes.gaussian because gaussian I guess is the default shape but this pulse has length 0). See related issue #48.
