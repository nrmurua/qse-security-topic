Describe the bug
I think (for ALT) proper libdir value should be /usr/lib64 for x86_64. Usually it should have lib64 for 64-bit systems and lib for 32-bit systems. Except for Debian based systems where is different convention â€” there it will be lib/x86_64-linux-gnu perhaps.)
This difference, though, does not produce incorrect flags (on ALT):
This is because -l/usr/lib is stripped by default by pkg-config (based on (default) value of PKG_CONFIG_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH containing /usr/lib.
So this is not a major bug, but better be fixed for correctness in future versions.
BTW. It's possible to force pkg-config to not strip system dirs:
So this could in theory produce erroneous linking for some very non-standrad build environments.
Environment (please complete the following information):
Change like this seems to produce correct values:

Thanks for letting us know. Would you want to contribute the above via PR?
I will send it later, when I test it on Debian.
Fixed by #1496.
