Currently, cuda quantum Python wheels are built without MPI.
i.e., cudaq MPI APIs in cudaq.cpp are compiled as stubs in the wheel binary.
This can be checked by:
Run with mpirun -n 2 python3 test.py.
-> cudaq MPI support is not active in the wheel binary.
Currently, this affects the following functionalities (only on wheels)
cudaq.parallel.mpi distribution mode (cudaq.observe(..., execution=cudaq.parallel.mpi))
MPI multi-GPU parallelization on the tensornet simulator (relying on cudaq::mpi API to detect MPI environment).
To make this work cleanly (i.e. independent on how mpi is installed), we need #802.
