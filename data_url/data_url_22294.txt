Running 1.2 on linux.  The following code spits an error.  If either of the print commands in the run method are commented out then the error goes away.
This is expected behavior. User-defined classes in ARTIQ are not parametric and so all instances of the class must have matching types for every field.
Oh.  Is this documented anywhere?
The documentation section for these features is https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-master/compiler.html, and it, unfortunately, omits the restrictions on classes. I will add that.
Thanks.  That'd be helpful.
