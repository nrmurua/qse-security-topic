The comment on both_negative_mask is wrong. It's only true for 16-bit arguments (int16_t) but wrong if int is larger (as it is on most systems). This isn't an issue here because the function should only be called with values of at most 16 bit length.
I would recommend using int16_t everywhere here to make the function do what the comment says.
