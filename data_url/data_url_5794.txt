AerJob should have a circuits method that returns the circuits for the job. Besides being useful, it should exist because IBMQJob has it and the interfaces should match whenever possible.
Copied from #1432:
While we should make things easy as possible for users, Aer still ought to be provider-independent; it's not specifically a simulator of IBM Q jobs, it's a simulator for all backends.  AerJob and IBMQJob already do derive from the same class - qiskit.providers.job.JobV1, which defines the spec.  IBMQJob.circuits goes beyond that, and it might not be appropriate in all situations - you can pass a Schedule to the Aer simulators too, which likely doesn't a circuit associated with it.
It could be worthwhile to add a method that returns the inputs, but with Aer being a local simulator, it seems slightly redundant with the potential to add overhead; whatever receives the AerJob will already have access to the inputs, from when it submitted them.
I close this issue. I hope further discussion will be in qiskit-terra ifqiskit.providers.job.JobV1 should have circuits.
