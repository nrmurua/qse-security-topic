The tests in test.python.visualization.test_visualization.TestLatexSourceGenerator should check against a file reference.
Does something like this fix the issue? If so I will work on replicating something similar for all the other LatexSource tests. Also, would it be better if I defined the expected content in an external file rather than a variable in every test, or is this fine?
I think I (kinda accidentally) closed this one with #5062.
