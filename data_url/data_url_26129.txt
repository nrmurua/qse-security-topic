cvxpy raises some warnings in tests/test_matrix_props/test_is_block_positive.py and tests/test_state_props/test_has_symmetric_extension.py. The flagged constraint numbers are not that helpful here as cvxpy allows 7 types of constraints.
Example of  scalarized problem vs. vectorized problem in cvxpy.
cvxpy is not imported in toqito/matrix_props/is_block_positive.py but another imported function toqito/matrix_props/sk_norm.py does make use of cvxpy functionalities.
The constraints considered by cvxpy for is_block_positive could be the ones shown below because an equality is also a constraint.
Constraint 1 
Constraint 2

Constraint 3

Constraint 4

Or constraints  considered by cvxpy for is_block_positive could be in sk_norm.py.
Constraint 1

Constraint 2

Constraint 3

Constraint 4

Similar detailed discussion for tests/test_state_props/test_has_symmetric_extension.py is skipped. cvxpy is not imported in toqito/state_props/has_symmetric_extension.py but another imported function toqito/state_opt/symmetric_extension_hierarchy.py does use functionalities in cvxpy.
As cvxpy considers an equality a constraint, the 5 constraints could be the ones in either of the two functions:
