Using config the set the simulation options will be deprecated, we should move forward to use backend_options but we should keep backward compatibility.
In Qiskit/qiskit#1629, a RunConfig class is introduced that will contain all options that the backend needs to run the circuit (shots, max_credits, memory, etc.).
Similarly we plan to have a CompileConfig class that is consumed by the compiler.
Does that work? The goal is to eventually make the compile/exeucte signatures more compact, and to be able to validate the passed-in args.
It sounds good to categorize options, will keep eye on that PR.
Btw, in my understanding, RunConfig is only used for running the circuits why it is needed for compilation? since you need to add RunConfig into qobj?

btw, in Aqua, we already have the categorization for those augments passed into compile/execute in Terra.
