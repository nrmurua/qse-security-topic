I received the following error
After having a look at line 539 and at the job_result object returned by the IBMQuantumExperience I noticed that there is no key called "result". The returned info from the execution is in the field "data"(?) I used the online device "ibmqx_qasm_simulator".
The following edits helped. Are these edits ok?
In _quantumprogram.py method get_counts()
return self.__quantum_program["circuits"][name]['execution'][device]['data']['counts']
In _quantumprogram.py method run() @ line 539
self.__quantum_program["circuits"][name]["execution"][backend]["data"] = job_result["qasms"][index]["data"]
Hi @alexandrupaler
Thanks for pointing this out it is fixed in our latest update r0.3. I am closing this issue but if you still find it occurring please let us know.
