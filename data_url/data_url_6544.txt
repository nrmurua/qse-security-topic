Trajectory simulation is currently available in qsim-core, but inaccessible to Cirq users. The qsimcirq translation layer must be updated to accept noisy circuits (i.e. circuits with Channels and Mixtures) and route them to the proper qsim-core methods.
An important point to consider in this space: Kraus operators fed into the trajectory simulator require lower-bound probabilities for their selection within a channel. Since these aren't inherently provided by Cirq, we either need to allow users to define lower bounds manually (likely in QSimCircuit) or provide methods to generate them automatically.
