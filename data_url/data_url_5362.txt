Running the following code:
Results in the following error traceback:
Setting "default.qubit" instead of "lightning.qubit" for the device works fine. There seems to be an issue with the lightning builds.
Expected behavior:
No ImportError
ImportError.

See above.
In the past when I have encountered this sort of error for other packages, it was because while the wheel names indicated that they were built for arm64, the actual wheel contents contained code compiled to x86. My guess is that there's something buggy with the build process for these published wheels.
HI @JoelHBierman thanks for reporting this. We will check this out and report back shortly
Hi again @JoelHBierman
We can reproduce the error locally. The issue seems to arise from the builder we are using for the wheels being unable to correctly output ARM64 targeted binaries, as we build using GH Actions. We are looking into a strategy to fix this, but as an interim we can suggest the following:
We can confirm when built natively, this will work, though we aim to have a fix for the built wheels shortly.
As an update, we have a fix for this coming with PR #306
The next release of PennyLane (v0.24) will arrive on Tuesday 21st June. The above mentioned fix will be available as of that release. I will close this issue now, but feel free to reopen if there are any updates you would like to share.
