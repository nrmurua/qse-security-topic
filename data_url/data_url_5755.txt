Currently in docs/apidocs/parallel.rst the U gates are applied as circ.u1(pi/2,2) and circ2.u1(pi/2,2) which flags a warning that this method is deprecated as of 0.16.0.
The fix should be using the circuit library (https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html) and
Thanks, it's good to get rid of these deprecations.
U1Gate as a whole is actually not something we want to be using - the preferred form would actually be to use the general u, which is
@jakelishman The deprecation message suggests using the PhaseGate via QuantumCircuit.p as it is equivalent to the U1Gate. Is there a particular reason to use a UGate over PhaseGate when making changes to these examples?
Oh yeah, p is a better choice.
