Right now if you check for results for more than 500 seconds, it just gives up. In practice, this causes more harm than good. It can take down a whole run (by raising an exception) if someone or many someones slots in a sufficient amount of work in front of you in the queue
On the other hand we have had a user who have "lost their server" and could not figure out how to shut down their job.
Maybe the solution is to set this at a day or something like that.
Timeout is now configurable and defaults to not timing out.
