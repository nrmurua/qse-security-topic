The pulse specification has acquire commands being applied to be multiple qubits. Within the terra API acquires should only be applied to a single qubit and then at assembly time the correct acquire command should be output by combining acquires of the same time and duration. This will make pulse programming more consistent and easier to reason about as all operations in pulse would then be for single channels.
@taalexander I can work on that
Is there anything helpful you can suggest for me to speed up my progress? Maybe example, startin point? Otherwise I'll dig in it myself :)
I think to start we should modify the Acquire command instruction to only accept a single input channel, memoryslot, and register. This should be relatively straightforward.
After that, we will figure out how to assemble the instructions and verify that all acquisitions are present to satisfy the meas_map.
Once again thank you for taking this on!
