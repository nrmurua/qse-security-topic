If only setting frequency0 the following can be run many times in succession using artiq_run.
If frequency1.set is uncommented the liklihood of the core device locking up on the first call of artiq_run is 5/6. In the 1/6 case the core device locked up after calling artiq_run a second time. So this looks reproducible on my end.
There's nothing printed on the UART. Setting frequency2 also seems to trigger same behavior.
Can you try by using the startup kernel? Likely there is intermittent memory/gateware corruption (did you rework the HMC7043 reset?) and running the whole TCP/IP stack is more likely to crash than when running simpler code. Also disconnect Ethernet during the test so that the CPU doesn't have to process network broadcasts.
It could be that it's longer kernels loaded through Ethernet that cause crashes, not frequency1 itself.
Ran this same experiment several more times.
Now disconnect SATA0 (Ethernet cable).
Reconnect SATA0 (Ethernet cable). Change frequency1 to frequency0 in above experiment.
Reduce @kernel in startup kernel to nothing but self.core.reset().
Edited previous post to strike Ethernet works fine on this board interactively when just working with frequency 0
On this same board I can repeatedly run experiments that don't involve SAWG interactively over Ethernet.
