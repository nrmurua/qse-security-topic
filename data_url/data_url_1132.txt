So this would like, replace all X, Y, and PhasedX gates with variants that rotate by epsilon more? Or would it also affect some other gates?
I think we'll want to be more general than that. For instance, #1001 requests the ability to add Gaussian noise. I also think we might want to let the user specify which gates are affected. I'm not sure yet what this will look like. @dabacon might have thoughts.
