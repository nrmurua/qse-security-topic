Doc build is failing due to a "broken link". I think this is a Sphinx-specific issue.
Initially, the error was about BQSKit paper reference in examples.
Then, an error was created by this paper published by ACM. (build failure link)
After this, an error was raised by another paper (not published by ACM) (build failure link)
Giving it a try by ignoring all 3 links in #1991 but I think there might be more linkcheck failures. This issue might need to be looked at more in-depth instead of ignoring a few links.
Edit: Link check ignore is not working? Both links leading to broken in the latest failure were added to conf.py.
Closing this because the Sphinx build failure fixed itself somehow. docs build is ignoring the links as expected.
