This actually already doesn't have the problem on the master/phaser branch. I believe the recent fixes for LLVM performance also addressed this issue.
Is that fixed in release-2?
No, since release-2 doesn't run the testcase...
Well, @jordens added this to the 2.1 milestone. Should it be moved to 3.0 then?
If it also happens to e.g. the DDS code in 2.0, which is likely, and if it is possible to backport, I'd like to see this fixed in 2.1.
@whitequark Is this more difficult than adding a few more passes?
@jordens The fix in the phaser branch was completely different, in fact it didn't involve adding passes at all (but making the analyses more precise); this requires migrating 2.x to LLVM 3.9.
I could add the passes as described above, but, in light of the way this was fixed in master, this seems sloppy, and I would really like to investigate first with some representative code (that runs on 2.x) whether this is the right solution, or whether there is some other bug.
Reopening as per IRC discussion.
Closing as per discussion with @sbourdeauducq, in favor of asking dowstream to upgrade to 3.0.
Ok by me. Just need to verify that it does not occur in master.
