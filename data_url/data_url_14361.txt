In #8858 is was noted that FakeAuckland is a v2 backend where as FakeHanoi and FakeCairo, both released at the same time as Auckland (technically a bit later) are v1.  This is extremely confusing and causes code breakage.  Instead of this, it would be nice to just have a new name represent the path forward.  In particular the word "fake" is not really what they are, but rather "snapshots" or "simulators" of the real systems at a given time.  Admittedly, I started the whole FakeBackend things several years ago, so I am to blame.
So instead of conflicting backend versions for things with the same names, it would be nice to migrate over to something like AucklandSimulator and just start not adding new v1 backends, thus forcing people over to v2 without conflicting naming conflicts.
