It seems the new macOS can not compile QuTiP, it can not find <complex>. The headers do present in /usr/include (however it required a header package installation on the new macOS)
Is it the case so, I was just about to upgrade to Mojave. Is it the issue with IDLE or Notebooks?
If the QuTiP is already installed then there is no problem after the update, it works.
I will submit a patch to the installer later today.  Basically you need to add '-mmacosx-version-min=10.9' to the _compiler_flags and extra_link_args.
