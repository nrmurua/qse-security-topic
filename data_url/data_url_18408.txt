It is known that quilc hasn't been particularly optimized for performance. @notmgsk did some significant algorithmic work to improve things, and others have done things here and there. However, the performance curves look quadratic against qubit count.
This is a general issue to start investigating performance, determining what's slow, and start creating tickets to speed individual elements up.
