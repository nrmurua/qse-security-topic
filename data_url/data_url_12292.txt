The CNOT representation should follow the standard (Wiki, Nielson & Chuang, etc.) used in the quantum community. A non-standard, IBM Q unique, representation is not helpful to the user.
Hi,
I agree with you that the standard notation is the best. This can be done once we swap the order of the qubits, from left to right instead of the current from right to left. I have noticed this in this tutorial:

@dtchang was discuss many times between us. Either you have to give up on the standard bits order, or the standard tensor order of gates using by quantum text books. Since the computer science community is much larger than quantum we decided to go with the standard bit order and have 0001 be qubit 0 in the excited state. It make associating the classical outcome with the bits simpler. The tutorials/user guides need more work to describe this.
