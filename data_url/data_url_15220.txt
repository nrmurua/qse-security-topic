Incorrect latex output for Statevector.
The resulting output is gibberish.  The zeros in the statevector aren't elided, but have the value None.  You end with stuff like None|0000\rangleNone in the generated latex.
The bug is in state_visualization.py and the function _state_to_latex_ket.  This function calls _round_if_close, believing that that function will convert all entries that are close to zero to zero. It doesn't do that.
_round_if_close calls np.real_if_close.  This numpy function only converts a complex array to a real array if all of imaginary parts are close to zero.  It does not work correctly if only some of the entries are close to zero.
It would be sufficient to change the two lines _state_to_latex_ket from
to
With qiskit-terra==0.22.2 it works well (it seems that that the bug has been fixed).
Closing the issue.  The bug has indeed been fixed in the newest release.
