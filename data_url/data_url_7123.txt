The code only supports single-wire gates (+ control wires). What about gates that apply to multiple wires, like the swap gate or big QFTs?
Gates now support custom shaders, which was a prereq. What's left to do is mainly UI stuff: pushing gates out of the way when the large multi-wire block intersects them, not allowing overhang passed the end of the circuit, etc.
