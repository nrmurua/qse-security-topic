Given how the text diagrams are currently being used (as debugging information), and given that we're not parsing them anymore, it makes sense to favor human readability over exacting precision. Could still be an option to increase the precision, though.
Just to paste this in from an off-line chat before it disappears:
"Yeah! That'd be great. Look for code that calls ascii_exponent (or whatever that method is called), and also look over the existing ascii symbol functions like e.g. in the W gate, since some of them include constants."
Fixed
