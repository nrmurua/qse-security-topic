After updating to the latest XCode Commandline tools which includes Apple Clang 12.0.0 Conan can't build by default.
Trying to build gives:
Build works
Probably we need to wait for Conan to release an update, but I was able to build by editing my local conan settings manually to include '12.0' as per the Conan troubleshooting guide.
