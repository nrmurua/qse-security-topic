The latest version of qcodes requires the package tqdm. Consider adding it to condalist.yml
@jpdehollain 'tqdm' is already part of the qcodes requirements, adding it to the condalist.yml will not solve the issue. The issue is that people update qcodes with a git pull, but do not update the required packages. We need another solution to solve this gracefully.
