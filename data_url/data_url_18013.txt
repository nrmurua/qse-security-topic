In order to transition to using common standards, local simulators should report results following the proper schemas.
Not sure if the original commentary wanted to say this should be high-priority or it was just pressing for moving to a separate issue as soon as possible. @ajavadia can you clarify this?

@delapuente and @ajavadia I think we make this 0.7.
I think it makes sense - at the moment, they still use the old result format internally, and make use of result_from_old_style_dict() for converting to the new result schema. Eventually they need to be updated, but since they do work, let's assign it to the 0.7 milestone - @delapuente and @ajavadia , please revert if this is not correct.
