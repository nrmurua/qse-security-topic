I just did a fresh instlal of qutip today and ran the tests. mcsolve (and mcsolve_f90) tests involving collapse operators fail. Probably this is due to a recent change in the code where averaging of states is turned off by default for the solver:

do not average states by default
I think this change in general involves a risk of not being backwards compatible with a lot of old code. What do you think?

Hi Arne
Thanks for the bug report. Yes, you're right, it is the change in default value of the average_states (used to be called mc_avg) that is the course of the failing tests. And it could break backwards compatibility so perhaps it should be reverted. However, if average_states defaults to True it breaks backwards compatibility with the stochastic master equation solvers (which did not use this flag before, and had a different default behavior). However, since the stochastic ME and SE solvers has not yet been an official part of the qutip API in a release, perhaps priority should be to keep the mcsolve backward compatible (although I think it makes more sense not to take an average over the trajectories by default).
