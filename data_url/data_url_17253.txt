DAG width needs to count both qubits and cbits for self-consistency.
qiskit.dagcircuit.dagcircuit defines width() as
There may be code that depends on the semantic of width() == number of qubits
Fulfilling the literal request of this ticket would be as simple as removing the - self.num_cbits() as shown in my previous comment. But obviously the coder believed that width means number of qubits. How to resolve this? Just change the code? Look for usages?
The only test of dagcircuit.width() I have found is in qiskit-terra/test/python/test_dagcircuit.py and it doesn't set any cbits.
...
However, in qiskit/transpiler/passes/width.py the dagcircuit.width() member function seems to be used as-is, that is, only counting qubits:
So does changing qiskit.dagcircuit.dagcircuit.width() to count cbits as well break the transpiler?
It probably breaks several things which is why it has not been implemented yet.
Ah, so maybe the trick is to
??
First step: coded replacement function.
Next, have to look everywhere for usage of DAGCircuit.width() and replace with DAGCircuit.num_qbits().
Then when invocations are all changed, DAGCircuit.width() can be changed to return the total number of bits.
Per @ajavadia 's comments after merge of #2708 I'll proceed to
The pull requests #2807 and qiskit-aqua number 613 should complete this issue.
It's now pull requests #2812 and aqua pr 614
I'll make the transpiler pass changes requested in #2812 on 2019-07-22
I have pushed the transpiler pass changes requested in #2812
