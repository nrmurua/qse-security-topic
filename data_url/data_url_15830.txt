Submitting jobs via the quantum_instance has an infinite loop that does not exit unless the job was submitted correctly and a job_id can be grabbed:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/0c6890dc0ed55626e96ceb5c27234ed2116e76bb/qiskit/utils/run_circuits.py#L149
If this does not happen, the code loops forever emitting warnings.
Reference: qiskit-community/qiskit-aqt-provider#46
Qiskit does not try infinitely many times to submit jobs.
No while True: loops.
@nonhermitian could you provide some example of how I may reproduce this in code?
Is this only on jobs to IBMQBackend or is this also to Aer?
Please see the attached code for an example
main.py.zip
@nonhermitian I have tested the current PR for different job states according to the code given by @shahakL. Would you be able to review the PR once?
