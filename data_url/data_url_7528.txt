Old API reset! is deprecated to collapseto!

It is still not clear if resetto! can be a better name for setting a qubit to specific value (experimentally equivalent to classical feedback control).
So I think we all agree to use resetto! now
The latest design is adding a postprocess argument. Which can be NoPostProcess(), ResetTo(bit"0011") or RemoveMeasure().
It makes the dispatch much easier. So that a simpler design of Measure block with less fields is possible.
