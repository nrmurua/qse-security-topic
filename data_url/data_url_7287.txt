Hello, I was wondering if you could add a ParticuleBasis abstract type such that
We could, but I don't really see a use for it. If you just want to dispatch on this in a script, you can also do something like
What do you want to achieve here?
I want to define many functions that work the same for both momentum and position basis. Stuff like
I also want to define some operators on a composite particule and spin basis.
I know the difference in runtime between the union and abstract type version is marginal, but I find the abstract type version cleaner.
