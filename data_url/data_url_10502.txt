Description
Functions like dwave_networkx.pegasus_coordinates.linear_to_pegasus are described as requiring a single input parameter; e.g., pegasus_coordinates.linear_to_pegasus(r) but require a value for the class which is undescribed.
To Reproduce

Expected behavior
dwave_networkx.pegasus_coordinates should be described so users know what m is.
Environment:
Additional context
Add .. autoclass:: for dwave_networkx.pegasus_coordinates
