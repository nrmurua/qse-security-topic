A tutorial for the docs showcasing how to use the output modulation features.
Should be done after #315.
Hi! Thanks @HGSilveri
Awesome!
By the way, the features needed for the simulation part are being introduced in PR #390, you can take a look already if you want.
Relevantly here, you'll have an extra option in Simulation() that let's you choose whether you want to simulate with the input or the modulated output. All you'll need to do is choose this enable option, like so:
If then e.g. you draw the simulation with sim.draw(), you'll see the output pulses will appear.
Thanks for the remark!
