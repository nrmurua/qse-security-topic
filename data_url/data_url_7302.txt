The current implementation for +(a::LazyTensor,b::LazyTensor) does not allow operators acting on different spaces. See the following:
One could create a LazySum operator of the two LazyTensor objects, something like:
Similarly, one could add:
Is there a reason this is not a good idea?
Think we have this now?
