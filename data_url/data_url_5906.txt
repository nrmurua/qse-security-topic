QasmSimulator.from_backend() is not found.
The method should work.
Hi @jwoehr . I have tested this with the latest release and with master as well and everything works. If I downgrade to version 0.6.1 it fails as you mention. Can you update your version and try again?
As @vvilpas this functionality was added in the 0.7 release so you need to upgrade your qiskit-aer install
