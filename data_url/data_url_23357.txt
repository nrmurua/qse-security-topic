This is not actually a qcodes issue but we might be able to find a workaround.
When creating a simulated instrument and then trying to connect to it on a different address than specified the error created in the visa lib does not get looped through.
If there is a mismatch in the address the session object will be a mismatch:

This is caught and returned properly, but never gets handled, the code from the cited line is:

I've seen this too, and it is really annoying.
