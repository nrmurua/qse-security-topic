Related to the message from this open user : https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/C88B13092/p1655043788534019 , using AerSimulator with VQE and the GPU option enabled returns the eigenstate in the wrong format.
Output :
The expected output would be :
Hi, I posted the question, let me know if I can give you additional details.
CPU uses AerPauliExpectation(), which provides better performance but GPU does not because is_aer_qasm() checks backend name is aer_simulator_statevector though the backend name of GPU is aer_simulator_statevector_gpu.
The easiest workaround is to set expectation argument with AerPauliExpectation. We believe that this is an issue in terra, but may change the naming rule of backends in the next release.
I think is_statevector_backend function in Terra is problematic, but my PR was closed: Qiskit/qiskit#7015. The issue of identifying the type of simulator needs to be discussed more.
I'm glad to see that workaround.
Please let me close this issue because this is an issue in terra (Qiskit/qiskit#7010).
I believe that this issue can be worked around by setting expectation in VQE construction.
FYI: Qiskit/qiskit#8411 fixes 7010.
