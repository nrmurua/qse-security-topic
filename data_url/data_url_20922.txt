Multiple connections from same node has been detected connecting to same ip. This happens when a node shuts and restart itself.
Solution
Before accepting connection, check if IP is already connected or any connection from same IP is already there. Disconnect from the peer if connection found.
We have noticed this situation in the latest release.
In PR #1470 max_redundant_connection has been added into config, whose default value is 5. Which allows maximum 5 redundant connection from same IP.
Without the presence of Node ID, it is hard to know if the redundant connection is from the same node having same IP or is it from the different node running on same IP.
