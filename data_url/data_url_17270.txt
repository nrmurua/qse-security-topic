This has caused major performance regressions as discussed in #2474.
I was concerned that #2474 would have a performance impact, guess it really did.
I wonder why we actually need the Bit classes, considering the backwards compat issues they cause is there actually a benefit to having them over just using the tuple like before? I'd rather just revert all of #2414 then revert just the backwards compat fix.
I went ahead and pushed up patch to revert those new classes: #2499 we can discuss that approach there.
