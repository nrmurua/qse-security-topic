Consider merging test_qasm_martix_product_state.py and test_qasm_mps_simulator.py , both in test/terra/backends.
Thanks @yaelbh, yes there should just be one file for the tests, probably test_qasm_matrix_product_state_simulator.py (but test_qasm_mps_simulator.py for short if the other file name is too long).
