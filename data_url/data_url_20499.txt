Just the go ahead from whoever has an opinion.  I can make the switch in the Github configuration easily.
My opinion would be to do it as and when open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos#88 passes CI.

Okay, I'll watch for that.
Done.
Shall I rename OQS-master to OQS-v7 as well, or does anything depend on it still being called OQS-master?
Done.
Thanks.

Well, old build scripts depend on that (should someone want to re-build v7 stuff). Generally I don't see value in re-naming it -- unless we want it to eventually refer to the true "master" (err, "main").

Okay we'll leave it.
