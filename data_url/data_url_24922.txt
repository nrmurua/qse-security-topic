I would like to plot a spectrum with dashed lines, to compare with a solid line spectrum. The code
FluxQubit.plot_evals_vs_paramvals('flux', flux_list, evals_count=4, subtract_ground=False, linestyle='--') produces the error
AttributeError: 'AxesSubplot' object has no attribute 'set_linestyle'.
This behavior is consistent with the options scqubits currently supports, I believe:

We may look into extending that in the future. Note: all plot routines return the Axes and Figure objects which can be further modified on the user side.
While it would be feasible to have linestyle/linewidth options be handled explicitly with _process_options and then routed to plot, this solution is not scalable (there could be many more option support requests in the future).
I added 'alpha', 'linestyle', 'linewidth', 'marker', 'markersize' options to all the standard x vs y plotting routines. And 'interpolation' to ones that use imshow.
Let me know if we need any other obvious ones that would be useful for people.
The changes are in master now, so should make it to next release.
