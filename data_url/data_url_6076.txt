Calling HamiltonianModel.from_dict(hamiltonian) with the dictionary in hamiltonian['h_str'] a simple numeric string like "0" causes an exception in file oppparse.py, HamiltonianParser._compute_drift_data() in the line ham_full = np.zeros(np.shape(self._system[0][0].full()), dtype=complex).
Using as a Hamiltonian "0*Z0" causes an exception in ham_full += ham_part[0].full() * eval(ham_part[1])
Closed by #752 - forgot to list this one in the list of closed issues for that PR.
