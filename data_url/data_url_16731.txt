As suggested by @lcapelluto : Add some form of generated unique identifier id field for SamplePulse/Instruction/PulseLibraryItem/... in pulse, so that they can be identified using this instead of the name field.
As far as I am aware, the only way to identify a SamplePulse/Instruction/PulseLibraryItem/... in pulse is through the name field. This has caused a recent issue in Aer as the names of PulseLibraryItems now get a hash added at the end, and as such there ends up being a name mismatch between an Instruction in an experiment to play a sample pulse, and the name of the sample pulse itself in an assembled PulseQobj's pulse_library (please correct me if the terminology i'm using is incorrect). E.g. if a sample pulse has name rabi_pulse, the Instruction to play the pulse will inherit the name rabi_pulse, but the name of the pulse in the pulse_library will be something like rabi_pulse--83975728198. As such, relating the Instruction to the sample pulse in the pulse_library using the name requires ignoring the --83975728198, which to work requires assumptions on what a user will "typically" enter into the name field.
