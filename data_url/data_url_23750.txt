Proposed config system, looks like what most python packages have:
I know @eendebakpt  has a nice basic PR in #302, and the  proposed solution looks a lot like that one.
This will solve most problems with the tight coupling of qcodes and jupyter.
f.ex  #316, #278, #155, #290
@MerlinSmiles @eendebakpt  do you two, biggest advocates of config, have preferences?
I am leaning toward a json based config file, which can be validated, and also created tweaked from a GUI, or yeah from an editor.
Others, please also say if you have preferences. I would not use a python file as it violates the principle of separating configuration data from code, which in the long run proves to be an effective way to avoid problems.
No strong preferences. Either text (.ini) based or json is fine. No binary and no executable statements.
I vote for json :) so much easier to work with than ini, the only downside is that it wont support comments...
