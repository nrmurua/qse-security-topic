The QV fitter forces you to run an ideal state vector simulator as done in the QV tutorial first. What if I wanted to compare data from 2 noisy experiments? How would I add the data then?
Currently, if I run
@zohimchandani - this is a very interesting suggestion!
However, note that in ignis code base there are only proven methods, that have been published in papers.
I would suggest that you will copy ignis code locally, and change the following QV fitter file as you like:

If you have any questions, please ask them in the qiskit-ignis slack channel.
