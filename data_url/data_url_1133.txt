Partially done in #2323
I'm not going to work on it any more. Someone could pick this up and address the following things
Hey @mpharrigan, I am right now working on the following issues of #4499.
For this, I changed the int to float and it still worked fine for me. What specific bug were you facing while using non-integer coordinates?

I see that currently, the implementation has hard-coded values. Do you have any idea how we could make this dynamically space the lines based on the user's dimensions? May I know what exactly do you prefer for the second task listed?
