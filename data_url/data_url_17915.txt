Current merging strategy allows merging a branch when it is up to date with the master branch only. This causes the workflow when merging several PR to be as follows:
There is an important bottleneck in steps 4 and 5 due to the number and duration of the CI's jobs.
This is a draft of the initiatives I'm taking to improve these times trying to reduce the bottleneck.
Maybe VCR can help with the caching?
Maybe use the failfast option?
The running time of the tests is relatively low with respect to the queue times now. I think we an close this issue. Opinions @mtreinish @diego-plan9 ?
I think the original description contained some ideas not only related to the running time of an individual job, but for the situation as a whole. Still, I do agree this issue has become rather stale and the individual job times don't play such a big part currently, and it makes sense to re-evaluate the situation in a new one if needed - so indeed closing.
