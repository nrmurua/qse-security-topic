I get errors when starting metal in python scripts on the command line. Here's a barebones script that works fine in Jupyter, but causes either Illegal Instruction: 4, Segmentation fault: 11, or just crashes when run:
When the code is run, the GUI sometimes appears with this annoying prompt (doesn't matter which option you choose, it crashes either way):

No crash, or graceful handling of teh error
n/a
@priti-ashvin-shah-ibm I don't have a mac so I can't check this, can you please try to reproduce this and comment if you can?
@JeremyDrysdale-ibm,  I tried to re-create few times on a mac, and was not able to.
Just for additional information, I have run many scripts in vscode, on a windows-server, and have not seen this error message.
This appears to have been resolved, but the issue never closed.
