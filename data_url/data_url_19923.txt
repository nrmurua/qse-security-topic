Failed to compile tests
All previous files compiled successfuly
Environment
Solution
Im not sure, but I think make install from openssl installs the libraries in /usr/local
and the cmake uses the first available libcrypt, libssl which in my case chose
-- Found OpenSSL: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so (found suitable version "1.1.1f", minimum required is "1.1.1")
manually adding args to cmake with paths to openssl libraries v3 solves the problem
-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR:PATH=/home/user/openssl-3.1.2/
Tests with cmake args
315 passed, 87 skipped, no errors
idk, this is a mistake on my side with the openssl installation or cmake libs discovery
hope the solution helps someone.
Thanks for reporting this observation. We have documented the recommendation in OQS_USE_OPENSSL
The OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR option can be set to aid CMake in its search.
IMO this should work as well (and be easier than explicitly setting libcrypto and libssl paths). Maybe you could confirm this works as good (or maybe even easier :) than your suggestion above?
In any case closing the issue as no further action is required,
Thanks
-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR:PATH=/usr/local/lib64/
Works
the only thing is that cmake does not show the version correctly, although it compiled
-- Found OpenSSL: /usr/local/lib64/libcrypto.so (found suitable version "1.1.1f", minimum required is "1.1.1")
@baentsch
I discovered that an incorrect version detection crashes the oqs-provider compilation
OPENSSL_INSTALL=/usr/local/lib64/ scripts/fullbuild.sh
I assume that the version is determined by the file name, I am sure that lib is version 3
removed unnecessary files (links and .a), cmake finds ghost library
Sooooo , after checking CMakeLists.txt:58
I realized that the standard find_package for cmake is called, the error is not in oqs-provider or liboqs but in cmake.
Setting -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR to source + compiled bins of openssl resolves all issues
Setting to only installed libraries /usr/local/lib64/ makes a mess
Setting to only installed libraries /usr/local/lib64/ makes a mess
That is expected as per its documentation: According to that, it must be
Set to the root directory of an OpenSSL installation.
i.e., the path set to the "--prefix" setting configuring openssl, not the source directory.
Added a link to this documentation in #1582 to avoid other's/future confusions.
