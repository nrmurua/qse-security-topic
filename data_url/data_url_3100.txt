pyquil 3.0.0
In the documentation, the syntax for DELAY statements is as follows:
DELAY q0 q1 ... delay_in_s
https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/apidocs/pyquil.gates.html#pyquil.gates.DELAY
It is also possible to delay all frames on some qubits, e.g. DELAY 0 1 2 1.0
or
PRAGMA q0 q1 "delay_in_s"
https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/basics.html#asking-for-a-delay
However, the behaviour seems to follow the quilT specification:
https://github.com/quil-lang/quil/blob/master/rfcs/analog/proposal.md#delay
which doesn't apply the delay to q0 and q1, but only to instructions which include both q0 and q1.
The documentation should be updated to make this more clear:
eg. Delay single-qubit gates on qubit 5 for 50ns
eg. Delay two-qubits gates on qubit 4/5 for 50ns
eg. Delay all gates on qubit 4/5 for 50ns
