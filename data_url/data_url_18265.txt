When parsing QASM, an AST is obtained where the nodes and their children are Node objects:
It would be expected to call a recursive function f over that tree, expecting nodes of the Node type.
When parsing a binary operation qiskit.qasm._node._binaryop.BinaryOp, (such as 3.141592653589793/2 from qelib1.inc) the node.children has three elements:
The item 0 should from a Node subclass, not a str.
Same with indexed_id. q[1] is parse to a node with the following children:
