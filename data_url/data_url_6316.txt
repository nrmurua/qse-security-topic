See #848. I can't figure out, yet, why this doesn't work reliably, but the problem has been temporarily alleviated by switching to a QEngine type instead, when cloning. This is usually only invoked immediately before calling a non-unitary operation, anyway, so it should make no great deal of difference to performance, typically.
Addressed by release v6.1.
