The test harnesses test_kem and test_sig should output which version of an algorithm's implementation is running.  This may require adding an "optimizations" field to the OQS_KEM and OQS_SIG objects.
The same would make sense for speed_kem and speed_sig. How would you want to identify/label the algorithm version/optimizations? Would it truly be necessary to add an "optimizations" field to OQS_KEM/SIG? Wouldn't a global cmake build options + /proc/cpuinfo output be sufficient (in combination with already available Git commit info)? Would also come handy for ´speed´ JSON output...
