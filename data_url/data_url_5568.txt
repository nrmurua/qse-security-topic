AerSimulator should not support QasmQobj and PulseQobj to run simulation.
They are deprecated in 0.9.0.

Even If we remove qobj supports in arguments, qobj will be still necessary to execute pulse simulation and DASK-based qasm simulation. That is, assemble() will be internally called in run(). To generate qobj for pulse, arguments for assemble()  is necessary. For example, verify_wheel.py executes pulse simulation as follows
Note that pulse simulation requires different arguments for assemble() and run(). If we remove qobj supports, the same arguments will be specified and unfortunately pulse simulation doesn't work correctly.
I think that qobj should be removed after unsupport of pulse simulation (#1722).
