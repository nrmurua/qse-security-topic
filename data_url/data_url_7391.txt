Use 1im and 0im or 1.0im and 0.0im if you need to enforce a floating-point type (note that e.g. 2.4 + 0im will already promote to Complex{Float64}).  The reason is that the 0.im syntax may soon be disallowed in Julia 0.6 (JuliaLang/julia#16339).
Thank you for the warning. I changed the code accordingly.
