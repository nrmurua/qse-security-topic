Current master of CP2K has the following check:

with spglib-1.9.9 being released in 2016 and the toolchain shipping 1.12.2.
Counterintuitively I get this warning even with FORCE_EVAL/DFT/KPOINTS/SYMMETRY set to .FALSE.
Do we have a test set for spglib-based functionality?
We depend on spglib in two ways: Directly via cryssym.F and indirectly through SIRIUS.
The problem with such a situation is that a version upgrade requires a concerted effort by otherwise independent developer(-teams). In this case we got lucky because so far the API seems to be backwards compatible, or we simply didn't notice because we're using our own Fortran bindings. Nevertheless, we do have some test coverage and those tests are passing.
Generally, I expect to see more of such problems as the trend towards libraries continues.
Welcome to dependency hell ;-)
