Prepare a suitable set of test cases and include into QUICK. Also write a script that would automatically run this set of tests. A user may run this script to verify the correctness of a QUICK installation.
Hi, Madu,
Software development call this continuous integration (CI) in case you don't know. For github, there are a few CI tools, https://github.com/marketplace/category/continuous-integration . I heard Travis-CI(https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci) is good, and free for open source, that is the least effort way to enable CI.
Another options are GitLab: here is a brief introduction of gitlab (https://about.gitlab.com/), you can use it on cloud or install it on lab-owned machines (https://about.gitlab.com/install/) . I would suggest to ask if iCER has it installed on their services or maybe ask for it if they don't, and you can test on-demand on GPU-enabled iCER machine in that case, most other public cloud services are quite pricy on GPU machine. The free tier is good enough for this project.
Hi Yipu,
Thank you for your suggestion. I will look at these CI tools.
With regards,
Madu
Hi Yipu,
I am trying to compile and test QUICK with TravisCI. But it looks like TravisCI is not supporting Fortran 90 (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/). Have you tasted any fortran codes using this software before?
