It would be really helpful to have an implementation of the Depolarizing Channel like the one on Qiskit
Note that the Pauli noise channel already implemented in Qibo is a special case of this channel.
Also note that this is channel is global, acting on a system differently than the tensor product of single-qubit depolarizing channels
Thanks @renatomello, we are looking into this.
