This is a follow up to #4174 to add another directive for aligning the pulses that appear within a block at their center. I think this is not that different from the other alignments (left, right). You would just find the longest pulse within that block and reserve a slot of that size. Mark the center point as c. Then all other pulses will last from c-duration/2 - c+duration/2.
Example:
What is unclear to me is the desired behavior when there are multiple pulses on a given channel in a block? Do we wish to squeeze them together in the center like so?
If so this should be straightforward to implement.
Ok, excellent we will tackle this in a follow-up feature PR.
