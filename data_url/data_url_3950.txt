The shuttle operation is already introduced in cQASM 2.0. But I would like to have it already implemented, since I need it for my architecture. Also adding the operation would not brake any version.
The alternative would be to add it only in my fork. If that is the only option, I would like to have some hints on how should I add it, in case I miss something.
Thanks
you can create a json config file for your architecture and use it in your openql program. In the json file you can define this operation.
