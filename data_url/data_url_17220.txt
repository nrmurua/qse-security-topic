meas_level seems to be the perfect candidate for an Enum class. The change would improve readability and clarity around raw numbers in the code. For instance: meas_level=MeasLevel.CLASSIFY is more suggestive of turning readout results into classified {0,1} bits than meas_level=2. This also fits with most other leveling systems in python, such as logging levels (https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels). This could also apply for meas_return.
My proposal:
I'd love any recommendations for the meas_level names.
Likely this would induce another change further down the line to pull .value out.
i support this as i'm often confused about whether 0 is lower or 2
Hi @SooluThomas, has any progress been made on this?
@taalexander Nope. I'm working on #2704
Ok, awesome! Do you plan on circling back to this after? I'm just trying to understand if I should reassign.
I might circle back to this.
