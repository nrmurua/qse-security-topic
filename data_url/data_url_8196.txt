In certain circumstances, zcsr_isherm can give a False negative.  This is usually masked by the auto_tidyup option being turned on.
Reproduce:
Up to the tolerance specified (1e-12), the given matrix is Hermitian, so it should return True.
This happens when a small non-zero value (lower than the tolerance) is compared to a zero.  This is because the structure test in zcsr_isherm assumes that for Hermicity to hold, there must always be an explicitly stored corresponding element for each entry, however clearly this isn't always the case.
It hasn't appeared before because we always have auto_tidyup turned on with a sufficiently large tolerance that these values would be removed by almost all operations which could have introduced this disparity (mostly matrix multiplication).
(I'll fix this on both the master branch and on dev.major, this is just for posterity)
