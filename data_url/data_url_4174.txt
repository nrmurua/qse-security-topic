I tried to run this example in pycharmï¼Œ but after a while, it doesn't work, what happened?

Hi,
What versions of Python, pip and ProjectQ are you currently using?
Also, do you get any error/warning messages? If yes, could you please provide them?
Hi,
Python 3.7, pip 20.0.2, ProjectQ 0.5.0
there is no any error/warning messages, just like this..

eng = MainEngine(IBMBackend(use_hardware=True, toke=token, num_runs=1024, verbose=False, device=device))
Should i add IBM account and password to this code?  such as: user='', password=''.
could you run your code with verbose=True?
no,  there is no any change . all examples about IBM as backend are useless, i don't know why.
the fact we don't see even 'IBM Q token> ' makes me think it's just a prompt issue.  (also little bug: your MainEngine is defined only if device is None). Try to run it by replacing the prompts by your IBMQ token and the device you want to run it with.
Anyway, seems IBMQ already upgraded their job submission mechanism; submitting circuits (what we were doing) via the POST method is getting deprecated:
Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider@e33b17a
ok  thanks for your help.
