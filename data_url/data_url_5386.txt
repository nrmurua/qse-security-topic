The definition of the T-gate in Gates.hpp currently mirrors the S gate. This should be rectified. The gate definitions are not currently used in gate applications, and so does not affect program correctness.
Expected behavior: T-gate definition should be correct.
Actual behavior: (What actually happens)
Reproduces how often: (What percentage of the time does it reproduce?)
System information: (post the output of import pennylane as qml; qml.about())
Close the issue as it is fixed in #212.
