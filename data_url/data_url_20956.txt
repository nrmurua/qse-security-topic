Describe the bug
The ~/.qrl/data/known_peers.json file grows quite large and upon starting the qrl node using start_qrl with a large known_peers.json file returns this error:
This error points to the open files limit default settings  in most unix OS's. This is not a critical issue, and the node will continue syncing even with the error. Ubuntu 16.04 has as a default open files limit of 1024
You can see that the num_known_peers has grown past this limit.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Expected behavior
Respect the OS limit and split the operation into smaller sized chunks to avoid hitting the warning.
Details:
Additional context
This is not critical and only presents a warning when starting the node. Setting the limit to something larger than the known peers removes the warning.
Changing the default in a local session with ulimit -n 1200  removed the warning upon starting the node.
Fixed in PR #1647
