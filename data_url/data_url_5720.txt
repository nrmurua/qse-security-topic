This fails:
AerError: 'AerSimulator.from_backend does not currently support V2 Backends.'
I would expect to be able to build noise models for backend versions supported in Terra
I have the same problem when I try to import qiskit_aer.noise.
import qiskit_aer.noise
ImportError: cannot import name 'BackendV2' from 'qiskit.providers.backend'
