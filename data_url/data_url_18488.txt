We implement a branch feature/recursive-UCR that implements a different compilation technique for uniformly controlled rolls, a key component of the CSC and QSC algorithms. This other compilation technique can be used to implement a delayed-selection version of UCR expansion, so that the entangler can be chosen to be native on the link that the addresser assignsâ€”but the logic is currently not laid out correctly to implement this. Revisit this UCR compilation method and introduce another pseudo-gate type that allows for this kind of scheduling.
