Bug
If using one of these setters after creating the AWG instance, they do not affect the actual function call.

Previously, we checked the option when executing generate_signal() calls now we bind the appropriate function handle.
Fix
Bind the function handle in the setters.
On closer inspection, it works since the option is passed to the Instruction. Consequently, this option should be removed from the AWG class and be set in the Instruction itself.
