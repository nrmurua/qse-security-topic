The package fails on the latest nixpkgs (master and nixpkgs-unstable, 31d567846255)

Looks like just the signs have changed, so in principle nothing physically wrong. Do you have any idea what changed in nixpkgs? Possibly something in Numpy?
These are changes, where the breakage happened:
I guess I found it and I don't like it. The only spurious thing between those two commits is an update of OpenBlas (cfe69b2b2f62266983a25da3a81b392d8e9c2d69). Now switching out OpenBLAS in Lapack and Blas for MKL solves the problem again and the test passes. So there must be some subtle numerical thing changing the signs of orbitals. Of course this doesn't change the physics at all but the test fails with large errors. I am not really sure what the best fix would be.
Another interesting issue with OpenBLAS after the strange AVX512 problems and wrong SCF in CP2K with threading ... üòê

In that case, I would say let's disable the test. The sign of the MO is mathematically undefined, and thus there is a 50/50 chance that the underlying solver gets it "right". Such a test should be considered broken.
EDIT: It's not LAPACK's fault if the sign of the MO is not the expected one.
