Arbitrary pairwise interactions between qubits can be simulated in linear depth and linear connectivity using a "swap network" as explained in https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04789. This is a generally useful algorithmic primitive. I need it for qiskit-community/qiskit-nature#654 but since it's not specific to quantum simulation I think it belongs in Terra. I can submit a PR for this.
I am not sure whether it's directly related, but @ShellyGarion and myself have been recently looking at this paper as a means to synthesize small-depth linear functions (that is, functions consisting of only CNOT and SWAP gates). Such a linear function can be represented by an n x n invertible linear matrix with 0/1 entries, and the construction in fig.2 of the paper shows how such a matrix can be reduced to upper-triangular form.  The synthesis algorithm for linear functions thus first reduces a matrix to an upper-triangular form (by eliminating entries below diagonal), and then to an identity matrix (by additionally eliminating entries above diagonal). Ben Zindorf (an intern) has further improved this synthesis algorithm (for linear functions) with respect to depth and linear connectivity. Please let us know if you think this could be useful for the qiskit nature application you have mentioned.
Thanks @alexanderivrii . Figure 2 of the paper is explaining the Givens rotation decomposition of a unitary matrix, used to implement a single-particle basis change. After the publication of that paper, it was noticed that there is a better decomposition described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08788. This is the decomposition we use in practice for the general basis change, and it is implemented at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/blob/main/qiskit_nature/circuit/library/bogoliubov_transform.py. I just wanted to call your attention to this in case it is useful.
Apparently this is already implemented in #7813.
