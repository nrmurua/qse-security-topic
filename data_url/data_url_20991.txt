No need to validate the block state for the alternate chain. Only validate the PoW for the blocks in alternate chain.  State validation for the blocks in alternate chain will only happen, in case the alternate chain cumulative difficulty exceeds the current chain's cumulative difficulty. In case the alternate chain, state validation fails, then roll back to original mainchain.
