I think I have succeeded building a new implementation of dilithium2(with arm_neon) in liboqs by changing some configurations, but I don't know how to use it in openssl, beacuse openssl does not have a algorithm name called "dilithium2_arm".
By the way, I see there are "dilithium2_ref" and "dilithium2_avx2" in liboqs, when we run
apps/openssl req -x509 -new -newkey <SIG> -keyout <SIG>_CA.key -out <SIG>_CA.crt -nodes -subj "/CN=oqstest CA" -days 365 -config apps/openssl.cnf 
If  is dilithium2, which one will be used, is "dilithium2_ref" default? Then, how can we use "dilithium2_avx2"?
submit twice, sry~
