Config contains certain operations using capital letters :
I use the same in my program
    k.gate('FL_CW_02', q2, q1)
However, here I get an error:

Changing the config to contain instructions in lowercase (while leaving the main program unchanged) makes it work. Note that this is a workaround and clearly not the desired behavior.
Fixed in the latest commit (9552605) on develop branch. test_case_insensitivity in test_configuration.py contains the tests.
