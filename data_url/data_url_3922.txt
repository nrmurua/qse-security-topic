To improve the workflow of quantum developers, greater integration of simulation tools in OpenQL is desired. These could take the form of simulation platforms such as QuantumSim (density matrix simulator) and QX (state-vector simulator). Additionally, it is of great importance that this is done in a way that fits the current use of OpenQL in the laboratory.
It appears that this functionality already exists in a branch of OpenQL.
@jvansomeren discussion should then focus on moving it to the main branch, and creating documentation on its use and interfaces.
