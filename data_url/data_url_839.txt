What did you find confusing? Please describe.
I am looking for the device property that describes whether or not a device has pulse level control access. I was assuming that the list of supported operations would contain pulse_gate, but for one of the two devices where that is the case, I cannot find it:
Describe how documentation can be improved
It would be great to have more details about how pulse_gate is treated on braket python sdk, we need it for the pennylane braket plugin to allow pulse gates.
Additional context
Add any other context or screenshots about the documentation request here.
@Qottmann Thank you for raising this request. At the moment you would need to do something like a "Try Except" statement on "device.properties.pulse" in Python.
To add to the above, if you'd like to avoid a Try/Except, you can also check if the device properties contains a pulse entry with "pulse" in device.properties.dict()
Aside from the mentioned approaches you can see which devices support pulse gates here; look for "pulse level control".
