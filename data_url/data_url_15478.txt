The marginal_counts function is failing with error ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 2: ''
Execute
Code should execute successfully and marginalize the counts.
No response
The issue is with the marginalisation of the memory - for some reason, we're doing everything on strings rather than int, and for non-zero indices, the representation of 0 was becoming "" instead of "0", causing a later conversion (via int again!) to fail.  Should be a pretty trivial fix - done in #8047.
