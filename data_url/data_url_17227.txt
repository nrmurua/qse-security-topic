Currently, any circuit diagrams that are generated can be saved to a file by providing a value to the filename argument. It would be good if this was the case for all visualizations, especially the counts visualization.
This is available also (not via an argument but via a separate method) in the Bloch sphere drawer.
This was discussed during #1260 when we standardized the visualization functions as part of declaring the visualization interfaces stable. We decided against using a  parameter for this and to just rely on the matplotlib native constructs for writing a file. (just call .savefig(filename) on the output Figure object from the function) I did write a tutorial which explained how to do this in: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials but I can't find it anymore, it might have been deleted during some refactor over there.
As for the circuit visualizers, the reason we left the filename arg there is because all 4 outputs have different types returned by circuit_drawer() each with a different way to convert that into a file on disk. So to ensure there was a common method available we kept the filename arg.
Ok, that is fair enough. I agree that it is perfectly easy to save it using the .savefig(filename) but I felt it would be neater to have this as a parameter as in the circuit drawer, but I see your logic.
