Hi @jcmgray, Is it possible to integrate quantum hardware systems like IBM quantum with Quimb? I seem to recall reading somewhere about that.
I don't think so - on the software side it might be possible to use quimb as a classical backend for qiskit etc., but I'm not aware of any such interfaces yet.
Thanks for getting back to me about that. I was also wondering how the circ_ansatz_1D_brickwork model was conceived. Is there any literature on that particular class of tensor network?
I'm not sure if it was conceived anywhere in particular, but it its simply the densest tiling of gates you can do so a natural thing to study (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01307). It's also the same geometry generated by trotterizing a nearest neighbor hamiltonian into even and odd pairs.
