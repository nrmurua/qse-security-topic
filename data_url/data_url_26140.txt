As mentioned by @dfacoet, the functions choi_to_kraus and kraus_to_choi presently expect the Kraus operators to be provided as a 2D numpy array that represents both the left and right Kraus operators. In some instances (when the channel the Kraus operators are representing is a completely positive map) it is only necessary to specify a single 1D vector of Kraus operators.
These functions should therefore allow the user to provide either a 1D or 2D collection of Kraus operators. Some checks should be in place to ensure that if indeed the Kraus operators are provided as a 1D numpy array that the corresponding map is CP (completely positive).
This enhancement will provide less redundancy when specifying the arguments and also aligns well with the apply_map function pattern as well.
Hi, thank you for this issue, which addresses nicely what I pointed out.
Some minor points:
