When trying to initialize a state using initialize for a vector with some specific negative entries, e.g. [-0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5], the state has wrong signs, e.g. it turns out to be [0.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5].
This can not be checked using an assertion on fidelity as it is a global phase.
In case of [0.5, -0.5, 0.5, 0.5] this error does not appear.
The statevector should show the same signs as desired_vector.
The bug might be caused in InitializeGate method _rotations_to_disentangle, but I did not investigate further.
Thanks @alfrisch, for this. I am working on it and have made progress. The problems is not in _rotations_to_disentangle but in the fact that the global phase was intentionally not added.
This is not an error or error. Global phase does not matter.
@ajavadia we should close this and add to documentation or something.
I agree that global phase has no measurable effect on a quantum state. However it may be useful to match the global phase of the requested initialization vector for testing purposes.

Addressed Issue #1721: Introduced a Gate for Global Phase adjustment
Designed a new gate that results in global phase change. Even though global phase has no measurable difference to a quantum outcome, it may be useful for simulation purposes.
see comments in the pr.
