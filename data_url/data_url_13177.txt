The data that we need to store in a mitiq.calibration.Calibrator  is given by the following three things:
The main limitation that we have now is that all the data mentioned above is now stored in a highly nested dictionary, with multiple  hard-to-remember text keys. More or less something like this:
This is hard to maintain and to use. In particular, the computation of the optimal Strategy based on all the data (or a filtered subset of it) becomes very involved.
To be discussed.
E.g. a simple List[Tuple[BenchmarkProblem, Strategy, BenchmarkProblem]] would already be a significant improvement. But maybe there is a better solution.
