There are quantum GAN implementations in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/tree/6004d524c0434cd304ab0472bb7f513b4147a9fb/qiskit/aqua/components/neural_networks.
But, I do not know how to use this implementation.
So, I hope one makes the tutorial.
There are updated and new tutorials that have been done the Aqua 0.5 release that includes qGAN. They are in PRs here pending imminent approval/merging here. The relevant one is Aqua 0.5 update for qiskit tutorials #633 and the tutorial will be in folder qiskit/finance/machine_learning.
If you wish, while the approval/merge is pending, you can see the tutorial already on the fork of the repo in the PR where we have done the changes and additions. It is here

Could I ask you?
Where is the training code?
I see your paper and think that this qgan is trained with both quantum generator and classical discriminator.
Did you look at this tutorial here?

I miss it.
Thanks!!
