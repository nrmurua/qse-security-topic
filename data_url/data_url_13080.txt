We currently have many versions of executor functions in mitiq/interface/mitiq_<frontend> for frontend in [cirq, qiskit, etc...] .
Some of them have been coded years ago, some of them are more recent.
We should probably deprecate most of them in favor of 2 or 3 types of executors. For example, good executors that we should keep if present and add for all frontends are:
sample_bitstrings()
compute_density_matrix()
Optionally, an executor that calls sample_bitstrings() and returns an expectation value as a float (e.g. [this one].(
Probably we should deprecate all executors taking a matrix observable of type np.array.  If they are necessary for tests, they can be moved to test files.
Took a look at this today to see where we're at. Looks like a slightly larger chunk of work than I expected if we want all of these interfaces to have a unified API (which I think is a great idea). Here's the current state of things:
Hence we will need to implement all of the ‚ùå spots.
