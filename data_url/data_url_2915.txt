In a lot of examples we say results[0]. A run_once method would avoid this detail and perhaps make it obvious that a normal run involves repetitions. run_once is also ideal in the case where the user just wants the wavefunction.
Given that almost all example code makes a Simulator instance without any parameters, it may also make sense to have just have a cirq.google.simulate_once method?
There is some confusion here.  results[0] is coming from the list of trial results.  If you do run, now, and in the past, you don't get a list of result, you just get a result.  results[0] is when you run_sweep.
I think the solution is that examples should call the right run v run_sweeps call.
There are essentially no calls like results[0].  Maybe this bug was for measurement results?  Or final states?  Closing  for now open if this was about something else.
