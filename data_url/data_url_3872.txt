Debugging using QL_DOUT is impractical because of the amount of (often irrelevant) information generated by code that is not under scrutiny. PR #434 introduces some per file compile time control, but a more flexible mechanism is desired.
PR #404 states this:
Instead of logging macros, move toward using logging objects, that allow scoped specification of loglevels,
allow teeing to files, etc. They may also gather timing information based on users entering and exiting logging
scopes. The pass classes will provide a root object for this, preconfigured using common pass options.
This PR is to first gather ideas on the desired approach
