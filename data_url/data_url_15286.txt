I transpile a circuit for a given provider, say FakeMumbai, with optimization level = 3.
The circuit has mid-measurements.
Before transpiling, it has 2 measurements, while after transpiling it has just 1 measurement.
This may be due to an approximation of a unitary: indeed, one of the measurement provides 1 almost every time.
The error consists in that after the removal of the measurement, output bitstrings are no longer consistent with those of the original circuit. In particular, the first circuit ouputs {'10': 2, '00': 3, '11': 2556, '01': 2439} while the second one {'00': 2542, '01': 2458}.
Run the following code:
Outputs are:
(Sorry for the big circuit attached, I tried to create a smaller one but couldn't replicate the issue)

If '11' and '01' are the most frequent measurements in the first circuit, they should be also the outputs of the second circuit.

Thanks for the report! Could you try this with an updated Terra? The latest version is 0.21.2. It feels like this issue may be the one fixed by #8041, which was released in Terra 0.20.2.
Hi @jakelishman I confirm that the behavior is not replicated in the latest version. Thanks a lot!
