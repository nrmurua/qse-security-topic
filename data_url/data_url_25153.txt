The Covalent CLI tool hangs when the self-hosted dispatcher address and the local server are not started in a certain sequence. We find that the server needs to be started before the self-hosted dispatcher address is set. Furthermore, when the CLI tool is interrupted, we get the following msg in the logs:
Setting the dispatcher address to a self-hosted instance via (while ensuring that the server has not already been started):
and then restarting the local covalent server via: covalent start or covalent start --triggers-only leads the CLI to hang.
Setting the dispatcher address and then starting the server in the Covalent CLI should not lead to freezing.

Hi, I am facing the same issue on local server. Wanted to just set a specific ip address as ususal so that the  gui is accessible in from the network but it freezes.

Hi @sandipde, you can try setting the address via the dispatcher_addr field when calling ct.dispatch. Here's the documentation for setting the dispatcher address without setting it in the config file.
@sandipde if you're using a local server you may also want to set COVALENT_SERVER_IFACE_ANY=1 on that machine before starting the server.  Otherwise it will only be exposed to the local loopback interface.
