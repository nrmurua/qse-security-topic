128bits=ON setting build fails with and without boost:


cmake -DENABLE_COMPLEX8=ON -DENABLE_COMPLEX_X2=ON -DQBCAPPOW=7
@twobombs I jumped on the compilation problem the other morning. That was merged with #519. Please test again.
(For general reference,) I suggest always using the Boost header when available, but otherwise the 128 qubit build uses the gcc unsigned 128 bit integer type, which is commonly available, but not officially part of the standard, and not complete.
Works, with and without boost enabled.
Defaulting to boost-enabled builds now.
