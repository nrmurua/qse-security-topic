The checks are too restrictive. For the collapse and expectation operator lists, previous versions allowed the input of single operators. The documentation also explicitly states this is OK.
Ex.
mesolve(qzero(2), fock(2, 1), [0, 2], destroy(2), sigmaz())
But now this yields the error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/kevinf/PycharmProjects/QutipProjects/test/test.py", line 3, in

for ii in range(len(c_ops)):

It is not so much the safety checks as the order in which a simple single operator is converted internally to a list vs. when the safety checks are run.  This is fixed in #631.
