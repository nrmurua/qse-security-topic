When using jupyter notebook/lab on windows: Can't seem to find qiskit_metal even thought installed and we ran conda from it
Solution:
Works just fine, pyqodeqt, gui, jupyter notebook, jupyter lab, etc. runs fine.
Just followed standard install with @dennis.wang
For jupyter lab, you may have to add the kernel ipykernel install --user --name myenv
