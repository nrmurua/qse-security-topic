Greetings!
In file https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/algorithms/06_grover.ipynb there is some misinformation

But actually I can observe only two qbits and no X or H gates at all, which leads to misunderstanding. I've found version with appropriate picture from some previous commit:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/35ff38c7ffe004bf4f5f1f2e964feb4c88d32b58/tutorials/algorithms/07_grover.ipynb
Could you please check and fix it to prevent misunderstandings in future? Thanks!
HI @daniil-lyakhov I can take this, and update the doc. Can you please assign it to me?
@AshwinKul28 sure, but it looks like I have no access to assign anybody on this issue
HI @daniil-lyakhov, yeah not sure whether is there anyone who is available here to assign issues. I will check with someone.
Hey, Don't wait for issue to be assigned, You can start working on this issue.
The discrepancy came about as the oracle example changed from qiskit.aqua.components.oracles to qiskit.circuit.library.phase_oracle.
The previous LogicalExpressionOracle code snippet was using a bit-flip oracle and converting it to a phase-flip while PhaseOracle is already a 2-qubit phase-flip oracle, leading to the inconsistencies in the paragraph below:
Instead of changing the graph, raised #1304 to correct the paragraph, keeping the note on bit-flip "sandwiching" as it was referenced to above in the notebook.
