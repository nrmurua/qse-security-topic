In picnic3_simulate.c.i a return code is set by branching on the output of "timingsafe_bcmp".
The name "timingsafe_bcmp" suggests to me that ret should be set using a constant time arithmetic expression instead, but I'd appreciate a review from someone familiar with the Picnic code.

I forwarded this to the picnic devs; waiting for review.
This compare does not need to be constant time as it does not leak bits of the secret key. The if is there as a safeguard to ensure we do not break signing when working on the code and for debugging (see https://github.com/IAIK/Picnic/blob/master/picnic3_simulate.c.i#L44). I'll add a comment and some TIMECOP annotations for this part of the to make this clear.
