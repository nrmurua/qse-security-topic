When trying to bind an integer for a circuit.Parameter() into a qiskit.pulse.library.Waveform(), the parameter needs to be casted into a float, then into an integer before it can be bound.

def gs_pulse(duration):
duration = int(float(duration)) # hacky solution needed ATM... TODO?
return qiskit.pulse.library.GaussianSquare(duration,0.5,64,64)
def random_2q_gate(x):
sched = qiskit.pulse.Schedule()
sched = sched.insert(0,Play(gs_pulse(x), DriveChannel(1)))
return sched
my_random_2q_gate = ParameterizedSchedule(random_2q_gate, parameters=['x'])
binding a parameter should maintain the datatype through to the parameterExpression
Talk to @lcapelluto , @taalexander , or #4940
@lcapelluto Is the problem here that if you bind a ParameterExpression to an int value, it currently can only be cast to a float? It seems like it'd be fairly simple to add an additional casting operator to ParameterExpression to support ints. I'll give a quick PR a shot.
Actually, I may roll it into #4940
@ehchen Take a look at #4940 ðŸ™‚ . Specifically this commit.
On second thought, this feels pretty isolated from that PR, so I'm going to do it as a separate PR.
