Im new to Quantum computing, Im trying to execute decomposition of the Toffoli gate can you please help me with how to decompose a n bit Toffoli gate or 2bit controlled qubit Toffoli gate with the code
Hi,
here is the most basic example below: we run a circuit with one Toffoli gate that we decompose via the restrictedgateset setup.
If you would like to adapt it to a n bit Toffoli gate you just have to use the 'with Control' statement:
https://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projectq.meta.html#projectq.meta.Control 
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
 in 
25 circuit(Meng) #run the circuit defined above
26 for cmd in Dummy.received_commands:
---> 27     print(cmd.to_string(symbols=True)) #display the decomposed circuit
AttributeError: 'Command' object has no attribute 'to_string'
The 'to_string()' function was implemented in the last commit. You can just replace with the str() function:
This should not be an issue in the current version of ProjectQ anymore. Closing this issue.
