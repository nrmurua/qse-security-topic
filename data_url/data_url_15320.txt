Similar failure to #8676
Using this script attempt pip install qiskit-terra on a fresh LinuxONE instance of RHEL 8.4
Should build. Did so before as recently as 2022-07-22.
@mtreinish !!
This turns out to be that suddenly python39-scipy package has to be installed via dnf before attempting to install qiskit.
Not sure what changed, but there it is!
