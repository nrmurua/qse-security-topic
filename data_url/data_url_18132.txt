test/performance/state_tomography.py does not run with qiskit 0.5 because local_qasm_simulator of qiskit 0.5 does not return statevector with shot=1.
The changelog of 0.5 says that "Simulators no longer return wavefunction by setting shots=1. Instead, use the local_statevector_simulator, or explicitly ask for snapshot."
local_statevector_simulator does not work for this script because local_statevector_simulator does not support measure and the script put measure in the circuit.
