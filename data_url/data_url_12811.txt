When I executed exercises on jupyter notebook. these error shows.
I tested SingleQubitGates.ipynb and MultiQubitSystems.ipynb
Both of qubit examples could not run test codes and show this error below.
My environments:
I tried these steps.
Open SingleQubitGates.ipynb
Run %package Microsoft.Quantum.Katas::0.10.1911.1607 before test exercises.
The other way, I wrote code into Tasks.qs file using Visual Studio Code.
And run dotnet test on terminal.
It tests normally and success all tests.
Could you let me know how run exercise tests on jupyter notebook?
This is odd, looks like you're doing all the right steps, but this should not give you this kind of error... We will investigate and might ask you for more information (I couldn't reproduce this behavior so far).
Meanwhile, you can use Binder to do the tutorial exercises online: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/master?filepath=index.ipynb
@tcNickolas Thank you for informations.
I tried online tutorial you mentioned, it works well.
It is only fails on Q# text codes start with %kata T1_Some_Test_Names_XXX on my Mac.
Meanwhile, another exercise(e.g.  Complex arithmetic and Linear algebra) without Q# runs and tests well on my Mac.
And example code of PauliGates_Demo Q# operation runs and works well on jupyter notebook.
I use MacOS 10.15.2, Python 3.6.10 and .Net core 3.0.100.
Could you let me know check point about setup and runs?
Here are some steps that might provide more information:
@tcNickolas Thanks for reply
I check versions of installed packages, and debug informations.
But it is hard to find errors. Package infos and debug logs are below.
Hi @ivorycirrus , are you using JupyterLab by any chance?
There is a known problem with JupyterLab and the IQ# kernel (see microsoft/iqsharp#34).
Which version of Jupyter are you using?
@anpaz-msft Thank you for helping me.
I didn't modify jupyterLab, but I haven't install before. I guess Anaconda environments are binding  jupyterLab on its base envs.
So, I re-install jupyterLab 1.2.4 from pip repository.
And It works well all of Q# code with testing.
Thank you all, @tcNickolas , @anpaz-msft .
For the record, I just got this same error when using IQ# without Jupyter Lab, with normal jupyter notebook execution. The reason was the leftover build artifacts from building on a previous version of Q#; once I removed bin and obj folders and restarted the notebook, the error disappeared.
Thanks @tcNickolas, that solution just worked for me, too.
Thanks @tcNickolas, I also had the same problem and when I removed the ./tutorials/SingleQubitGates/obj folder and restarted the notebook, it fixed the issue.
Thanks @tcNickolas. I had the same issue and deleting the two folders worked.
