The expectation_value method of Statevector and DensityMatrix returns the incorrect value for a Pauli or SparsePauliOp operator if non-trivial qargs are used.
Compare the expectation value for a Pauli op to Pauli.to_matrix() computed via the Operator method.
The operator and Pauli methods should be equal for equivalent operators.
This is because the qargs are not used in the internal pauli expval function
