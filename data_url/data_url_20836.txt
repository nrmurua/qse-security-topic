Since we have NIST KAT checks, we can remove our custom testvector check, I think. Any objections?
Briefly came up in #110; I have no objections.
For signatures, the NIST KAT does not have a way of checking the detached signature API.
Good point... should I remove it just for KEMs?
Yeah, I think that's the best situation we could hope for.
Fixed by #161.
