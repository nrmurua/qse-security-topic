Vrtual device scheduler fails to run kernel code with relative path. https://forum.m-labs.hk/d/530-submit-experiments-using-virtual-device-scheduler
Experiment runs without errors and prints both test and test from kernel.
Appears that it fails to locate the source with the  relative path used. Absolute path works normally.
