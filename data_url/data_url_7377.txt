I have something like this implemented in a small tutorial. Basically one has to use a flag which tells whether it should be checked or not. This doesn't avoid the code branching, i.e., the checking is still there, but AFAIK, you cannot do the way @inbounds does yet.
Now it should be good to go. Whenever one thinks that an expression is used for checking the hilbert spaces (known as "basis" in QuantumOptics.jl) one should annotate it with @hilbertcheck.
Just use @inhilbert to avoid the checkings.
Inspired by https://discourse.julialang.org/t/generalizing-bounds-checking/4704
The latest master branch has this feature now. Thanks for the help @i-apellaniz
