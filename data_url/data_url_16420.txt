AerPauliExpectation.compute_variance returns zero variance as the comment said.
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.aqua.operators.expectations.AerPauliExpectation.compute_variance.html
However, AerPauliExpectation has a finite (=non-zero) variance in general. In SnapshotExpectationValue used here,  an optional argument of variance is True. It seems that this returns variance computed in Aer.
Which variance do you mean exactly?
As far as I know, the variance argument in the SnapshotExpectationValue does not return an estimator for the sampling noise but only if you add a noise model to the backend. I.e. it cannot be used as a replacement of PauliExpectation.
Yeah, SnapshotExpectationValue returns an expectation value <psi | H psi>. This is not an estimator.
The variance here is
<psi | H^2 psi> - <psi |H psi>^2.
Is this still valid, and if so should it be moved to Terra repo given that opflow has been moved and is being maintained there now? Or  should this be closed?
It's an Aer thing. As commented above, the variance should be equal to 0, since this is not an estimator. But it is perhaps about to change, @chriseclectic should know more.
This will be resolved by usingSaveExpVal in AerPauliExpectation.
Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1101
Closable in Aqua.
Move to Terra and we need to update opflow.AerPauliExpectation after SaveExpVal.
If this issue replaces SnapshotExpectationValue with SaveExpectationValue in AerPauliExpectation, then it will also fix #6504
Close once. Please reopen if you want.
