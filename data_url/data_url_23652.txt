The README.rst claims that some features are broken outside the notebook. Is this still valid? If so, could we document the features?
I also want to ask this question.
I think in general it would be good to update the README.rst. I don't know if anyone feels like volunteering for that, @QCoDeS/core?
related to #839 too
