Running this experiment:
Causes this error:
This only occurs when run is a kernel AND broadcast=True.
Another thing I guess is problematic is RPCing the Notifier mutations.
@sbourdeauducq This is a bug in set_dataset--it ought to always return None, or at least, always return the same type, in order to be a valid RPC.
Yes, I'll change it.
I was trying to try out this fix, and I ran into a problem.  I'm subscribed to only the main m-labs conda channel.  I created a new conda environment following the instructions in the manual today, but it seems that the git commit id of the artiq version that I got is 10 days old:
Should I be subscribed to the dev channel also?
The fix will be available in the next release (1.0rc2). The dev channel currently has a number of new and serious bugs.
