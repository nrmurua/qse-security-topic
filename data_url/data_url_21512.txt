AFAICT, the Sampler coredevice machine units to voltage conversion function is not correct for the current hardware revision.
It looks like the Sampler coredevice driver hasn't been updated since May 2018. Back then the ADC FS corresponded to +-10V.
Because of sinara-hw/Sampler#3 we changed the reference to make the ADC FS actually +-10.24V in the current 2.2 release (sinara-hw/Sampler@8c1bd3e).
As a result, the ADC to mu conversion gain is incorrect by about 2.5%
We should implement a backwards compatible fix for this.
@hartytp are the majority of samplers  ADC FS +-10.24V as for now?
The original Sampler bazed on LTC2335 was using 5V reference and simple x1/10/100/1000 gain stage.
We switched immediately to LTC2320 which is using 4.096V reference and additional driver stage with gain of   1/2.5 (differential)
So the actual range is 2.5*4.096 which is +/-10.24V
