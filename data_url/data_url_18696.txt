It would be helpful if errors in {lexing, parsing, compiling} Quil could be assigned to a particular bad point in the input. Threading at least the line number through the output of the parser would enable this kind of error emission.
In the current arrangement, these would go into the TOKEN objects. Line numbers would have to be specially dealt with since the current tokenizer is line-based (cf. #93).
