Qiskit Metal presently has the functionality to natively render QGeometries in Ansys. However, to make the full superconducting quantum hardware design pipeline open-source, it is essential to have the capability to render the design into an open-source rendering and meshing software, to be able to perform the EM simulations using open-source FEM solvers.
Gmsh sis a very versatile software which can handle constructive geometry ideology that Qiskit Metal already uses using the shapely library for the MetalGUI, and has capability to render and mesh the geometries in 3D, and will be a very good option to increase the flexibility of Qiskit Metal to interface with many other open-source (and even proprietary) FEM solver software platforms.
To provide an alternative and free FEM solver backend for performing EM simulations necessary for quantum hardware design, which would increase the reach of Qiskit Metal further to academic and research use-cases.
