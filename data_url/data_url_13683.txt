All the links in the first section of the docs (the one based on the README.md file) don't work properly.
@nathanshammah  Since the first section is an html rendering of the README.md file, I think that this issue can be fixed only after the documentation will have a public url.  Just for the scope of the workshop(s), I think it would be good to fix the README of your forked repo, adding links to the temporary documentation (https://nathanshammah.github.io/mitiq/build/html/index.html) .
I am happy to do this, but I don't have permissions to access to your private fork.
@andreamari it looks like all internal links linking to other pages are broken. This seems to be due to the trick used to have ~github.io/mitiq take us to build/html. The best thing to solve this may be just to forget about the whole build/html structure and dump all of the docs/build/html/ content directly into docs/. If you think you've got a better get around let me know, otherwise I can take care of this. Related comments or other workarounds may be present in this thread, sphinx-doc/sphinx#3382.
I am on it, @andreamari.
I am listing here the to-do list and marking it as I fix it:
In the README page:
In the guide pages:
In the README contributing to mitiq guide:
Great, thanks!
I tested the new guide https://nathanshammah.github.io/mitiq/index.html and everything seems to be ok.
I think we can close this issue.
I'll reopen this, as the fixes where tailored for the html of v. 0.1a1 of my personal fork, but they need to be implemented in this repo.
Most (but not all) of these broken links issues are mainly due to the fact that,  with the m2r extension, we are porting md files that can also be visualized on Github. The links in md are thought to work in the website.
As @andreamari pointed out, a workaround could be obtained once we opne source the repository, as all links in the md files (contributing, readme, etc.) will point to the Github website. In that case, if one is reading the docs from a local html build or from readthedocs, it will be taken to the relative Github page.
I will address some of the other broken links as in the 00 guide (not updated filenames) in another PR.
