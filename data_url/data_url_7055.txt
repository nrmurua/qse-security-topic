This would be the same display that shows at the end of the circuit, except that it needs to have some kind of fall-back error case for when the state is mixed or entangled.
It could be a 'sampled pure state' display. Showing one of the possible pure states. This would be probably be confusing and unhelpful and annoying to compute.
It could show an 'Entangled' error.
For measured states, a 'Deferring Measurement' explanation needs to appear.
