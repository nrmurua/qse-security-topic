This issue can be closed once we have a MEP/RFC for implementing Dynamical Decoupling (DD).
The document can drafted in the form of a shared google document and linked as a comment in the main issue related to DD #822.
For an example and a template, see the RFC linked  in #821.
Shared Google document on dynamical decoupling:

Note: The old doc by @andreamari is superseded since its content now merged into the doc by @Aaron-Robertson linked above.
Here's the draft I'd prepared so far @andreamari https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cRwFCTn6kUjI1P0kNydtevxIYtE4r8Omd_iWK0Pe8qo/edit?usp=sharing
Great @Aaron-Robertson I also shared a document in the description of this issue. Tomorrow we can try to merge things into a unique one.
Sounds good!
Per our offline conversation I updated the link I provided to merge yours in and do some cleanup on content order. Edits are welcome!
This will be accepted Tuesday Mar 2 unless there are further comments/blockers.
Thanks @crazy4pi314, I thought the correct date was today February 22 instead of March 2, such that we could close this issue before the release which is planned for next Friday.
I noticed the date mismatch only now, so I propose we shift the "acceptance-unless-blockers-day" to tomorrow February 23.
@andreamari sorry! I was looking at the calendar during the meeting and got the current date wrong... Tomorrow is great üëç
Discussed and accepted! Thanks @andreamari and @Aaron-Robertson for the proposal üéâ
Great work everyone for feedback and especially @Aaron-Robertson and @andreamari. Looking forward to begin prototyping this from the next Milestone.
