After merging #773, review the qiskit.Result API to ensure it offers all the necessary now there is a new, more-powerful result format.
Reviving this issue after closing #1023 and marking it as discussion, invoking @jaygambetta and others!
From the mentioned issue and conversations, it would be great if we could "stabilize" the Result "API" along with the upcoming releases - deciding which methods are to be deprecated, which ones stay, which ones need to be added, and a timeline for the changes:
An alternative hinted by @delapuente is to make use of View or Browser objects that provide "richer" views of a base object.
i agree with changing get_* to just *.
After internal conversation with Jay, here is a summary of the changes:
(1) this was decided seeing that it was not used by the tests, and that it had not so clear semantics (as in, users can access result.results directly). They can be reintroduced if needed.
(2) already tacked in #1351, reintroduced as qiskit.quantum_info.analyzation
There are also some still to be decided issues:
After #1360, updated the table below - the consensus is that the get_xxx methods will imply that some preprocessing might be applied to their return values (most notably, get_counts will have its keys in the right format, not hex), and get_data will be renamed to data, signalling that it will contain the raw information.
