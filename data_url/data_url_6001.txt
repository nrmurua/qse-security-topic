Some of the standard tests that have been fixed in #765 are failing on Windows for the matrix product state simulation method.
The failures all appear to be due to SVD errors ERROR: error: wrong SVD calc: A != USV* (likely due to lack of quad precision on windows).
The specific tests failure are related to CX, CZ, CCX, CSWap gates and grovers test:
where test circuits are counted from 0.
Run tests in Azure CI
Tests pass
Investigate the validation of SVD, maybe we are checking with too tight a tolerance?
For now I will need to add skips to these tests until they can be fixed, but this issue can be used to track which tests were skipped.
Fixed in #809
