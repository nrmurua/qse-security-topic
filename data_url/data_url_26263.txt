Hi! Is there a way to install toqito as an editable program. Something along the lines of
Thanks in advance!
Hi @paniash,
Thank you for the question. Truth be told, I've never used the -e option when running pip install. My initial, and perhaps naive thought process, is that this should be natively accessible for any package on the PyPi server.
I'm also curious about the use case for installing as an editable program. I think it would be preferable to simply pull down a branch of the project and edit this branch as need be for any local changes you wish to make. I could be oversimplifying things here as well though. Hope that makes some semblance of sense!
@vprusso Sorry for the late response. With pip install -e ., any local changes I make are instantly reflected when executing code (atleast that's how qiskit contributions work). Perhaps this isn't required in toqito's case. Feel free to correct me, I still pretty new to python's package management (coming from a C background).
@paniash. Gotcha. I wasn't aware of this pip flag before, so I did a bit of reading on it after your comment. I wasn't able to stumble on a use case where the alternative of cloning and making changes that way would be any different. Of course, this could just be a blind spot on my part, which is likely.
The internal of Qiskit perhaps lend themselves better to this option for one reason or another? Again, I'm doing a bit of guessing here. In the meantime though, I may close this issue for now if that's okay with you. Thanks for the added context.
@vprusso Qiskit probably uses some Cython stuff in aer, so I guess that requires some sort of compilation. I'm guessing here as well haha.
