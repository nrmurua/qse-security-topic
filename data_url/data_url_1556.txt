Description of the issue
Creating a Measurement Gate with a measurement key produces a non-string, making it unprintable.
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
0.11.0
Branched off of 58cda7a
For what it's worth, the snippets you posted don't break on Cirq's mainline branch:
You do have to provide a non-empty measurement key on the most recent release of Cirq though:
@tanujkhattar @smitsanghavi , should these changes have been deprecated instead?
It looks like there was an actual bug in the first version of the implementation of MeasurementKey class, as the class supported passing only string keys and did not check whether the passed key was a measurement key or not. As a result, you ended up with measurement keys of the form key = cirq.MeasurementKey(name = cirq.MeasurementKey(name = 'a'))
This PR fixed the behavior - https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/4086/files#diff-6754ccd16f390263dd1f8a9f6cef03fde56e5d48571de13f2eeb9c08ea623e44R77
I think should add a validate_args check to MeasurementKey class to throw an error whenever the argument is of a type other than str. For eg, even now it's possible to write key = cirq.MeasurementKey(name=[1, 2, 3]), even though name should be an str and not a list.

I believe this behavior was changed in #4445 which does an explicit check for isinstance of string.  Closing.
