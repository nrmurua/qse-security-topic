Move to new org. All branches will be deleted before the move just to make sure we don't forget anything. You won't be able to create branches on the new repo.
@qdev-dk/qcodes-beta @qdev-dk/qcodes start saving things, or closing stale branches.
@giulioungaretti When will this happen? Deleting all branches does not sound good, unless they are merged into master.
If we cannot create branches on the new repo, how will we do development?
@peendebak Forking? As far as I know a fork works pretty much the same as a branch except that you have it coupled to your own (or group) account. It also shows up in the network graph.
@peendebak  it happens when we move to the new org, i.e. 21st. and yes it has to be forking, because it's a public repo.
Unfortunately too many branches have been already created, it is not human to go through all of them, so it's time for the owners to do something. Also deleting is misleading, they just won't be transferred to the new repo!
It will look much like the same for most people, fork and pull requests.
@giulioungaretti Thanks for the clarification, but this does not answer the question: how will development continue in the future (at least it is not clear to me).
Forking is used to create a distinct and separate piece of software (i.e. development on a fork happens independently).
Will there be continued development on the private repo (current org), with periodic updates of the public org?
@lgnjanssen  sorry, I will try again.
Developing will proceed as in most OSS projects, the core developer can commit and create branches on the public repo.
Contributors will fork the public repo if
In the latter case they can contribute back by creating a pull request from their own fork.
Forks are not just that, they separate the ownership and remove the burden of managing branches and permissions.
As @AdriaanRol  said, just think as forks as branches (except you can create your own branches in your fork).
@giulioungaretti Thanks! That makes sense :)
