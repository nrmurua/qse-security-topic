Currently CXPowGate has a special override of on which allows one to pass in control and target when turning into a GateOperation.  It seems like we never followed up to do this for any other gates, and if we are going to do this we shouldn't do it in a one off manner.
At the very least the code can be simplified to def on(self, target, control) instead of the args/kwargs stuff that's there.
I'm fine with deprecating it.
discussed at Cirq Cync: vote was to keep it, but to do it in a way that is not adding this code to every gate.
Discussion from cirq cync: cut this.
