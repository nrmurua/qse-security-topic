According with #4669, it is possible to use $ for activate LaTeX math mode in gate names. However, that triggers an error.
Take the possible example:
This triggers a pdflatex compilation error. However, circ.append(HGate(label="U^a"),[0]) works.
This might be a regression. I think at some point we supported math mode in names. What it should happen is that $ activates it.

The PR you reference is for the MPL drawer, not the LaTeX one.  From a quick scan-through, it looks like we've pretty much always been drawing LaTeX labels in math mode, except wrapped in a \mathrm.  #5855 added the explicit escaping for ^ and _.
We could probably use a similar approach to #4669; escape the name components that are outside the dollar signs, and pass through the inside-dollar-sign bits to LaTeX verbatim.
(I note that in that stackexchange question, the user's gate name isn't valid LaTeX already - _ consumes one single token, but they want it to consume the entire \mathrm{rot}.  They should have written $U_{\mathrm{rot}}$, most likely.)

ups! my bad.

I extended the answer with that clarification, thanks.
