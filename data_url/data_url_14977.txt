This is a stretch goal for the full implementation of the initial classical-expression RFC.  This is the tracking issue for "PR 5" - the builder interface as described by that document.  See further details within it.
This is not needed for Terra 0.25, but some variant of it will be needed longer term to make constructing these classical expressions more convenient for users.
I think for now I'll close this issue, because the way we split the tree representation vs the user constructors is already decently friendly, and we've no immediate plans to design and then work on a new interface.
