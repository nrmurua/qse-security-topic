This issue emerged from some questions on Discord.
When using mitiq.cdr.execute_with_cdr() with a Clifford circuit produces the errir:
ValueError: Circuit is already Clifford. 
on the other hand, it may be more useful to return the mitigated result
which, in this case, is the exact classical simulation.
If the input circuit is Clifford we could return the exact classically simulated expectation value.
I can add this feature. Are there any recommended papers/sources I ought to consult before giving this a go?
Standard references on CDR are Refs. [3,11]  (together with the Mitiq white paper) and references therein.
I have two possible solutions but I could use some feedback:
and
and I'm not sure why the warning is being raised. The correct answer (the classical simulation expectation value) is still calculated. A hacky fix is to suppress the specific warning.
+1 for the second option.
If the circuit is Clifford, CDR should not waste quantum and classical computation for training but directly return the exact result.
