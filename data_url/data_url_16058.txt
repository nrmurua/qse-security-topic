As a consequence, it is not possible to do this:
This happens because two reasons:
Or
Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but it seems to me that your second reason
The second reason is because there is reset inside initialize
is a deal breaker. The reset is not invertible, so the initialization can't be invertible. Probably an attempt to invert it should raise an error.
I agree, ideally it should raise an error clearly stating that it isn't allowed to invert the Initialize instruction if it contains resets.
After discussion, there is consensus that Initialize should continue being an instruction and non-invertible. The possibility of adding a qc.initialize(..., with_reset=False) was discarded as would make the instruction "undefined" when the reset is not in placed.
The exception raised by state_vec = (~StateFn(op) @ StateFn(qc)).eval() should be solved at that level.
Therefore, this issue is being closed.
