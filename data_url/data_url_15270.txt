See title.
It should work (??)
This can be fixed by checking the type of the coefficients in the list. However, this incurs some overhead. So I'm actually not sure whether this behavior is intentional. @ikko
This is a spec. The default dtype is complex, so if you want to use other dtypes, you need to set it explicitly.
works.
It should be documented.
I would actually also expect @kevinsung's example to work, it seems unintuitive if we have to wrap the coefficients in an array -- and that wouldn't work if I used from_list or from_sparse_list, right?
Is there an overhead to allowing Parameters directly or could we add that efficiently?
The overhead would be iterating through the list and checking the type of the elements.
An alternative to making the user wrap the coefficients in an array would be to allow them to specify the dtype. That may be slightly easier to discover.
Linking #8896 where this was also discussed. Personally, I would be in favor of supporting Parameters as they pretty much native numeric types in Qiskit and it would make life of users easier if one doesn't have to remember to explicitly set dtype=object.
This works since #8896.
