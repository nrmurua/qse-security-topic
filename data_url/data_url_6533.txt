Inside of qtrajectory there is:
Which doesn't allow the user to choose anything other than the number of threads they would like to supply to whatever comes out of formux.h. Could this behavior be changed to support TFQ so that a user could pass in their own For implementation @sergeisakov , @95-martin-orion ? Is there a way around this that I might be missing ?
This is a good point. Thanks for catching that. Yes, there is a way around.
However, this solution is not very good. I'll fix the code to support TFQ in a cleaner way.
