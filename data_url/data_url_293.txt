Kernels created by the cudaq::kernel_builder class can't be translated to OpenQASM by cudaq-translate. This is because they don't contain any function with the cudaq-entrypoint attribute.
Compile the following code using nvq++ kernel.cpp:
The result is the following MLIR code:
When the file is translated using cudaq-translate --convert-to=openqasm kernel.qke, the output is
The output of the C++ program should be:
Which will then be translated to:
Not a regression
I think this can be fixed by using the code from the jitCode() method in the to_quake() method.

The above suggestion should work. Would you like to issue a PR?

I might be able to issue a PR next week. If that works with your schedule, I'll do it.
