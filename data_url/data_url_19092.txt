I tried to modify the simple_state_to_state notebook  to perform gate optimization with the goal of $sigma_y$ gate. But apparently, the optimization unable to effect any change in the cost function.
So inspired by this code block in the arXiv paper associated with the package.

I modified this code cell in simple_state_to_state notebook
 to this.

Unfortunately, that completely stopped krotov optimization from progressing further.

Can you upload your notebook as a gist and link it here?
Here is the gist.
If there's a problem rendering the gist as I have,  you can copy the URL into https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.
I'm quite sure this is a controllability issue (the Y gate you are asking for cannot physically be realized). You can optimize for an X gate instead and use the square-modulus functional, see https://gist.github.com/goerz/d62fcabc2f2d3e97dd0cc32a115227d0.
In general, if in doubt, you should do a controllability analysis before running an optimization, see Chapter 3 of the book D'Allesandro - Introduction to Quantum Control and Dynamics, or section 2.3.3 of my PhD thesis for the one-page summary.
I'll close this since it doesn't look like a bug in krotov, but we can reopen if I'm wrong.
Thank you, Dr @goerz. I will look into it.
Dear Dr @goerz, I have thought further about this issue and these are my thoughts. Please let me know what are your comments.

I am sorry for wasting your time. But, even after thinking a lot, I am unable to resolve this vexing issue by myself.
