The tests
fail with the Intel compiler version 18 as well as 19. The issue seems to be related to DBCSR and is persisting since a while. It is not clear if this is a compiler bug or a cp2k/dbcsr problem.
Same for the CCE test...
Actually, it is not strictly DBCSR related, rather cp_dbcsr...
It errors happens at this line:

with message
A pointer passed to DEALLOCATE points to an object that cannot be deallocated
Concerning the other failing tests on mini-arch, the tests are not protected when libint is not available...
One case (HF_ec_field.inp), however, shows a deeper trace into DBCSR:
The problem it seems started after this commit: 63f2e15
My guess is that we are looking for blocks that are not available in the particular processor, so the pointer is somehow null. I can think something wrong with the distribution...
In DBCSR it is possible to add a check for that, but still, the problem is elsewhere...
Is this issue still relevant?
I think that was fixed indeed by #761.
Fixed, see #761.
