BackendV2 objects return a CouplingMap object as the coupling_map.  The old list-based coupling_map allowed for simple iteration, such as:
It would be nice if this same behavior could be done using CouplingMap objects.  Currently one gets:
TypeError: 'CouplingMap' object is not iterable
There's .get_edges (or edge_list or something) on it.
It also does not present any difficulty to give easier access to the primary data for CouplingMap in an easy manner, and solve issues like #8865 at the same time.
That's fair - I'm not saying we can't add the magic method, just that in the interim, the iterable form does exist.
