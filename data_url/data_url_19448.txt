As discussed, a useful tool to implement in Qibo would be an easy way to invert, or reverse existing circuits.
In several occasions quantum circuits require the inverse of a particular part of the circuit in order to complete the algorithm. This is true, for example, for Shor's algorithm as well as most Grover based algorithms including Amplitude Estimation.
A quick way of getting a circuit you have already created and get its inverse would help circuit design. This would require applying the dagger of all gates of the initial circuit in reverse order.
Thanks for reporting this. So you would like a method which reverses the current circuit or returns a new circuit?
Maybe it is better to return a new circuit, as this is normally used to add it into the main circuit.
I started looking at this yesterday, I agree that returning a new circuit is convenient as one can create the total circuit by adding the original + any other gates + inverse.
Implementation of this should be easy, I just think we need to add a dagger method to all gates. I will try to propose something for this later today.
