Classical Register Subscripting Error Code raises an error for the final two lines of code:
It is not necessarily apparent to a user that the variable they have provided is not a classical register, and that it needs to be subscripted.
Quantum Register Subscripting Error Code raises the following error for the final line of code when addressing a single qubit quantum register:
Having experience with various quantum programming APIs, we fell into the trap of omitting the [0] subscript. This was not apparent from the error message.
Recommend clearer error messages for these specific common API usage mistakes.
I would love to fix this as my first issue, could anyone tell me please how could I?
@ajavadia if it's not impolite from my side, could you please help me dealing with this as the "good first issue"?
I've tried to solve this in #1330 .
@Exferro what kind of help did you need? How did you start with the problem?
@Exferro sorry I just saw your comment here. Looks like @lukasszz took care of this issue. If you still would like to contribute, please feel free to take up another issue and ask if you need any help.
@lukasszz Thank you for your question, but I do apologize, I didn't mean that I need some help dealing with issue (it didn't seem to be that hard). Instead, I thought that I had to obtain some kind of "ticket", or discussion, or foreword to start dealing with it since I hadn't previous contributions.
Now I see that it's not necessary and I will be more brave next times)
@ajavadia It's okay, thank you very much, I will try to do my best and cope with another issue indeed)
The error message was fixed in #1330.
And actually after #1643, the particular example in this thread will not throw an error (i.e. it is possible to measure a quantum register into a classical bit, as long as the quanutm register has length 1).
