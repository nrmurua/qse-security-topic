When it is used in a controlling circuit, QuantumCircuit.diagonal() decomposition does not provide global phase as a relative phase, but instead only provides a identity operator. I'm using the latest Qiskit release, i.e. Qiskit 0.20.0. The code example is:
The output statevector corresponds to the case where identity operator is used in CIRCF_1.to_gate(label='DiagGate1')  and CIRCF_2.to_gate(label='DiagGate1'), without applying the global phase as relative phase. The list of diagonal entries in PARAM1 and PARAM2 does not affect the output in any way, i.e. the output statevector is always in form:
Is there any way to keep the global phase when the .diagonal decomposition is used in controlling circuit?
Thanks.
