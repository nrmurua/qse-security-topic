Is it possible to create a Hamiltonian which has continuous operators such as spatial differential operator? Perhaps this would be done using Sympy in some way?
Not really.  That would probably be handled better in the position (phase) basis rather than the number state basis as used in Qutip.
Thank you for the reply.
