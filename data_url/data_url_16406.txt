I wrote a simple program to get the output
when I check the result I just get the  statevector output and the bloch sphere output but not the Circut diagram( qc.draw() )
But when i just do the below it works fine :
My request is qc.draw() can be mentioned in any part of the code and it should show the Quantum circuit and then the result
The draw method without any arguments returns a string representing the circuit. If you want to display the string, you have to print it:
About the second code snippet: Did you run this in a Jupyter notebook? If yes, the output of the last line is implicitly shown as output, which is why in the second code example you see a circuit.
It does work if you replace it with print(qc.draw())
The error is occurring mainly due to the attempt of plotting multiple plots after the execution of the same code cell block and yes as @Cryoris suggested use the print() method to get the required results.
@abhishekengg24 Feel free to re-open if you think we're missing something here.
