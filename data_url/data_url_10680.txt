Description
If a user sets a too-high value for cutoff so all variables are isolated, one random variable should be submitted to the child sampler. But I get a KeyError on FrozenSet.
This part of the code:
doesn't execute new[term] = original[term] because
To Reproduce
Expected behavior
Should extract a variable from the original poly

Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here.
Hmm, this is easy enough to fix, but now I don't remember why we still sent one variable to the child sampler rather than just sending an empty binary polynomial? @conta877 do you remember?
Nevermind, I see why. It's because the other variables are added back in relative to the problem sent to the system, so we need one to start that process.
