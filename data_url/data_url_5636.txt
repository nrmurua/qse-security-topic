When trying to run the VQE tutorial, it works on qiskit aer cpu, 0.12.0. It fails on qiskit-aer-gpu 0.11.2
There is no version 0.12 for gpu on pypi.
run the vqe tutorial with qiskit aer gpu.
that the versions will match
update qiskit-aer-gpu.
We have now trouble to release qiskit-aer-gpu. CUDA 12 makes sizes of wheels exceed cap of PyPI and CUDA 11 is too old in a docker for Github actions. Please build from sources until we can provide alternative.
Hi! which version of qiskit do you recommend to use with the current aer-gpu? I updated qiskit and it crashes aer-gpu.
#1854 will add support of cuda 12.
@contepablod
qiskit-aer with GPU needs to run with the latest release of qiskit. Could you create a new issue if you encountered an error?
@hhorii Thanks! I'll try it out.
qiskit-aer-gpu is now in PyPI: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/releases/tag/0.12.2, and it will help running your VQE applications.
