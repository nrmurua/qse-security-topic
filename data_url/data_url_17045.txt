Before starting with a drawing change, I would like to ask for opinions on how. Let's take the text drawer as is the more restrictive one. The rest might be easier.
Considering the following custom instruction:
It would be possible to control on q_1 and have a classical condition c == 2. How to would be a proper way to draw that? I brainstormed this with @ismaelfaro and we come up with some options:
Option 1:
Option 2:
Option 3:
Any other idea?
3rd option is clear, the 1st and 2st one are more representative.
The control is good where you've drawn it.
I think it's better to show the acting qubits (0, 1) inside the box not outside.
I don't understand the classical condition. You have a custom instruction which encompasses q0, q1, c0, c1 and you want to condition it on c0, c1? This seems like a weird scenario, and a bit outside the circuit model, it should be drawn more like a control flow. But if it has to be drawn in a circuit, I think the "read" part should be drawn before the "write" part, so option 3.
The custom instruction parameters are c[1] and q[0].
Option 3 it is!
