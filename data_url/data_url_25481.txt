The custom executor template suggests using a helper function that deserializes an electron's output. This is an antipattern and should be discouraged.  Since the Covalent server's environment cannot generally expect to satisfy a specific workflow's dependencies, executor plugin writers should not deserialize electron outputs in the server's process via TransportableObject.get_deserialized()
