The MQPUTester.checkSimple and MQPUTester.checkLarge tests are intermittently failing for me in at least one test environment w/ A100's. When they fail, they produce errors like this:
checkSimple Case 1:
checkSimple Case 2:
checkLarge Case 1:
checkLarge Case 2:
The bug has been reproduced in the 0.4.0 release and the main branch.
Or
No unit test failures
Not a regression
No suggestions yet ... just documenting for now.
