Hello @rizzeeb I have tried running the code in the README locally and it works for me. Do you have Qiskit Aer installed?
I think @rizzeeb is right here. Terra should not depend on Aer (that's why BasicAer) exists, and this example is clearly a getting-started guide for Terra, not all of Qiskit.
It might also be worth updating the Qiskit website as this has the same code snippet on it.
The guide asks users to install qiskit using pip install qiskit, and that includes Aer. So the dependency on Aer is fine. However, since this is a first program in qiskit-terra, which includes BasicAer, it's probably a good idea to keep the reference to BasicAer in this particular readme.
pip install qiskit should come with Aer on most of the platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux). There's a known problem with Windows + Miniconda3 + Python 3.7  though, but otherwise, it should just work.
