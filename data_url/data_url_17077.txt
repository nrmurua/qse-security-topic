The pass NoiseAdaptiveLayout makes a layout choice based on the error of the backend. However, this is not testable with out Mock backends because the FakeBackend class sets the gate_error to 0.0  (qiskit/test/mock.py, around line 129):
It would be great if, in a deterministic way, we could set some error value (not in a direct relation, so NoiseAdaptiveLayout would be different from TrivialLayout). Something like "value": 1/(pair[0]+pair[1]) or similar.
Hi there! I'm interested in this issue. Just wanted to know if you could elaborate more on the way you wanted to fix the issue or if it could be done in the same (or similar) way the  test for NoiseAdaptiveLayout currently does it ( where value in parameters can just be the ro_errors in the test).
Some preset passmanagers use NoiseAdaptiveLayout. It's hard to know that they layout selection was correct if NoiseAdaptiveLayout is non-distinguishable of TrivialLayout. Adding hardcore errors in all the backends is an option.
I've got a work in progress for this. I am taking a snapshot of each backend from real calibration data and hardcoding it.
Ah alright, thank you for informing! will look into other issues then.
