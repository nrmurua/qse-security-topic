I am trying to run the Pytket AerBackend, and it requires importing :
from pytket.extensions.qiskit import AerBackend
However, when I run this I get the following error :
Traceback (most recent call last): Cell In[53], line 1 from pytket.extensions.qiskit import AerBackend File /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytket/extensions/qiskit/__init__.py:18 from .backends import ( File /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytket/extensions/qiskit/backends/__init__.py:16 from .ibm import IBMQBackend, NoIBMQCredentialsError File /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pytket/extensions/qiskit/backends/ibm.py:37 from qiskit.primitives import SamplerResult  # type: ignore File /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qiskit/primitives/__init__.py:55 from .base import BaseEstimator File /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qiskit/primitives/base/__init__.py:17 from .base_estimator import BaseEstimator File /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qiskit/primitives/base/base_estimator.py:95 from ..utils import init_observable File /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qiskit/primitives/utils.py:25 from qiskit.circuit.library.data_preparation import Initialize ImportError: cannot import name 'Initialize' from 'qiskit.circuit.library.data_preparation' (/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qiskit/circuit/library/data_preparation/__init__.py)
Just run :
from pytket.extensions.qiskit import AerBackend 
Well it should pass this, and allow for running the pytket code.
I ran this, and it didn't give an issue, but I can't use this as I still need this to be fixed through the package or pytket import won't work :
from qiskit.circuit.library.data_preparation.initializer import Initialize
I'm not able to reproduce this error using qiskit==0.45.1 and pytket-qiskit==0.47.0. Does the plain import
work for you? If not you might not be using 0.45.1.
Initialize is definitely importable in Qiskit 0.45 from both qiskit.circuit.library and qiskit.circuit.library.data_preparation, so you shouldn't need the over specific import.  It's possible that your Python environment is a bit messed up somehow - your error message suggests that everything is installed in the global site-packages, and not in a virtual environment (conda or otherwise).
I'd recommend using conda (since you're using that) to create virtual environments for different tasks; it's much easier to verify that your environment is sound in those cases.
Similar to Julien, I can't reproduce this is in a fresh environment initialised with pip install pytket-qiskit.
I am using IBM Quantum Lab. I can try to make a virtual env externally, I usually just use the notebook online and it's never had any issues to be honest.

This works. The one that has the issue doesn't.
It's alright, I'll try to create a virtual env using conda. If the issue persists there I'll reopen this issue.
Thank you for the prompt response and kind support. Please feel free to close this for now if you wish.
