I am using qutip 5.0.
When I use mesolve, the output always displays the running time and total run time of the calculation, and I am wondering if there's anyway to disable showing these?
The progress bar control in now in the options: mesolve(..., options={'progress_bar': False}).
Any of ["", None, False] will not display the time.
