The latest version of the qvm seems to be not applying Kraus operators during density matrix simulations.
With qvm 1.9.0, the script below gives [0.6222487943248762]. However with qvm 1.17.1 and 1.15.3 it gives [-1.0], which is what you'd expect in the absence of noise.
@kilimanjaro maybe you can take a peek?
