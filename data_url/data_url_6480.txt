Minimal reproducer:
Traceback:
When I inspected the object associated with the global phase operator, I got something like cirq.MatrixGate(np.array([[(6.123233995736766e-17-1j)]], dtype=np.complex128)).on().
The same circuit works just fine on cirq.Simulator.

The error is being raised from this method:

@sergeisakov, is there a simple way to add this support? My first thought is to just add case 0: to the switch, but I get the feeling that a no-qubit gate may run into problems elsewhere.
Yes, I think there should be a relatively simple way to add this support. I will do that next week.
Bump. @sergeisakov any update on this?
#579 should fix this issue.
