Using 1.1 on windows, is there an easy way of changing the order of applets on the gui, or to insert a new applet after a specific applet instead of at the end?
No, there is not.
This is in the next contract:
"in the dashboard, creating applet groups, renaming groups, moving applets from one group to another (drag-and-drop)."
Including moving applets within a group?
It's not there, but it's probably efficient to do it at the same time as we implement this. I'll see what I can do.
