Since update to qiskit 0.19.5, I get this error:
Fresh python environment with
Start python and issue
to get the above error.
The same line works with qiskit 0.19.4.
This is a duplicate of #429 and the fixes for it have been merged and backported and will be fixed in the pending ignis 0.3.3 release and 0.19.6 qiskit metapackage release (which I'll be pushing out today). I'm going to close this issue for now please feel free to reopen if I'm missing something
Just circling back here to say that qiskit-ignis 0.3.3 and the qiskit metapackage 0.19.6 have been released and are up on pypi now so if you upgrade it should work fine now.
I confirm that it works now. Thanks!
