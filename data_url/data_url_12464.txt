As others have noted, I'm unable to install Tensorflow Quantum using Pip (i.e. Pip isn't able to find it). A seeming work-around has been to install tfq-nightly, however, when I do, I get a memory allocation error on import. This seems to be a consistent issue as it's persisted over a couple of weeks â€“ it does not seem related to a specific nightly build.
Any ideas on work-arounds or how I could get this resolved would be very helpful.

Admittedly, these attempts haven't been particularly methodical...nor have they done anything to resolve the issue.
Using python 3.9 I replicated your error. However, I have always fixed it simply by using python 3.8 instead (just checked again and it worked for me). This is on a 2019 MBP 2.4 GHz intel core i9, Monterey 12.2.1.

Thanks @lockwo, that worked!
