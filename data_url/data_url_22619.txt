With the new compiler, from artiq.protocols import pyon results in a lot of unnecessary modules (regex, levenshtein, ...) being pulled in from the compiler through artiq.language. There are many cases where one would use pyon (or another ARTIQ library) without needing the compiler: controllers, GUI...
Loading those modules anyway unnecessarily increases memory consumption and dependency hell.
Is there any convenient way to see what modules are loaded?
Note that this does nothing to alleviate "dependency hell", although it does slightly reduce memory consumption and much more importantly startup times.
What I mean with alleviate dependency hell is things like: if you install ARTIQ manually to work on a specific part of it on a new machine, you don't have to install every dependency or touch conda.
