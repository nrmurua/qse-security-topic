Summarize the task
#5519 will deprecate and eventually remove cirq.NeutralAtomDevice from Cirq. The only place it's used right now is in https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/docs/tutorials/educators/neutral_atom.ipynb
I propose that we should get rid of the tutorial once the PR is checked in. The same strategy would be followed for ion device tutorial, as discussed in #5463
cc @augustehirth @aasfaw LMK if the proposal looks good.
If the tutorial uses deprecated code definitely delete it. If not, might it serve as a useful example for people trying to build custom Devices? Or has Device evolved too far for it to be useful?
