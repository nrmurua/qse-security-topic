In circuits.py, comments say that
In line 47 we have
    num_multiplier_bits = num_multiplicand_bits = nbit
Then in lines 68-69 we have
Although num_multiplier_bits and num_multiplicand_bits have the same value, perhaps for clarity this ought to be
Or am I missing something?
Thank you.
Hi @myriagon ,
You're right, this is confusing. I have made a PR to correct the double for loop to use the correct notation.
The num_multiplier_bits = num_multiplicand_bits = nbit line is an artifact from when the function was written. Originally it allowed the user to specify a different number of bits for the multiplier and the multiplicand.
