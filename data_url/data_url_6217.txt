Add additional test coverage for optimized gates in qubitvector class.
Hi @chriseclectic,
I am heavily interested in helping out here. I don't necessarily have a heavy background in the subject but I am eager to learn. How might the ideal form of this expanded test coverage look? Is there any literature I can leverage to get up to speed more quickly?
Thanks
Hi @jparr721 that would be great! If you're interested in helping out on this I just made some issues that might be a better place to start for the controlled-swap (#274) and controlled-u3 gates (#274), since these are both supported by Terra compiler to unroll into basis gates.
After that you could try these gates, but since there isn't a specific gate object in Terra yet you would have to define your own to build the tests, and you couldn't test the unrolling.
In general we should define class objects for these multi-controlled gates, but you could do a quick version for testing by directly using the gate objects (note that this will be defining them for a fixed number of qubits though). Ie something like
Hey @chriseclectic, I'd like to help out in any way I can. If this still needs to be completed, I'd like to try my hand in this. Could you please refer to some resources for me to get started if this issue is still active?
Hi @chriseclectic! Is this issue still open? If so, I'd like to help out.
Multi-controlled gates: #1076 adds tests to all mc gates that are supported by Terra (some of them are not supported by Terra - see #1070). #1076 excludes deprecated mcu1.
