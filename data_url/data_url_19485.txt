We mentioned it at the last meeting, but we should consider if we want to implement a Qibo function for different kinds of visualization.
On one hand, there is circuit visualization that could be implemented using qasm, or different latex libraries such as 'qcircuit', which has been already discussed.
Then, there is the issue of visualizing circuit results. The most common way is to plot a histogram with 'matplotlib' from a frequencies dictionary (this dictionary is already available in qibo).
We may want to provide users with a histogram module for their circuit results. If it is easy to use, with few customizable options like titles, and axis customization it will be one of the first things user do after completing a circuit run.
Furthermore, if the default design has something recognisable, such as some specific color or design choice, it can be a way for people to recognize that qibo was being used from just looking at a histogram they might see on some presentation or website.
On the other hand, we can decide that everyone should plot their data in their preferred way, and not provide that for ourselves, which is also an acceptable option.
This may not be something at the top of our priority list, but I think is worth considering.
