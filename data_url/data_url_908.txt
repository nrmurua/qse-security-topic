Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
https://quantumai.google/cirq/build/interop documents how to import from an OpenQASM input, but not for exporting. I never knew this has been possible until I read the source code of qBraid.
Describe the solution you'd like
While the API used in qBraid works, I still have to:
Ideally if I could do cirq.circuit_to_qasm(circuit) (named to be consistent with from cirq.contrib.qasm_import import circuit_from_qasm), with no other required arguments.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
Not a blocker because qBraid already does it. P3.
Cirq cync:  issue accepted.  Code part should be straightforward.  A new method that uses a similar approach to the qBraid could be used.
Documentation should also be done.
@ossRe would like to take this issue on.  For some reason I cannot assign to ossRe so I am just noting here.
@ossRe won't be able to be assigned until they comment on this issue.
