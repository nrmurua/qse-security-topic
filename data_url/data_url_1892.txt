It seems that Cirq supports only Google devices, but they seem to be closed for public access :-(
Do you plan support for publicly-available devices, eg AWS Braket ?
We don't only support Google devices. We support AQT, and IQM devices too. You can compile Cirq circuits to QUIL and run them on Rigetti's devices and also compile them to QASM to run them on IBM's.
I don't see what will be gained by Cirq supporting AWS braket. AWS braket  seems like a mediator for hardware from a range of different institutions. We can support those devices directly without AWS braket..
+1 to @vtomole's comments!
Cirq is an open source framework for quantum circuits that allows users to directly access quantum computing platforms who decided to partner with us. AQT, IQM and Pasqal as well are the current examples beyond Google's devices.
Where direct access is not implemented, there is an option for "import/export" between Cirq's langauge to the other quantum computing platform's circuit language: PyQuil, OpenQASM (IBM), quirk, qcircuit (latex) are examples.
In comparison AWS Braket is a managed service by AWS that charges for accessing the quantum computing platforms.
AWS Braket comes with an SDK for which a circuit "import/export" functionality could be implemented in Cirq. However, for Cirq, quantum annealers are not in scope - so that part is unlikely to be supported.
