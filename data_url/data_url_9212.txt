This is really amazing work! I noticed something weird: when I run a two qubit bell state and sample it I see elements "00" and "100".
Expected would be: "00" and "11" like in this example: https://qcgpu.github.io/qcgpu-rust/book/user-guide/examples.html
Currently returns: Measured: {"00": 487, "100": 513}
Thanks for the feedback!
I think your code might be slightly off! that for loop will go through 0, 1, which means the simulator is trying to apply a CNOT with the control of 0 and target of 1, and then a control of 1 and a target of 2! The qubits are zero indexed, so you are actually trying to apply the gate to a qubit that isn't there, that's why the results are off!
I changed the code slightly, I think this should be more correct:
Which outputted:
Let me know if that worked for you!
