I'm wondering if the Verilog oracle synthesis syntax supports vectors as inputs/outputs?
Minimal example:
Oracle declaration:
With QASM:
gives a compiler error:
test_oracle.qasm:10:10: Register c has incompatible length
Thanks!
Currently it can not. This is due to a limitation of the openQASM 2.0 language, which will (hopefully) be fixed in openQASM 3.0 (issue #323), where gates can only take individual qubits as parameters.
Thanks! Leaving this open as an enhancement for now, but if there are other missing features of Verilog that would be useful feel free to open up a separate feature request.
