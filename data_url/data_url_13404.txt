There is a new feature in GitHub (docs here) that makes it easy to add a nicer UI with buttons and dropdown selections when filing an issue or making a PR.
GitHub has a nice blog here: https://github.blog/changelog/2021-06-23-issues-forms-beta-for-public-repositories/ , but its basically using some yaml formatting in the templates.
I think this could make adding issues especially more easy/user friendly. Sphinx is already using it if you want to take a look: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.yml
I can work on this, have done it for my opensource projects @crazy4pi314
if there is a template or list of fields that's required and I can make the form ready according to the given fields
Sweet! You can see our current templates in the .github directory, but initially just porting the fields we currently have to the nice text boxes, and then I was gonna take a look at other projects like pyquil or circ and see what info they ask for in their templates to see if we should add them too.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
