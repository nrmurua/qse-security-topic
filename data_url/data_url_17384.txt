When trying to run disassemble() (or qobj_to_circuits()) on a qobj that includes conditionals for instructions this isn't handled properly. This was listed as a todo in the code doing the conversion: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/compiler/disassembler.py#L17 but it has yet to be handled.
Build a qobj with experiments that include a conditional and then run disassemble or qobj_to_circuits on it.
The conditional is reflected in the output circuit.
Add the missing conditional support. (Likely after #2147 merges)
