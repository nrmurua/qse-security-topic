It would be good to also show a qiskit version of the example in the getting started from #72.
My first attempt at this involved some wrestling with qiskit that I could use some help on from folks who are more familiar with it.
I was unable to define the depolarizing noise model on the qiskit simulator in a way that would actually show errors. Maybe it was the X gate? I tried optimization 0 so that the circuit wouldn't be compiled, but perhaps that had something to do with it.
@rmlarose @nathanshammah @andreamari Do you have any suggestions for what the comparable qiskit code to the cirq example should be?
Do you mean this line in Cirq but in Qiskit? Have you tried the method in run_with_noise, or tried using this function itself (from qiskit_utils.py)?
I've made progress on this but it is blocked by needing to do come circuit conversion code to use the folding methods. Since I know you're already working on this @rmlarose I'll wait on that PR and then build on top of that. Let me know if I can help get that in place modularly from the other stuff you are doing.
