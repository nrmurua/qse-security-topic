@MaJaISTA Thanks for the report. This is due to the version parsing code in packaging having become more strict.
As a work around you should be able to downgrade to packaging 21.3
I should have a fix soon
Solved, thanks!
@MaJaISTA Great. I have reopened to ensure that we get a proper fix in via #5008 that works with the newest packaging and has a test
