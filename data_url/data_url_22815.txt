Setup unit test for pyEPR that can be run
Start with just basic functionality and loading
I haven't used pyEPR. So, I think this is a reasonable starting place for me.
Excellent! Maybe @DanielCohenHillel can also help explain what he has done  to start on unit test and show you which way to advance?
@zlatko-minev Awesome! I sent @DanielCohenHillel an e-mail. I am looking forward to hearing back.
