I have not been using this repository for that long but in the time I have,  I encountered problems several times where a code written just a few weeks ago didn't work correctly because of changes made to the repository. I suggest creating a "stable" branch (the master) and a development branch to solve this issue.
This way you can still develop easily and when it's time to update the stable branch you can make sure that someone using an "old" method of doing things it would work but he would bet a "deprecated" warning or something.
Yeah, I can create one.  But if so we need to make the master stable.
By the way yesterday I created a branch to fix a TODO from project_info.py (converting the self.dissipative from a class to a dictionary). You can check it out but it doesn't run now because I forgot some commas in the dictionary :\ I'll fix it today and then we can merge it back. I also created a TODO.md on that branch from the TODOs on all the files.
Great job, i'll keep this open until this is all set
I've created the a development branch and merged the branch dissipative_class-to-dict into it. I suggest following the git workflow described here. There's a useful plugin you can use called git-flow which you can download from here. Also found this great tutorial you can check out.
I'm not sure how would that plugin work with the GUI but it shouldn't really change much. All it does is give you a one-line command to do stuff that would normally take you several of commands to do (such as creating feature branches, merging branches correctly, etc...). It also automatically creates the branches but since I already used it to create them it shouldn't matter anymore.
I'm closing this issue. Hopefully we won't have any git workflow issues in the future ðŸ˜€
Check out SourceTree by Atlassian, its good.  https://www.google.com/search?q=source+tree&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS817US817&sxsrf=ALeKk01JHCO3XJk9Mhlzm_N0ozKssyMF7Q:1589063785311&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4oMvz66fpAhXBmHIEHZKwBVsQ_AUoAnoECBAQBA&biw=1536&bih=757#imgrc=5es7xfr_i3OuoM
