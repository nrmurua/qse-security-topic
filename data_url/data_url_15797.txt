If the circuit contains a PhaseEstimation block, the code returns an error when using any of the Aer simulators.
output:
The same problem occurs for other Aer simulators.
Please transpile the circuits before submitting them to the simulator. This will map the circuit to the simulator's supported gateset. Eg.,
