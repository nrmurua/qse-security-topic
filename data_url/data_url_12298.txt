I was trying the teleportation circuit, which requires control using classical registers. The code is the following:
`include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[5];
creg c0[1];
creg c1[1];
creg c2[1];
h q[0];
t q[0];
h q[0];
cx q[0],q[1];
h q[0];
measure q[0] -> c0[0];
measure q[1] -> c1[0];
if (c0==1)
x q[2];
if (c1==1)
z q[2];
measure q[2] -> c2[0];
`
And I got error:
Error in line 14: Operations are disabled
Which refers to the "if" operation. How should I use a classical register to control a quantum gate?
@taojiastanford what backend are you using. If is not supported in real devices yet.
@jaygambetta
Is the following control-if supported in the real device? I have been using it with the simulator and wonder if it is an alternative of the above if statement.
@rraymondhp all the qasm simulators should support this.
I also found that I could not create multiple classical registers. The following code:
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[5];
creg c0[1];
creg c1[1];
h q[0];
t q[0];
h q[0];
cx q[0],q[1];
h q[0];
measure q[0] -> c0[0];
measure q[1] -> c1[0];
This does not have compile error, but when I tried to simulate it I found "Generic error".
Am I supposed to only use one classical register?
Hello @taojiastanford
Sorry for the late response.
I confirmed that the code can be compiled and can run with the simulators. I believe you got the error message because you executed the qasm code (with QASM editor instead of the QISKit tutorial) using the topology of the real device on IBM Q experience, right? Is it correct?
If so, the error (bug) is due to the limitation of commands used to operate the real device. You are right that at the moment one is supposed to use one type of classical register.  The error message should report this clearer instead of "Generic Error" message.
Thank you very much for reporting this.
Dear Dr. Raymond,
Sorry for my late reply.
Yes, my code works if I choose "Custom Topology" instead of "ibmqx2" when I start a new experiment. However, if I choose "ibmqx2", even later I just want to click the button "Simulate", the system will not allow it.
Also is it possible to have bigger number of shots in simulation? Now the result of my teleportation is quite randomized and away from the ideal case.
One small bug is that some times when I tried to save the experiment under the "Dragged-in Gates" interface, the system shows "Generic Error". It always allow saving under the "QASM Editor" interface.
Hope my observation helps. I do like this open-source platform and want to thank you for maintaining it.
Sincerely,
Tao
P. S.
Below is my code for teleportation:
Hi Tao,
Thanks for your contribution. We really appreciate it.  Please just call me Raymond.
Meanwhile, about your questions, the real devices ibmqx2 and ibmqx3 has connectivity limitations: not all circuits that can be run on real devices, even though they can be run on simulators.   For example, if you use real devices, a measurement will end the execution of your program. In this case, the teleportation code, as you gave me, cannot run the classically controlled gates.
For the number of shots, at the moment, there is an upper limit for one submission, but I think you can trivially combine two submissions with N1 shots and N2 shots, and essentially get N1 + N2 shots of experiments, and so on.
About the error for the experiment, I believe this is a bug report to be handled by IBM Q experience (the web interface). I will forward your suggestion to the forum here:
https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/community
There is a tutorial on quantum teleportation here, that allows you to write the program with python interface:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/2_quantum_information/quantum_teleportation.ipynb
@taojiastanford and @rraymondhp I think this issue is solved. I will close the thread but please open it again if there is more.
For the bug can you use the bug tracker on the IBM Q experience website.
Thanks
@rraymondhp the link you shared does not work now. Can you send another one, or share the code?
