Those line cause make install_dev fail, because oqs directory is not part of the source tree. The headers are part of liboqs and, by the time the make command is executed, are already installed.
Thanks for making us aware of this issue. However, we're ceasing support of this OpenSSL111 fork, so don't encourage using make install_dev, and invite all users to move to OpenSSL3 (using oqs-provider) instead.
The OpenSSL project has indicated that OpenSSL 1.1.1 will reach end-of-life in September 2023.  As such, we are discontinuing development on OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1, and recommend all users switch to OpenSSL 3 and the OQS Provider for OpenSSL 3, which provides all the same functionality that OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1 does.  Hence we are closing open pull requests and issues in OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1 as won't-fix.
