Artiq 5 is unavailable through the conda channel.
I'm attempting to install Artiq 5 through conda, and it defaults to downloading 6.7251.91c93e1a.beta.
After this, the output of artiq-client --version is 6.7251.91c93e1a.beta.
I would expect to be able to roll back to Artiq 5.0 by either creating my environment with conda create -n artiq artiq=5.0 or by using conda install artiq=5.0 on an already-created environment.
The output of conda install artiq=5.0:
The output of conda search artiq -c  https://conda.m-labs.hk/artiq-beta is
I would expect to see something with a 5 in this list.  My interpretation of this is that 6.7251.91c93e1a.beta is an unreleased beta.
(If this is an inaccurate interpretation of that number, I'm happy to be corrected!)  I'd vastly prefer to work with the stable release.
The correct channel URL for the stable channel is https://conda.m-labs.hk/artiq and not https://conda.m-labs.hk/artiq-beta - I will fix the manual.
If you are using Linux you really should not be using conda.
