Sometimes InteractionOperator objects behave strangely if the n_body_tensor attribute is modified but the one_body_tensor and two_body_tensor fields remain unchanged, as in the example below.
Maybe instead of having one_body_tensor and two_body_tensor be attributes, they should be properties that encapsulate n_body_tensor?
Yes, one_body_tensor and two_body_tensor should be properties that access n_body_tensors.
