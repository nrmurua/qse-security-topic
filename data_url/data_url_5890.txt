I am trying to do a noise simulation on a 30Q circuit.  The simulator config sim.configuration().num_qubits says it can handle 30Q, but when doing so I get:
QiskitError: 'ERROR:  [Experiment 0] QasmSimulator: Insufficient memory for 30-qubit circuit using "statevector" method.
The raw data storage at 30Q is 16Gb of memory, and I have 32 (well effectively reported as 31 since on linux).
An user would expect the number of qubits in the config to be the true value.
Total memory is calculated differently for MAX_QUBITS_STATEVECTOR in python and for default max_memory_mb in C++.
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator.html
max_memory_mb (int): Sets the maximum size of memory to store a state vector. If a state vector needs more, an error is thrown. In general, a state vector of n-qubits uses 2^n complex values (16 Bytes). If set to 0, the maximum will be automatically set to half the system memory size (Default: 0).
By setting max_memory_mb as 16384 or more, 31 qubit will be available.
@chriseclectic should we allow Aer to use all the memory by default?
Yes, my point is there should not be a difference. I would also expect to be able to run a 30Q sim on a system with 32gb of installed memory.
