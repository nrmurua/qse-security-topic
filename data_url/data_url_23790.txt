During some of my overnight measurements, the notebook hangs for some reason.
I think in most cases the measurement was finished, but I cannot do anything in the notebook, even restarting the kernel doesn't help.
So I have to kill the jupyter process again :(
How can I debug this?
Here is the relevant traceback from the terminal, if it helps, the aaa1 and such are the server processes.
If this is an issue directly with the javascript widget, we can change from setTimeout to setInterval that gets recreated after the widget action returns each time, so the calls don't pile up on each other.
This issue has become obsolete.
