Building tweedledum-1.1.1 with Python 3.11 fails as follows:
I think this is because the bundled copy of pybind11 is a bit stale.
Successful build.
I can confirm the issue after replacing external/pybind11 with version 2.10.4. Also, it would be nice if CMakeLists.txt included the option to find a local installed version. The option TWEEDLEDUM_USE_EXTERNAL_PYBIND11 doesn't work as expected for me. Also, for recent versions of gcc, you have to add #include <cstdint> to Cbit.h. This needs some attention, as latest release was already broken (and had to manually applied #170), but now it just got worse after many distros updating to Python 3.11 and GCC 13.
Quick fix:
