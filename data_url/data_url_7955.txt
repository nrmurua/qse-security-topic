In qutip.qobjevo.compile, on line 1646, the .pyx file created by qutip is registered into the global variable coeff_files containing a _file_list object using the method coeff_files.add(file_). The add method appends a .pyx extension on line 60 to the string file_
However, the file_ string generated by _compiled_coeffs already has the file extension, judging from the return value of qutip.qobjevo_codegen._import_str, on line 54
I believe this causes coeff_files.clean() on line 1697 of qutip.qobjevo.compile to not delete the .pyx files after the cython class has been loaded.
The .pyx file in the working directory should be deleted.

Thank you for reporting.
