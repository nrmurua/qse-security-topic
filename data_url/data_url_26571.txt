Detailed configuration is attached as Br-elpa-stuck.zip, but essentially when setting:
the calculation gets reproducibly stuck at iteration 4, with the main processes spinning at 100%.
This is with CP2K 9f7a817, SIRIUS v7.2.8 and ELPA 2021.05.002_bugfix.
Also notable is that MPI_GRID_DIMS gets ignored completely.
This was likely fixed by the upgrade to ELPA 2021.11.002. See also #1956.
