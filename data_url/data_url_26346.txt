Dear Sir/Madam。
Master branch was compiled wiht toolchain method on the OS of Ubuntu 20.4 with gcc 9.4，intel classic 2021.4.
When compiled to Libint v2.6, it report some errors about init_( ).
libint-v2.6-compiling erro wiht intel classic 2021.4.txt
I noticed the same error. There is a trick in the script: 
In the end I chose to compile v2.7.0 beta 5 (https://github.com/cp2k/libint-cp2k/releases), though a pre-release, worth a try.
The cmake build method works, here is the command that I used:
Please modify according to your needs. Then in the end choose --with-libint=system
(You can read my original google groups post)
The newest code is updated  and the things changed. the errors about libint-v2.6.0-cp2k-lmax-5 still exist but do not stop the toolchain installation.  the errors could be reproduced using intel oneapi 2022.02 and intel parallel studio 2020.04.

libint2.6-intel2020.4.txt
Unfortunately this seems still to be broken in the toolchain of the current 2023.1 release for me. (used intel2020.4)
