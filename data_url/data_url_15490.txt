In the current version of Trotterization, if the user provides observables/auxiliary operators to be evaluated on a quantum state, it only happens at the end of the evolution. It was suggested by @Cryoris to also have an optional setting to evaluate them at intermediate time steps.
This issue has been fixed in the time_evolvers module.
