When transitioning code from using tuples to using Bits, a pain point has been updating a reference from qubit[1] to qubit.index (while updating qubit from a tuple to a Bit). If a case is missed such that qubit can still be a tuple, the updated code will not immediately throw an error, since tuple.index exists as a function.
Renaming Bit.index to e.g. Bit.position or Bit.location would address the issue, though I do think Bit.index is probably the most fitting name. Do people think this is significant enough to warrant a change, or some other accommodation during the transition?
this is going to be hard to change now. hopefully this problem does not arise too often, and it is transient.
