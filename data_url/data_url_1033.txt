I just realized that the default branch of this repo is called master. Should this repo adopt the new main branch convention?
In case yes, this might help.
What will be gained by renaming?
I was planning to do this in the coming weeks, thanks for bringing it up!
@vtomole - the industry is moving away from terms with historical baggage of misuse and oppression - e.g. master, blacklist, whitelist, etc. E.g. see https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/ - Github itself is now creating new repos with main.
@balopat I see. Good to know!
Adding discuss to this to determine whether we should do this or not, and whether it should be before 1.0.  It seems disruptive for little benefit, but would make our repo more consistent with new GH repos and improve naming.
