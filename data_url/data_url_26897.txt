A growing fraction of our code are bash scripts. Hence, we should look into using a linter like
ShellCheck.
I also started using pylint/flake8 for the Python scripts, I will come up with a pre-commit configuration for all of it.
Yes, flake8 is a good idea. While you build the pre-commits, I'd add this to the CI-system. However, it will probably take a while until all our scripts are made to pass.
@oschuett you could then use the pre-commit run -a feature in the CI
Yes, we should re-use your pre-commit scripts for the CI. I would like to run the flake8 as part of the existing python test and create a similar test for shell scripts.
We are now using shellcheck and mypy for new scripts.
