In the Qobj specification, pulse are identified by their name. In the pulse module pulses are identified by their object instance and when assembled are stored in the Qobj pulse library by name. If two SamplePulses of the same name exist, the second will overwrite the first, causing undesired behaviour.
Create a pulse schedule with two different pulses of the same name and assemble into a Qobj.
Unique pulses should be stored uniquely in the Qobj pulse library.
If a name collision occurs when building the pulse library. Modify the name of the sample pulse in some consistent manner, and adjust the commands that refer to this pulse.
