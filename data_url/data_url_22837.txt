Currently, only Eigenmode and Driven Modal (DM) solution types are supported for HFSS. The interface for Driven Terminal (DT) is largely the same as for DM so it should be easy to just inherit from HfssDMSetup and edit the corresponding parts if necessary etc. Using pyEPR as a Python interface makes sense for DT as well.
