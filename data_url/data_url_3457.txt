Readout symmetrization in measure_observables breaks the experiment down into a number of different readout configurations, and averages over them, to get an effective symmetric behavior.  If N shots are requested out of measure_observables, each configuration in the symmetrization will take N//C shots, where C is the number of configurations being used by symmetrization.  This means the total number of shots will be C * (N//C), which can be smaller than N, in some cases even 0.
