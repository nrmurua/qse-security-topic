I'd like pushes to an open draft PR to provide feedback more quickly, and concisely. It takes a long time, can be interrupted by subsequent pushes, and uses excessive resources.
Write a workflow that checks for draft PRs, add in workflow items to detect changed files/directories, then use the make test-% wildcard to test only changed files. On the trigger change from draft -> ready for review, run the entire test suite.

See #1807 for a working example of the idea. Still could use some refinement!
