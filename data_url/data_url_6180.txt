I tried to run from qiskit import Aer.  The result shows  ImportError: cannot import name 'Aer' from 'qiskit'
Diggin in, with the command from qiskit.providers.aer import Aer, the result shows
I guess you installed qiskti-aer via pip , right?
How did you install Pyhton in your Windows? Is it from Anaconda 3? Miniconda 3?
@atilag , Yes, I've installed qiskit-aer via pip.  I've install python on my windows directly from https://www.python.org/downloads/.  Does this leads to the problem?
Thanks,
Probably,  I'm going to try to reproduce the error, but in the meantime if you can install Anaconda3 (or Miniconda3) and create a virtual env for installing Qiskit, you won't have any problems.
Hello, I am having a similar issue. I am trying to use a noisy simulator, but when I do
from qiskit.providers.aer import noise
I get an error. I am using a conda environment with python 3.6.7 in VSCode and my qiskit versions are
qiskit: 0.11.1
qiskit-aer: 0.2.3
Here is the error I get:
Traceback (most recent call last):

@atilag is this resolved?
