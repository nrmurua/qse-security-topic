Conda env on latest commit on main will not work due to depreciated classes.
update classes to use python 3.10 both:
collection using Callable
attrdict change to addict in pyepr
update pyepr, get a new tag for Metal to use, then also update Callable in Metal.
This has merged during the time of making a tag. However, just need to still have CI use python 3.10.
The merged branch #796
