Due to the changes in 0.6.1, the benchmarks don't work any more,
Happy to take a look at it btw.
@adamisntdead Thanks for checking. We are going to move benchmarks to a global repository fairly soon where they will act as integration tests for the compiler, simulator, etc.
But I agree that they should be fixed here first. If you want to take a crack at it, please do!
Any updates on the new integration tests?
