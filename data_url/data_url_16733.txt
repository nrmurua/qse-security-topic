Building a gate definition that incorporates conditional gates, adding to a circuit and transpiling removes the conditions, changing the outcome
Output:
Building an Instruction from a QuantumCircuit and unrolling should produce the same circuit.
Inspecting the instructions in the decomposition shows that they still have the correct data in the condition field, so the error is suspected to be in the unroller but not certain.
NOTE: it is possible to add a c_if to qc.append(...) which is preserved. In theory, to solve this correctly, Qiskit would need to support having multiple conditions, or rather conditions on multiple registers. May be worth looking at this after #1160 is solved to allow conditions to be arbitrary lists of bits. Or allow purely classical operations to allow the appropriate bit manipulation.
This looks like a case of #2784 . In https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/4dd47cf/qiskit/transpiler/passes/basis/decompose.py#L66 , inst.condition is set correctly, but apply_operation_back only respects the condition keyword argument.
Thanks @kdk for pointing this out! Resolving #2784 does fix this issue, and the circuits match! Opened a PR for it :)
duplicated #2784
