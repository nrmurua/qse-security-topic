The following code gives a warning on MPL drawing
RuntimeWarning: Cregbundle set to False since an instruction needs to refer to individual classical wire
self._get_layer_widths()
run above
no warning should happen
No response
This is the same thing as #8690, which I thought had been solved by #8689, but it looks like that PR for some reason only applied the default-setting logic to the text drawer, not all three.  We should be able to update it to fix that without too much trouble.
