From my folding method benchmarks, I'm finding that Richardson extrapolation returns some nonsensical results. For example, consider the following MWE:
Am I missing something here or is this a bug?
Probably this is normal since Richardson's extrapolation becomes very unstable beyond 3 or 4 data points. This is due to the fact that, by construction, the fitting order is proportional to the number of data points (in your case order is 19 !).
This is also the main advantage of PolyFactory: you can have many data points but still keep a small fitting order (e.g., order=2 or order=3).
