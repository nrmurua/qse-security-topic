The current scripts/format_ipynb.py has a slightly different convention than the tf docs nb formatter at https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/tools/nbfmt.py; per @lamberta, the latter is also designed to be compatible with Colab downloads
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
(just saw you reopened)
Take a look at this CI check to install the tensorflow-docs package and test with nbfmt: https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yaml#L11
To run it:
Recently submitted a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically add a format commit, but it needs a webhook to run the workflow with permissions: https://github.com/tensorflow/docs-l10n/blob/master/.github/workflows/bot-pr-fix.yaml
And still working out it can play nice with the CLA bot.
