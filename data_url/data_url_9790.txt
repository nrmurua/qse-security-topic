Note how -20 for b in the second sample is out of allowed {1, -1} set, yet when printed it's rounded down to -1. Energy stays incorrect though (calculated for b = -20).
The energy is correct, it's calculated from a*b*J_ab so -1*-20*1. The problem is that the sampleset does not check that the input samples are actually correct so sampleset.record.sample in this case would be [[1, 1], [-1, 20]]. It is the print function, not the construction, that is rounding b down.
We can change it so that the sample set enforces the samples to be the correct vartype, would you prefer an exception or rounding? There is a performance hit that comes with that, so maybe I can add a permissive=True flag or something.
Yes, I'm aware of that. I guess I forgot to write my expected behaviour:
