I'm trying to reproduce this tutorial. My problem happen when executing results = vqe.run(quantum_instance)  in cell [9] in the tutorial. This line give the following error:

I saw another issue here with the same problem. However that case seemed to be RAM related. I don't think my issue is RAM related since I'm only dealing this 4 qubits.
Try reproducing the result of cell [9] in this tutorial.
The program should run without termination.
Somehow sage was causing problems. Disabling sage resolved the issue. If you ran into the same issue you can disable sage by adding
import os os.environ['MPMATH_NOSAGE'] = 'true'
in the beginning of your code.
@amarjahin
I tried following at the begining of the notebook. But no luck.
import os
os.environ['MPMATH_NOSAGE'] = 'true'
I am using Python 3.7. Qiskit Aer version: 0.7.6.
