Hi,
At this moment I am writing a driver for the Keithley 2700. The add_parameter and add_function functionality of the Instrument class is really helpful and prevents a lot of duplicated code. I use for example:
k1.add_function('readnext', get_cmd=':DATA:FRESH?', return_parser=float)
Is there a method to add documentation for the generated functions and parameters? For normal functions I can use something like
but for some reason this does not work with the  qcodes.instrument.function.Function class.
@eendebakpt Possible duplicate of #18 ?
Indeed a duplicate. I will close the issue and continue in #18
