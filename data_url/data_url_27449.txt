There are a number of things that need to be improved in the SIM gui:
I think this wouldn't be too hard to implement right now, we could create and destroy threads when voltages are being ramped via the text box methods. You could differentiate 'enter' and 'shift + enter' for ramping a single voltage or all currently modified voltages etc.
Attaching arb. keys to actions may be more difficult, it would best be handled in a drop-down menu registry.
