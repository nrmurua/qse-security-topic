If a circuit has a .measure on a qubit, but no other gate the transpiler throws an error. Confirmed on multiple devices, but diesn't error on simulators (appears to be related to the last qubit on the device).  Confirmed the error goes away by adding .iden gates
Here is qasm that will cause it
'OPENQASM 2.0;\ninclude "qelib1.inc";\nqreg q0[5];\ncreg c0[5];\nmeasure q0[0] -> c0[0];\nmeasure q0[1] -> c0[1];\nmeasure q0[2] -> c0[2];\nmeasure q0[3] -> c0[3];\nmeasure q0[4] -> c0[4];\n'
Here's a screen clip of error

Looks like this was already resolved in f693681.
