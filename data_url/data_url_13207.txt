CI is failing on non-linux tests.
An example is given by the last commits of #1442
But it's happening in many other PRs too.
I am re-running tests on #1442 to see if it was just a temporary problem.
If you have any ideas on how to solve this, please comment here.
If no one is working on this, I can take it. Or if someone else wants to work together, that is fine with me as well considering this needs to be fixed ASAP.
I am not too familiar with Github Actions. I have been spending some time trying to figure out the differences between the linux and non-linux tests in the workflow file. So far, I have gotten as far as understanding the yml syntax.
if it was just a temporary problem.
I do not think this is a temporary problem because only the non-linux tests have been failing consistently. Windows 3.10 test fails and the others are canceled afterwards.

Job named core is failing here.
If I google the hint  that pops up, there are some discussions about init.py being in the wrong directory.
Wrong version of numpy might be getting installed because following error also pops up:
I checked it locally and numpy version installed is what is specified in the requirements. Haven't checked the version installed in the runner yet.
Another possibility is there is some problem with the latest version of pip. I tried a fresh install in a new virtual environment and I am getting the following error after the latest version is installed. I do not know if this is because my local virtual environment dependencies are incompatible somewhere.
I'm hoping this will be fixed by #1486, but the only evidence for that is that the builds passed on the numpy upgrade PR.
Looks like this was fixed by #1486. If this pops up again, feel free to re-open.
