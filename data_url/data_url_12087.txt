When running the QSVM classification tutorial on IQX, a DCP Error is  raised while running some code in the CVXPY module and fails to  complete.
Go to https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jupyter/tutorial/advanced/aqua/machine_learning/qsvm_classification.ipynb Run all cells Cell 4 which calls qsvm/run() is the cell with the issue. See error scrolling down to the bottom after the deprecation warnings.

This occurred recently after the CVXPY fix was posted in the release note of the latest release of Qiskit on IQX. https://qiskit.org/documentation/release_notes.html
This is an older tutorial, and has not been added to the verified set yet.  You can try
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/legacy_tutorials/aqua/machine_learning/qsvm_classification.ipynb
but has not been updated to the latest set yet.
Closing as solution is found.
