Drawing circuit with initialize instruction with matplotlib (mpl) leads to the following error.
It should print it with the label 'psi'.
Since only gate instructions has labels, we should use "getattr" with a default None value instead of using "op.op.label".
I might be able to look into this

Is this the text that should be shown also in the mpl drawer?
This was fixed in #4616 and should be in the next release.
Closed via #4616
