Because of rounding error (~1e-16), this condition is not always satisfied exactly (the difference may be ~1e-16). Should we round obs to some precision?
One way to fix this is to make your observables hermitian
We can also increase the tolerance of the ishermitian test and then do that projection afterwards, for sanity.
I believe we are now doing this in Qlab.jl before passing in the data.  I think that's the best way to handle this for now.  If there are no objections, I'll close this issue.
