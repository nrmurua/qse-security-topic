Previously the bitstream was not build on pull-requests (no access to the secrets), using BUILD_SOC. With the conda builds, we still can not build bitstreams for pull-requests (yet we should still run the testsuite). We can keepl building the bitstreams for non-master builds. But more importantly we should not upload the packages to binstar if TRAVIS_BRANCH!=master.
