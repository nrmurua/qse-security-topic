Generally useful decorator like cloud-client's @dwave.cloud.utils.retried or @dwave_networkx.utils.decorators.binary_quadratic_model_sampler that aren't limited in use to the particular repo that were written in should be under a generic dwave.utils or dwave.decorators namespace.
I know that @randomir has been suggesting a dwave.common package or similar. Unfortunately, there is no nice way to populate a namespace from multiple packages (or at least none that I know of, though I haven't re-checked recently). dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk#21 is an attempt to create one using entry points.
Yes, I still have dwave.common on my todo list. It would include:
Basically, utilities we use across multiple Ocean packages.
