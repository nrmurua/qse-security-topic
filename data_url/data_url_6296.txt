If we switched from bool to unsigned for stabilizer bit packing, it seems that some of the Windows compatibility problems would no longer matter. The only significant challenge is Compose() and Decompose() logic, but we can rely on Swap() and swizzling composition order to alleviate this, with good performance.
I think I'm working on this immediately.
Having experimented in the code for a minute, the above isn't generally true. If we used C types only for stabilizer state, performance might be better, but Compose() type methods require std::vector-like resizing. This doesn't solve the Windows stabilizer bugs.
