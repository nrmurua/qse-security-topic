I've been unable to get latex output from qc.draw() (apparently pyenclatex isn't installed even though I've explicitly installed it via pip) but when trying to solve that, I've found that for some reason the version check doesn't work as expected; some aspects show up as None even when installed via pip and the kernel restarted.
My code is literally as follows:
This produces the following output:
{'qiskit-terra': '0.21.0', 'qiskit-aer': '0.10.4', 'qiskit-ignis': None, 'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.19.2', 'qiskit': '0.37.0', 'qiskit-nature': None, 'qiskit-finance': None, 'qiskit-optimization': None, 'qiskit-machine-learning': None}
All of those with version None should have versions; for example, pip install qiskit-ignis installed version 0.7.1 but it doesn't show up.
No response
