Hi, thank you for the amazing work that you do.
When using qutip to diagonalise two simultaneously diagonalizible, hermitian operators it continues to throw this error:

Which comes from qutip.simdiag.py in simdiag(ops, evals):

My installed packages:
QuTiP Version:      4.4.0
Numpy Version:      1.16.4
Scipy Version:      1.3.0
Cython Version:     0.29.12
Matplotlib Version: 3.1.0
Python Version:     3.7.3
Here's a code that reproduces the error for me (taken from an earlier GitHub issue for qutip):
import qutip as q
Thank you for reporting, should work in 4.4.1
https://github.com/qutip/qutip/tree/qutip-4.4.1 (Should be released next week).
I tested that this snippet now runs on qutip 4.4.1.
