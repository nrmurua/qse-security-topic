Noticed this while running my Grover example: if the bitstring was 0,0 or 1,1, the result is as expected, if the bitstring is 1,0 or 0,1, the result comes out reverted.
It's not the inversion (otherwise the first two cases would've been wrong as well).
Looking into the XmonSimulator code, found this (line 514):
Could it be the culprit?
Update: verified that the "reversed" was not where the problem was coming from.
Closing, not an issue.
