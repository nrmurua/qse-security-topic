Screenshots or logs
System information
Additional context
This was not an issue in 1.29.2 and presumably is a consequence of 60fc15b .
Thanks for raising this. I will get a fix out asap
Looks like the issue here is that when no profile is present, profile_name will be default. However, initializing a new session with profile name "default" fails without a correspondingly named profile. #454 should resolve this issue.
Fix is included in the latest release, 1.31.0. Closing this issue, please feel free to reopen if you run into anymore problems here!
@ajberdy Thank you for the quick fix!
