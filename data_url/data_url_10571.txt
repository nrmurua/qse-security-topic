Reasons:
My 2c for this debate: I think that :func:~dwave.embedding.chain_strength.uniform_torque_compensation adds urgency, and that we need to either deprecate or update VG's chain_strength algo because my guess (based on just a small sample) is that despite improvements from adjusting flux biases, results from the max negative chain strength do not compare favorably with the calculated chain-strength from uniform_torque_compensation .
A 50-node clique BQM with biases generated by dimod.generators.randint(50, 'SPIN', low=0, high=5) and scaled down to the J range, reusing the embedding with VG produced unsatisfying results:
