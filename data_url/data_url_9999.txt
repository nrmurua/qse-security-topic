Description
dimod.generators.combinations() claims to work for either vartype ("Accepted input values: Vartype.SPIN, 'SPIN', {-1, 1} Vartype.BINARY, 'BINARY', {0, 1}") and that "energy for the binary quadratic model is given by    :math:(\sum_{i} x_i - k)^2" but that is true only for vartype=BINARY, because that's hardcoded now "bqm.add_variables_from(((v, lbias) for v in variables), vartype=BINARY)" etc.
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
Unless we specify that this is for binary variables, the code should convert from SPIN
Environment
Win and python 3.x
Additional Context
I think it's preferable to enable both vartype values rather than limit and document the limitation
My bad, sorry
For posterity, the problem was the sample in
was binary-valued. The correct form would be
This does touch on #244 in the sense that bqm.energy does not complain when the wrong vartype sample is given.
