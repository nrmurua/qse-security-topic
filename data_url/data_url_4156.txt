ProjectQ is a great tool for teaching and learning. So, I encourage you to increase the number of Jupyter Notebooks, including a clear (when possible) description of the algorithm and references to the original paper when one is used.
For example, feel free to import some of my Notebooks for a Quantum Course (In fact, I have used sone ProjectQ examples in some of them) from
https://github.com/gomeztato/QuantumCourse
I had recently participated in a competition where I worked with Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC) and feature maps in order to make a classification model to classify MNIST digits.
I would like to give a try to make a notebook tutorial on the same with a different dataset :)
