Put very rough logging in
@dcmckayibm what are you thinking here.
It will be for the next release
Eli Arbel will do this. Will add him as assigned once I get his github name and get him added to Qiskit
@gadial will help in guiding him
To clarify what I meant by this issue is some centralized way to keep track of the fit parameters which can then be data mined at a later point in time.
E.g. consider that we run a bunch of T1 experiments, each time save the date/time, qubit, T1 values. At a later date we would want a way to plot all T1's for Qx in some date range. Chris suggested pandas could be used for the plotting.
To start we need some type of centralized file and a config file that points to the location of this file.
Hi Dave, thanks for clarifying. What I initially thought was needed here is a more general logging capability, i.e something which gives visibility into the code while it runs as well as outputting info for debug purposes.
What you are suggesting is a different use-case, which looks very useful. I will look into it and think about a framefork to support this type of logging. Most likely we can piggyback on the logging framework which is already there, maybe making the configurability aspect of it a bit more convenient.
I opened a PR to a branch on my fork giving a rough outline of what I envisioned logging would look like. I'm not sure sure it can piggy back on the current logging framework because I'm thinking of something that makes structured output.
#149
Hi Dave, please check out the "Ignis Logging" PR. It has the log writer and reader classes implemented. Comments are welcome.
