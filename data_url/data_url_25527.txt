Covalent fails on import.
Attempt to import Covalent using Python 3.10.
The Covalent package should be imported without error.
I believe this is limited to Python 3.10. I tried to reproduce it on Python 3.9 and did not see the error.
Seems like eventlet problem that has been solved. Reference - eventlet/eventlet#733
