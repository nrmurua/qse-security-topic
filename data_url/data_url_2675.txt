This is related to #393 but we could potentially implement this without doing #393. This would be super useful for creating parameterized circuits that approximate operators of the form exp(-i H t), where t is a variable parameter. For example, the simulate_trotter function in OpenFermion-Cirq would be able to take a Symbol for the time argument.
Done by us moving to sympy. Please close.
