Transpiling a simple circuit, which contains a snapshot, with basis gates ['u', 'cx'], raises an error. The same happens with more sets of basis gates: ['r', 'cz'], ['rz', 'rx', 'cz'], ['p', 'sx', 'cx']. However transpiling the same circuit with basis gates ['u3', 'cx'] is OK.
Note: this is working well with the stable version, the bug appears only in the master version.

Oddly enough, I was just working on this as part of #5554. This is caused by Optimize1qGatesDecomposition.run() calling Operator(qc). Operator will fail for 'snapshot', 'delay', and 'reset'. The reason it works with 'u3' in the basis is that if the basis has 'u1', 'u2', or 'u3', the optimizer calls Optimize1qGates.run() instead, which does not call Operator().
It should run ok with optimization_level=0 for transpile.
This is actually a duplicate of #5543 the issue is that the run collection for 1q gates is treating some non-gate 1q instructions as gates and trying to make an operator from that which obviously doesn't work.
