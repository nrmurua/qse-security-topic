go through all bitshifts in demodulation / modulation chain.
exclude signal=0x3FFF already in saturation part and gain one bit and possibly some noise performance
need to change line 217 in red_pitaya_iq_block.v to
.SHIFTBITS (0)
and deal with the consequences (possible overflow due to max. negative signal value).
Won't fix this. If you really need 1 V at the output, pass through a PID module. The reason is that IQ module also realizes bandpass filters. A saturation stage has to assure that the coefficient that multiplies with the sine (which is derived from the input) will not lead to a distortion of the sine. Since two quadratures are added together, each coefficient may correspond at most to 0.5 V, such that the sum is at most sqrt(2).
If a strong need for this arises we could think about implementation, but it will increase the necessary resources / risk saturation. Or we could make a switch that doubles the amplitude, but all this will cause nasty unreadable code.
