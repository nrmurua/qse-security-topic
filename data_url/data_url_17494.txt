Currently only the text drawer is able to do this. This capability is useful when defining hiearchical circuits.
Also refer to #1939 for a discussion of how to draw these.
I'm a bit confused by how to start working and testing the implementation for this. Based on all the examples in #1939 this is dependent on #1816 before we can implement this. Or am I missing something?
I pushed up a branch (not a PR yet) with a WIP implementation for how this would be implemented here: mtreinish@e358db2
Having an example script to add a custom gate to the circuit with current master (not a PR) would be ideal because then I can actually test this. The code in the latex module is hairy enough without actually testing a bunch of edge cases this is unlikely to work completely on my first try.
Yeah #1816 needs to be merged to test this. That is close to being merged though.
You can maybe implement it on top of 1816 and test for now, rebase later.
I just tested mtreinish@e358db2  with #1816 applied locally and it works after a small tweak (the numeric arg to \multigate was off by one). So I pushed up #2049 with the version I tested locally.
