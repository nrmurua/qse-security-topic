In v0.3 we will move some part out of this repo to improve CI time and precompile time. Also this will benefit other projects in the Julia ecosystem to re-use our utility. And on the other hand we will add some more features.
This issue will track what we will do next
see #117
see #113
see #57
The other extensions in Contrib should take this as an example.
The following could be in separated package in the future (to be decided)
Since QASM has been wildly supported by various projects, we will also support lowering our block tree structure to QASM. This will requires two feature
See #41  This is currently developing by @GiggleLiu , we will discuss whether this goes inYaoStdExt with other part of the Block system or not.
Tensor network algorithms can be used to accelerate certain kind of circuit.
See #13. This was an early request of parallelism, which is quite useful when you need to run the circuit for multiple times.
Any suggestions?
