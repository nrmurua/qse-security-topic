Describe the bug
HilberSpace.bare_hamiltonian() fails with:
Expected behavior
expect to get a bare Hamiltonian
To Reproduce
OS and version used (please complete the following information):
Looks like a default for evals_count is not being set properly somewhere, most likely? Interesting that the example in the demo notebook (2 transmons and a resonator) goes through without error.
No, I actually think this is expected behavior: you seem to be missing the truncated_dim specification. Once that is set, there is no error.
If that's not clear, we may want to change defaults/the docs.
ya since we don't require truncated_dim we could set evals_count to something reasonable, or at least warn the user - i.e raise our own exception telling them what's wrong and what they must do.
as of b51a316 we now require truncated_dim to be set by each subsystem that's passed to HilbertSpace.
