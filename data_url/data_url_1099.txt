import cirq takes around 1.5 seconds (this is in colab).
Would be nice to get some other numbers from users as to what they are seeing.
New MacBook, Python 3.8, Cirq master (7191cb57):
Ubuntu 18.04
Ubuntu 18.04. i5-8250U
python3 -c 'import time; time.sleep(1); t1 = time.monotonic(); import cirq; t2 = time.monotonic(); print(t2-t1)' executed sequentially
Cirq submodule import times excluding external packages:
Using tuna, the top offenders are  numpy, sympy, matplotlib, pandas, and networkx.  We've added code #4653 to do LazyLoading for scipy which was also slow.  The good news is that the problem is mostly these external deps, not cirq.
