GCC 13 requires including some additional headers that were not necessary in earlier versions. The migration guide is here: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-13/porting_to.html. At the very least, it seems that <cstdint> needs to be explicitly included.
Seems reasonable to fix. I don't currently have gcc 13, though.
