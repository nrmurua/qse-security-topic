Description of the issue
cirq uses an internal version of cached_property defined here to support earlier versions of Python.

As of #6167 we require Python 3.9 which is guaranteed to have functools.cached_property.
We can therefore replace all instances of _compat.cached_property with functools.cached_property and remove the cached_property definition from the _compat.py.

I opened a PR for this: #6398.
I closed the first one because it was committed with the wrong e-mail address (and making a dummy commit with the right e-mail still failed the CLA, so I figured opening a new PR was simpler).
