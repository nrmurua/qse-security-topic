Pulse durations sometimes get computed incorrectly due to floating point error.
The exact pulse calibrations that have this issue seem to vary with time. However, I have found that at least one incorrect two-qubit RZX calibration on guadalupe can be found consistently. Here is an example of how I found them:
Running this just now, I get
Now, I pick one of these layouts, transpile and schedule, and print the schedule
As you can see, the second pulse has a duration of 784 instead of 768 because the width is slightly greater than 512. I have found that running this circuit on the IBM Quantum service gives error code 9999.
The pulse durations should be computed correctly so that the circuit in the example above executes successfully.
