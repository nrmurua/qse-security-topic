Hi all,
I am getting the error message above when trying to do import tensorflow_quantum as tfq and I'm not really sure how to resolve it.
The full error message is:
ImportError: cannot import name 'Task' from 'pp' (C:\Users\MyUsername\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\tf\lib\site-packages\pp_init.py)
I currently have TF and TFQ installed in a conda virtual environment with Python 3.7.13.  TF and TFQ were installed using Pip according to these instructions: https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/master/docs/install.md
I'm not sure if it's related but doing "conda list" shows tensorflow as version 2.4.1 but doing the following in jupyter notebook returns 2.7.0.
Any help would be appreciated!
I've had problems before with version control before, my usual recommendation is to create a fresh python environment and install everything anew (seems to have worked for other problems in the past: #602). I cannot say I have ever heard of you specific problem before, but it might be some version problem that could be fixed with a new environment.
Thanks for the suggestion!
I have deleted the conda environment and created a new one. This time using Python 3.8.13. Following the install commands in the link above again, I have verified that I am on Tensorflow 2.7.0. However, trying to run pip3 install -U tensorflow-quantum returns the following error:
From searching online, this issue is usually encountered when someone tries to install the package into 32bit Python. However, I have verified that my Python is 64bit.
I've found this stackoverflow post and it seems like TFQ doesn't play well with Windows?

EDIT: Just saw from #673 and #671 that TFQ 0.3 is the last version that supports windows and probably why it can't be installed using Pip.
Yea, TFQ hasn't supported windows since 0.3. I recommend either using WSL, Colab, or some cloud compute resources.
Any updates on this or should it be closed?
