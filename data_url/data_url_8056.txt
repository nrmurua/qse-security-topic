It seems MeSolver does not accept SolverResultOptions as input, yet none of the other Options class seem to have a store_states attributes documented. Is this the correct behaviour @Ericgig?
I was expecting it work.
I am using PR #1644 to test how it works with qutip-tensorflow.
I am also aware that MeSolver(H, options = {"store_states" : True}) works fine.
It would be (for now):
SolverResultsOptions is not used directly but is contained in SolverOptions.
While I expect verner method to work with tensorflow, there is still no way to pass a tensorflow variable as a coefficient in a QobjEvo yet, so autodiff will not work.
@AGaliciaMartinez @Ericgig Can we close this?
Yes, we removed SolverOptions a while ago.
