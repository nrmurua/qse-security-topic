There used to be a function eval_hamiltonian in qiskit.tools.apps.optimization.py that seems to have gone missing.  Ditto for group_paulis.
I did a search for them and I can't find them anywhere is QISKit.  Were they replaced?
I should be able to import the function such as
from qiskit.tools.apps.optimization import eval_hamiltonian
ImportError: cannot import name 'eval_hamiltonian'
Identify where those functions went.
from qiskit.tools.apps.optimization import eval_hamiltonian
Trying to run the Quantum Chemistry tutorial
If nobody is currently working on getting those functions in the right place I can volunteer to do it.
This should be in pr #104 the team is reviewing this pr now. If you want to look at please do and if you have suggest or want to add additions i would suggest commenting with @antoniomezzacapo so that there is no repeated work (or less repeated work :-))
That looks OK to me.  I'd be happy to test it out, if that's part of the process.
Closing this bug as it seems it was implemented in #104
