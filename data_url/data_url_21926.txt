Sometimes when the RTM FPGA is not loaded and the AMC starts, it prints several times:
and sometimes it just waits for it to be loaded. Why are there those two different behaviors at random?
@enjoy-digital This is still a problem with the current master; can you look into this?
Understood and fixed via 64c8eee.
Thanks
This is still happening.
When RTM is not loaded, the AMC LVDS input is not driven and can be 0 or 1. The case is now handled in the gateware with cd44778.
If input starts toggling, we need to start calibration since this means RTM is calibrated and is sending pattern to AMC for calibration.
Once #813 will be implemented, serwb initialization will only be done after RTM is loaded. So this is a false problem: It will not happen and even if it happens, it falls back correctly (retry link calibration).
