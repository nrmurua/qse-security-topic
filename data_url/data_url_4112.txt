open_ql.py seems to be codegenerated (as is shown with the comments up top). When I install open_ql it has a file that is different from what is in the repository.  This creates problems when trying to pull in changes from the remote (or generally when making commits).
Should this file be added to the gitignore and excluded from version tracking?
@AdriaanRol indeed. I added it in the beginning as if this file was not there before installation, setup.py was not copying it to the install location. But with currect setup.py that is not the case. so you are right, it should be gitignored. I will do that in my next commit.
@imranashraf I added a pull request #7 that should resolve this.
