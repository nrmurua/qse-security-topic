Allow expectation value evaluation circuit generation w.r.t. to a list of qregs instead of a single qreg only
In the WeightedPauliOperator line 643, 644 the following check is conducted
if not wave_function.has_register(qr):
raise AquaError("The provided QuantumRegister (qr) is not in the circuit.")
This prevents to construct the evaluation circuits w.r.t. a list of qregs/qubits. e.g. [q0[0], q0[2], q1[1]]. The rest of the function works with this kind of list though.
Hi Christa - #852 gets rid of using specific qregs for the expectation, and instead allows you to just append your expectation measurement to the circuit directly. Does this solve your issue?
Hey Donny,
If I can specify the qubits to append the expectation measurement to - which I assume - yes.
Christa, from discussion with Donny, and above comments, I understand with the new operator flow and the use now of the new expectation objects that your needs should be accommodated. As such I am closing this.
