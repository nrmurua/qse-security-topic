@ajavadia and @mtreinish  it has been lost where to find how to add this dependencies outside pip. It is in the doc for the function https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/visualization/dag_visualization.py but I think we need to make this clearer in the documentation in the Qiskit repo.
I would split this into two issues --
This is issue is about the second item.
I agree this needs to be done but it should  be put in the source code of the dag_drawer.  This is in terra.
can you add to the source and it should be added here now?
https://qiskit.org/documentation/api/qiskit.visualization.dag_drawer.html#qiskit.visualization.dag_drawer
Let me rephrase to be sure I'm following: you think the qiskit.visualization.dag_drawer docstring should include details in how to install Graphviz in different OSs. Is that correct? In that case, should this issue be moved to terra?
yes and yes.
