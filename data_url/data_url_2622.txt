I think users of TrialResult will often have questions like "what's the bloch vector of qubit 5?" and "if I trace out qubit 4, what's the remaining density matrix?". We should have methods for these kinds of questions, and others.
Are you thinking of answering these kinds of questions with tomography or did you have something else in mind ?
I was thinking that, for the trial results that have the actual wavefunction, it would directly compute the bloch vectors. If there's only sample data, then the bloch vector would be unavailable but the expectation of observable Z would be.
Ok I think I'd be up for adding a few of these. I'm thinking most of the logic might live in sim/wave_function.py and then would get passed up to TrialResult similar to how dirac_notation is done. What do you think ?
That sounds good to me.
