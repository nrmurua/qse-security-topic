The goal of CheckMap pass is to check that the swapper fulfilled its promise. No more than that. Therefore, is_swap_mapped should also be renamed to requires_swap (and inverted). The direction checked can be done by a different pass CheckCnotDirection, so the property is_direction_mapped should be removed.
