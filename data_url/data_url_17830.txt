When calling qiskit.tools.visualization.plot_bloch_vector() it unconditionally calls show() on the figure to get an interactive 3d visualization of the bloch sphere for the provided vector. However if you're using a non-GUI matplotlib backend this doesn't have a user visible effect. All that happens is that matplotlib will emit a warning like:
lib/python3.5/site-packages/matplotlib/figure.py:448: UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg, which is a non-GUI backend, so cannot show the figure.
This comes up particularly if running on a system that doesn't have X or a graphical interface installed. All that happens is the warning is displayed and the script exits without failure.
Call qiskit.tools.visualization.plot_bloch_vector() on a system with matplotlib configured with a non-GUI backend.
The visualization is saved to disk somewhere, or the function returns the PIL.image object (or something else that represents the visualization)
Add a filename flag and/or add a return for the function.
