I was trying the random number generator example in the tutorial and could not proceed. The aborting message is as follows, of which ImportError: No module named 'hiq.projectq.backends._sim._cppsim_mpi' might be the problem.
Can you show the the running log of "python3 -m pip install --user ." It seems that you have not successfully installed hiq.
and I tried RNG again
Is it possible that there’s a missing __init__.py file somewhere in the projectq folder?
It looks like some file named _cppsim_mpi is missing in hiq/projectq/backends/_sim, and this file is required by _simulator_mpi.py.
Also, don't put the test case in the root directory of the HiQsimulator code, this will cause Python to find the lib path error.
Your python package installation directory is /home/parallels/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages, but the directory for import hiq is: /home/parallels/quantum_computing/hw_contest/HiQsimulator/hiq/
So what should the directory of hiq be
/home/parallels/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/hiq/
Alright I've changed to that. This is the log. However, the RNG is still not working. I find that it crashes on Measure | q1, and then it says "Illegal Instruction“
Can you successfully execute the examples in HiQsimulator/examples/
No, for example the teleportation
I can actually run project q program on my computer successfully.
If you go to the /home/parallels/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/hiq/projectq/backends/_sim/ do you see any shared library files (*.so) ?
Otherwise, you might want to try this
Any update on your problem? Were you able to solve it? If not, what is your current status?
I wanted to use HiQ during the contest. I did not manage to solve this problem, so I just used ProjectQ during the contest. Now that the contest is over, I stopped digging into the problem, and do not plan to resume doing so for the time being. I can close the issue if you want.
same issue

Do you have Boost::MPI installed on your system ?
I have this one
sudo apt-get -y install libboost-mpi-dev
