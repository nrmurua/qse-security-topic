Following the conversation here: #7765 (comment)
Currently the test only checks the function returns an instance of InstructionScheduleMap because there is no mocked V2 backends yet. After #7643, we should improve the test with a mocked backend.
add a test with FakeArmonk to verify the InstructionScheduleMap is correct and that the transpiler is actually using it when needed.
