If a framechange shares the same start time or end time as a pulse, the simulator can hang (it doesn't seem to be universal behavior). I don't know why, but I suspect it has to do with the pulse interpolation in the simulator.
An example would be a schedule created from the qasm for the fine amplitude cal.
Code is probably in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/openpulse-sim/qiskit/providers/aer/openpulse/cy/channel_value.pyx
