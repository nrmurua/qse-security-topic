As this is a "major" release, we should prepare some release notes for 0.6, ideally starting working in them sooner rather than later for the benefit of early adopters and similar cases. 0.5 was the first release where we included the release notes - the plan is that they include:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/releases.html#qiskit-sdk-0-5-0
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/0.5.7/doc/releases.rst
