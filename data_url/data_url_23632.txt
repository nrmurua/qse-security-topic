Steps to reproduce:
If the experiment was already there in the database, the first measurement will also fail.

In the first instance, this seems to be caused by line 242 of the experiment_container module. We need to change
to
However, we do not know how much of the code relies on the presence of the "exp_id" property being present. So we need to add this line instead of replacing the previous one.
Additionally, the fact that the first run does seem to work is weird and needs looking into as well.
Finally, tests need to be written to verify that this problem has been solved.
