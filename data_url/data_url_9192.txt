When calling The Walrus to calculate the matrix element <i_1,i_2,...,i_N | \rho |j_1,j_2,....,j_N> two different types of tensors can be obtained. If the the routines involve multidimensional polynomials one the tensor above is returned in the following order
tensor[i_1, i_2, ..., i_N, j_1, j_2, ..., j_N]
otherwise they come in the following "strawberryfields" order
tensor[i_1, j_1, i_2, j_2, ..., i_N,j_N]
this is confusing and a unified notation should be established.
