We need persistent storage in RAM of coredevice. Lists of integers up to 10M should be stored. Storage and retrieval is performed using string keys. Retrieval should not copy lists.
API: self.core.get_cache/self.core.set_cache. On error return empty list. If a list was returned by get_cache then set_cache will refuse to set it until the current experiment terminates, to maintain memory safety.
@sbourdeauducq Question: where should we stick the heap for the cache and how large should it be?
Nevermind "where", lwip does not give much choice in this regard. But "how large" still stands.
Please add to documentation.
Would also be good to benchmark performance.
There is no DRAM to Core Device step: any data stored in the cache is used directly when you extract it.
Documentation added.
