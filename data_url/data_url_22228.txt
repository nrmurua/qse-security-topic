Using artiq 2.0 on windows, I have the following experiment
Which generates the error message,
It would be useful to be able to return lists. For example, we may want to have one method that generates a list of all the results that we then pass to another function that processes that list.
@sbourdeauducq How do you expect this to work? Once we return, anything allocated on the stack is destroyed.
I know this, but is are there useful special cases that can be implemented anyway?
@r-srinivas in your example, you can allocate the list in run, pass it as parameter to return_list, and mutate it there.
@r-srinivas Or even better, do something like this:
I'm not sure if that would work for the particular application we had in mind.
The work around we've been using is to preallocate the list in prepare and have it as a class variable, i.e self.results = [0]*self.repetitions which we just overwrite for every scan point.
What I proposed would work:
That works, thanks!
