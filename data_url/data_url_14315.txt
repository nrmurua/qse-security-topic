SciPy optimizers allow one to easily pass arguments to cost functions. E.g.
However, the optimizers in Qiskit, e.g SPSA, do not offer this flexibility.  This makes crafting reusable cost functions tricky.  For example, using a Runtime Estimator makes creating VQE cost functions trivial, yet because I cannot pass an estimator to this cost function, I am forced to wrap the cost function within another if I want to use the same cost function over again (a simulator and real backend, for example):
It would be nice if args were supported so these kinds of tricks are not necessary.
