Currently validate-notebooks.ps1 script validates the workbook code cells using the same logic as the code cells in notebook versions of the katas: %kata magic that invokes test for the code in the cell is replaced with %check_kata magic that invokes test for the reference solution (from ReferenceImplementation.qs). This means that validating the workbooks ignores the solutions in them and does double-coverage of reference solutions.
Modify the script to validate the actual solutions in the workbooks.
I believe it should suffice to not replace %kata with %check_kata for notebooks that have Workbook as part of their name at https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas/blob/main/scripts/validate-notebooks.ps1#L59. This requires careful testing, though, including adding deliberately incorrect code to the workbooks and making sure this fails the CI build.
Hi @tcNickolas.
I would prefer this issue to get resolved before the issue #485 as it effects the 2 workbooks(CHSHGame and SolveSATWithGrover)
I have one approach in mind :
Sounds good!
Cool will raise a PR shortly...
