Suggestion: expose the I2C switch functions from the runtime to the kernels, and use them in i2c.py instead of reimplementing them as is currently done. The artiq-zynq runtime already supports PCA9547/PCA9548 autodetection.
Needs support in DRTIO aux as well.
Should it encompass only PCA954X series of i2c switches, or TCA6424A too, replacing all the i2c switch classes with just one generic one? Autodetect would be probably limited to PCAs on Kasli and Kasli-SoC only as well, since only they have a i2c reset pin - so should the type be overrideable?
TCA6424A is not a I2C switch and not relevant here.
