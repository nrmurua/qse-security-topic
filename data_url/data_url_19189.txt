As Qibo evolves we should start considering taking its quantum simulations to the next level. And to d-level quantum bits after that.
Qudit manipulation will allow Qibo users to create different kind of algorithms that could then be deployed on quantum hardware as experimental implementations of quantum computers usually allow for control of more than two states. It also has value from a quantum information perspective even before experimental implementation.
I would start with an initial Qutrit implementation and possibly build a generalization from there.
