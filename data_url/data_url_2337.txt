check/pytest should fail when there are import-time errors but it this case it incorrectly returns status code 0 and Travis marks it as "passed".
It occurred in this Travis job https://travis-ci.com/quantumlib/Cirq/jobs/224953957
This may be a more general issue with pytest: #1945
Closing as duplicate of #1945.
