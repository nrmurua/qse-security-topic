I installed qtt as a site-package part of another package.
In my setup.py I have:
However, it seems that after the installation completes successfully (after a pip install .)the qtt/exampledata/ folder is not part of my qtt site-packages.

Can someone please have a look at this?
Thank you!
The exampledata should be accesible with
The load_example_dataset is used in several example notebooks, e.g. https://qtt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/analysis/example_fermi_fitting.html
@sldesnoo-Delft @QFer
When installing qtt via 'pip install .' only the qtt 'functionality' is installed, not the docs, ipython notebooks etc. So in my opinion exampledata is also one of the components that should not be installed. When you want to run examples or unit tests you have to install in editable mode.
Or am I missing something?
@QFer You've got a good point. I tend to agree and we should remove the docs and examples from the install.
@peendebak Do you agree?
