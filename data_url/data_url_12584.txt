There's a line in the call function of the QRNN class that I think is incorrect. prev_input should be assigned inputs[4] instead of inputs[3]. Code shown below with stars around the line in question.
Good catch. @zaqqwerty can you take this on ?
I'll address this now
Awesome. I’ve read the paper and am trying to build on this for a project for class. Any chance y’all have code on the VQE Hubbard model that you can share with me?
Unfortunately no, we don’t have any VQE Hubbard stuff laying around in TFQ. Check out here: https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion and https://openfermion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/openfermion.html . You should be able to setup your circuits using OpenFermion and then just run them through TFQ.
Going to close now since the original issue is fixed now.
