The biggest problem with this right now is that we need would need to do some custom simd instructions as there is no numpy native complex32 and not all ops we need for float16 have simd instructions.
I think because this would give us an accuracy of about 1e-3, this is probably not a good idea (though that is close to some hardware!)  I'm going to close for now but we can reopen if you disagree.
