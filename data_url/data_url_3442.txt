Environment:
. Jupyter notebook at Rigetti Forest QCS Services
My program code is similar to quantum_die sample code.
Runtime error at statement
---> 67     die_compiled = qvm.compile(die_program(number_of_sides))
Error message is: **TypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'warnings'**
The same error occurs when executing the original example code under a QCS Jupyter cell:
source from: https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/blob/master/examples/quantum_die.py
When running the code on my local workstation, having active the two QVM daemons, I 'am able to execute the same code without any errors, using the QVM node simulation mode for 'Aspen-4-6Q-A'.
This is the hardcopy of the resulting Quil code to be compiled:
Also tried to disable the "warnings" at Python level, by use of statement: warnings.filterwarnings("ignore") , but still getting the same error at qc.compile(p).
Under instruction of the Rigetti support center,  I' ve executed the following commands under my QMI environment using the SSH command prompt:
source ~/.virtualenvs/venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pyquil
pip install --upgrade rpcq
Then I've connected to the Jupyter notebook doing a "Restart". I was able to successfully process my new code under a "true" lattice (reserved QPU), as well as under the QVM mode.
Thanks for the support. This issue is closed.
