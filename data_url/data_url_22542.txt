I propose doing this by right clicking on a experiment in the scheduler, and having a "request graceful termination of all experiments in the same pipeline as the one selected" option. A short text in the menu could be "Gracefully terminate all in pipeline".
Wouldn't this be more appropriately placed in the context menu in the scheduler? Terminating a complete pipeline only makes sense if there is something in that pipeline. That provides a nice context.
Yes, I was talking about the context menu of the scheduler here: "propose doing this by right clicking on a experiment in the scheduler"
Ack. Nevermind then.
