When an applet is floating, it incorrectly gets back its default size and position upon GUI restart. When an applet is docked, Qt correctly restores its size and position (minus the bug described in #287).
Log docks (which are also dynamically created by the GUI) do not have this problem.
Commenting out self.resize in _AppletDock.__init__ does not solve this problem.
objectName appears to be correctly set.
The sequence of function calls to Qt for docking and restoring state appears to be identical between log and applet docks.
@jordens can you reproduce that? Might be another WM-related bug, as this seems to be assorted with a window focus issue.
Problem not present on Windows 7 (also tested with 1d94cfd). Looks like another Qt bug.
Works fine here. Floating applets are restored to position and size.
Can't reproduce this anymore (Qt 5.7). Closing for now.
