As part of #2626 we are checking that gates satisfy gate.on(*qubits).gate == gate. To do this we need instances of the gates.  Instead of doing all of these by hand, we leverage the json test data.  In doing this there are a few gates that do not have json serialized forms, but probably should.  These include
cirq.DiagonalGate, cirq.TwoQubitDiagonalGate, cirq.ThreeQubitDiagonalGate, cirq.PauliInteractionGate, and cirq.ArithmeticGate
cirq.ArithmeticGate is an abstract class and so likely does not need serialization (and may be difficult as it represents a general reversible classical computation)
All our now handled.
