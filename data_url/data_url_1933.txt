Description of the issue
On my local machine, running pytest in a fresh virtual environment gives 162 failing tests, many of them with the same error.
How to reproduce the issue
In a fresh virtual environment, install cirq and the dev dependencies and then run pytest. For example, from the root directory of Cirq,
Note that you may need to edit dev_tools/conf/pip-list-dev-tools.txt to contain the latest mypy version, due to #3124. The pytest output is too long to reproduce here, but here is a representative test failure message:
Cirq version
0.9.0.dev
This seems to be caused by Qiskit/qiskit#760 which is specific to python 3.8.
Upgrading qiskit-aer to the latest version (0.5.2) fixes this issue. So the solution to this issue should be to upgrade the version of qiskit that we are using, which is currently 0.13.0.
Thank you @kevinsung for the issue as well as the investigation! I'll look into this!
Oh I see, this is 3.8 related. We don't run our CI against 3.8 yet. Would it be possible for you to run on 3.7?
I'll open an issue to start to look into the 3.8 upgrade.
Yeah, I can work around this issue.
This should work now since 3.8 is supported.
