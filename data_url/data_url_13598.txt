As described in Temme2017, we would like to compute the quasi-probability representation (QPR) of an "ideal gate", assuming that we have a basis of "noisy implementable gates" containing all all possible unitaries followed by a depolarizing noise channel. The optimal decomposition given such conditions is state in Temme2017 as probabilistically proceeding each gate with a Pauli (or no Pauli), with probability determined by the strength of the depolarizing channel. As such, the goal of this issue is to produce this analytically-derived optimal decomposition using the method described in the paper (rather than e.g. using a linear solver, which will be described in another issue).
