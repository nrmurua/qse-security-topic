and when I ping the IP address, it reply that 'Unable to access the target host '
I have set the IP address using artiq_mkfs flash_storage.img -s mac 00:0A:35:03:33:45 -s ip 192.168.1.170 and  artiq_flash -t kc705 -m nist_clock -f flash_storage.img proxy storage start successfully.
@mingshenli you can debug this by checking the following:
the IP address is corect and hub is fine too.  What is 'use flterm on the appropriate USB port' means and how to make sure that 'The KC705 is booting properly, and the configuration is correct '?
If you run python -m serial.tools.list_ports -v you should see an entry CP2103 USB to UART Bridge Controller - this is the KC705 serial terminal. If you don't see this, make sure you have a USB mini cable connected to the UART port on the KC705, and that the driver is installed (https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
For me, on Linux, it is /dev/ttyUSB1, if you are on windows, it will be COM<number>
On Linux you can use flterm to monitor the serial port output. On Windows you can use Putty or Realterm - use a baud rate of 115200.
After you have the serial port connected, restart the KC705 - you can do this by pressing the button SW14 on the KC705, or by running artiq_flash -t kc705 start. If you have it right, within 10 seconds you should see a page of startup messages, including a message like
you should make sure that the IP and MAC address here are correct.
ok,I will have a try, thanks.
Went there and fixed it.
