The development page currently references the old and new doc pages, but the old is deprecated or retired?
Also is it possible to generate docs for the new site in any form locally?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters

I think we thought about retiring in the past, but there were some packages depending on us that needed our RTD (or something like that) does anyone know if this is still the case ? @vtomole ?

Unfortunately no, you can run notebooks locally, but there is no way to stage them for viewing as they would appear on the site without being a Googler.

I wasn't aware of this. What would those packages be?
Is this fixed?
If the merged removal is sufficient, I think so!
