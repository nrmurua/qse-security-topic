Current Problem
In case a C++ project would need to solve some problems on a DWave computer there should be a C++ library to do this. Currently (AFAIK) code is in a form of a Python libraries. But Python is (1) very slow and (2) very inconvenient to use from C++ programs.
There should be a set of C++ libraries that do the same what Python code currently does.
Proposed Solution
Each dwave* Python sub-project should be a Python binding (wrapper) for an equivalent C++ library.
Many other projects take the same approach of having full API support in a C++ library and wrapping it in Python. This is a very beneficial approach.
Additional context
Anybody who works in HPC would be very averse to the need to call Python scripts from an otherwise high-performance program.
