We need visualization tool for quantum process.
âœ… PR #3375 Seems to be stalled which has also stalled this issue.
I'm going to close this now due to an ongoing lack of interest after it stalled.  If there's further interest in having this sort of visualisation, please feel free to open a new issue.
(imo I'm not certain that we'll necessarily be able to maintain further visualisations, so would suggest that people look to other packages for enhanced visualisation, but am willing to have further discussion on that.)
