When building an fpga image using rtl from either 'master' or 'pyton3-only' branch, there is a large timing violation in the iq2 demodulator block. The violating path is through low-pass filter and gain block. Reason could be that unlike iq0/iq1 which only have 2 stage low-pass filter, iq2 has a 4 stage low-pass filter.
Using Vivado 2020.1.

The timing violations are not just in iir and iq2 block, but in most blocks. Using Vivado 2020.1 on the python3-only branch the post_route_timing_summary.rpt says:
ie. 12000 failing endpoints ! The violating paths are located in most blocks. Seen >3 ns violations in pid0/1, iq0/1 and asg. Many violations have a large net-delay (> 8 ns), which I guess is caused by the high 91% LUT utility. Vivado seem not to be able to report delay for typical corner, which could indicate how bad the situation is on a random RP board. Situation is similar on the master branch.
Running fpga implementation with modified 0.9.3 rtl, that has 75% LUT utilization, only gives 350 failing endpoints mainly in iir block.
Has anybody seen a clean timing summary with the newest pyrpl rtl ?
