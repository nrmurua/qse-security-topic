It seems like the only way to add a complex conjugate of a gate such as  to an existing Program() is
This is neither elegant nor useful and I would suggest moving towards a syntax that looks like this:
or even
where .dagger would be a @property on the Gate class.
I agree. A little too much typing though. How about p.inst(S(0).dg)? I've thought about p.inst(Sdg(0)), but I don't know how to feel about it.
Actually, I feel like p.inst(Sdg(0)) is cleaner than all of the alternatives.
The problem with p.inst(Sdg(0)) is that it implies the manual definition of some daggered gates such as Sdg and maybe Tdg. In contrast, the syntax S(0).dg would allow daggering any kind of gate, even self-defined and parametrized gates which would be much more general in my opinion.
@markf94 , sorry about the late response. You can use daggered gates without having to use DEFGATE; check out docs on this here
Should be much more straightforward :)
