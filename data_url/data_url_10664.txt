Continuing the discussion from #278 here. In short, the proposal so far is:
 (A) Specialize DWaveSampler for QPU solvers by using client=qpu and leave solver features undefined.
 (B) Specialize LeapHybridSampler for hybrid solvers, with client=hybrid.
 (C) Introduce a new general sampler (name TBD), which will use the generic client=base, it will support structured and unstructured solvers, and it won't imply any solver features. Ideally, this sampler would be easy to subclass. Potentially implement DWaveSampler and LeapHybridSampler as such subclasses.
 (D) Specialize DWaveCliqueSampler for QPU solvers by using client=qpu and leave solver features undefined.
