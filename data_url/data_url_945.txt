Summarize the task
Currently LineInitialMapper is the only initial mapping (placement) strategy Cirq offers for routing. Adding more strategies like graph monomorphism could improve routing performance on deep circuits with a small # of qubits (graph monomorphism scales exponentially with the # of qubits).
Acceptance criteria - when is the task considered done?
The task is complete once a graph monomorphism initial mapping strategy is added and is benchmarked for comparison with TKET's implementation here https://github.com/CQCL/tket/tree/develop/tket/src/Placement
