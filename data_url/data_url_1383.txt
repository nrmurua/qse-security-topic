Description of the issue
Qiskit has a verification module that allows one to automatically generate quantum volume circuits. I want to to translate those circuits to Cirq. The problem is that the circuits generated from this module names measure as it's classical register which Cirq's QASM parser can't translate.
How to reproduce the issue
Install Qiskit on your system then run.
Cirq version
Master version
I think in _parser.py we need
Then update a few parser rules to use name instead of ID.
The qiskit library in question has been superseded: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ignis, in favor or https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments.
measure is also an invalid creg name in OPENQASM 2.0 (or at least it doesn't parse on their playground website).
@vtomole can you check if the replacement library has the same issue, and/or whether qiskit proper can parse its own output? (It looks like the underlying issue, if still there, may be in https://qiskit.org/documentation/_modules/qiskit/circuit/quantumcircuit.html#QuantumCircuit.measure_active, which seems like it should be a bug on the quiskit repo itself.)
Bug already filled Qiskit/qiskit#7866
Good find. This is a Qiskit bug. Qiskit is returning incorrect QASM. This isn't the first time Qiskit's QASM writer has gotten me in trouble: Qiskit/qiskit#8090. I've transferred this issue into a comment in your linked qiskit-terra issue. That's enough to close this.
