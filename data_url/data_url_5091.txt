Unless I've missed it and its already setup that way, can we add a few extra hetmap key checks to enable users to specify key 'backend' for a desired target tnqvm visitor? I'd like to see this so that it will more easily fit into our qcor and qcor-mlir-tool workflow - qcor -qpu tnqvm:exatn-mps big_circuit.qasm for instance.
This has been implemented, e.g. the syntax tnqvm:exatn is valid.
