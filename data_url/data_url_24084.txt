The cpw_gap does not render correctly when exported to GDS. Specifically, although the fillet of the trace is there, cpw_gap has no fillet and has square edges. Furthermore, the width of cpw_gap seems to have doubled when rendered on GDS.
Make any circuits with cpw or any elements with etched gap, then export the qiskit-metal design to a GDS file.
It is expected to see the fillet and correct width on etched gap of design elements like cpw.
I have tried using the updated version of qiskit-metal(0.1.2) to see if the above issue is resolved. The code I used to replicate the issue was taken from a "Simple CPW Meander" example given in the link: https://qiskit.org/documentation/metal/circuit-examples/B.Resonators/11-Resonator_Meander.html
code:

The code gives me the following rendered image on GUI:

When I exported this design to GDS, I used set of default options:

But after exporting to GDS, the design looks like:

The grey cpw_gap of cpw_meander still renders as sharp edged box on GDS. Updating the qiskit-metal module does not seem to resolve this issue
That is the keep-out region for cheesing.  There is an option called view_in_file which is true.  Can you change that to False and try again?

If that doesn't work, can you copy/paste the code you used?   To duplicate your situation. I don't want to re-type your code.
Changing the view_in_file to False in the no_cheese options worked!! Thank you!
Super.  I will close this issue.
