Hello, I am planning to introduce the new features of QASM 3 to my colleagues. The capabilities as described in the paper seem very powerful, and I appreciate the work done by the community. However, I've found that the for loop is not working as I expected. What should I do?

Hi @eeeeeeeason . Thanks for the report. This issue is better raised in the Qiskit repo https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit.
Also,
Screen shots in bug reports should be avoided.
Another tip: It's easy to get syntax highlighting in your code blocks.
Thanks, I found that the documents related to "for loop" have been taken down. I originally learned about qasm3 from the paper[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14722.pdf], but I found that many functions cannot be implemented[https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/build/feature-table].
Please tell me where should I go to find qasm3 that can interact with qiskit or other What about examples of running on software?
OpenQASM 3 is forward-looking in the rapidly changing field of NISQ and has not been fully implemented by any organization yet.
Amazon Braket has a public implementation of a large subset of OpenQASM 3 in their Quantum offerings.
@jwoehr @jlapeyre thanks~
