With the release of Cirq v0.12, several qsimcirq tests are now failing with error messages similar to the one below.
We need to bring qsim up-to-date with modern Cirq.
This is closely tied to the split-state simulator changes in Cirq, which are tangentially related to #101. While we will eventually want to reconcile qsimcirq intermediate-state simulation with that of Cirq, for expediency I will address this issue by simply routing around that behavior.
While this is being repaired, you can continue using qsimcirq by downgrading your Cirq installation to v0.11.
