I think cast operation from uint to bool is not clearly defined in the specification. I'm not sure following two cast operations in adder.qasm are valid or not:
(BTW, variable names (ain and bin should be a_in and b_in).)
I guess that they are
or does uint[4] a_in allow bit access with a_in[i] (as creg)?
Its unclear to me if we support bit, level access to all types. This may be difficult to implement, and casting may be more straightforward. Thoughts @blakejohnson?
bit access is added. It returns bit and cast to bool is necessary for test in a branch.
So, the following codes are valid.
