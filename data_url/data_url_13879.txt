If I run pip install pyzx followed by running the notebook, I receive various errors, presumably because the pip version is out of sync with the source, as per #42.
When I install from source and run the notebook, there are a few sections where the text doesn't accurately describe what's going on.
I should say that I would fix these myself, except:
Good find. I'll take a look.
The pip version is now pushed to 0.6.0, so the inconsistencies should be fixed now.
