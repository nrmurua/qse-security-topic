Enabling a basic validation that runs all examples on the GPU backends, the gradients example fails to make progress. Locally, everything works fine, but on the runners the values are odd:

I haven't had a chance to look further.

In .github/workflows/publishing.yml enable the /home/cudaq/examples/cpp/other/gradients.cpp example in the validation job, then manually run the workflow for a recent deployment. It would be good to find a local repro, but I don't have one right now.
The example should succeed.
Not a regression

Hi, I guess the optimization is done by Powell's COBYLA here. If yes, this is a known issue of the old version of COBYLA based on the original Fortran 77 implementation, which may get stuck in infinite loops. It is advised to switch to the PRIMA implementation of COBYLA. See #399 (comment). Thanks.
Claims to be fixed.
Gradients example has been readded to the GPU validation test suite. Closing.
