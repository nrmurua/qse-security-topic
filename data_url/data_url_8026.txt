Time evolution based on the Lindblad master equation for a time-independent Hamiltonian is guaranteed to be completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP). However, the flag iscptp returns False for the Liouvillian when calling propagator for a time-independent Hamiltonian and including a collapse operator.
I expect prop.iscptp to be True

The issue is with numerical error: the default tolerance for the computation of the propagator is 1e-8, but the tolerance for iscptp is 1e-12.
You can improve the precision of the propagator by passing options=Options(atol=1e-14, rtol=1e-14). These precisions are per internal step, not for the full evolution.  You can also lower the requirement for iscptp with qutip.settings.atol = ....
I see! That fixes the issue, thank you very much
