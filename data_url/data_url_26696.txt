Dear all,
I tried to use cp2k to reproduce previous group member's NEGF calculation who used ATK. I encountered the error  ''Unable to map the atom onto the atom (Au    9.438804   16.348399    8.899098) from the corresponding FORCE_EVAL section". What I found strange is that the Au atom mentioned above didn't appear in my input file. Please find attached my input.
Thank you for your help.
Here is my input.
Best regards,
lmx
I am sorry, but this looks like a support requests, while the issue tracker on Github is for reporting issues with the code.
Please wait until someone finds time to reply to your request on the CP2K mailinglist/forum.
The default accuracy threshold (EPS_GEO) seems to be too strict. Please try to relax it a bit.
