There is a section that says "Todo" that should be completed before it goes into the docs.  Also, there is an unused import of IBMQ that should be removed as this is not allowed in the docs build, and of course because it is not needed.
This was fixed some time ago in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/circuits_advanced/07_pulse_scheduler.ipynb.
