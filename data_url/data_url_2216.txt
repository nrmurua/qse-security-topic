If you multiply a paulisum by another paulisum (which is not currently supported), lineardict allows the computation until it fails cryptically in LinearDict.clean.
Can you give an example to reproduce this issue @trevormccrt ?
I believe that PauliSum now supports multiplication so this is obsolete.
Example
returns a valid cirq.PauliSum
