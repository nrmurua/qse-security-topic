Description
Common methods for serialization (json, bson) will convert tuples to lists. When using these with the BQM serialization, everything works well because when deserializing, variable labels that are lists get converted to tuples. However, this behavior is not implemented for SampleSet.
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
SampleSet serialization should behave the same way for variable labels as BQMs.
