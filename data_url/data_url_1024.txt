Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
I was trying to export a circuit that was compiled to a sqrtISWAP gateset to inspect in quirk for a presentation. However the export failed.
Describe the solution you'd like
It would be nice if the quirk exporter could handle unknown gates automatically, quirk does have the ability to create custom gates from unitaries.
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
Use the prefer_unknown_gate_to_faliure=True results in too many of these gates, but at least the URL is generated:

Maybe I could do the custom gate creation and replacement in the URL manually, but I probably won't :)
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
