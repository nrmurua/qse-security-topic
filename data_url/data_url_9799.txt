Application
Sometimes we want to combine samplesets but still track which sampleset they originally came from.
Proposed Solution
Something like
Additional Context
In general we are not supporting additional data vectors very well, for instance in concatenate itself. So need to somehow handle cases like:
Something like this might be handy since a user may have their own id scheme:
samples = dimod.concatenate({id: sampler.sample(bqm) for id, bqm in bqms.items()})
Love the suggestion @jberwald .
On the one hand, it sort of breaks the API because the current behaviour (if samplesets were hashable) would be to iterate on the keys. On the other hand I want that functionality and can imagine myself using it.
A couple things to work though:
@JoelPasvolsky might also have an opinion (I think he has wanted this sort of thing in some of the jupyter notebooks he has been writing).
Another thought: If track_source=[list of id's] then one could do,
I like your idea of pushing the id into the record, btw! That would be very clean.
Something similar but a little different, I linked it: dwavesystems/dwave-system#180
But yes, this would be good too
