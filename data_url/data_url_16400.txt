I would expect to be able to access Statevector data like:
but this is not currently possible because __getitem__ is not defined to grab from state.data.
Can I work on this?
Oh, I was waiting for permission. Should I just add the fix next time?
Actually, no. That's my bad. I was already working on another issue regarding Statevector #4934, saw this thread, and thought to do both fixes in one branch. When I noticed you had already asked for permission, it was too late. Sorry.
is there any pending PR on this issue?
@1ucian0: #7095
