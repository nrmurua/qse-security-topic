Add a notebook in the examples of the documentation on ZNE for VQE for H2, as discussed in #775, to provide an example from the Mitiq paper that is self-consistent and useful for users.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
@rmlarose  Shall we add this issue to the next milestone?
Solving this issue would be a quick way to add examples as it seemed a priority request from the community.
Just a note that maybe the only work is that the notebook would need to be converted in .myst format.
