It seems that synchronous compilation call can't handle more than a (arguably not too big/complex) circuit composed of ~1400 identity operations. Is this considered expected?
The _async versions of the calls can handle this situation. Maybe the TimeoutError should suggest using the _async calls?
As an example, see the following script:
This Issue still persists. The compile method simply yields a TimeoutError without any reference to the compile_async method. Please implement this since it will save people a lot of time.
@markf94 @tbabej sorry for the late response. Hope the new local Quil compiler is working well so far! Will reach out for feedback.
I'm curious whether this is fixed by the local quilc
@mpharrigan I think it was. I just tried the following example (with pyQuil 2.0/downloadable quilc):
[out] PyQuilExecutableResponse(attributes={'native_quil_metadata': {}, 'num_shots': 1}, program='PRAGMA EXPECTED_REWIRING "#(1 2 3 4 5 0 6 7 8)"\nRX(pi) 0\nPRAGMA CURRENT_REWIRING "#(1 2 3 4 5 0 6 7 8)"\nHALT\n')
Seems to work fine- though the compiler of course will get rid of the identity gates.
