This may be very fundamental but I tried implementing it by using online resources before posting the question here.
I want to plot the dynamics of an atom in the vacuum first, where it's revolving around z-axis on the Bloch sphere.
And then plot the dynamics with a driving term and see the orientation of the atom in the Bloch sphere.
Maybe this is helpful. You will just need to change the Hamiltonian.
