After lots of caculations, an issue occurred:
So, I opened my server's log,it showed lots of:
cc1plus: warning: command line option ‘-Wstrict-prototypes’ is valid for C/ObjC but not for C++ [enabled by default]
And an error:
gcc: error trying to exec '/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.8/cc1plus': execv: Argument list too long
After killing the kernel, open the notebook again...Everything is ok...I'm puzzled now...
So did the simulations complete the second time?  Or did it abort in the same location?
It aborted at the 12nd loop which consist of 200 sub-loop.
see:

Closing this as there is too little information to help out. @caidish Feel free to reopen it if you can copy paste the whole notebook and give some more details.
