Hardware under development will permit measurements annotated with the memory addresses to which the measured runtime-values are stored, i.e.
(for reasons having to do with the way Pulses are compiled, it's more convenient at this time to create a new method to create these "annotated measurements" rather than just adding another kwarg to MEAS, although this might be revisited in the future.  If, in the future, all measurements are annotated, then we won't need to distinguish them.)
