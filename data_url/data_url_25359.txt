Once separation of workflow and electron statuses is done, the electron level statuses need to be updated to accommodate executor dependent statuses. In this case the following status definitions will be updated:
REGISTERING - Connecting to the Dask cluster and submitting the task
PENDING_BACKEND - Corresponds to Dask's future's states - Released, Waiting, and No-Worker
STARTING - Corresponds to Dask's future's state Processing
RUNNING - Corresponds to Dask's future's state Memory
The classes for these statuses will need to be created similar to status classes defined in covalent/_shared_files/statuses.py. Then, in order to save the status, one can do:
This will propagate the status updation to the DB.
