Description
In a Python 3.10 env, trying to build docs terminates in an error: ImportError: cannot import name 'Union' from 'types' 
This is a known sphinx error that was fixed in sphinx==4.2: sphinx-doc/sphinx#9562
Currently our requirements file limits the version of sphinx: 
At least for Py3.10.2, C++ docs are generated fine with sphinx==4.4.
I think we can change the requirement on sphinx version now (py 3.10 --> sphinx>=4.2 etc).
