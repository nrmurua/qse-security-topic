There is not an example of the proper device_db.pyon entry for Thorlabs T-Cube. It took me an hour to figure out that the target_name is "tdc001". Please update the controller usage examples to show the proper device_db.pyon entry.

5947f54 and a560676 make this parameter optional for single-target servers (all controllers at the moment), and display the list of targets when an incorrect target is specified.
