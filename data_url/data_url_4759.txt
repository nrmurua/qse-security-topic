The numba package has been introduced into SF, however, no version is pinned in requirements.txt.
Expected behavior: (What you expect to happen)
Can import Strawberry Fields well.
Actual behavior: (What actually happens)
An error is raised related to numba.
Reproduces how often: (What percentage of the time does it reproduce?)
Each time SF is being used.
System information: (post the output of import stawberryfields as sf; sf.about())
If numba is not installed, then a simple numba import error is emitted.
Since numba is a hard requirement of SF, we should also add it to setup.py (no version pinning needed here for now)
Closing this as #305 got merged.
