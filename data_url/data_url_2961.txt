If the simulator automatically and transparently decomposes Hadamards into supported gates, should we also do the same thing for calls to the service?
I think we've found that doing these transforms automatically causes confusion.  Suggest we close this issue?
This isn't really in the scope of Cirq.  This is tracked on service side where we do proper integration testing.
