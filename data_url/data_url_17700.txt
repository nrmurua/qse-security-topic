Currently, the pass check_map set the property is_mapped as True if the circuit/dag is "mapped" to a given couple map. The meaning of "mapped" in this context does not consider direction. That means:
is "mapped" to [0]->[1].
Since check_map already transverse the DAG, it's kinda for free to also check for direction and set a property if it is. I'm not sure how to call this property. Maybe is_direction_mapped? In the example, is_mapped=True and  is_direction_mapped=False.
@ajavadia maybe you can comment here the convention to the names in each stage of mapping?
