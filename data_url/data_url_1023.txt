How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
v0.12.0.dev
I think this happens because project_id and gatesets are set as None. I agree this should probably raise instead of returning a device with no edges. @dstrain115 Please verify that this is post 1.0, since it's a project health task (raise if API is used in a way it's not supposed to).
