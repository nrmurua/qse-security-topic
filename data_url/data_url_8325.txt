I've consulted the problem with the Scipy team and they suggested that:
IndexMixin got moved and changed in gh-7827. It was private though, so QuTiP should not be using it.
So would it be possible to update the QuTiP and to fix this problem? Thanks.

Yep, I know that this is caused by the newest version of Siipy. But is there any possibilities to upgrade the qutip. It seems that it is difficult to ask the scipy team to "downgrade" the scipy, isn't it/

But thanks anyway. QuTiP really helps a lot and I'm looking forward to a version that is compatible with the newest scipy.
You can choose the scipy version to install: conda install scipy=1.2.1 or pip install scipy==1.2.1.
This issue has been fixed by #1000, but don't you think there should be a new release of QuTiP to integrate it? A minor release integrating only the corresponding commit could be enough.
There is nothing more frustrating for a beginner than when the installation instructions fail. I can grantee that most QuTiP users are not expert of packages dependencies and follow installation instructions without understanding them.
Agreed. Weâ€™re working on a release soon.
@ElieGouzien the new QuTiP release solves this. See the change log for more information on new features.
