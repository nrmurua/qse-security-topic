So really there is exactly 0 documentation and this needs to change.
Documenation catagories:
Application level is pretty much done, with some tweaks I am sure in bound. Code level is pretty sparse, but there, going to continue to tweak that. The wiki has been started and basic layout created. Need a lot of content so going to take a bit to finish.
