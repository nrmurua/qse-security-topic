A symbolic link is in place in qiskit-sdk-py after moving tools into the folder qiskit.
When checking out qiskit-sdk-py under Windows the symbolic link is being converted into a textfile. Hence I get a NotFoundError when loading any tools.
Add "qiskit." to tools import statements.
I also submitted a pull request in qiskit-sdk-py and double checked all occurences of tools imports.
After merging that request I suggest to remove the symbolic link.
I know but lets talk in that. I think i want you to push it to r0.3 and we need to update pip.
Thanks
updates are pushed to r0.3, closing this issue
