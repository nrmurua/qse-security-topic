The commutation rules for controlled "inversion" buffers are not correct for single bit phase gates, at least. On master, phase gates assume that they will commute with all of these buffers, but this is no longer true since adding handling for "inversions" with buffers. I'm working on a fix in #261.
Fixed by #261
Closely related to the above, a particular decomposition of CCNOT does not work reliably on QUnit. This will also be addressed as part of #261.
Also fixed by #261.
