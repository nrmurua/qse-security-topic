With on-going efforts to move state off of Instruction instances (e.g. #10314 , #7624 ), (and in preparation for a later move to something like qiskit.qasm2.dumps ), the Instruction classes which implement .qasm and associated methods should have that code inlined into QuantumCircuit.qasm and those methods deprecated.
When/if someone is considering the move to qiskit.qasm2.dump, note that there's a couple of related PRs in flight: #9956 and #9945.
I'm trying to understand what we need/want here. Eventually we want all of the following, perhaps not all is needed at the same time.
EDIT: It looks like all methods named qasm for Instruction and its subclasses should be deprecated, with the strings being built elsewhere.
Is it true that we want all qasm2 export methods named qasm to be removed eventually, except QuantumCircuit.qasm?
It looks like QuantumCircuit.qasm relies quite a bit on data in QuantumCircuit. It's not the most objectionable method in coding style that makes everything a method if at all possible. That said, I support moving it out of QuantumCircuit to qiskit.qasm2.dumps. I'm not a fan of huge classes. However, it might make sense to keep the data specific to gates near the rest of the code for gates. And then access this from QuantumCircuit.qasm or qiskit.qasm2.dumps.
Can or should this be done in stages?  Item 1 in particular is a problem because we don't want to expose it (because it allows overriding for custom instructions ?) Does fixing 1 make sense by itself ?  Or do 1 and 2 need to be done together? If only 1 is to be done, the neatest way to do it is to more or less copy the code from Instruction.qasm to a plain function for internal use only. This is done here:
How will  qiskit.qasm2.dumps be implemented? Will we exchange the methods for a function qiskit.qasm2.dumps that uses a series of if isinstance ?
These are the relevant methods named qasm that I find.

If I understand correctly, all the qasm2 export code, in particular details of the representation of the objects should be moved above. But in the next stage, or perhaps skipping this first stage altogether, move them to qiskit.qasm2

Here (above) super().qasm calls QuantumCircuit.qasm.

EDIT: I removed QuantumRegister and ClassicalRegister from this list because these methods are already deprecated, and the code moved into QuantumCircuit.qasm.

I suppose QuantumRegister.qasm should also be moved to the single function doing conversion. This, even though it should be unrelated to singleton gates.
