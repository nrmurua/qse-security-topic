There are a few issues with graphic capacities in Qutip.
The interface is not uniform. Most functions take 'fig' and 'ax', but hilton only takes 'ax' but no 'fig'. Maybe one third of the function in visualization accepts 'title' and half a 'figsize'. The order of these options is also inconsistent, 'fig', 'ax' can be the first parameters or the last... As seen in matrix_histogram updated - imporved the styling optionsÂ #1573, some want more control so matrix_histogram accepts options. I am all for more control, but being available for only one function feels wrong. On the bloch side, there is a mismatch between add_vectors, add_points, which takes color and alpha as input, and add_arc, add_line which takes **kwargs.
The colorblind mode should works everywhere, but presently only hilton support it.
So for v5 release, the interface of all these should be clean and uniform, with proper tests.

I agree that unifying the interface would be ideal for QuTiP 5.0. I was aiming to do so with Bloch and also clean-up the code on my way. For tomography, visualization and distribution, we may be able to include them in the Unitary Hack if we make a more detailed issue with the requirements (provided there is still enough room for new bounties).
@nathanshammah would know if we can add new bounties, but I believe the deadline was last week.
