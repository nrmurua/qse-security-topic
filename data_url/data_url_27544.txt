In the present version 5c023a2 braket compiled in Fugaku with libc++ doesn't work.
I have checked that the present version 9c545f6 of braket can be compiled in Fugaku with -stdlib=libc++ option. However, the speed of execution is slower than that of a binary compiled without -stdlib=libc++ option.
Although I don't understand the difference of speed, I would like to close this issue because this bug has been removed (I don't know when it is removed...).
