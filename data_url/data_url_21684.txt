This seems to be a problem specific to the typing module of Python 3.5. The problem is gone with the new typing module in 3.7 that does not have this __extrahook__ method anymore (maybe for this reason?)
We will most likely upgrade the conda packaging for Python 3.7 (#652) as part of a NIST contract, but in the meantime are you able to use ARTIQ-5 + Linux + Nix, which already supports 3.7?
I'm probably stuck with windows for now, but I can work around it by just not importing typing and removing any type hints from my functions.
For anyone else who finds this issue, I used to use
But, on pycharm at least,
also results in useful autocompletion.
Type hints for function parameters can be moved to the docstring with
@charlesbaynham Is this also fixed with the new Py3.7 packages?
Yes, this is fixed!
