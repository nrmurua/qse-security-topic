For performance reasons, Quirk avoids representing the circuit state as a density matrix. Thus using the deferred measurement principle hack to do measurement.
Another possible hack is to randomly switch between post-selecting on a measurement result being true and false, with a probability that matches the measurement's expectation. After all, that's what measurement really acts like in practice. This would be easy to implement.
The main snag here is that this gate will act very differently from every other gate in Quirk, and it could easily cause confusion w.r.t. no signalling. As such the main issue is how to present it.
