The initial pybind interface accepted lists of strings. Is the intended behaviour now with files like in the example from tests?
I am assuming this is the case, and will change my entire code accordingly in the PR.

No, it will not. I can include your original way to pass circuit/grid/ordering to pybind to avoid to break what you've done. Also, if you have other suggestions, I can try to implement them.
Thank you! No need to change. I have almost finished rewriting and redesigning my code.
At any rate, I've just added the options --circuit/--ordering/--grid so that user can specify the input as a vector of strings. Sorry if you had to rewrite part of your code :(
