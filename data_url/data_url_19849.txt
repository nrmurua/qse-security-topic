The run_oopsc.py file has been refactored. It should be updated in the Readme file.
If possible, I'd suggest having also one basic example that produces a plot without any additional command line appended command. I.e., typing
generates a plot / intended outcome. I wonder whether a configuration / settings file could help to store command line configurations that one is re-using (e.g., 8 -l planar -px 0.03 -pmx 0.03 -i 1000).
