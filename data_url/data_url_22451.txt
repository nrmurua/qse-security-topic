I was trying to use flterm but it's basically not responding.
rabi@68810MAGTRAPVM:~/artiq-dev$ flterm /dev/ttyUSB2
I've tried the other USB ports and power cycling and resetting the FPGA but I'm not getting any response from it.
These are the USB ports listed,
If I try /dev/ttyUSB0 I get
But no response from ttyUSB1 or 2. The user (rabi) has been added to dialout.
Can you get any output using cat /dev/ttyUSBN?
I get this if I try that,
Right, I forgot you can't do this to ttys using cat. Nevermind what I said.
Works fine here.
Are you sure this isn't just some VM USB bug? This happened regularly when I visited NIST. Try rebooting the VM.
I tried it briefly on a linux computer that we have and had the same problem but I'll look into it again tomorrow.
Please first identify which serial device you want to use instead of guessing. E.g. a) use the one that appears if you plug in the relevant cable, b) use ls /dev/serial/by-id, c) use dmesg etc.
All version numbers (gateware, runtime, artiq) as well, please.
Can you also try with gtkterm and/or the C flterm?
And also are you actually booting the device when you do this? Do the leds blink?
Okay, so it works now after I restarted the virtual machine again. Not sure why it didn't when I had restarted it before. Thanks.
