Btw, is sphinx-build missing qiboteam/qibo/actions/runs/4342411482/jobs/7583613358?
Different problem: sphinx-build should be part of the Sphinx package, that is present

We should specify them in the workflow extras, as done in the other two workflows:

This has a firs part to be performed in the workflows repo, since the docs building workflow has the inputs.poetry-extras key inside https://github.com/qiboteam/workflows/blob/0aac7f146611b4e4bf05a35758658af60ff86a80/.github/workflows/build-docs.yml#L50, but not exposed.
It should be propagated to the workflow in this repo, and passing --with docs, similar to what is done in the tests one.
Is someone looking into this?
I am asking this because I would like to release 0.1.12 soon, and I believe that this bug will block the documentation generation.
Yes, I am working on it.
