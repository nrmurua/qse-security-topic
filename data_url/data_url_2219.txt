Basically this would involve copy-pasting the code from src/math/FormulaParser.js in Quirk and translating it into python. The goal is functional equivalence (i.e. bug parity).
This is a good idea because sympy's parser has a lot of exploitable properties, e.g. you can easily cause it to take hours to parse a string.
