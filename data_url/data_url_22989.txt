We should be able to build a nice, direct interface from the Redpitaya usb port to this and thereby boost the resolution even further. The problem is the bandwidth (200 kHz max). If we find similar pluggable modules, its the perfect complement. Otherwise, this is the first thing to develop to make the RedPitaya a serious competition to commercial spectrum analyzers (in addition to a mixer and microwave source) etc.
