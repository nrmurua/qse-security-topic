When I was trying to write an objective function where the sum of squares needed to be minimized I realized the energy was close to the square of sums instead. Then I looked at the cqm.objective and noticed that the coefficients of linear variables are added to their quadratic coefficients.
It actually works like this: 5x^2 - 3x = 2x
Here is a simple example that reproduces the problem. Let's say we have this objective function:

The expanded form will be:

Hi @BehrouzSohrabi,
if in the expanded form above you use x_i^2 = x_i (because a binary variable squared is equal to itself), you notice that the coefficient obtained are correct!
For example: 'x_1': -120 and ('x_1, 'x_1'): 29. The sum of the two coefficients is -91 which is exactly what you obtained.
Thanks for your comment @alexzucca90
You're right. That shouldn't be the cause of the problem. I'll keep looking.
