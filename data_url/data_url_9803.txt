Application
It would be useful to be able to add two overlapping sample sets together.
Proposed Solution
Something like
The case that needs be considered is recalculating the energies. We avoid that problem in #445 because the samples are disjoint. The 'easiest' approach would be to simply add the energies as in #445. Adding makes sense when the sample sets are generated by two different bqms, but that might be confusing for users who are updating based on generating the samples for a sub-bqm.
