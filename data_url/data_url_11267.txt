Hi all,
besides the "unitary_cc.py" file, I was wondering whether there is already code, which takes as input a reference state \rho{init} = |\Psi_{ref}><\Psi_{ref}| as well as the Hamiltonian, the number of electrons and the number of spin-orbitals/qubits and then performs a VQE type optimization, outputting the optimized approximate ground state as well as the corresponding energy?
Sry, if this has been asked before and it slipped my attention.
Cheers,
Michael.
Functionality for simulating VQE circuits fits within the scope of plugin libraries that combine with circuit composition frameworks (an example would be OpenFermion-ProjectQ or OpenFermion-Forest but those have limited functionality). In fact, the Google team will be launching a new plugin that does have the functionality you ask for very, very soon. We'll be sure to make this plugin visible from the front page as soon as its ready.
