Based on slack conversation at https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/C01R8KP5WP7/p1669333180117889, appears the latest version of Ansys does not work with Metal/pyEPR.
The workaround is to use Ansys version prior to 2022 R2.
Tutorial 4.02-Eigenmode-and-EPR has comm error when using Ansys 2022 R2.
No comm errors.
Since there is a workaround for using the comm port, and an effort is being made for the pyaedt renderer, the this can be closed.
