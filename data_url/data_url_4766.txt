The return of strawberryfields.decompositions.rectangular_symmetric(unitary) is only two values long and not three, as might be expected from its test function https://github.com/XanaduAI/strawberryfields/blob/master/tests/frontend/test_decompositions.py#L308.
Expected behavior: (What you expect to happen)
I expect tlist, _, _, = strawberryfields.decompositions.rectangular_symmetric(unitary) to give me a tlist.
Actual behavior: (What actually happens)
Instead, I am told that there are not enough values to unpack.
Reproduces how often: (What percentage of the time does it reproduce?)
100%
In fact, the test itself appears to fail.

@heltluke same as issue #192?
@co9olguy related, but also a v0.11 v0.12 issue, I believe.
I believe this is now solved in SF master as #196 has been merged.
