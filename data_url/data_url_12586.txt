Like batch_util which is designed for fast parallel calls to Cirq simulator/Sampler objects we should make engine_util which is designed for careful and efficient calls to Cirq Sampler objects to ensure maximum compatibility with Cirq's engine interface. This will need to wait until we finish #185 .
