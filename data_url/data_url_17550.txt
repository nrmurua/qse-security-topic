qiskit.mapper._mappererror.MapperError: 'internal error'
The QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister and QuantumCircuit are intialised when a object is created for the user-defined class I have made. The code ran without errors on the local machine and on the hpc. But when I tried to run it on the ibm Qx_16 it showed this error.
I expect to get values of get_counts() for 20 different values for a given parameter. For each value a new object is created and the entire circuit is simulated.
The problem could be because I create a new object every iteration of the loop. I made sure to delete the object after each iteration though,
Hi @isolatedinformation could you provide some more information about the circuit you were trying to execute when this error occurred?
My circuit consisits of 9 qubits and 9 cbits to record thier outcomes. Basically, I was trying to simulate a noisy channel and perform error correction to retireve the initial message. The noisiness of the channel was tuned by a parameter \gamma. For diiferent values of \gamma, I wanted the statistics of the measuremnt outcome and plotted them. For instance, this attached image was the statistics I got for 20 different values of gamma when run on the HPC.

I created a class to make sure the entire circuit was re initilased for every iteration of \gamma since each iteration is independent of the other. The objects of the class helped achieve this objective.
If it's still not clear, I can email my code to you.
I think this is the same issue as #1871
