Using 1.0 rc3 on Windows, trying to access data_set variables in the kernel spits out an error.
For the following experiment,
I get the error message,
Outside the kernel it's fine. It's not a totally necessary for us I think, but it could be nice to access those variables during the kernel if you want to switch the frequency of a laser between its cooling and detection frequencies during an experiment.
In short: the problem is that get_dataset does not specify a return type, and it defaults to None. So, when it returns something other than None, it's an error.
To work around this, wrap get_dataset like this:
There is a section in the manual on this but it isn't up yet.
Or define self.get_laser_frequency().
