I tried to recreate environment based on an old artiq flake (around 1 yr old). Pypi no longer hosted source package of llvmlite that was used in that flake, so it was impossible to recreate environment without changing the flake, which isn't good for reproducibility.
Drop fetchPypi from flake, instead use e.g. fetchFromGithub. Currently only sphinxcontrib-wavedrom package uses pypi.
Github repositories can be deleted just like Pypi archives, so this does not sound like a solution.
Hydra caches and serves some sources, but they can get garbage-collected after the package is built. Maybe patching/configuring Hydra to reliably download relevant sources and exclude them from garbage collection (by adding them to gcroots) could be a good solution.
See https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2022-11-03-nixpkgs-fetch-all-sources.html for some ideas.
And https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-06-18-software-heritage/ - not sure how widely this is currently deployed for nixpkgs.
