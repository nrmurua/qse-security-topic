Decompose creates multiple new gates if custom gates are nested, could those be removed?
As I'm working through improving my circuits I have been using decompose to observe what I'm trying to make against the reference. When I nest gates like so
gate a ....{ gate b.... ....} gate b ... { ... } 
when I decompose this circuit, my gate declarations turn into where I have an extra gate b whenever I call gate a like so
gate a .... gate b ... gate b_q6u647664356 .... 
Would it be possible to add something that suppresses this?
Please could you provide a complete but minimal code example that produces the behaviour you're seeing?
Sure!
This has four gates that decompose to eight. It could be shown with just two but some of the structure is harder to see.

Perhaps this is a little bit of an A/B problem - the extra re-definitions are actually only added by the OpenQASM 2 exporter, as a safety mechanism because of problems with how parameterised gates are handled in it, and the rest of Qiskit Terra.  We can't really remove that without causing more serious problems elsewhere in the exporter right now (though we do hope to change that in the near future).
If the goal is just to observe the circuit, you might find QuantumCircuit.draw to be a clearer option.  For example, given your input circuit as qc, I can do:
This form shows a little more clearly which operations logically need to follow others, because you can trace the path of each qubit.  Perhaps that's enough for you?
Ok, thank you.
I have been working with the drawing and the Qasm together.
