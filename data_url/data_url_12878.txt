In your nisq benchmarks, there is one called adder. Can you specify how this circuit is an adder? Is it the same with this? What are the qubits A, B, Cin, Cout?
It is an adder, I can't find a resource that describes this method, but if you look here you can see the circuit, q[0] and q[1] are A and B, q[2] is Cin. q[3] is Cout.  You can treat the output of q[2] and q[3] can be treated as the result of the adder with q[3] as the most significant bit, and the q[2] as the least significant bit.
The X at the beginning of the circuit are just initializations.
