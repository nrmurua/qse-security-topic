There are a great many compilation routines which have a guard which encodes "these two instructions act on the same qubits, up to permutation", typically written (subsetp (list p q) (list r s)) or (member r (list p q)). This pattern is so common that we should teach it to the automatic fuzzer, rather than writing a slew of manual fuzzers.
This is a sub-issue of #368 and is related to previous work in #518.
