Description
If variable labels that were not present in the original BQM are passed into BQM.relabel_variables, then they are ignored (which seems reasonable to me). However, SampleSet.relabel_variables will raise an error in the same situation.
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
I think these should certainly be consistent. Personally, I like the BQM.relabel_variables behavior of ignoring unused labels more.
I agree, will fix
