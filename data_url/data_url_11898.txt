Maybe check this unit test out which sets up initial parameters for VatQITE and works https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/81964e649938ce7b201364013e4fe17098e4533c/test/python/algorithms/time_evolvers/variational/test_var_qite.py#L189
According to docs
initial_parameters (Mapping[Parameter, float] | Sequence[float]) â€“ Initial parameter values for the ansatz.
So it should be a Sequence (list) of float values, which will give the values in the order of the Parameters they are returned by parameters, or a Mapping (dictionary) which allows you to state which parameter gets which value explicitly, rather than implicitly by the list.
I have implemented it on a 5-vertex MaxCut Problem
QITE Maxcut 5-vertex
With the Hamiltonian
QITE Maxcut 5-vertex Hamiltonian
Then I print the evolution result
QITE Maxcut 5-vertex evolution
If I want to know the minimum eigenvalue of the system, like QAOA, what should I write the code?
