The matrix-class of numpy is currently being deprecated. I therefore get the following warning when running the below example using numpy>=1.15.0:
Example:
Yes, we currently suppress this warning

The idea was waiting until Python2.7 is depricated so that everyone switches to Python3.5+ which allows to use @ for matrix multiplications (for which we currently can use * by using numpy.matrix)...
But I don't mind from changing already before, e.g., in the context of #282
Any thoughts?
An option would be to use numpy.dot instead of @ if you don't want to wait for Python2.7 to be deprecated.
