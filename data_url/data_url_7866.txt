Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
The dimension argument of qutip operators are quite inconsistent in the naming, type and description. Here are a few examples picked from the functions doc page:
Is there a reason for this apparent disorder? I'd be happy to propose a PR.
Describe the solution you'd like
Harmonise the naming, type and description of the operators dimension argument.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Even if not all operators are meant to work on composite Hilbert spaces, harmonising the naming and docstring would already be helpful.
Additional context
Cc @francois-marie for indicating the issue.
We can maybe make a distinction between operators that act on any Hilbert space, including composite Hilbert space, (like qeye) vs operators that act on a specific Hilbert space (like momentum or num). The first would take a dimensions: int or list of ints as argument, and the second N: int.
Thank you for pointing, these functions were added and modified over years and it would be a good idea to unify the documentation.
However we are short handed, so it will probably wait until we rework the dimension representation in a future major release
( #1476). We are open to help until then.
@Ericgig can i work on this issue
Hi @soma2000-lang,
Yes, it would be a great help.
Is someone working on it? if not can I work on this?
As far as I know, no one is actively working on it. Any help would be appreciated.
can you suggest what kind of convention I should change it to?
@Ericgig I have implemented the enhancement required please have a look.
@Ericgig Made the suggested changes please have a look.
