There are two ways to construct a chip specification. The general case is through the machinery of chip-reader.lisp, which takes an ISA description in JSON format. There are also some helpful routines in chip-specification.lisp, which are used to construct some of the basic/default chip architectures (e.g. everything involved in build-nq-linear-chip).
These latter routines are alluring but do not work robustly, For example, if one wanted a linear chip supporting both CZ and SWAP operations natively, adding the line
in the appropriate place in build-nq-linear-chip would not work (one will see a later failure in find-shortest-compiler-path).
Here I would request some general improvements in this area, allowing for easy procedural construction of chips without recourse to the JSON middleman.
Doesn't (build-nq-linear-chip n :architecture '(:CZ :SWAP)) achieve that?
Yes, I was misusing install-link-onto-chip
Can we close this, or is there still something to be done?
