works fine, but if I replace the last line with
I get
@ampolloreno @stylewarning Any ideas?
Pushing a fix to quilc
quilc could handle this more gracefully than a fatal error, & @notmgsk's changes will fix that. On the other hand, his fixes will strip the PRAGMAs from the reply program, and I think that the API itself prevents us from returning a reply with them re-inserted. Someone—probably pyQuil—ought to either warn the user that this is happening or otherwise correct the results.
Would the fix also make this
work?
The quilc fix will require you to do those steps in a different order:
quilc (which gets hit during apply_clifford_to_pauli no longer balks on PRAGMAs, but it drops them from its output, which means the READOUT-POVM directives won't survive.
@ecpeterson The noisy readout is a property of the program, not of the PauliTerm, so I don't think the reordering is necessary.
I'm worried only that apply_clifford_to_pauli doesn't copy extra Program metadata from its input p to its output p_conj. If it does, then: great!
(Upon inspection, the situation seems even goofier than I'd thought: p_conj is a PauliTerm, not a Program.)
