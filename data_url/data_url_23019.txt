The custom lockbox model has a custom calibration function. Clicking the calibrate button in the GUI returns the error: "AttributeError: 'CustomInputClass' object has no attribute get_stats_from_curve".
This error can be traced to line 39 of pyrpl/software_modules/lockbox/models/custom_lockbox_example.py
Another simple to fix error is in line 37 (sweep.acquire() returns a second object)
replacing lines 33 to 39 with the following fixes the problem
I would also suggest to move custom_lockbox_example.py to the pyrpl_user_dir/lockbox directory to facilitate lockbox design for non-developers
Hi Bob, thanks for the feedback. This is a good suggestion, thanks. If you'd have time to create a PR with this change that would accelerate the integration into pyrpl a lot, otherwise I'll put this on my long todo-list. Thanks!
I put up a pull request with the fix mentioned. I don't know how to edit the setup to add the code to the user_dir
merged the fix
