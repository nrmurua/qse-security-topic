It seems there is an new releases of SimulaQron, v3.0.4 on PyPI. However users will fail to install it for the lack of some files (Please refer to Actual Result section).
pip install simulaqron
The installed simulaqron and cqc are ready to pass simulaqron.tests() unit tests and the corrRNG example.
@tai271828 Due to a typo only the tar.gz was uploaded to pypi but not the .whl. This is now fixed, see #205 and the wheel is also on pypi. After some reading it seems to be some inconsistencies between including files in the wheel (bdist) and source (sdist), see https://stackoverflow.com/a/14159430/10566440. I tried to use the MANIFEST.in for the sdist, however this fails on the CI test on macos due to permission problems, as you can see in your pull request. Furthermore, it seems as if the command-line-interface is actually not properly working when using the tar.gz version of the package. An option would be to only use the wheel. I'm not sure if there are any disadvantages of this.
Anyway you can now try to install simulaqron again. Note that you might need to use the --no-cache flag.
Thanks for the reply. To distribute the package in wheel format makes pretty much sense to me. It is an newer format.
Besides, I successfully installed simulaqron (v3.0.4) (along with cqc v3.0.2) now. Thanks for re-distributing the package.
