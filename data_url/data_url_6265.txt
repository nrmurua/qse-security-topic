I get a crash when I run the simulator from Jupyter notebook, with an error message that I don't understand. The same code runs alright outside of Jupyter notebook.
Someone else has already encountered the same and provided an accurate description: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50611414/jupyter-notebook-always-gives-brokenprocesspool-error-while-executing-qiskit-cod
Do not crash, or at least crash with a meaningful message.
Problem was solved when I restarted my kernel.
