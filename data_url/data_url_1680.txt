Description of the issue
On this documentation page:
https://quantumai.google/reference/python/cirq/experiments/xeb_fitting/characterize_phased_fsim_parameters_with_xeb_by_pair
if you click "View source on GitHub" it does not go to a live link.
Oh, I think I know what's happening - the API reference generator has the wrong prefix - it still thinks things are under cirq - but they are in fact under cirq-core/cirq... This is an easy fix for cirq-core stuff but a bit trickier for cirq.google stuff... I'll work on it!
Actually I'll reopen this until we published the site.
