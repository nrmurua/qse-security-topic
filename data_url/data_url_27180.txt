This happens with the ref/Makefile intact:
After pointing the compiler at the correct location of the OpenSSL-1.1.1 (there's no other usable OpenSSL on this box, except for OpenSSL-3.0 Dev master):
the code in ref/ builds but crashes:
The problem appears to be stack alignment that gets screwed up by the Xcode compilers - from the crash report:
This workaround (adding -ffrestanding flag) helps:
and produces desirable results:
Switching from Xcode clang to Macports-installed clang-mp-9.0 alleviated the need to add -ffreestanding flag.
Similar problem with avx2/ code, for the same reason ("stack not 16-byte aligned").
Compiling with Macports-installed clang-mp-9.0, or adding -ffreestanding flag resolved it here as well.
Finally, the following patch allows build and tests succeed using Xcode-11.4 clang:
I took the liberty of adding const where it belonged and the required header files where they were missing. Also, re-ordered the headers.
