Our Implementaton corresponds to the BIKE_Spec.2020.05.03.1.pdf spec, whereas the latest specification is BIKE_Spec.2022.10.10.1.  The latest specification features a new vector sampling technique that results in new KATs.
@crockeea Is there anyone from your team who is able to help with updating BIKE in liboqs to the newest version?
