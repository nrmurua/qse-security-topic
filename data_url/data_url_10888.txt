Hi Guys,
Got qbsolv to build on windows just like the ree bsdbuild.
I'm facing a problem with qbsolv. qbsolv  on windows command line doesn't converge when given the same input file as on free bsd on the mac.
Source is the same for both file streams and the only difference is the compiler, one is g++ and the other is Visual Studio 14 2015. Wanted to know why this is the case, I'm trying the command line version of the tool.
Best regards,
Cartik
hi Mike,
I cannot share the .qubo file due to IP reasons. What compiler are you using to build qbsolv on windows? qbsolv converges fine for the same qubo file on the MAC.

Are you using a Cygwin based enviroment to compile?
