I would like to rename the tensor network QasmSimulator method to be "matrix_product_state" since this is the actual simulation method being used. The current method string "tensor_network" is too generic as there are multiple different tensor algorithms it could refer to (eg MPS, PEPS, MPDO, MERA).
This should be done before the official release in 0.3 so we don't have to change the API in a later version.
