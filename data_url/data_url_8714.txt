Hi,
I want to know the bell states between entangled pairs so that I change Bell basis from one to other. Can I know the Bell basis without measuring the qubits and can I change to a different basis?
The entangled pairs in simulaqron are always 1/sqrt(2) (|00> + |11>). You can change state by applying X and Z operations. For details refer to e.g. Nielsen and Chuang
