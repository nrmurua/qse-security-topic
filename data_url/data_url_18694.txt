Repeatedly, as part of print-instruction itself and in support of error message printing, we make use of the nil stream functionality of print-instruction to extract a string from an instruction object. If there were a more direct utility wrapper for this functionality, we could incorporate all these calls (including some mapcar calls) into the relevant format string by using ~/fn-name/. Investigate how much this cleans up the code.
Can this issue be closed now, or should it morph into an issue for tracking the propagation of "~/cl-quil::instruction-fmt/" use throughout the code?
I'm gonna close this. We can change stuff as it comes up in other PRs.
