Make the VQE algorithm stateless.
All our algorithms are stateless, i.e. they don't store/depend on previous executions. The VQE still has methods that allow access to the last solved system, which should be strictly left to the results object. Furthermore the computation depends on an internal state being set, which should be changed to a procedural, stateless workflow.
