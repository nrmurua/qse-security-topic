For example, a 'not-working' pulse is being generated by OpenQL:
pulse 0001, 0000, 0000
A working pulse should be:
pulse 1001 0000 0000
For example, the config file, the trigger_bit = 7 should produce the instruction:
trigger 0000001, 2
Instead, it is trigger_bit = 0 which produces that instruction. So, maybe the endian-ness needs to be checked again.
@AdriaanRol Please check if what I wrote made sense. If not, please edit accordingly.
This is rather high priority. Please have a look @Nader-Khammassi or @imranashraf . Thanks very much.
@kel85uk I am looking the pulse issue right now...
The most significant bit of the Pulse Codeword is now set to one whenever the Pulse Codeword is different from Zero. Change made in Commit f5ade72
@Nader-Khammassi great work. Just to be sure we don't prematurely close this issue, you will also make the ordering of the trigger bits consistent right? (trigger 1 is left most bit and trigger 7 is right most bit).
@Nader-Khammassi Setting the most significant bit of the Pulse Codeword whenever the Pulse Codeword is different from zero implies that we cannot use codeword zero. This results in only having 7 instead of eight code words.
@Nader-Khammassi , the trigger_bit is still not compiling correctly. It is still at bit 0 for the correct trigger.
@Nader-Khammassi I am using the develop branch
@kel85uk The latest Fixes are made in Commit abacf47
You can pull the changes.
@Nader-Khammassi It totally works now. :-D Thanks for your help!


You are most welcome !
