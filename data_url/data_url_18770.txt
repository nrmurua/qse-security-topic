The lexer recognizes chr(181) + 's' as a TimeUnit representing microsecond.
The lexer does not recognize chr(956) + 's' as any TimeUnit.
However, backslash + mu [TAB] in ipython produces chr(956). (The same in Julia).
The qss parser also useschr(956) in the TimeUnit for microsecond.
Try to parse first 1µs, then 1μs. The first works, the second throws an error.
(Also, paste this into ipython or Jupyter: 'µ' == 'μ'.)
That's a good question.
Perhaps allow both characters to represent the character mu in microsecond.
