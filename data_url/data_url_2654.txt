How do I self-assign to issues?
I gave you "collaborator: read" access to the repo, but that may not include the ability to assign issues. If you can, you click on Assignees in the right hand column and set it to yourself.
If you just leave a comment saying "I am working on this issue, please assign me", that is sufficient for now. I'll think about some kind of workaround, e.g. CirqBot watching for particular comments or good 'ol complaining to github that read access should include the ability to self-assign unassigned issues.
may not include the ability to assign issues
Yup. That only works for personal repos, not organizations'. Manual or CirqBot is fine.
