As we update all pluggable class with concrete constructors, will it better we also promote all setting in parameters to the init method.
Thus, we do not need to call the set_options method.
I know that the reason we had this set_options is that in scipy, those setting are needed to be set in a dict.
to make the class constructor self-contained, yes, we should let the constructor include the parameters.
