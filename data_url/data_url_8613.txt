I was recently helping a colleague install qutip on his macbook. We had a lot of trouble installing the requisites scipy and cython, with issues relating to their dependencies (gcc). We were following the instructions in INSTALL.txt and using Mac Ports version 2.3.2 on OSX Yosemite and Xcode 6.1. In the end we had to use 'brew' to install these packages.
I know that this is not an issue with qutip, but rather scipy / cython. However, I am sure that we not like to put off mac users, so perhaps offering alternative INSTALL instructions to 'brew' rather than 'port' might help.
As a disclaimer, please note I have very limited experience on mac.
Thanks for reporting this. Yes, we certainly want the installation to be smooth on osx... Exactly what problems did you have with macports and xcode? I've got thing running on yosemite and macports, so that's certainly possible, but I have not installed this environment from scratch in a long while, so I don't know what difficulties you might encounter when doing this.
I've not used brew myself, but if you wrote down the steps you had to do to set up things with brew we could provide these as an alternative install path.
I am afraid it was last week, and I can't remember the details. The error was always related to OSX version mavericks or later not being compatible with gcc48.
Again these steps may not be exact, but this is what I think we did:
This turns out to be the best way to go:
