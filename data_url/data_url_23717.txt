The only thing the decadac driver seems to be doing when initialised seems to be to set mode to 1 which is needed to ensure that the decadac is active https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/instrument_drivers/Harvard/Decadac.py#L101
I guess that this also resets all voltages but there does not seem to be a way to get the mode setting
@WilliamHPNielsen @jenshnielsen @fabioansaloni  and afaik there is no way to query for the mode value (firmware issues). In short, either you make sure the dacadac is actually working but this will probably reset all the voltages or you live on the edge and your decadac may be off all the times without you noticing. This is a limitation of the firmware.
@fabioansaloni So you will be much better off using the QDac. The driver for it is online as of now!
@fabioansaloni @jenshnielsen @WilliamHPNielsen it seems like it's a decadac bug (surprise).
With the new Decadac driver, is this solved? @fabioansaloni?
Closing this issue for now as the setup whence the issue came no longer exists.
