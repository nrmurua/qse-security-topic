The current implementation of the QPUConnection object breaks the intended symmetry between QPU and QVM. It declares certain metrics inside the Connection object that is oustide the scope of a connection container. Ramsey, T1, etc. should use a connection object and not be defined inside a connection object. The current abstraction seems to break this separation of concerns.
Any thoughts @willzeng @ncrubin @stevenheidel
See my PR and also @pkaralekas 's upcoming PR which cleans up QPUConnection.
I think this is fixed now thanks to Peter, can we close?
@jotterbach I think Peter and I improved this with our commits last week, we can reopen if we want to make further changes.
