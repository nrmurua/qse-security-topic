I have an old implementation of CHP algorithm in Julia, which contains a tableau representation of stabilizer states.
https://github.com/Roger-luo/QuCircuit.jl
With the tableau, we will be able to have polynomial time simulation for stabilizer circuits.
But, as discussed in #138  We will leave PauliString for now.
This is work in progress in https://github.com/QuantumBFS/YaoGraphs.jl now
