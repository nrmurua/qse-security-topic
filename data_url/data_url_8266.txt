Right now, maintainers need to go through the PRs in qutip/qutip to update the changelog. This is quite time consuming.
There may be automated tools to generate the change log.
I propose at minimum to keep a changelog file also in qutip/qutip, asking contributors to update it before merging the PR. This makes it simpler than for them to open another PR to qutip/qutip-doc.
As note in the release_distribution guidelines, one should check that new functions and classes are included in the classes.rst and functions.rst files. Having a recipe to check this quickly or automatically, maybe with a script like this one.
Superseded by #1894.
