The method extract_states() of the Qobj class doesn't preserve the isherm attribute of the operators it truncates. Maybe I'm forgetting an edge case, but it seems to me that taking any subset of states from an Hermitian operator should results in an Hermitian operator.
Extracting a state of states from an Hermitian operator should yield an Hermitian operator.

Thanks for reporting this issue. It does seem to be a bug. I will take a closer look at the extract_states method and propose a change.
