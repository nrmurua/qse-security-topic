Summarize the task
With broader changes to devices (#4744) and optimizers/trasnformers (#4722), vendors might need to update device decomposition to use the newest transformer APIs. At first glance it looks like:
cirq-pasqal is rolling their own PasqalConverter optimizer which could be converted into a transformer: 
Like aqt, this calls out to the cirq-core neutral atom module. Perhaps we should consolidate this ? @HGSilveri @tanujkhattar
The PasqalConverter and ConvertToNeutralAtomGates are almost identical, so if ConvertToNeutralAtomGates is turned into a transformer, then PasqalConverter should naturally follow.
