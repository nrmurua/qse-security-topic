The error message:
A Dockerfile to reproduce this:
With this Dockerfile, run:
This error is consistent.  Helps. Thanks.
Thanks for this report. We can reproduce this and (think we :-) understand it: This is a test assuming short(er) ClientHello messages than what OQS-OpenSSL presently produces with all QSC algorithms enabled. It therefore does not apply (ClientHello padding is not required/triggered).
So for the time being, you can safely ignore the error message.
We will update the tests accordingly.
