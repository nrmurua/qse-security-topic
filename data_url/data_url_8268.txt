Hi all,
I am trying to reproduce the results of the photocurrent solver for open systems with my own methods, but I see some differences in the dynamics.
In the documentation webpage to what L_sys is, and why it should be corrected with that effective term. Can someone please give provide a reference for that statement?
Furthermore, are C_n in that equation equivalent to the sc_ops in Qutip?
Thank you for your help!
It refers to the system's Liouvillian, I'd say. I think all the C_n there are stochastic jumps, sc_ops , while the system Liouvillian is the constant part, c_ops. But I am not 100% sure.
The user guide is partly out of date there, @Ericgig and others have considerably extended the functionalities of the stochastic solvers. Looking at the API documentation is safer, and the source code is even more complete.
Meanwhile, you can also have a look at these development notebooks here, here, and here with regards to the new methods (you can find them all, a bit hidden, at the bottom of the http://qutip.org/tutorials.html list). Technically this issue could be transferred under qutip/qutip-doc.
Thank you very much! The development notebooks were very useful, especially the last one.

Everything's correct.
