Please Consider name change to Eliptic Curve Cartography, if the name wasnt allready passed over in favour of SIDH.... 1 biased opinion of course but there is no way one can get "tits or dicks" explaining that they are super into Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange/cryptography. i am aware this would effect many pre-existing git/subversoin/mercurial etc but this is the price of having a bad ass name
and will likely be the deciding factor for its eventual adoption.
Thanks but no thanks.
