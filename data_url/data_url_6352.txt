I have positively identified that a bug specific to QUnit::ProbParity() edge cases is responsible for unit test failures in the Q# simulator package. In the AssertProb test in that project, Prob() correctly distinguishes that ProbParity() would be 0.5, with correct basis transformation and qubit parameters from the PInvoke header logic, but ProbParity() returns exactly 0, anyway. This does not affect non-QUnit types.
This is likely the source of the remaining unit test failures, with the exception of 2 failing tests that appear to be expected due to intentional rounding.
Fixed by #520.
