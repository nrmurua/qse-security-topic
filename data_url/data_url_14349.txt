When a circuit contains multiple instances of a custom gate (with the same .name), qpy serialization+deserialization will silently replace the .definition of each with that of the first (resulting in incorrect definitions for parameterized gates).
prints:
where after serialization both gates' .params are correct, but the second gate's .definition has been replaced with that of the first
the final line should read Rx(1.2) instead of Rx(1.1) (or otherwise qpy.dump should throw an error)

Yeah, this is definitely a bug, qpy currently is assuming for custom gates that each name/class has a static definition. To support this we'll probably have to make the key we store in the custom definition table unique for every instance and store the name separately. We'll probably need to bump the qpy format version to support this.
This also applies to the custom gates defined within Qiskit itself, making qpy unusable when using such gates, at the moment.
