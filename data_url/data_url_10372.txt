Error writing to configuration file: [Errno 22] invalid mode ('w') or filename: ''
I see in the code:
try:
with open(config_file, 'w') as fp:
config.write(fp)
except Exception as e:
click.echo("Error writing to configuration file: {}".format(e))
return 2
And I see that on my Windows OS,
So I suspect that the OS is not allowing dwave to create a new directory in the open command as part of the file name.
@JoelPasvolsky, actually I suspect this might have to do with readline default value not working as it should, but I have to verify that.
@JoelPasvolsky, as assumed, readline-powered editable input on windows/mac didn't work correctly. Switched to simpler default-provided method. Maybe docs/examples need updating?
