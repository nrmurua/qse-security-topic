enr_fock is incompatible with enr_destroy.

returns an error.
I believe the problem is that the problem is that y has dim = [[3, 3], 1] instead of dim = [[3, 3], [1,1]].

yanayyar is right. I fixed it in my branch.
@IIAOPSW this does seem like a sensible fix. Can you create a branch and raise a PR with the fix. Call the branch something descriptive like 'fix_enr_fock_dims'. Thanks
@IIAOPSW are you going to do the fix PR for this?
@ajgpitch yeah I'm on it!
