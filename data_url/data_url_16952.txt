When using polymorphic field qiskit.validation.fields.ByType combined with multi-nested schemas leads to incorrect deserialization result. If you have a nested schema listed in ByType polymorphic field, it might not get correctly deserialized. An example is provided below.
Consider the following setup:
And corresponding model bindings:
The following test case will always fail:
When you create a dict from given schemas:
result dict is supposed to match the following dict:
Instead, TestInt will not get deserialized properly, and will result in:
Interestingly enough, the deserialization result depends on the order of nested schemas in the list of ByType fields.
For example, if we declare TestSchema as:
i.e. changing the order of nested schemas or swapping  FirstNestedSchema and SecondNestedchema it will result in correct deserialized dict:
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Closing this as stale, we've removed marshmallow from terra (and client code so this no longer applies. Please feel free to reopen if I'm missing something or there is more to discuss on this.
