I installed qiskit in my Mac and went through the Tutorials and clicked on Basic, and clicked on the script listed in the GitHub.
I do not know where should I need insert the commands from the tutorial. But I do not know where is the documentation to log on the qiskit or something like that
Hi @imvieira
I'm gathering that you navigated to this particular tutorial below, and you're looking for a way to execute the commands that you see there to practice for yourself.
Qiskit Github/qiskit-tutorials/qiskit/basics/
The tutorials are available in Jupyter notebooks so that you can see the code as well as outputs from the code. If you'd like to run them yourself, one option is to create a python file or jupyter notebook on your computer, insert the commands from the tutorials, and run that file. The simplest option is probably to clone the tutorials folder and run things locally on your computer.
If you are asking, instead, about how to get access to the devices, the setup instructions for obtaining an API key are provided here:

Hi @imvieira
I think you need to learn more about juypter notebook to master writing program and run it thru your browser:

I am closing this issue as I think @aasfaw  has already pointed you the right way to solve your issue. Please feel free to open a new one if you encounter another issue.
I am still having the error above
This error is because you have
qc = qk.QuantumCircuit(qr.cr)
instead of
qc = qk.QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)
Note the change from . to , (period to comma).
For your second error, replace the last line with these two:
and please let us know if you have any more issues.
