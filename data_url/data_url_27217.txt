SIKE triggers many compiler warnings, especially on the most recent version of GCC. This is prohibitive to compiling with -Wall -Werror as is generally recommended. Some of these warnings suggest possibly invalid behaviour. The below logs are copied from this issue on downstream liboqs but I can reproduce them trivially by calling make on this repo.
The problem appears to lie in -Warray-parameter=2, which is included in -Wall. It appears by adding either to the makefile here.
At level 2 the warning also triggers for redeclarations involving any other inconsistency in array or pointer argument forms denoting array sizes.  Pointers and arrays of unspecified bound are considered equivalent and do not
trigger a warning.
It also fails on -Warray-bounds.
And on -Wstringop-overflow. I don't even need to enable extra warnings for this one to show up here.
