When plotting circuit diagrams, the gatefacecolor key has no effect.
Produces this image:

The same image is produced using any hex colour code or by removing the gatefacecolor key.
The gate faces should be white in this example.
A suggested solution was to use style=False, which overrides the default styling and produces a black and white diagram. However, this would not allow the use of other desired style keys such as 'usepiformat': 'true'.
Working on it
There is a possible overwrite of colors in qiskit/visualization/matplotlib.py
@bjader, I think it's fixed, please test it and see if the colors are like you expect.
style = {'gatefacecolor': '#FF0000'}
