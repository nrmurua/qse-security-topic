Insert Ansys "proper installation" check in the Ansys renderer code (in the "initialization" method)
for Ansys2020R2 this would be the command to test that Ansys is properly installed: win32com.client.Dispatch('AnsoftHfss.HfssScriptInterface').....there might be a better command that does not actually "execute" anything. Also the COM key might be different for different versions of Ansys, so will need to check other possible keys in the loop.
Also add this to the FAQ in case something goes wrong in a different way
This will become sunset with pyaedt renderer.
