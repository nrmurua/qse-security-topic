Quadratic interactions between continuous variables are not supported.
However, it is possible to build a CQM object with quadratic interaction between two real variables by "bypassing" some checks. This happens if we build a model from iterable
To reproduce
We expect to have an error like ValueError: REAL variables (e.g. 'x') cannot have interactions.
