VQE and the like are basically unusable with FakeBackends because the QuantumInstance is waiting 5 sec to get results.  It would be nice to have wait=0 by default.
For example, a 2Q problem takes 21min by default, verse 39sec on the same machine using a custom SPSA solver following this tutorial: https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/tutorials/sample_vqe_program/qiskit_runtime_vqe_program.html
Opflow is now deprecated soon to be removed. New features/enhancements are no longer a consideration.
