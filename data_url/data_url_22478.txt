May be helped/triggered by hi-DPI display. The crash happens most of the time and renders the scan widget unusable.
I haven't seen this but I bet the signal loops are in there. Unless @cr1901 finds time to fix that today, I'll rewrite that.
Works now.
(The changes still need to be merged into ARTIQ though, and scrolling is still missing from the widget)
