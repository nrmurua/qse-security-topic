This is mainly a refactoring issue, where the advantage is that by making SVM Kernels as pluggable entities, researchers and developers who want to extend Aqua will have an easy interface to swap kernels in AI.
Currently, kernels are hardcoded inside the SVM Q Kernel algorithm.
Make SVM Kernels pluggable entities, such as algorithms, optimizers, variational forms, Grover oracles, IQFTs and initial states.
N/A
The goal is to continue to promote the modular and extensible nature of Qiskit Aqua.
