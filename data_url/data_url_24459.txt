Hello,
I tried simulating a DoubleDot analog to the classical_triple_dot.ipynb example notebook.
But I get the following error:

I think the reason is that by creating an instance of  DoubleDot  the method makebasis is called twice with different parameters. The first call is in the init method of  ClassicalDotSystem with the parmeters self.makebasis(ndots=ndots, maxelectrons=maxelectrons). And the second call is in the  init method of DoubleDot with the parmeters self.makebasis(ndots=2). The first call creates a numpy array with shape (16,2) from which the variable _coulomb_energy inherits it shape but the second call overrides the variable basis with a array of shape (9,2). Therefore the shapes between the parameters basis and _coulomb_energy donÂ´t match anymore, which results in the error.
As a possible solution I added the parameter maxelectrons to the class DoubleDot analog to the class TripleDot.
Code before:
Code after:
My code is now working but is it correct to call the method makebasis  twice and if yes why?
Maybe the better solution would be to remove the second call if it is unnecessary.
Hello @fabian-fuchs You are right. This call to makebasis should come from the parent class only and not (again) from the subclass. I'll create a bug report.
@fabian-fuchs a fix is merged to the dev branch.
