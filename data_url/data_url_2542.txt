Empty Moments arise when optimizations leave existing Moments empty. For example:
Input:
Output:
As you can see, there are gaps in the wires in the diagram of the optimized circuit.
I think there's a case to be made that in this situation, the empty Moments shouldn't be rendered at all.
How is this issue related to #1131?
#1131 was resolved by PR #1193 , but that PR did not include any tests for transposed text diagrams (specifically, in test_empty_moments in circuit_test.py).
See #1319.
