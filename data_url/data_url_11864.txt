@woodsp-ibm are we going to have a follow up on this or can we close this issue?
I think we should keep this open, this seems like an important feature we could implement in the future! ðŸ™‚
The relevance of this depends on what happens with the FermionicOperator going forwards. h1/h2 are the one and two body spin integrals which so far, since only a smallish number of qubits (orbitals) can be supported, having dense matrices has not really been an issue to date.
As the chemistry operators are being redesigned for the next release of the chemistry capability, see qiskit-community/qiskit-nature#4, and Aqua, including the FermionicOperator class will be deprecated, I am closing this issue.
