Doing this with canvas calls is easily eating up ~30% of the frame time for 16 qubit gates.
(But fallback to javascript for NaN cases.)
Turns out this is slower...? Possibly due to the way I get the pixel data out (i.e. not by drawing it to a canvas but by calling readPixels and rounding and making an image data from a subset and then drawing that).
So it looks like this would require too many architectural changes to be a reasonable idea at this time.
