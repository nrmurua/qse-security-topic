Hi
I've found the game interesting, however it would be great if you can divide the components into separate PDF files:
At the moment I'm not able to print the cards which are not cut in half :-/
@xanderbo Entanglion v1.3 has just been released with a version for A4 paper. Does this solve the problem?

I deleted my previous comments because I missed that A4 version has the components separated the way I want. Thanks!
