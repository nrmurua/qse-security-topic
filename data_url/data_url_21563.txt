There is no an explicit function to get the frequency, amplitude, or phase from a AD9910 device. I understand that the values can be get using read32 function with the corresponding registry addresses, but I think having those explicit get functions for the AD9910 device helps reducing some of the code duplication that I imagine many labs using urukul have. Please let me know if this is already addressed somewhere or this idea does not make sense.
Add get_ftw, get_asf, get_pow functions in artiq.coredevice.ad9910.AD9910 class, and add get_frequency. get_amplitude, and get_phase as corresponding counterparts in natural units.
By coincidence, I have made that code earlier this week and I expect to get it tested soon. Once I have it I will make a pull request for it.
