Seems like we should be able to support identity gates of any size by treating them as "no-ops".
This is easy enough to implement - we can just remove the explicit identity conversion rule:

This will fall back on the decompose behavior for IdentityGate, which produces no-ops.
One issue with decomposing to no-ops, related to #327: if an identity gate is the only gate on any qubits, they will be ignored in the results. I'll look into fixing that issue before making this change.
Should be ok if we look at circuit.all_qubits() before decomposing. Or, could do a custom decomposition into single-qubit identities here.
