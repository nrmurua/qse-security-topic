When running the unit tests everything fails upon collection of the tests since it's trying to access qiskit modules which do not exist.
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit.wrapper.credentials'
pytest .
Smooth running unit tests.
It might possible have to do with the Qiskit version (I used pip3 for installation). Unit tests need to be updated.
Hi, I believe that you test against the newest Aqua master branch, right?
If so, current master is synced with the newest Qiskit-terra master branch, to pass the tests, you will need to install the newest Qiskit-terra as well.
Thanks.
@markf94 do you still encounter any issue about testing? If not, I would like to close this issue. Thanks.
@markf94 As noted above you need the newest qiskit terra master branch for the tests. The newest Aqua from master is dependent on the newest terra and with this the tests pass fine, and should for you too. However for some reason should you still have problems with the newest terra you can re-open this.
