Running the ideal() method from QuantumError gives incorrect results for 2-qubit errors.
A minimal example is:
The ideal() method should return True for all identity objects
On line https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/main/qiskit/providers/aer/noise/errors/quantum_error.py#L247 the index of the qubit seems to be hard-coded to 0.
