When using Yao for variational quantum algorithm, is there a way to set the loss as the expectation value of some general hermitian operator? For example, in variational state preparation, we have the target state |psi>, and the loss would be the expectation value on hermitian operator -|psi><psi|.
Thanks!
Please try the following code
