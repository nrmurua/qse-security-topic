Bring over the proper dependency files for the pulse simulator.
The dependencies have been moved into my branch:
https://github.com/nonhermitian/qiskit-aer/tree/openpulse
However, the runtime files need OpenPulse to be installed so that they have a place to import the Cython modules from.  Therefore, the Cython files need to be built and installed with the current build system (which I probably need help with).
