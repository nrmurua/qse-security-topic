From a comment in that PR:
Making it just Hermitian make sense when thinking of this as "expectation value of an observable in quantum theory".  For non-Hermitian operators, sometimes you can think of them as "observables" with complex eignevalues.  But sometimes you end up with non-Hermitian operators that don't a complete set of eigenvectors than span the space, so then it is really hard to interpret this as an observable.
That said, it definitely makes sense to define <x|A|x> for a non-hermitian operator.  My suggestion would be to allow this via an explicit parameter.  i.e. normally it requires Hermitian and throws an error that says if you want to calculate for a non-hermitian operator, set the parameter appropriate.
