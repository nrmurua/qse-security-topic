Compute Weighted MIS probability for a state
Describe alternatives you've considered
I use this function (but can be embedded in current function used for regular MIS probability):
In this function, we compute the probability that the state contains a certain IS configuration (MIS_original) for a subset of atoms, and the probability that it is the weighted MIS (MIS_mapped).
