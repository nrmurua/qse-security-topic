There are several standard experiments that people will want to do on qubits to see how well they work. These include:
It would be nice for us to provide pre-built methods to do these experiments.
An experiment differs from an example in that an experiment is useful to users who already fully understand the library. Experiments provide runtime functionality, whereas examples demonstrate source code in simplified scenarios. We could have an example that runs experiments, but we'd never have an experiment that runs examples.
Agree.  One question is where to put it, i.e. should this be in Cirq proper?
Yes it should be in cirq proper, because it is functionality that users are likely to want.
Q: "I just installed cirq. How do I run a Rabi experiment?"
A: "cirq.experiments.rabi"
One open question in my mind is that we want to somehow decouple the experiment from the thing it is being run on. We don't want "simulated_rabi" and "google_engine_rabi" and "ibm_q_rabi", we just want "rabi".
Done: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/tree/master/cirq/experiments. I'm going to tag #1002 as it's related.
So many fixed issues!
