I tried to install qsimcirq on my Windows machine by running pip install qsimcirq. I have a virtual environment with python 3.7 and I've already installed CMake.
I get the following error
(The main error is C:\Users\Sorin\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-2moej2xu\qsimcirq_2bac09547c194fe49942fe3d07d88005\pybind_interface\pybind_main.cpp(409,7): error C3861: 'posix_memalign': identifier not found [C:\Users\Sorin\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-install-2moej2xu\qsimcirq_2bac09547c194fe49942fe3d07d88005\build\temp.win-amd64-3.7\Release\qsim.vcxproj])
I read in the docs that installing in docker is an option. But I want to try and run some cirq circuits using this simulator and I want to do it in a jupyter notbook. Would that be possible if I install it in docker?
Hi @sorin-bolos,
Running Jupyter notebooks using a Docker image should work - it's similar to the GCP setup process, but without a separate VM.
Once the above steps are complete, you should be able to import cirq, qsimcirq and run your circuits. Please follow up here if you run into any issues in this process.
That worked for me, thanks!
But it would be nice if it could be called from Windows and not needing to build it from source code. Either by installing directly on Win or by having the docker container act as a server.
