I have tried to port the conda package for qibo, the main issue is that tensorflow is not really well supported by conda-forge, the current versions are old, there is version mismatch between linux and osx, and furthermore the GPU support is only available from tensorflow-gpu which is outdated and supports only linux.
Given that tf is using pip as their default channel, I believe we can stick to pip until there is stable and updated version of tensorflow in conda-forge.
I have implemented a basic recipe for linux-cpu. The PR is in conda-forge/staged-recipes#12509
However due to an issue with the tensorflow version the job fails, so I am waiting for feedback from the conda-forge maintainers.
Given that the main issue here is tf in conda, let me propose to close this PR and wait until (if) the situation improves.
