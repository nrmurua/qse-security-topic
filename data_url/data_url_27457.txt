No longer an issue in matplotlib v3.2.1 (I was running v3.2.0)
I'm currently getting this issue in both jupyter lab and jupyter notebook.
Basically, plt.savefig(*args) fails with an error message (at bottom),
I just wanted to log this here in case anyone has seen this issue before and knows the solution, otherwise I'll raise it in matplotlib.
