The general hope here is to make sure that use of IonSim is easy and intuitive for a user, basically matching up with intuitive expectation as best as possible. This is a list of some of my thoughts of items to consider for this. Many of them are questions about how we should handle stuff.

It would be nice to create an empty Chamber(), then we consider the trapping potentials for the ions in IonTrap, then add the Laser and IonTrap into the Chamber.
Also: Is our convention for phrases:
I've been following ion_configuration for file names. IonConfiguration for structs and ionconfiguration for function names. Sometimes I break the last rule if it is not readable.
