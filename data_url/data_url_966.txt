num_qubits, _num_qubits_, _qid_shape_ are all in Gate.  They use @value.alternative.  But there is no indication of which of these you should actually implement.
I can give some context.  num_qubits was the original way to determine how many qubits a gate needs.  This was changed to the cirq.num_qubits and cirq.qid_shape protocols when I implemented qudits (#933, #1777).
In my opinion, a gate subclass should implement only _qid_shape_ if it is gate type that can act on qudits, otherwise only _num_qubits_.
