For example, the generated docs for the pulse tutorials (https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/pulse/2_building_pulse_instructions.html#Building-Pulse-Instructions)

Sphinx doesn't support ``literal`` emphasizing within external hyperlinks. For example ```Delay(duration: int, channel)`` <#delay>`__
We also might want to figure out how internal hyperlinks can be used interchangeably in both the tutorials and sphinx generated docs. Because "#delay" adds hyperlink in .ipynb/markdown but it doesn't do the same when converted to .rst.
Hey @SooluThomas  I think this is fixed. You can close this issue
It's possible to use RST with notebooks: https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.5.0/raw-cells.html
