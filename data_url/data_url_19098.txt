When calculating μ=∂H/∂ϵ for an ε that does not occur in H, the derivative_wrt_pulse function currently returns the integer 0 for μ, which is not compatible with how μ is used in optimize_pulses: we need μ to be a callable. In the zero-case, μ(state) must return a zero-state while preserving the dimensions of state.
