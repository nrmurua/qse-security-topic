Noise model created from BackendV2 contains excessive (relaxation and depolarizing) QuantumErrors on measures while ReadoutErrors should be sufficient for measures. This is due to a bug in qiskit_aer.noise.device.models.basic_device_gate_errors where it returns QuantumErrors on non-Gate objects incorrectly after #1484.
basic_device_gate_errors never return errors on non-Gate objects.
