ยง Compilation toolchain introspection. Here's how to see what the compiler is doing. Use this when submitting bug reports about poorly optimized code.
There's no more ARTIQ_UNPARSE, and for the time being the easiest way to debug poorly optimized code is to send the source.
There are ARTIQ_DUMP_IR and ARTIQ_DUMP_LLVM, but these would be of little comprehension to the end-user, so I don't think it is valuable to list those.
In any case, let's see what the real-world performance problems with the new compiler are and how they can be better solved, to see what would be the most suitable alternative to ARTIQ_UNPARSE.
