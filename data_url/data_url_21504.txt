Currently the the external clock selection on ARTIQ boards (KC705, ZC706, Kasli, Kasli-SoC) is inconsistent, limited in features, and difficult to use with firmware recompilations and reflashing required to change Si5324 settings on Kasli.
There are currently two clock settings, the rtio_clock config key used by KC705, ZC706 and Kasli, and the JSON options used by Kasli.
I propose replacing them in ARTIQ-7 with a single rtio_clock config key that can take values such as:
If we ever have a board with several clock inputs, the input could be selected with ext0/ext1/ext2...
Synthesizers (e.g. WRPLL vs. Si5324) could similarly be selected using synth0/synth1...
There can be board-dependent extensions for these strings. For example, PLL loop bandwidth could be selected using ext0_synth125to125_bw606 / ext0_synth125to125_bw200.
Any given board would only support its own set of strings.
Would it be better to have a series of key, value pairs indicating: clock input, synthesizer (incl. bypass), input frequency, output frequency, loop bandwidth?  I just worry about the long concatenated strings above being fragile and unwieldy.  Or is the idea that only a small subset of combinations will actually be supported, so making a small list of possible strings allows users to choose from among the only available combinations?

Yes, that's the idea. While the strings share a common format for easier understanding, each board would only support a limited set of clocking configurations and corresponding strings. The strings would make it easier to see what is supported and what is not.
