Now that we have a setup.py, we shouldn't need to do this import hack in the notebooks:
I have verified locally that I am able to remove this block and everything works. If it's still not working for you @HGSilveri, then try running git clean -fdx in the top-level directory of Pulser to get rid of the cache files.
I can make this fix after #17 is done, so there are no conflicts.
It works for me now. I'll let @sebgrijalva handle #17.
I can help with this.
