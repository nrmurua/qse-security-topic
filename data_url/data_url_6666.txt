Dear LIQUi|> team,
We are using the Stabilizer simulator and would like to be able to access and manipulate the output of the stab.showState function.
Thank you.
Raja Nagarajan and Antoine Vaillant
I have placed a new example in UserCode/wecker/Tableau.fsx. It requires a new version of Liquid1.dll (which has been uploaded to the repository). This is from the ReadMe.md file:
We've been told that people would like to access the internal state of the Stabilizer simulator. Tableau is a new property that will return a tuple of n,rs,xs,zs:
ints is the number of ints used to represent the bits ((n >>> 5) + 1)
Tableau.fsx has a complete implementation of ShowState and is demonstrated dumping the tableau for Teleport.
Note: I have not added the Tableau API to the docs (for now). This is a very specialized call and (I believe) it isn't of great use to most users.
You can compile and run the sample with: \Liquid\bin\Liquid.exe /s Tableau.fsx Tableau()
Thank you for doing this quickly, Dave.
Best,
Raja
