The code in qiskit/visualization/bloch.py needs testing. Current coverage is:
(This is a follow up from #300 (comment))
Still true: https://coveralls.io/builds/24960860/source?filename=qiskit/visualization/bloch.py
on hold until #2968 is decided.
Removing on hold. The testing should be on binder, like in #4544
@1ucian0 do you think I could help with this one?
Yes! Probably following the same style than in #4544
Sounds good, thanks! I'll give it a try
Hi @mlarocca are you still working on this? There are more details here about how to run snapshot tests for visualisations. And you can check coverage for a specific file by running coverage3 report -m <filepath> in your terminal. Let us know if you have any questions ðŸ˜„
I am new to the world of quantum computing and open source. I have good familiarity with python. I would love to work on this issue.
Hi @a-freakish as @mlarocca hasn't replied I will re-assign this to you, let us know if you have any questions ðŸ˜„
Hello @javabster, sorry for the late reply!
I hadn't had a chance to make a lot of progress on this back in September, and then for some reason we forgot about this (I think in favor of other tasks).
It was an interesting one and I'd have loved to pick it up again, but at the same time I'm swamped right now and for a few more weeks, so I also meant to say that if @a-freakish has the time to tackle this right now, it makes sense I step aside.
If later or at any point you need help, please feel free to let me know!
Thanks!
Thanks for the update @mlarocca! ðŸ˜ƒ
âœ… bloch.py still lacks its own dedicated testing and has no-one assigned to it - Issue exists
As I understand, the functions of bloch.py are directly used in plot_bloch_vector,plot_bloch_multivector,plot_state_qsphere and visualize_transition including any functions that depend on any of these 4 functions
plot_state_qsphere and plot_bloch_multivector are tested in test/ipynb/mpl/graph/test_graph_matplotlib_drawer.py
Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
According with coverall, the file is 49% covered.  Still some testing is needed, but much better than the original situation.
did you have any chance to have a look @a-freakish ?
unassigning to return the isssue to the pool of bugs for new comers.
@1ucian0
Hi, if nobody has been assigned to this task, I'm interested in it.
Assigned @orangekame3! Thanks!
record the current coverage for reference. (before starting)

@1ucian0 Hi is there still help needed with this one? :) I would really like to contribute.
I haven't made any progress on this, so if it's okay, I'd like to pass it on to @sjbokhari .
reassigning. Thanks both!
I would like to contribute on this issue if no progress has been done.
@aabennak I am currently working on it, but if you want to you can take over :)
@sjbokhari Thank you so much for your kind reply :) but I can't do that if you're currently still working on it. Good luck!
edit: I understand that the learning curve is a thing, so me butting in would destroy that time that you have invested in understanding the code.
