During the setup phase of OpenQL, cmake is invoked by using the 'cmake' command (setup.py, line 17). On QSIM servers, the 'cmake' command refers to cmake version 2.x, while the required cmake version 3.x should be invoked by using the 'cmake3' command. Therefore, building OpenQL on a QSIM server results in the following error:
Workaround
Modify setup.py line 17 to use cmake3.
Proposed solution
Search for the proper cmake command. In case of linux, first try 'cmake3', and if non existing, fall back to 'cmake'.
well this is not something related to openql. you should in your system make sure that you source or in some other way set cmake, to provide openql the right cmake version. And this cmake3 is how Erik named it on qsim servers, which IMHO is not the proper way to do it (but that is a separate discussion).
I leave it up to the developers if this is something you would like to handle. In case you don't, a valid workaround would be to first execute the following command on the Linux terminal:
After setting this session temporally alias, OpenQL can be installed while the 'cmake' command refers to cmake version 3.x .
