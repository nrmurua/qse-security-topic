Transpiling (opt.lvl.2) a circuit with initialize() with a quantum state that should behave like a reset() leads to an error.
Run this python script:
Produces this output and error:
The variant with reset() instead of initialize() works fine.
The transpiler should not crash but rather recognize that the initialize is a reset operation and handle it in the same way.
Please correct me if I am wrong, the initialize([1, 0], qreg[0]) should be equivalent to reset(qreg[0]) and both should initialize the qubit to the |0> state (assuming that the default state of a qubit is |0>).
Source: initialize and reset.
What about adding a pass that converts all the initialize() operations to reset() operations (whenever applicable) before the transpiler starts?
