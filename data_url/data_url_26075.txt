Eventually, all classes and functions that qbraid-SDK users are able to interact with will need to be fully documented. For now, we can start with just the classes declared inside of the qbraid/circuits folder (and sub-folders).  We will use Google Style Docstrings inside of the code and ultimately generate our doc files using Sphinx. This exercise will hopefully help familiarize you with the codebase and the class hierarchy that makes it up and will come in very useful during the testing phase (coming up next) and for whenever we add new functionality. Following the "road (code) map" of how the transpiler executes through each call will help you fill in the summary of each class's functionality and description of its attributes. In many cases, a sentence or two may already be written, which may be sufficient. If not, do your best to describe what you think the class does, or ask me or Erik. The Cirq repo is a great example of how to use the Google docstrings format. If you finish before I've assigned another task, you can start creating docstrings for functions visible to users in qbraid/circuits, and/or you can follow the Sphinx tutorial linked above to build and populate the actual documentation page from the docstrings you already made. Remember to create a new feature branch and push your changes there instead of to master. Then after you're done, we can merge more easily.
