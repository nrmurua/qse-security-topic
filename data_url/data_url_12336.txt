I was trying to run simple quantum circuit performing binary classification on processors "rainbow and weber", but it throws an error. Is there any short example performing machine learning task on quantum virtual machine? any help
Is TFQ supposed to be compatible with QVM (ie does QVM have documentation on it)? Since I imagine the QVM is basically just a different kind of cirq backend, if specifying it as a backend doesn’t work I would guess it isn’t supported.
Thank you for you response. I follows your youtube videos related to tfq cirq implementations. :)
as we perform QML tasks on ibmq real devices. I am planning to use TFQ PQC on QVM.
Looking at QVM I suspect you will have to write some interfacing code, I wasn't able to get QVM working trivially as a normal backend. You can see examples of how the cirq backend here: https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/master/tensorflow_quantum/core/ops/circuit_execution_ops.py.
