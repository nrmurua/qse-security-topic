The qiskit interface to c3-toolset provides a very user-friendly way to run circuits with full physics simulation. It would be beneficial to also run optimal control or calibration or model learning routines within the same workflow
Something like the following would be useful:
Optimizing gates separately and sharing the optimized gates through the configuration json files.
This seems trivially solvable by creating the c3 experiment object at the qiskit backend object level (unlike how its currently created inside run_experiment()) and provide user level access to this object.
