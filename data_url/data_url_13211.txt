With current settings CI stops as soon as a test fails. In this way we don't know if the other test would have passed or not.
I understand the motivation: it saves computational power.
On the other hand, it would be helpful to know what are all the failing tests for each commit instead of catching and fixing failing tests one-by-one.
I think the desired effect can be achieved by setting fail-fast: false in our test matrices. The keyword is documented here.
