I am trying to understand how to go to RZX gates and calibrations when targeting IBM Quantum systems.  However, I am already lost at the basis translation step.  Namely decomposing a CX gate gives the expected transformation:
but if I add a H gate then the transformation adds multiple RZX gates even though the H gate is a single-qubit gate:
I am pretty sure this is not the way this should be decomposed here.
It seems like an inefficiency of BasisTranslator where the transformation path that it finds is: CX -> ISWAP -> CX -> ECR -> RZX. Good news are that I ran this example with #7211 branch and it seems fixed.
