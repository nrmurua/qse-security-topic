My pytest in verbose mode is dominated by a trillion of these warnings.  Was there a reason we were not using math.gcd()?  (3to2 problem?)
I know that we didn't get this before verbose mode on Travis because we were using an older version of pytest. Since updating pytest to 3.8 to be able to run  pytest-benchmark (https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), we now see them.
Changing it to math.gcd makes a test fail :(
It's because of the python 2 compatibility.
... we could consider dropping that, now that e.g. numpy is dropping it. There's a lot more momentum away from it.
