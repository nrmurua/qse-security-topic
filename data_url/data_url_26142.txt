The toqito documentation presently covers the subjects of nonlocal games, XOR games, and extended nonlocal games. Binary constraint system games (BCS games) sometimes referred to as linear system games are a subset of nonlocal games that related to binary constraint systems. These games were initially defined in:

The toqito project presently possesses the ability to specify a BCS game, and then, be able to bound the quantum value and directly calculate the classical and non-signaling values of that game. At the moment, there are no tutorials on usage in toqito for BCS games.
To start off, the existing function docs in nonlocal_games/nonlocal_game.py, as well as the test cases in tests/test_nonlocal_games.py, should provide good starting points for what types of topics to cover in a tutorial as well as providing examples of usage. The tutorial itself should following a similar flow to the previously mentioned tutorials in that they define the notion of a BCS game and provide some rudimentary examples of usage showcasing how one can use the toqito package to calculate or bound the values of certain games.
