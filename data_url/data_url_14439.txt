Compose of two Pauli operators gives unexpected sign:
gives:
when we naively expects, for example XY = iZ. This is also confirmed by:
Is this reverse of sign intentionally? It seems difficult for me to find a documentation mentioning this as well.
Thanks!
Yeah exactly, that's how we define difference between "compose" and "dot" - compose (&) means "apply the left one, then apply the right one", whereas dot (@) is the mathematical matrix multiplication.
You're right though that the documentation isn't necessarily easy to find - you'd need to know that & is the syntactic sugar we decided to use for Operator.compose.  We do say it, but I do recognise it's not the best layout.  We've got a big internal effort to work on how we present our documentation, but it might take a little while to bear fruit.
