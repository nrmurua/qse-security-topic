See title and repro.
The custom pass manager should not print out nonexistent couplings such as (0, 1).
Using
instead works.
Yeah inspecting the code quickly the bug is here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/transpiler/preset_passmanagers/common.py#L320-L326 IIRC when we added that I think that logic was there primarily to detect that the target has connectivity constraints set. At the time we were working more in the dual mode where target was the new thing and was opt-in if it was present. We were always generating a preset pass manager with a coupling map even when coming from BackendV2/Target so that was a proxy check for connectivity constraints. But since then we've obviously moved on and this isn't necessarily true anymore, so we need to update that logic to handle just taking a target
