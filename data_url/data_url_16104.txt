The problem is probably caused by retworkx API changes.
The issue is being caused by using a retworkx version in your python environment that is too old. It's not an API incompatibility but more terra leveraging newer features that weren't available on older retworkx releases. Terra's master branch requires retworkx >= 0.7.0: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/requirements.txt#L3
If you run with an version older than that (previous versions of terra had a lower minimum requirement, for example terra 0.16.x requires retworkx >=0.5.0: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/0.16.4/requirements.txt#L4 ) you will hit errors like this because terra is leveraging new features and APIs offered in newer retworkx releases. You should be able to fix this by just upgrading your retworkx version in your environment (from inside jupyter something like !pip install -U retworkx and restarting the kernel should fix this)
@mtreinish I updated retworkx and now it's working :) Thanks for the quick reply!
