Sometimes a hardware device (AWG) does not have sufficient storage to maintain all registered programs in device memory, requiring to discard currently unused programs from a single device (while still retaining them as registered pulses in the setup) in order to upload new ones. The current HardwareSetup does expect registered pulses to be available on the hardware at all times and cannot deal with removing some pulses from some devices only (removing a pulse from all devices is possible, though).
This could at first be implemented that a user can manually clear the memory of a device and HardwareSetup checking and reuploading if necessary before executing a pulse.
Long term it would probably be beneficial to have a memory manager that automatically deals with these kinds of memory restrictions in the background (similar to a page manager in OSes)
