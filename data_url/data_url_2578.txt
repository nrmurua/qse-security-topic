In particular, the random circuit generator to produce the circuits for https://github.com/sboixo/GRCS/tree/master/inst/cz_v2 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10749) add an initial and a final moment of Hadamards on every wire, but the xmon devices do not support the Hadamard gate.
We should be careful here since adding composite gates can result in behavior that does not closely track hardware.
I'm having the problem that the randomly generated circuits from generate_supremacy_circuit_google_v2_bristlecone always have a Moment of Hadamard gates at the input and output.
The following code fails:
With the error:
This should now be handled by the serializable gate set as well as custom optimizers for the different gate sets (though of course this later is not unique).
