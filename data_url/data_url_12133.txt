I think we should move https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/advanced/ignis/repetition_code.ipynb to qiskit-community-tutoiral.
Hi Jaygambetta, do you want to me work on this
I think we should move https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/advanced/ignis/repetition_code.ipynb to qiskit-community-tutoiral.
This link is not available anymore
starting Apr 25 this repo received a new format. I believe this file, which can still be found/was last seen here is in fact this file here now.
Should this be moved, an update to start_here.ipynb will also be needed.
oops! this issue was closed while I was writing this comment! damn... xD
