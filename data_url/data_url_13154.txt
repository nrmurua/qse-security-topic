Implement standard Mitiq functions: execute_with_qse, mitigate_executor, qse_decorator without supporting the case observable=None (consistently with the current QSE draft).
This is a sub-issue of #818.
Hint: have a look at how such functions are defined for other techniques. E.g. in mitiq/rem/rem.py
