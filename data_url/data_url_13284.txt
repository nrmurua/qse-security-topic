Currently most of our examples are written with only one frontend. It would be easier for our users to have this example written in their preferred frontend, and would make Mitiq more accessible.
Each example should be written in the other supported frontends. The following checklist is a link to an issue for a particular example and frontend.
Since all of the sub-tickets have been completed here, I'm going to close this. Nice work, and thank you to all of @andreamari, @Misty-W, @deji725, @dubeyPraY, and @nickdgardner for your work here!
