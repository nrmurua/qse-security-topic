It looks like pydocstyle will not be maintained anymore.
This issue is to remove pydocstyle from github workflows + replace it with something else.
This might be a good alternative: https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-docstrings
This issue is also related to some things discussed in #201
Fixed by #298 and #297
