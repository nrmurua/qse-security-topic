When transforming a circuit to schedule, the original circuit has a barrier at the end. It's not really a bug but if i send the quantum circuit to the backend an error occurs
Maybe just delete this line https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/58771d82badb4a60da23132615086eaae3c038b5/qiskit/scheduler/methods/basic.py#L96 or create a copy of the circuit.
This issue exists and a fix is under way: #3757
