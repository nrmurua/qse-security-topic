I had to do some benchmarking of liboqs on an ARM Cortex A-53 a couple of weeks ago and found a variety of weird things in how various optimizations are configured on ARM that I think is suboptimal.  I'll try to quickly note them here, but I might not be recalling all of them quite right.
In the profiling scripts for ARM (https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/profiling/blob/main/perf/Dockerfile-arm64-start), why is there a toolchain file to enable cross compiling?
This is such that we can cross-build ARM docker images within an x64 CCI build VM. The reason for that was that "natively" building ARM64 docker images failed on CCI at that time. Will check again whether this is still the case.
