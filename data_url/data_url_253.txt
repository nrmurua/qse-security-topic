Can we add support for these gates please:
Fermionic swap gates
Givens rotation gates
A givens rotation controlled by 2 qubits.
Moreover, is it possible for a user to define a unitary matrix and use that as a quantum operation.
Adding gates via cupy would be great too.
Users are interested in this kind of functionality
@zohimchandani I would like to break this apart into two work items:
@zohimchandani Closing this as the request in this issue is now supported. If there is a desire to have support for creating a gate/kernel by defining an arbitrary unitary, could you please open a separate issue for it?
