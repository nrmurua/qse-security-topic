The CommutationTransformation does not preserves the semantic of the DAG. I do think that the commutative DAG is useful for some transformation and we should have some form of support for it. However, this is probably a discussion for another time.
I think, for now, the direct solution is to remove this pass. In the near future a commutative DAG can be storage in the property set. We owe a discussion if the main DAG should be a commutative DAG. Please, dump your thoughts about it in #1914.
I think it's fine to remove it, as the CommutationAnalysis pass is the main pass used for optimizations. The CommutationTransformation pass is not used. If we end up creating a new DependencyGraph structure, then a pass like this will be useful.
