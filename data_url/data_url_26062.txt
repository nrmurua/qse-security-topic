Currently, the circuit_sampler takes CircuitStateFn objects or StateVector objects and creates the circuit to be run on a quantum computer using the to_circuit method.
Our job is to make this compatible on any device which will involve converting the to_circuit() method to handle transpiling out of qiskit and into other device compatible circuits. With this and the QuantumInstance working to handle different devices we should have a VQE that will  be compatible with different backends.
Closing b/c this doesn't seem to apply anymore
