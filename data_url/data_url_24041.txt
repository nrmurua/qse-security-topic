A transmission line might need to allow for turns with a different corner rounding radius (fillet). At this time, the only thing I found I needed was fillet or no fillet (image below), so the current automation that prevents fillet on short edges works in my favor, allowing me to create orthogonal jogs as long as the edge is smaller than the corner radius. Great! However, the short edge gives me the warning, which in this case is undesirable.
This is for instance a custom grounding feed pin that was used in Bluejay

Can implement in multiple ways. For example:
