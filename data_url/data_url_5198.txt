I am working from a Mac and was trying to run the docker image for qvm. The qvm  docker image opens port 5000 , which is then mapped to port 5000  by default. However on a Mac port 5000 is already in use by Airplay. Currently there is no way in the provider to change the port on the host machine as it is hard coded to port 5000 in qcs_api_client/client/_configuration/settings.py . Can you look into this and perhaps make it more flexible?
@lauracaune - this should be more flexible, and I'll take a note back to the team to see where this falls in priorities. For the time being, on macos, you can work around this by disabling the Airplay listener in System Preferences > Sharing and toggling Airplay Receiver off:

Once you disable it, the port should be immediately available.
To add, the QVM itself can have the port changed with the -p or --port option at the command line. But it may not be configurable from pyQuil. I'd advise filing an issue in that project.
