Software triggering the ASG temporarily sets the ASG output to 0. If this is the intended behaviour it should just be documented.
This isn't necessarily the wrong thing to do, but it was a little weird to debug. A nice workaround if the asg shouldn't jump to zero was to set the trigger mode of the ASG to 'ext_positive_edge' and set the trigger pin to an output and sw toggle the trigger pin.  We were implementing this to avoid sudden jumps in the setpoint and enforce maximum setpoint changes and maximum setpoint slope changes.
