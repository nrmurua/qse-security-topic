Hi,
So I am trying to pip install on a macbook pro with an apple M1 chip and get this error:
Building wheels for collected packages: stim
Building wheel for stim (pyproject.toml) ... error
error: subprocess-exited-with-error

note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
ERROR: Failed building wheel for stim

ERROR: Could not build wheels for stim, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects
does it happen because of the chip or is it something else?
also using python 3.8.9 and latest pip
Should fixed it 1.9.dev1649881693 (try pip install stim==1.9.dev1649881693). Once 1.9 is out it'll be the automatic choice.
thanks! at the end it worked with regular pip install but inside a conda environment instead of pyenv
