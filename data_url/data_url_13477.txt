For zero noise extrapolation there are 3 alternatives ways to use Mitiq: execute_with_zne, mitigate_executor and zne_decorator.
For probabilistic error cancellation, we only have execute_with_pec.
It would be good to have a more uniform interface. This is also relevant for the arXiv resubmission.
I would propose two options:
Discussed at Mitiq meeting. Decided to:
I think I've accomplished this, and I am writing the tests right now. Writing the tests raised a question, though:
While zne spreads its tests for cirq, qiskit, and pyquil across different files in different locations, all the pec tests are contained within a single file test_pec. Is there a plan to spread pec testing into multiple files as well? If so, should I put the executor and decorator tests in the current test_pec file, or should I go ahead and create individual test files for each of the frameworks and place the new tests there?
@andre-a-alves good point!
For the moment I would put them in test_pec.py, for consistency with other PEC tests. For the future we could discuss the alternative option.
Personally, I find more intuitive the current PEC approach where that tests related to functions in pec.py are in test_pec.py even if related to non-Cirq circuits. However, I recognize that this is different from the way in which we organized ZNE tests.
