Since numpy has been removed in NixOS/nixpkgs@0fa639e from python2.7 the following packages can not be build anymore:
The last two seem to rely on python-2.7. We need to evaluate if this can be fixed with a reasonable amount of effort, or rather mark them as broken.
I guess Sharc is broken at this point beyond repair and simply going with 2to3 over it is likely to leave a complete mess. Sharc developers told us that they are porting to Python3 currently and rewrote some parts. Seems to have progressed well but is not complete yet. I think until then I would consider it broken.
Regarding chemps2: I would suggest to just build it python3 exclusive, which works flawlessly. I don't think some package uses it via Python2.

Then the solution is simple: I mark sharc and pyquante as broken and only build pychemps2 on python-3. pyquante is even unmaintained in its current form.
