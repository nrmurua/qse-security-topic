Certain composites do not handle reverse anneal parameters right now (for example the higherordercomposite).
There are multiple ways of dealing with this. Discuss? (10pts)
One thing that occurs to me would be to add a Initializable (or similar) ABC, similar to Structured. This would signal that the composite/sampler accepts and/or modifies an initial_state kwarg.
both classical solvers and the qpu in principle accepts initial states. I do feel like this should be standard
Worth noting that dwave-hybrid Runnables all accept an initial state. They also provide a Trait concept that is similar in concept to the dimod ABCs like Structured.
These are different objects with different pros/cons but worth keeping in mind.
ok?
