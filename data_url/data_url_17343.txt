I might be missing something important here, in which case, an friendly explanation would suffice to close this issue.
The test test.python.transpiler.test_coupling.CouplingTest.test_failed_reduced_map  attempts to create a coupling map that is not connected and, therefore, CouplingMap.reduce should rice. However, the resulting candidate (reduced_cmap) is [[1, 2], [0, 1]], which is connected.
What am I missing?
but it does not connect in qubit 3 so it is not connected over qubit 0, 1, 2 and 3. I agree that without looking at the test that said get 4 qubits it is very hard to tell.
Oh! Thanks.
