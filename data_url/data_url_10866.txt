Vartype definition is displayed twice
The adj attribute needs better explanation in BinaryQuadraticModel
as_ising and as_qubo return type  in BinaryQuadraticModel
Explain exception subclass structure
@orenshk
Any other doc issues add them here. Thanks!
@aidanproy Putting these here for posterity and so that I don't lose track of them.
The documentation should define a penalty model (and Ising model, QUBO,
feasible configuration, etc.) more precisely or give references
I wonder if "Boolean" would a better description of the {0,1} VarType
than "Binary", given that a "binary quadratic model" is also allowed to
be of vartype "spin"...
when "Vartype" is defined it would be helpful if the documentation
stated up front that "QUBO" is associated with "Boolean/Binary" and
"Ising" is associated with "spin"
when Specification class is defined it would be helpful if the
documentation stated up front what it's used for (input to a penalty
model factory)
typo in penaltymodel->decision_variables doc: "case" should be "cast"
in BinaryQuadraticModel, offset should be defined (is it ground state
energy?)
A single energy range (eg. [-2,2]) would be a useful way of inputting
Specification.linear_energy_ranges in addition to a dictionary of energy
ranges. Same for quadratic_energy_ranges.
It might be useful for penalty models to have an extra "graph
structure" flag of some sort, like "complete" or "chimera"?
Will dimod and penaltymodel eventually use to same notion of
BinaryQuadraticModel?
I'd like to see a "verifyRelationIsingModel" type function here rather
than in the factory modules
What is the name of an 'edge' in a binary quadratic model? add this to the BinaryQuadraticModel class comment.
Mention that decision variables must match the labels of the graph.

I believe all of these are addressed in 1.0.0 release.
