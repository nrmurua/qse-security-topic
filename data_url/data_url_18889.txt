branchingStatement  takes booleanExpression for its test.
However, this test can be bool type variable or subroutine/kernel calls that return bool . I believe that we should use expression instead of booleanExpression after integrating booleanExpression into the expression hierarchy.
This is already fixed. See https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm/blob/master/source/grammar/qasm3.g4#L370.
