The information should also be retrievable with the call to get_dataset.
Or a separate get_dataset_provenience() because you don't want it each time.
There is a race condition with that. I'd rather add an argument to get_dataset that defaults to False and says if metadata should be returned.
OK.
also display the rid provenience it in the datasets dock
