I created this issue:
Qiskit/qiskit#4694
but perhaps I should have created it here instead.
I believe that this line in the process tomography tutorial:
computes an incorrect fidelity (see the terra issue for details)
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/legacy_tutorials/ignis/6b_process_tomography.ipynb
If you run it as-is
The correct process fidelity
It might be nice to see average_gate_fidelity in there too
@qci-amos The link to tutorial is not working. Could you give me the correct one?
@rafal-pracht this looks like the successor notebook: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/noise/8_tomography.ipynb
it looks like the notebook has been rewritten and the specific concern is no longer applicable.
By reading its docstring, it looks like process_fidelity now supports the feature I was requesting, so I closed the terra issue too.
