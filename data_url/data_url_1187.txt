Description of the issue
How to reproduce the issue
Setup development environment for Python 3.9.16 and run
Strangely when pytest is run only on cirq-core/cirq/_compat_test.py it is a pass.
There seems to be some interference with other tests.
Cirq version
1.4.0.dev at 3161d30
The failure shows for the Pytest MacOS (3.9) CI check in #6340.
This was fixed by #6374 and by the merge 011f3fb in #6340.
