At the moment there is a "benchmarking connection" which essentially returns an ordered sequence of random Cliffords and the element that inverts the entire sequence (also implemented is the "interleaved" protocol).  I'd love to see a similar thing implemented for the "CNOT-dihedral group" described in this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.02720.pdf . It is an extension of the Clifford procedure to an important subset of non-Clifford gates. Even if we only got sequences for one and two qubit gates that would be amazing!
