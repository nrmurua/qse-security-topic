From the description on the manual
init()
and the dds_test.py file in the examples, it seems like I should be able to set the DDS' frequency without initialising it in the experiment? However, I find that I still need a dds,init if not there's no output from just dds.set(). Should that be the case?
Okay, thanks. It definitely took more than 1 ms between initialising dds' though. 10 ms seemed to work for me.
Oh right, the runtime gives 1ms to the 9914 just for the DAC calibration. Somehow I thought that figure was 125us.
