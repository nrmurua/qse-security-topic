0.23.1 transpiles a UCCSD circuit without one-qubit optimization though 0.22.0 does with it. Probably deprecating U1, U2, and U3 is a reason.
0.22.0:
0.23.0

Since #5429 is merged, is this problem resolved? ðŸ™‚
Not quite yet. That was only part of the issue aqua with aer exposes. It would have been sufficient without qiskit-community/qiskit-aqua@4cca284 and everything was still in U. But, with that aqua change that and aer's overcomplete basis set we need to merge #5431 too, and also adjust the selection logic in preset pass managers. For example: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/transpiler/preset_passmanagers/level1.py#L178-L182 doesn't work for aer because it we don't simplify chains of other single qubit gates because the basis translator doesn't translate most gates for aer.
This issue has been resolved with the merging of #5429 and #5431.
