The options that can be passed to the solvers are not entirely clear by looking at the documentation. For example:

Does not show the explicit options even thought it refers to them in the parameter documentation. For comparison, SESolver does show the options.
This I assume is because the options are inherited from SESolver. But this is not clear either by looking at MESolver's rendered documentation.

When using help(MESolver) the documentation of the class is much clearer but perhaps too verbose for the online documentation.
I would suggest we render the options property explicitly for each solver. I would also consider rendering the documentation related to the run method. If not, we should render at least Solver documentation which does not seem to be listed in the class API documentation for solvers.
Affected solvers:
No response
The documentation was taken from qutip 5.0 "ReadTheDocs".
Plus one on adding the options and run methods to the list of methods rendered in the documentation.
Hi! If I want to address this issue, should I just fork the repo, create my own branch an open a merge request?
Yes, go ahead, we are looking forward to your contribution! ðŸ˜„
I have just created the PR, I hope this solves the issue as expected. If not I am happy to discuss there ðŸ˜ƒ
If the issue is done but not merged yet, do I get assigned anyways so it can be crossed out from the unitary hack page and I get my bounty? ðŸ¤”
Merged now ðŸ˜„ . Thanks for the changes!
Awesome! If you have time to answer the final comments I had in the PR it would be really helpful ðŸ˜€
Also, I think I need to be added as assignee for the bounty to be closed in the unitary hack.
Done @EmilianoG-byte
Congrats @EmilianoG-byte!
