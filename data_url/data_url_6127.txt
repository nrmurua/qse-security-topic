In the pulse simulator, PersistantValue command does nothing when followed by a drive pulse with 0 amplitude.
Create a schedule as follows:
Now run a single qubit qobj with this schedule on meas_level=2 and check the counts. You should see {'0': number of shots}.
Unless the PV command leads to a 2 pi pulse, there should be some change in the counts. A good example to try is setting the PV amplitude to pi/number of samples which should lead to a pi pulse. This should make all the counts 1.
As we've added PV pulses to the 'unsupported' list, and they will also be removed from pulse, I think we can close this issue @chriseclectic
