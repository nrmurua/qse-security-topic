I was looking at the published docs for QuantumCircuit initialize - the links are referring to extensions and do not resolve
https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#initialize

which is in 0.45 and 0.46

In main it seems to have been updated but there is a typo in the StatePreparation link - library is missing the y there

Hi @woodsp-ibm can I be assigned to this issue?
Ah yeah, that was overlooked in #10725, nice catch! @valleyofblackpanther of course, you can have a go at it!
The links pointing to qiskit.extensions.<class> should instead point to qiskit.circuit.library.<class>. Let us know if you have any questions.
Hi, @Cryoris I made the changes but I am unable to push them because Qiskit is not allowing me to do so, do I have to sign the CLA agreement, before pushing it to the main? And who should I send signed document too?
Hi, you cannot push changes direct into the repository if that is what you are trying to do. Rather you should fork the repo, then make a new branch off the branch to which the changes should apply in your repo, make the changes on that branch in your fork and then do a PR (Pull Request).
The CLA is online and when doing a PR it will link to this for it to be signed electronically.
here is more info about these things in this file https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md if you have not seen this.
While the typo (the missing 'y' can be fixed with a PR against main (i,e do the changes in a new branch made from main branch), I think the issue against 0.46 needs to be done against the stable/0.46 branch. There do not seem to be any more releases planned for 0.45 so it maybe 0.46 (which is imminent anyway) is the earliest it can be fixed for, with 1.0 coming a bit later from main. Hopefully @Cryoris can correct me if needed.
Hi @Cryoris @woodsp-ibm I did the required changes as instructed.
This issues have been fixed by referenced PRs so I am closing this (not sure why it was not auto-closed).
