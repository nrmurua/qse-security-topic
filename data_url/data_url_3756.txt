Increase functionality of control flow conditioned on classical memory position to include JUMP-UNLESS @something [0].  Streamlines many empty JUMP-WHEN blocks making control flow cleaner.
@ncrubin Can you add a simple pseudo-code example of the functionality here?
Currently, if_then can be used to create Quil control flow that executes the if statement conditioned on classical memory.  If there is no else program specified the control flow would look as follows:
Expressing if control with no else can be more succinctly expressed as
There's now a JUMP-UNLESS (class JumpUnless) directive in PyQuil (like in the Quil paper). Can we close this issue now? @ncrubin @willzeng
@stevenheidel yup!
