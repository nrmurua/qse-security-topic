Thanks for these awesome tutorials and katas!
In the ComplexArithmetic workbook answers.
Exercise 1: Powers of  𝑖 .
Input: An even integer  𝑛 .
Goal: Return the  𝑛 th power of  𝑖 , or  𝑖𝑛 .
The solution code here is below:
While that works for the divisible by 4 case, it doesn't really work for the not-divisible by 4 cases.  The answer should only be -1 if n % 4 == 2, right?  There needs to be another check to see if it could also be -i or i as well.
Am I missing something super simple?
I'm glad you're finding this project helpful!
In this task the input promises that n will be even, so either divisible by 4 or give remainder 2 when dividing by 4; thus the result is always an integer. (In the first iteration of this tutorial, we offered the full version of the task, asking to return a complex tuple, but that turned out to be more complicated for the first task of this tutorial than we wanted it to be, so we cut back to a simpler version.)
@tcNickolas I see!  I didn't read the input correctly.  Thanks!
