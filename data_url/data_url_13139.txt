We now have a quantum sub-spece expansion (QSE) technique but its functions are not visible in the API doc of the Mitiq documentation.
This scope of this issue is to add all public QSE functions in the docs/source/apidoc.md file with some reasonable section titles/subtitles.
For what concerns the full documentation of QSE in the user's guide, there is a different issue (#1924).
