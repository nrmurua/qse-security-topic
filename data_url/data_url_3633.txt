The ISA class currently ingests JSON of the format:
To be compatible with other parts of the Forest stack, it should be of the form:
In other words, the ISA json would be a list whose nth entry is a dictionary keyed by n+1 qubit strings, and whose values are all relevant information to those n+1 qubit sets (single-qubit gate information, two-qubit gate information, etc.).
However, as a result of this change the "id" dictionary would be lost.
