Various tests seem to fail with qiskit-aer-0.12.0, while qiskit-0.11.2 passed all its tests at the time of release and still passes them when I check now, which suggests it's not an environment issue.
The failures all look identical:
The full log is available here:  build.log.gz
Let me know if I can give more information.
I can try cook up a Gentoo Dockerfile to reproduce if needed.
All tests pass.

Thank you for your report. We are uinsg stestr and it does not report the above error.
Could you test stestr run --slowest and tell me whether you encounter the same errors?
BTW, I have tested with pytest on my linux env (Ubuntu) but was not able to reproduce the above error.
Let me close this issue because no response in a month. Feel free to reopen this or open new issue if a problem remains.
Okay, I bisected, and I came up with:

Any ideas?
@hhorii I still seem to get these with 0.12.2. Does the bisect from above help? Thanks.
Ping.
So I've been able to determine that nlohmann_json is to blame. 3.10.2 is the newest version that "works", with 3.10.3 qiskit-aer doesn't compile, and with 3.10.4+ it fails.
I am running into the same issue but only on MacOS for some reason. I am using 0.13.1 from conda-forge.
Any idea how this could have regressed?
edit: it is because of https://github.com/conda-forge/qiskit-aer-feedstock/blob/5b673ad4eb3827ff5b34345d1869b2077f2a5a33/recipe/meta.yaml#L74-L75
Should be fixed in conda-forge/qiskit-aer-feedstock#29
