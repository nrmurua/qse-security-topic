3+ qubit unitary matrices can be transpiled to basis gates using the isometry instruction, however this is not used automatically if a circuit contains unitary gate instructions --- circuits with unitary gate instructions can currently only be transpiled if they are 1 or 2 qubits.
The definition of the UnitaryGate class should be updated to unroll using an isometry instruction for 3+ qubits.
