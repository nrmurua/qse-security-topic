In the method IbmqNoiseModel::relaxationParams()

there is a call to getUniversalGateEquiv() here:

Subsequently the returned  string is used to lookup m_gateDurations here:

However, the strings returned by getUniversalGateEquiv() have the form: "u3_0" whereas the keys for m_gateDurations have the form "u3" which have been populated based on JSON input during IbmqNoiseModel::initialize()

The following test code  (which uses 'backend-json' ) results in core dump:
Actually I think it's my JSON noise model...the 'gate_qubit' must be in the "name"...so this works ok:
Yeah, the backend Json file from IBM has a unique name for each gate-qubit combination (e.g. u3_0, u3_1, etc.)
We currently rely on that naming convention in XACC to look up gate data from that configuration Json.
There are a couple of sample Json files that we pulled from IBM for testing, e.g. this one.
