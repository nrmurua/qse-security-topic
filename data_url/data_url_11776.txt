When setting up a quantum instance with the ibmq_qasm_simulator backend and a noise model, from what I can tell, two things can happen:
To setup logging, include this
Then run
An error should be raised instead of going ahead with instantiating the QuantumInstance. I think this behavior would be better because if the user specified a noise model and hasn't enabled logging, then they would get results back without knowing that the noise model they chose wasn't actually used.
PR #552 is adding more checks and will raise AquaError if we found the improper setting.
That PR #552 is merged. I think we can close this issue, is it okay? Thanks.

Great, thanks for the quick follow-up!
