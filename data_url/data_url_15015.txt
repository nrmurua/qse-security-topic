I think the value returned with frame = 'h' should be different from the value returned with frame='s'. Seems like one or two daggers need to move:

If we trust the docs for Pauli.evolve, then the error on PauliList.evolve docs is for the default behavior (frame = 'h'), which should instead be C^dag P C :

Looking at the code also the change you suggest seems correct:
It would also be nice to update the Returns docs to reflect that the results could change.
You are correct. the documentation for PauliList should be the same as Pauli.
