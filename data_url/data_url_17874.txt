One other thought that I had recently related to this is now that we have an ascii drawer we should also make the __str__ for a circuit return the output of the circuit_drawer(output='text'). So people could print(circuit) and get the text visualization of the circuit.
I am good with that.
When fixed, unblock issue #981.
We do have text drawer now. Can @mtreinish modify #911 to just add the method? Or close #911 and create a new PR for that.
@1ucian0 I'm going to reuse #911 to add the method. I decided to split up the commits that were part of it though. Right now #1152 is the last prerequisite, once that merges I'll rebase/rework #911
