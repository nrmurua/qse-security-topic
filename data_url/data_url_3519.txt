This is because ForestConnection means different things depending on where you are. Outside the QMI it hits AWS, inside it tries to hit the QVM-VM.
I think using PyquilConfig instead should fix it, but you probably know better than me how that works outside of the QMI @mpharrigan
It's supposed to always hit the aws endpoint, right?
