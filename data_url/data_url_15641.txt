I'm solving QAOA Max-cut using the L_BFGS_B optimizer provided in qiskit.algorithms.optimizers and then realized it doesn't update the QAOA parameters, and hence did not solve the problem. I've tried with both Aqua and the new qiskit_optimization package the behaviors are the same. Pretty sure I didn't do anything wrong as it works well for other optimizers. The termination was caused by CONVERGENCE: NORM_OF_PROJECTED_GRADIENT_<=_PGTOL, as shown in the disp=True output below.
qiskit_optimization package:
Using the old Aqua:
L_BFGS_B should update the parameters like the other optimizers do.
