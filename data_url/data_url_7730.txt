Found this when tried to load a circuit with patametrized gates. Saves fine but fails to load

Thanks for the issue, this should be quite fixable, hopefully just by adding __setstate__ and __getstate__ to PTensor and maybe PArray, (which customize pickling behaviour). I can try and take a look unless you want to attempt a fix yourself!
I've looked into it, overriding __setstate__ and __getstate__ in PTensor indeed seems to fix the issue. However there is a very weird case when it can't save it after optimizing a circuit, here's an example.
Honestly I have no idea what's happening, but it looks like when not all tensors are optimized something goes wrong. And it doesn't look like it's caused by the fix. Don't really need this to work anymore, but let me know if you have any thoughts on this.
Hmm, I'll try and take a look. Looks like something weird to do with capturing locally defined functions somehow. Thanks for the PR fixing the original issue!
