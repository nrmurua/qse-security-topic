Part of the #2678 Epic. Repeated below:
Change: qiskit/pulse/commands/instruction.py should be moved to qiskit/pulse/instruction.py.
Rationale: Instructions are Commands + Channels, so they encompass both pieces equally, and should live separate from just one of the submodules. Instruction is a type of ScheduleComponent, so it fits better with other Schedule / ScheduleComponent files, rather than within the command module with Command and Command implementations. To be verbose, Command also doesn't inherit from Instruction.
There are circular imports between instruction.py and command.py, makes this a more interesting (larger in scope) issue.
this will be fixed by removing instructions
