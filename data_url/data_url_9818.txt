Description
I am trying to implement the Gavish-Graves subtour elimination constraint for a CQM. To do so, I have to implement this CPLEX code [1] using Dimod :
Where y is the binary variable representing the edge connection from i to j, and Z is a positive number.
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
I am expecting to have it pass similar to the CPLEX code.
Environment
Additional Context
Here is the paper which I took the CPLEX code from :
[1] : https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1680/10/1/19
Kindly let me know if you would like the full code for this to have it run in full.
I tried #1211 mindset, and thought something like :
$Z[i][j] - (n-1) * X[i][j]$, and got this error :
Here is my code for it :
I imagine the case for Real is what is causing the error.
tHE TypeError was from presence of int in place of the variable (which shouldn't really be causing a problem, I think this could be avoided by adding a condition in the add_constraint expection that if no variables are being passed, then assert the condition stands, something like here for instance if Z and X for some ij value is 0, then 0<=0, which is True, so it would continue to the next iteration.
I resolved the issue for now, I'll address this again in case I have any missed issues.

Sounds good, closing for now.
