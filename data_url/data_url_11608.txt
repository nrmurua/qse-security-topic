Under Python 3.8 the following line fails under lints due to differing arguments

I suspect the UserDict signature may have changed a little. Can this be investigated and altered as needed. #1089 which is unrelated adds a pylint disable as they ran lint under 3.8.
In addition to looking at the code and handling appropriately perhaps we should also lint under 3.8 too in the build.
