Currently, the performance of my quantum algorithm varies greatly with the different QPU runs I perform. To track this, I started saving the native.native_quil_metadata output to a file so I can compare the program fidelity between runs.
It would be nice if native.native_quil_metadata could also output information such as the latest retune results for the select qubits in the algorithm and not the whole chip.
Moreover, if there could be functionality to save all this information along with an image of the decomposed circuit which ends up being executed to a pdf automatically, this would provide a holistic set of information that the user can use for analysis later on.
