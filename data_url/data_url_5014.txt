Now that users can (soon) specify n-qubit unitaries, the struct design should use arrays rather than fields for ease of use.
Additionally, we should include functions for e.g. computing the conjugate transpose, and other matrix algebra (without external lin-alg integration).
Additionally, functions for creating 'templates' of unitary matrices (e.g. creating n-qubit identity, creating a zero matrix (when ={0}; becomes illegal after switching to arrays).
Additionally, an extension of QuEST_complex.h to integrate with these new data structures.
Done.
