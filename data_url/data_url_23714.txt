The next version, and thus the master branch will ship without the multiprocessing code.
It's huge and we just don't want to keep maintaining it.
@giulioungaretti any idea how long it will take until a replacement multiprocessing? Our group is quite reliant on the multiprocessing architecture, and we will probably have to separate branches until then
