In many place our documentation shows LaTeX fractions that are larger than the surrounding parenthesis. For example in the sine and cosines in the UGate documentation we have

That's because we don't use the \left \right or \big commands if a parenthesis surrounds a \frac-fraction. It would be nice if we could go through the docs and ensure everything is nicely rendered by e.g. replacing occurances as
with
Can I work on this issue? Also, please share link to qiskit documentation where it needs to be fixed.
@saktar-unr Yes sure, thank you! @Cryoris can you post links to places where this needs to be fixed?
Thanks for taking this on!
I think we'll have to adjust the docs mainly in the standard_gates submodule: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/tree/main/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates. For example, in the RXGate docstring we have
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/5c61d8f2df5a2255e1f31a53be79a45a1abe0cd1/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/rx.py#L43
which produces the following

If we'd adjust the docs to
that should render much nicer (meaning "exp" is not cursive and the parenthesis size matches the size of the fraction).
We'll have to check all the files in that submodule to see where this is the case ðŸ™‚
I'm looking forward to any questions you have @saktar-unr!
@Cryoris, Thank you!
I looked into all the files of submodule: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/tree/main/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates. and fixed all issues related to parenthesis and latex commands. Can you tell me is there anyway to see the changes of the docstring (similar to https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html)? Also should I create pull request for each of the files or  one pull request for all (13) of them?
Just one pull request for all of them would be good! You can build the documentation locally and check there how it looks like. If you have tox installed you should be able to do that by calling tox -edocs in the qiskit-terra root folder ðŸ™‚
Can I work on this issue? Send me documentation where it needs to be fixed.
Thanks for your interest, @stoicodin, but this issue has already been solved by
@saktar-unr in #7872.  You can see the context and linked pull requests above.  If you'd like to find something else to work on, please have a look at the issues tagged "good first issue".
