The matrices should be equal.
In this case, the two matrices differ by a factor of -1.
I would like to work on this issue.
Previously global phase factor differences in decomposition had not been considered bugs although maybe it's unexpected that these two paths should yield different decompositions.
Thanks for your interest @Jwala-1908 , I am working on a related fix that should also resolve this issue.
Sorry for the late response, I didn't see notices.

Do we expect that controlling a circuit should give equivalent results for nominally equivalent decompositions? If this is so, I suppose the global phase is important here.
My immediate concern is tracking down bugs in an implementation of phase estimation. The behavior in this issue is a candidate.
Closing as resolved by #5764 .
