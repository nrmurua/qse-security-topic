We currently have nightly integration tests that send programs to the supported providers, but none of those tests exercise cudaq::observe(). (They currently all use cudaq::sample().) We need to add some additional tests to accomplish this, perhaps like examples/cpp/basics/expectation_values.cpp.
test/NVQPP/integration/test-observe.cpp was added in PR #661. Currently, Quantinuum is the only one exercising this (as evidenced in this nightly integration run), so I am leaving this issue open until the other backends are updated to use it as well.
