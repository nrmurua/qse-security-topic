Hello, I was trying to generate certs with Sphinics on Harka, SHA 256, and shake 256 but I have only gotten "sphincsharaka128frobust" working. I use the same notation as on the Github page ex"sphincssha256128srobust". An I using the notation wrong or is there some other problem?
As noted in the Authentication section here, only sphincsharaka128frobust is enabled in the fork by default. In order to use the rest, you will have to run the code generation mechanism as described here.
Hello, thanks for your reply. I followed the steps on the website and got the algorithms to generate the keys but I am still facing a couple of issues. The first issue is that "rainbowVccylic" still does not work and the second issue is that I am not able to get the certificate signing requests for a lot of the algorithms. I use the commands provided in the openssl website " apps/openssl req -new -newkey  -keyout _srv.key -out _srv.csr -nodes -subj "/CN=oqstest server" -config apps/openssl.cnf
" and " apps/openssl x509 -req -in _srv.csr -out _srv.crt -CA _CA.crt -CAkey _CA.key -CAcreateserial -days 365" and I get this response.

rainbowVccylic is a typo in our README, it should be rainbowVccyclic. I'll fix that shortly.
As for the other set of errors, how was the CA certificate generated? What algorithms did you specify for req and x509?
Hello, sorry for the late reply and thank you for the typo fix. Here is how I generated the CA keys
"apps/openssl req -x509 -new -newkey rainbowVcclassic -keyout key_CA.key -out key_CA.crt -nodes -subj "/CN=oqstest CA" -days 365 -config apps/openssl.cnf"
@xvzcf any progress?
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you @prchander, but I'm unable to reproduce this issue with the commands you gave.
Could you perhaps provide a Dockerfile in which the issue can be reproduced?
Closing due to lack of activity. Feel free to reopen if the issue persists.
