I don't think you're forgetting anything; I think this was an accidental consequence of both the cost-function changes and accomplishing the original by uncoordinatedly tweaking things 'til they worked.
@ecpeterson Should the compute-applicable-* functions be generic? Right now they only consider fidelity, but we also support (elsewhere in the compiler) duration as a cost metric.

I doubt it should be generic (in the generic-function sense), but maybe it can take some extra arguments controlling how to sort the applicable compilers according to custom or more generic policies.
