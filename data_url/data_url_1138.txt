The AQT api does not seem to have a measurement gate.  This issue is to add measurements to generation of cirq circuits from the api when it gets measurement gates.
Currently blocked on AQT api.
Combining this with another TODO in the AQT code.  In aqt_sampler.py there is a TODO about not hard coding the measurement.  Likely this is because AQT assumes terminal measurements.
