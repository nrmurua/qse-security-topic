Recently I was testing the openssl speed command. I can’t understand why AES128-CBC can set -bytes +int option to run benchmarks on custom-sized buffer, but Bikel1 can’t set.
AES128-CBC:

Bikel1:

This option is for non-PKI/"streaming" crypto components. Please run openssl speed -help:
-bytes +int         Run [non-PKI] benchmarks on custom-sized buffer
And from https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-speed.html :
-bytes num
Run benchmarks on num-byte buffers. Affects ciphers, digests and the CSPRNG.
