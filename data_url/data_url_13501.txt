It would be super cool to have an action like https://github.com/marketplace/actions/twitter-together hooked up to tweet when we publish releases as well as merge PRs into master for stuff :)
I'd love to try this as a first issue! Could I take it?
Yeah! That would be great @StreakSharn 💖 We can talk about this if you want tomorrow at the Mitiq community call on our discord :)
Sure! I don't have a working mic, sadly, but I'll make sure to be there. What time will it be?
Its 9am PST on #community-call voice channel 👍
Does Mitiq have a twitter account?
Not separate from the Unitary Fund's acct. (@unitaryfund).
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
