I'm using DWaveSampler, and want to compare results of two different settings.
They should return same result, however, the results are always different.
Is there random state in DWaveSampler? If so, how do I fix the random state?
Thanks!
The DWaveSampler uses the D-Wave Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) as a computational resource. Quantum annealing processors naturally return low-energy solutions, but they are inherently probabilistic.
For example, you can imagine sampling from a single qubit with no bias and no interactions with other qubits:
Everything else being equal, the probability of the qubit ending in the -1 or the 1 state is equal (50 percent).
In another example, say we strongly bias a single qubit towards -1:
Even in this case, there is a small chance that the QPU will end the anneal in an excited state and return 1, rather than -1.
It is also important to note that because this sampling is done via a physical process, there is no 'state' to fix.
I hope this helps!

Thanks, Arcondello.
How about SimulatedAnnealingSampler? Is that possible to fix the random state?
Thanks again,
The SimulatedAnnealingSampler found in dimod is a reference implementation and does not currently have the ability to fix a seed.
However, there is a more powerful implementation of simulated annealing found here which does allow a fixed seed.
Thanks, Arcondello.
I'm using dimod for now, maybe it is a good idea to move to neal :)
I found fix random state quit helpful in algorithm development, especially when I want to compare the performance of 2 algo.
Glad I could help. Closing this issue for now.
