The cirq.rz helper function (cirq.ops.common_gates:1045) converts inputs to half turns (radians?) by dividing by sympy.pi for parametrized inputs, but this division is actually expressed as sympy.Mul(sympy.Pow(sympy.pi, sympy.Integer(-1))
The sympy.Pow part of that expression then causes problems with serializers that expect only Mul and Add in Sympy expressions (i.e. cirq.google.arg_func_langs:143)
Would it make more sense to convert all forms of rz inputs (symbolic or not) with division by np.pi?

Was there a reason not to support Pow in the language (or division for that matter)?  Worry about divide by zero?
