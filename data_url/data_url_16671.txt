Currently test_compose.py doesn't cover setting condition to a circuit (a consequence of which can be seen here #4135 (comment)). It does have a variable self.condition but it isn't used in any test.
The expected solution should add a test to cover setting condition and using compose.
@1ucian0 I can pick this one up if you'd like.
HI,
is this resolved? Can I collaborate?
This is the documentation of compose:
QuantumCircuit.compose(other, qubits=None, clbits=None, front=False, inplace=False)
I understand, front is not yet implemented and inplace is already tested. What is meant by condition?
