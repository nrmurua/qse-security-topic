This code, which currently causes exceptions:
should have the equivalent behavior as this code:
via Linspace checking for sympy.Symbol and calling str on it to get the actual key if so.
I'll take this.
@vtomole Feel free to completely ignore this, if you have spent significant time on this already, but I have a pull request ready to go for this. I can wait for the next "good first issue", no problem.
I have a question about my implementation, though. Right now I do a type-check whether the key is of sympy.Symbol before calling str, but I'm wondering if that is at all necessary? Anything can be used as a key, as long as it's a string? Can we just call str on any input?
@timothyman It's yours!
Thanks, @vtomole!
@timothyman I would avoid just calling str on the input, because that will mask mistakes where a nonsensical value is entered. Also, it would do things like cause the number 1 and the qubit LineQubit(1) to map down to the same thing, which is probably not desirable.
