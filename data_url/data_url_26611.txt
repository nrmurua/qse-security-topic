With the current master at d8b6a4f I get the following warning after building with the toolchain on a non-CUDA system with PREFERRED_DIAG_LIBRARY ELPA:
This is wrong.
Though a regression tester run on daint-gpu (CRAY-XC50) shows no wrong or failed tests, there are still many warnings and MPI errors printed of the following kind:
The GPU warnings are triggered here. I assumed elpa_obj%can_set("gpu", 1) was the right way to check for GPU support, but looking at what is presumably the implementation that seems to not be the case. Since we did not yet get ELPA+GPU to work anyways, I'll just remove those warnings.
It's strange that the warnings about leaked ELPA objects persist. I expected them to turn into aborts after dceca61.
