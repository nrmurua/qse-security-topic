Converting a dictionary generated with as_dict back to an ExperimentResult with from_dict does not generate the same object.
A minimal example:
The output of the example is:
I would have expected the following output:

Hi @peendebak ,
those functions are indeed not guaranteed to provide a "round-trip" and be an inverse of each other - as a matter of fact, it is not recommended to rely on those functions, as they were mostly introduced to support the transition from the older format to Qobj and it was not a hard design decision to be able to seamlessly convert back and forth from dict fully. Other than the issue #753 you correctly mention as related, there are already other issues discussion the functions #652 (and ultimately a TODO https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/qobj/_qobj.py#L89).
Can you provide more information about your use case for round-tripping?
@diego-plan9 We have been using the conversion functions to adapt our interface to the new 0.6.1 release. We have decided to also convert our internals from the dict to the objects, so we have no use case for exact round-tripping any more.
Thanks for the confirmation @peendebak ! Indeed, in general making use of the Qobj machinery internally tends to be the recommended approach (wherever suitable) - looking forward to more reports in the process üëç
I'm not sure if as_dict is a method anymore. Is this bug still valid? @peendebak @diego-plan9
Please see the comment at #1448, which linked this thread - this issue is part of the group that will become obsolete when that one is addressed.
