There is a failure in example_sig on travis when qtesla-p-i is used; this needs to be investigated.
Is this still an issue since the latest qtesla update?
qTesla works on my Raspberry Pi.  I've submitted PR #716 to re-enable qTesla on ARM CI, and if the CI tests pass for it then we'll merge it and close this issue.
