Hi,
I am a phd student currently working on a transpiler. I would like to use your code for benchmarking but i have problems installing the package. I have tried both pip install, and cloning the repository...
Can you fix the code or help me with the installation?
Hi Simon,
Could you share the error messages?
error: legacy-install-failure
× Encountered error while trying to install package.
╰─> qiskit-aer
note: This is an issue with the package mentioned above, not pip.
hint: See above for output from the failure.
I have tried also installing qiskit aer and then the package, but it is still not working
