Apologies, the current QFT benchmarks are based on a default case which was basically too ideal to be representative, in the tester's ignorance. It seems that aggressively trying to recover separation of QUnit subsystems usually costs more performance than it recovers, at least at available quantities of qubits with my current best attempts.
The Grover's benchmarks represent an algorithm without subsystem separation attempts, and QUnit just about limits to the performance of QEngine types on that test. Arguing from the Grover's benchmarks, QUnit can probably be safely assumed to just about recover the performance of QEngine types when not trying to proactively separate subsystems. My hope, (partially based on naive data, which was my fault,) was to beat the complexity order of QEngine types. Maybe this can still be done.
It's probably worth pointing to "Breaking the 49-Qubit Barrier in the Simulation of Quantum Circuits" by Pednault, et. al, again. I'll have to do more research on whether this approach has been adopted elsewhere with success.
I will also update the benchmark document and graph, probably on January 1st.
