I can't seem to get sawg to produce clean sinusoids at low frequencies. This is new in the last couple days. When run the program below I get
10 MHz -4 dBm
20 MHz -33 dBm
30 MHz -13 dBm
40 MHz -47 dBm
50 MHz -18 dBm
I expect the spectrum to be free of harmonics out to f_rtio_coarse/2.
The spectrum will never be completely "free of harmonics out to f_rtio_coarse/2".
The data out of SAWG in gateware simulation for this experiment is squeaky clean, with harmonics below -80 dBc and the Nyquist image at 140 MHz at -60 dBc.
There is a 8 MHz lower limit on the balun. I don't know how it behaves towards that.
You are certain this was not the case with 3.0.dev-py_1092+gitebb46602? Please do that same measurement with that older version.
A -9 dBc third harmonic would be easily visible on a scope. Is it?
Please test this with the DUC upconverting it to somewhere else, e.g. self.sawg0.frequency0.set(25*MHz).

Roll back to previous version.
Flash & reset KC705.
This build doesn't respond to ping. I think it's the one that's foobar'd. Try earlier build.
OK can ping this build.
10 MHz tone is beautiful.
An oscilloscope shot would help a lot. Then try again with b5772f4 (and properly initializing the channel).


@jordens What's the status on this?
Joe, the status is waiting. Quote from above:
I see. I tested and posted screen shots for
3.0.dev-py_1126+git10fb6c62 which predated  b5772f4.
Since the build for  b5772f4 failed I can't do verbatim as you ask. I'll use the most recent build.
I observe the same harmonics.
Thanks. Testing the current version is fine.
This is not using sawgx.reset(). See #751.
I tested again this afternoon. The output still includes enormous harmonics. Can you reproduce on your hardware?
@jordens Do you have what you need from me for this? Label is still state:waiting.

@jordens Please post what you see on your spectrum analyzer.

(the blue trace is just testing the limiter)
OK. Confirmed.
