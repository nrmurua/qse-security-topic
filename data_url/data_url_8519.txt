Hi,
Is there a reason for not using aspect ratio "equal" for the resulting plot of the plot_wigner function? Wigner plots are much more readable when using such settings, in my opinion.
Thanks
EDIT: I can make a PR for this, but would rather have some feedback before doing it :)
I am willing to make a PR to fix #544 and could include a fix for this as well.
The way I am thinking I could do it right now is to put an extra equal parameter to plot_wigner which would have a default value and could be used to alternate between the two behaviors (with othonormal axes and without).
I'd like a feedback on the best default value, each one having its own advantages:
Thanks
This was done in Pull #736
