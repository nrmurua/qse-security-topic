--> aqua install
pyeda's docs also include notes on installation on Windows
Thanks for noting this. Since pyeda requires manual intervention to install on windows the install via requirements and setup.py has been made conditional in order to allow the Aqua install to complete. We will add some note to the installation instructions. Also should you try to use a component that depends on pyeda, it will give information to the effect that it needs to be installed and link to pyeda.. This was changed in #471
