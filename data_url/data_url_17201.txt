Part of the #2678 Epic. Repeated below:
Change: The name of Instruction class
Proposal: CommandSchedule
Rationale: Instruction and Command are often synonyms in practice, and what distinguishes the two might depend on who you ask. In our pulse code, Instruction refers to a ScheduleComponent which has no children, and is made of a Command played on particular Channels. The proposed name makes it more transparent that the class behaves like a Schedule, and contains a Command.
Instructions will be removed in a later refactor
