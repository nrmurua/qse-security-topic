Currently the bit strings using in plot_histogram can only be ordered as ascending or descending.  However, it is informative to be able to order the bit strings in terms of some distance function from a target bit string.  The Hamming distance is one such measure, and is useful to see the effects of gate and environmental noise on the system as measured by number of bit flips.
