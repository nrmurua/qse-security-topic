measure_observables created new programs to calibrate readout errors (and can also symmetrize the errors).  Unfortunately, if the program given to measure_observables contains error model information, that will not be captures by the calibration, and the results will not match the expected behavior from calibration.
See #825
i.e., if we add an error model via
readout calibration in measure_observables will not behave as expected.  We need a mechanism to add asymmetric readout error to the QVM instead -- and there appears to be none at the moment.
It used to be possible to write
but this code does not work anymore because _get_qvm_compiler_based_on_endpoint has been removed.
As a short term fix, you can replace _get_qvm_compiler_based_on_endpoint with QVMCompiler (as imported from pyquil.api._compiler). That method used to switch between QVMCompiler and LocalQVMCompiler as needed, but LocalQVMCompiler has since been removed.
Another issue is that the calibration program was not being symmetrized. This and the one that has been discussed here before are being fixed in a branch as we speak.
Following @ecp-rigetti 's comment, it seems like
works -- i.e., provides a QVM with an error model (even if the program does not introduce errors)
