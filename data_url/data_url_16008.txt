The assemble function changes the name of the circuit. That makes the circuit's result "hard to find" after job.result() (see https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/16946/qiskiterror-data-for-experiment-circuit-109-could-not-be-found/16948#16948, which exposes broken example in the textbook https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-machine-learning/machine-learning-qiskit-pytorch.html#3.-Let's-code!- )
This was introduced in #5851
Closed as it is the expected result. The problem is in the textbook (already reported here https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-textbook/issues/1038).
