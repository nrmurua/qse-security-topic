The build of libsirius fails on Piz Daint using GCC 9.3.0. See the corresponding regression test for details.
@mtaillefumier could you have a look at this problem?
problem is here : /store/psi/psi01/mkrack/rt/gpu-gnu-psmp/cp2k/tools/toolchain/build/SIRIUS-7.4.3/src/api/sirius_api.cpp:3062
wrong version of SIRIUS.
We won't be back porting these changes though so the linked version of sirius should be updated.

That file does not exist. The current SIRIUS build for daint-gpu uses version 7.5.2. Therefore, it is not clear to me what you mean.
CP2K is linked with the wrong version of SIRIUS. the error you see is triggered by SIRIUS itself. So the file might not exist but the binary still knows about it. The CP2K binary is linked with the wrong version of SIRIUS. 7.5.2 is build but the older version is still in use.
The problem is not related to CP2K. The compilation of SIRIUS 7.5.2 with GCC 9.3.0 itself is already failing:
I am not even sure we support gcc 9 and the error reported here is an issue with the cuda version installed on daint or the version used at the time of configuration. We can not support everything.
As a quick solution I can propose to roll back the change in cp2k to get the band gap and use tested version of cp2k/sirius. It's more realistic to enable sirius verbosity so that user can extract the band gap from sirius output. The problem comes not from gcc, but from cuda. I think we need cuda>=11.4 because it provides cusolverDnXtrtri_bufferSize api function. I agree, this is a bad thing in cuda to change API in the minor version.
@toxa81 Thanks for the clarification. I would indeed appreciate if the verbosity of the sirius output could be controlled by cp2k. Since cuda >= 11.4 is not available for daint-gpu, I will drop sirius from the CRAY-XC50 regression test until a fix is available.
