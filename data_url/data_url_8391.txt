I am trying to perform this simple operation 
where

and

I do that as follow:
and i got the following :
but when i do each part separately as follow I notice that the shapes are compatible:
The first has shape = (16, 16) and the second has shape = (16, 1), there shouldn't be any problems in performing matrix multiplication.
Why I got this error and how to solve it.
My environment is as follow:
It is giving an error because your operator and your state are in two different spaces.
tensor(hadamard_transform(1), hadamard_transform(1), identity(2), identity(2))  is 4 single qubit operators acting on 4 single qubit subsystems (as intended).
basis(16, 1) is an atom with 16 distinguishable states and no subsystems. You cannot make a single qubit operator act on this object (since it is not a qubit) and there are no subspaces for the remaining 3 operators to act on.
The state that you actually want (a system of 4 qubit subsystems) can be constructed as
tensor(basis(2), basis(2), basis(2), basis(2))
Try this
tensor(hadamard_transform(1), hadamard_transform(1), identity(2), identity(2)) * tensor(basis(2), basis(2), basis(2), basis(2))
Or for clarity
H = hadamard_transform(1)
I = identity(2)
ket0 = basis(2)
HHII = tensor(H, H, I, I)
psi = tensor(ket0, ket0, ket0, ket0)
HHII * psi
Hope this helps.
