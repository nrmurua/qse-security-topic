Do we need to update the CBOM #1336 after the BIKE Round 4 update #1369?  @bhess?
If so, we should also make some process to ensure we don't miss that type of thing next time -- maybe updating the PR template, maybe something more.
It looks like the CBOM was updated in #1369.
The CBOM is automatically updated along with the docs when doing a copy_from_upstream, so I think no additional process is needed.
I updated the CBOM manually in #1369 by running the update_docs_from_yaml.py script (the CI complained about documentation not being up to date before that).
Ah, thanks for handling that!  Closing as already resolved.
