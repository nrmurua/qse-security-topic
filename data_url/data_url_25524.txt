When users iterate large workflows, it would be very convenient if modifying an electron only causes itself and dependent tasks to be re-run. This is analogous to how build systems like make work; only modified source files and files that depend on them are rebuilt.
This issue tracks the algorithmic part of the implementation: a procedure to determine which nodes from a previously run computational graph can be reused in a newly dispatched workflow.
@cjao can this be closed as either fixed or duplicate?
Yes, this has landed in develop with the rest of redispatching.
