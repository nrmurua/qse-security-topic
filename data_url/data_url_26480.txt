Hello. Dear Sir/Madam.
Today, aftetr make the cp2k.psmp successfully using the newest code, I started to make test on Ubuntu 22.04.1. The screen held the words about not finding modules  and not moved on for many minites. I think it  was stucked because on my machine, the test only needs about 15min with 28 cores.
the environment-modules  have been installed on the OS.
Could give some advice to me?
stucked.txt
it is about slurm or slurm settings.  after uninstall slurm and slurm-*. it is ok.
