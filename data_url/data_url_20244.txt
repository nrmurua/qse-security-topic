I did some performance test in trying to sign and verify a some data and calculating the average signing and verifying per second. I found that Dilithium and qTesla outperforms the other by a very wide margin. Here is a sample of the signing performance with NIST level 1 security level (sign per second on the same data):
My question is that is this normal as the Dilithium and qTesla are a lot faster by design than the others or these results is not correct?
Thanks
PS: I used the golang-wrapper and the code ran on the same machine under the same condition.
Yes, Dilithium and qTesla are faster by design.  You can see information about each algorithm's intended performance characteristics by reading the submissions at https://nist.gov/pqcrypto.  You can also see performance in other testing frameworks such as SUPERCOP.
