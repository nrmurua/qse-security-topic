There are actually several issues here. The first most obvious is that the mpl drawer does not draw it properly. The text drawer, though, has this output.
The bigger problem is that the call to ControlledGate in the control() method for UnitaryGate does not pass the num_ctrl_bits or ctrl_state, so you're not getting the gate you thought you were. I'm going to open a separate issue to fix this, and leave this one for fixing the displays.

I agree with @enavarro51 that there are many issues together. I will close this one as duplicate following @ewinston advice once we break this issue.
