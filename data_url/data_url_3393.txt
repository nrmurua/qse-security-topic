Part of the decomposition of measure_observables described in #1028 is to pull out the conversion of a TomographyExperiment into its constituent Programs. In general it seems desirable to have the ability to perform this conversion independent of measure_observables. This allows the user more flexibility and access to a program description of a TomographyExperiment that may be useful independent of measure_observables.
Essentially just move the loop in measure_observables up to comment '#2' into its own method; this method will return a list of programs and a corresponding list of qubits to measure.
