I am trying to run the following from the example:
from qsurface.main import initialize, run, BenchmarkDecoder
code, decoder = initialize((6,6), "toric", "mwpm", enabled_errors=["pauli"])
run(code, decoder, iterations=10, error_rates = {"p_bitflip": 0.1})
I am getting the following error:
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
 in 
......
in match_syndromes(self, syndromes, use_blossomv, **kwargs)
60         matching = matching_graph(
61             edges,
---> 62             maxcardinality=self.config["max_cardinality"],
63             num_nodes=len(syndromes),
64             **kwargs,
KeyError: 'max_cardinality'
I have made sure I am on the same version of python as the one in the hub online example, which runs without issues.
=====UPDATE=====
I discovered that the cause of this error is the missing *.ini files when installing with pip.
It seems that the decoders.ini file is not packaged even though it is specified in manifest.in.
Fixed in #36.
I've repackaged it in version 0.1.5. You can update qsurface via pip install --upgrade qsurface.
