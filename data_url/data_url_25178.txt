(wip)
Electron attributes unset during dispatch submission are currently
initialized to some concrete default value of the expected asset type
(empty strings for text assets, pickled None values for electron
outputs) and uploaded individually to the dispatcher. These uploads are
superfluous as the attributes will be overwritten when the workflow
runs.
We can avoid such uploads by adhering to the following rules:
Any electron, lattice, or result attribute is assigned None – the unique value of NoneType – if and only if it is unset. Note that None should be distinguished from the nil value of other types (empty strings, pickle.dumps(None)).
Do not transfer any unset attributes when submitting a dispatch or retrieving results.
An asset record in the server's DB has size = 0 precisely if it is not backed by a file
file in $COVALENT_DATA_DIR.
The concrete changes required are:
