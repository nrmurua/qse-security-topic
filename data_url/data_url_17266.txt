If I try and apply a 4-qubit unitary, or define a custom gate that acts on 4 qubits I get an error of QiskitError: 'This gate cannot handle 4 arguments' (and similarly for any number of qubits greater than 3).
This only occurs in master, seems to work fine in 0.8/stable.
The following circuits will give this error
The Gate object should work for any number of qubits.
The error is being raised by the Gate.broadcast_arguments function which looks to be hardcoded to only handle 1,2,3 qubit cases.
