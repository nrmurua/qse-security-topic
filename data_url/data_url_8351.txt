We (mainly @Ericgig ) are developing some changes that would only be included in the next major release. It would make sense to merge these into one branch, but not the master branch, so that we can test their compatibility. Maybe development is a good name, although we often refer to our master as the 'development' branch.
I have seen some template for this in another project, but cannot remember where. If anyone has some ideas for this, then would be good if they could share here
Why not create a feature branch?
