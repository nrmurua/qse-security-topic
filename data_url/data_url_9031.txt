Is it possible to declare detectors of opposite parity to a set of measurements.  E.g. a detection event when some measurement is 0 instead of 1.  I would imagine a command like
DETECTOR rec[-1] 1 or
OPPOSITE_DETECTOR rec[-1]?
Of course, this could be circumvented by adding a noiseless 1-measurement and comparing against that, but its less elegant.  Seems peculiar that one can add a trivially off detector, but not a trivially on detector.  Wondering if this functionality already exists somehow or could be easily added.
Detectors already handle the "parity is expected to be odd" case automatically. The expected parity is computed automatically in order to make comparisons. For example this produces a 10% detection fraction instead of a 90% detection fraction:
X 0
X_ERROR(0.1) 0
M 0
DETECTOR rec[-1]
