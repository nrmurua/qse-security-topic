Could it be possible to access Xanadu interactive from the python?
I have two issues right now related to this question:
Thanks for your interest in Strawberry Fields @OneDonMateo!
We can consider number 1 as a feature when we update Strawberry Fields interactive. But bear in mind that this might take some time before it is updated.
Number 2, however, we might be able to help a little easier. We have some code on the server side for generating these plots. As a quick first step, we might be able to open-source that code as a separate repo. @josh146 how easy would it be to provide the that code?

The visualization is done using the open source Python plot.ly library, so shouldn't be too hard at all!
