Result returned by the backend will fail validation if a pulse_library is not supplied. Certain backends such as simulators will not have a pulse_library or meas_frequency as they do not make sense within the context.
Call backend.defaults() against a pulse backend.
Failure should not occur if a parameter is not supplied.
Make all parameters not required in defaults.
