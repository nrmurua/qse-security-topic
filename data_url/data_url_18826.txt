Currently, in the ComplexType in the AST, the doc-string says ComplexType "is based on other classical types." The type annotation is only FloatType, it should be changed to ClassicalType.
ah ah, what is meaning of your question ? it meaning complex number or refer to complex space @godott  (for example, 2 + 3i is a complex number) :
complex[float[64]] c;
c = 2.5 + 3.5im;
complex[float] d = 2.0+sin(Ï€/2) + (3.1 * 5.5 im);
Oh, I mean the last line of the code should go from  base_type: Optional[FloatType] to  base_type: Optional[ClassicalType].
Also, since the basic type is optional, I am wondering what's the default.
I think default of base_type is None  when you declare variable as: complex c; 
The spec itself is pretty clear that the real and complex parts of a complex are float (see here).  I think rather than changing the type signature in the Python AST, we should just clarify the docstring.
Per discussion in the TSC meeting (10/25), for simplicity and lack of use case of other base types, ComplexType will continue to only support a base type of float. Closing this issue.
