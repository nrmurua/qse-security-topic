Installed artiq using conda following instructions in the manual, and am attempting to flash a kc705.  Command "artiq_flash.sh -m qc2" fails with error message below.  I've repeated about 5 times and always see the same error message (but the page it fails on is different).

Someone should switch this script to openocd (@jordens ?), in the meantime can you use another kc705 that does not tickle this likely xc3sprog bug? (This is also happening on the Pipistrello, but I had not seen it with the KC705 before)
See #103
Tried a second kc705 and artiq_flash.sh works.  Thanks.  For the record, both kc705s were new out of the box.
Next problem: when I try to run the led.py demo, I get the warning below and no leds change status.
WARNING:worker(36):artiq.coredevice.comm_generic:Mismatch between gateware (0.0+2302.g50a463a) and software (0+unknown) versions
Did you flash qc1 or qc2? If using qc2 you need to update device_db.
On a related note, it's probably time to make qc2 the default configuration for the KC705.  This is obviously not a big issue for people to change the device_db, but going forward I don't think there will really be any users of the qc1 hardware with ARTIQ and there are at least two setups being put together right now with the qc2 hardware.
I'll put porting that to openocd on my todo list. @whitequark, could you package openocd? There will be a few dependencies but it seems doable. Also https://github.com/timvideos/conda-hdmi2usb-packages/tree/master/openocd
I flashed qc2.  I just tried updating the device_db, and now I can turn the led on and off, but I still get the same mismatch warning message.  Should I worry about this?
Also, I agree with @dhslichter's comment above.  Additionally, it would be nice to add qc2 to the board ports man page (http://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual/core_device.html#board-ports).
This should do it: [RFC] https://github.com/nist-ionstorage/artiq
Packaging openocd does not seem necessary since we didn't package xc3sprog either (afaict).
@dleibrandt the warning message is due to #199 and you can safely ignore it.
@jordens Thanks, looks good, merged it.
@dleibrandt Can you try flashing the problematic KC705 with openocd/the new script and see if it works?
@jordens Your script does not look for flash proxy bitstreams where the conda package puts them.

The old one didn't. I am pretty sure mine checks that location first (https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/frontend/artiq_flash.py#L83). But will check.
Yes, just tested and confirmed it works, but the script's help message doesn't mention this.
Yes, it also works on the board that didn't work with xc3sprog.  Thanks.
