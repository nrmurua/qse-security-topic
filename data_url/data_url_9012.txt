I'm interested in generating the tableau of given circuits because I want to define functions where the tableau will be input. I've read through the available documentation and I'm not sure how to do it. For example, consider the following simple circuit:
How can I generate the tableau of the state after the application of the circuit as to have it as a python object I can manipulate?
By the way, the function I want to define is the von Neumann entropy of a given region of qubits. I didn't find this method on STIM, it would be a nice addition.
You can get at a tableau by using stim.TableauSimulator.
