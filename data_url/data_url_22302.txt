How did you install openocd?
@whitequark i don't see how this would ever have worked. the scripts are not in sitepackages. is this change (a7e101a) ok?
@jordens Hm, I tested it only on lab. and seems like openocd also always searches system paths, so that's how I missed it. Change seems OK.
ack
Confirmed OK. Thanks!
