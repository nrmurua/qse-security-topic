Can we improve the flow from QSVMKernel to SVM_Classical? I can already save a QSVMKernel to a file, but it would be great if I could load that file directly into SVM_Classical and start making predictions. Currently, I have to do the following:
Thank you for your time!
@AustinGilliam
I think this PR improve the flow of your use case. #491
The model trained by a quantum of classical svm save the model in the same format; thus, they can load the models interchangeably.
Then, your step 1, 2 and 4 are not needed. You just need to create a SVM_Classical object and then load model
@chunfuchen Thanks Richard! That makes things much simpler. =)
