Describe the bug
The matrix of the permutation might not be computed correctly.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

As you can see the photon is redirected in the second path while it should be in the third. I looked at the code, in my opinion there is a missing piece here:

The unitary u is missing a transposition. Reasoning in physical terms, right now that function correctly describes the permutation only if you reverse the timeline, i.e., you invert the input and output states.
The 2-path transposition phys.PERM([1, 0]) ,  as well as the transposition shown in the Documentation, produce symmetric matrixes, hence this mistake is not evident.
Thanks @FGiorgino for catching this - fix on its way !
