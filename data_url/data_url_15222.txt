Together with @Cryoris, we noticed that if the IMAG option is set, the resulting gradient has a spurious (undocumented) - sign.
Same problem seems to affect the COMPLEX option.
The code
prints
EstimatorGradientResult(gradients=[array([-1.])], metadata=[{'parameters': [Parameter(p)], 'derivative_type': <DerivativeType.IMAG: 'imag'>}], options=Options())
For the code example above, the result should be:
EstimatorGradientResult(gradients=[array([1.])], metadata=[{'parameters': [Parameter(p)], 'derivative_type': <DerivativeType.IMAG: 'imag'>}], options=Options())
This code fragment
should be replaced with
It also seems that unit tests for IMAG and COMPLEX options are missing.

Are you sure it's a bug? ðŸ¤” I thought the - sign is necessary.

Yes, it was like this in opflow but we discussed with @Cryoris that this is an undesired behavior.
For context, the docstring says that
is computed. If we take the example that the observable O is just the identity and the state is prepared by RZ(Ï‰)|0ã€‰, then
but the current gradients returns -i.
I talked with @Cryoris.
If you differentiate the gate on the the left hand side, then you take Im, it will be like that. How ever if you differentiate the gate on the right hand side, the sign will be a minus (Itâ€™s because imaginary parts will be cancelled out in the end, so which side we use matters)

We couldn't find the exact definition of imaginary gradients (not qiskit's docstring. It might be using the wrong definition), so itâ€™s up to our definition. If we change this, we need to change this line in QFI. Because, I suppose the return value is the right hand side gradient.

An alternative way is to change the docstring in qiskit. Then, we donâ€™t need to change the code, and we donâ€™t need to change the QFI.
@dlasecki What do you think?
After discussing with @dlasecki @Zoufalc and @a-matsuo it seems that the conclusion is to change the documentation and not the code, because

Yes, sounds good to me. I will adapt the PR that I opened already.
