Part of #672
This task includes:
I would really like if cirq.decompose was a bit configurable, so that callers didn't have to handle recursive decomposition on their own and could generally control the direction decomposition was going. Something like this:
A decompose_func returns its input if there is no further decomposition to do, raises an error if something went wrong, and otherwise returns an OP_TREE (a single operation, jagged list of operations, or etc). If it returns NotImplemented that is the same as not being decomposable.
