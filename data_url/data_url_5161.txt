There are at least three modes of allocation:
All of these modes exist in QVM currently (with varying levels of completeness). We should take some time to clarify the interface, and complete unfinished work (namely shared memory). Shared memory will require pyQuil changes.
Something we might want to keep in mind is how changes in the memory management of our code interact with ECL.
Also, @stylewarning pointed out to me recently that there is opportunistic pinning of memory happening in magicl.cffi-types:with-array-pointers. Those pieces of memory are temporarily prevented from being garbage collected but they are Lisp-allocated.
Is the API implemented sufficiently well with the allocator classes? Or do you mean something higher level?
