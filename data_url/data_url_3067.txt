Insert a short description of the bug here, along with what you expected the behavior to be.
Thanks for helping us improve pyQuil! ðŸ™‚
When I use a Paramteric value in a custom gate, I get this error. I don't get this issue with a native gate.
Operating System: MacOS Ventura 13.1 (M1 Pro)
Python Version (python -V): Python 3.10.6
Quilc Version (quilc --version): quilc --version
QVM Version (qvm --version): 1.17.1 [cf3f91f]
Python Environment Details (pip freeze or conda list):
For what it's worth, you can avoid this quilc error by passing in a specific value to the gate rather than the parameter theta; e.g. circuit.inst(RYYGate(np.pi / 2)(1, 0)) works just fine.
