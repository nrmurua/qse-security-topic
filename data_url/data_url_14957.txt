As a user of Qiskit, I would like to request the addition of an SMS or Email notification feature to be sent after a job is done executing on a real quantum computer. This feature would greatly enhance the user experience, especially when dealing with long execution times for quantum jobs on real devices.
Currently, executing quantum jobs on real quantum computers can take a considerable amount of time due to various factors such as queueing, device availability, and the complexity of the circuit being executed. In such cases, it becomes important for users to be informed about the job completion status to effectively manage their workflow.
The suggested solution is to integrate an SMS notification feature into Qiskit's job monitoring system. After submitting a job to a real quantum computer, users can opt to receive an SMS or Email notification when the job is completed. This notification can include essential details such as the job ID, execution time, and any relevant information regarding the quantum device used.

This feature request aligns with the growing need for improved user experience and job management on real quantum devices. It complements existing job monitoring capabilities within Qiskit and enhances the overall usability of the framework.
Developing a dedicated Qiskit mobile application for Android and iOS platforms would greatly enhance the accessibility and convenience of managing Qiskit accounts and workflows. The mobile app would provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring job progress, accessing backend information, and exploring Qiskit resources. This would allow users to interact with Qiskit on the go, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for quantum computing enthusiasts and researchers. The app could also offer additional features such as push notifications for job completion, real-time status updates, and integration with cloud-based quantum services.
I kindly request the Qiskit development team to consider implementing this feature, as it would greatly benefit users and contribute to a more streamlined and efficient workflow when working with real quantum computers.
I have already implemented a similar functionality by utilizing a third-party API.

Thanks for your interest!  I think this could be interesting as a side project helper extension to backends.  If you wanted to build up your code into a full Python package, you could consider joining the Qiskit Ecosystem with it.  It's a bit beyond the scope of Qiskit core, so it's not something we'd merge into the core codebase, but if you wanted to built it as a wrapper for backends, please feel to make your own package.
@jakelishman  Thanks for your reply!
I appreciate your suggestion of building it as a wrapper for backends. However, I believe that in addition to the helper extension, a dedicated Qiskit app that encompasses all these functionalities and more would greatly benefit the community. Such an app would provide a unified and user-friendly interface, simplifying the workflow for developers and users in the future alike.
Currently, developers have to deal with a lot of raw data and manage different aspects separately. Having a comprehensive Qiskit app would streamline the process, allowing users to focus more on their quantum programming tasks rather than the technical details.
I understand that this may be beyond the scope of Qiskit core and not something that can be merged into the core codebase. Nevertheless, I am enthusiastic about exploring the possibilities of creating a standalone Qiskit app as a separate package within the Qiskit Ecosystem.
Thank you for your support and guidance.
