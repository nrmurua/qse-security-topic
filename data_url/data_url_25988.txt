Report that get_devices() function showed IonQ Harmony device as offline, but person was still able to submit job to device, and got results back within 5 min. So device was definitely online. Could be bug with get_devices() and delayed status updates? Look into further.
From source:
AWS will send jobs to provider queue systems outside of dedicated windows so they're loaded up and ready to run. If providers run those jobs outside of their dedicated windows, then they'll just run! This is entirely expected behaviour tbh.
