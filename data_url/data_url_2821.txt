Does it mean (1) that OrderTester can verify equal ordering for a pair of iterable sequences, given that there is a 1-1 mapping defined between their elements?
Or does it mean (2) that given a sequence where comparison functions are defined, we can verify that every other sequence has elements related to each other in a similar way?
E.g. given the sequence A: a1, a2, a3, ... and B: b1, b2, b3... , there can be at least two ways to verify equal ordering:
Which one would be more useful?
I pictured the API being something like this:
i.e. you provide a sequence of equivalence groups, but usually just individual items instead of a big group, under the constraint that they must be ascending.
