Prior to merging #1337, running copy_from_upstream copy didn't change the repo (on unchanged code). This no longer is the case now: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/docs/cbom.json is always updated when this command is run.
Is this intentional & necessary, @bhess ?
This is the reason why #1405 only tests copy_from_upstream verify and not for an unchanged repository after copy_from_upstream copy. The latter test would clearly be more powerful to protect liboqs from incorrect upstream integrations.
Yes you are right, it shouldn't be updated if the repo didn't change. I'll look into it next week.
