We don't always communicate new Mitiq releases on UF social media.
It could be nice to have, every time there is a new release at https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/releases:
The Metriq Twitter bot (@ metriqinfo) makes automated tweets every time a submission is made. It is using the dev tools from Twitter official API.
