The command from qiskit.tools.visualization import plot_bloch_vector no longer works now that this function is defined in the file _state_visualization.py in the visualization folder, rather than in the file visualization.py. Perhaps this is intentional, but in that case then the file qiskit/python/quantum_phase_bloch.py in the repository ibmqx-user-guides should be updated accordingly.
Nice catch @dtmcclure ! I'm actually unsure about the best solution: perhaps the best way is to update the ibmqx-user-guides file, but instead of modifying the import for pointing to the specific function (as technically modules with an underscore are "private"), make the file use plot_state(rho, method='bloch') instead?
The reason would be that plot_state acts as a "dispatcher" function of sorts - any other state visualization can be invoked through it ... and it seems nor the tutorials or the user guides are using any other function defined in _state_visualization. I'm unsure if this was by convention, though: probably a question for the tutorials/user guides?
We want the plot_bloch_vector as a function.
This was done to give users one unified interface for plotting density matrices:
where method can be "bloch", "city", "qsphere" or "paulivec". The idea is that these all plot the same thing, in different ways.
So I would also vote for keeping that the "public" interface, and the underlying methods as private.
yeah, I agree but the point is you can plot a Bloch sphere with much less information than a state as it is not informationally complete. I am fine with the others not being accessed unless using state but this one I think should be special. I can't believe i'm defending the Bloch sphere when I think this is the worst thing physicists ever got used to helping explain quantum computing.
The plot_state method should only use rho but the plot_vector uses the smaller vector format. The reason is also when using it for education i dont want to make a rho when we dont need to.
Thanks for the clarification. I made a PR to make the plot_bloch_vector method public, but the rest remain accessible through plot_state.
@ajavadia we can close this correct?
