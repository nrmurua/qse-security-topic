The Base Profile Specification contains many requirements for a Base Profile QIR 1.0 program, and cuda-quantum is not currently enforcing, complying with, and verifying all of them. This top-level issue will be used to discuss items that affect multiple requirements and track improvements to cuda-quantum with respect to these specifications. New issues will be created to work specific items and track individual PRs.
The attached spreadsheet contains relatively priorities Base_Profile_Spec_Analysis_GH.xlsx (updated Sep 7, 2023) for each requirement, but they are tentative priorities and may change as needed.
PR #546 resolved 29 elements in the spreadsheet attached to this Issue.
Status update: the change to a commonly used library (PyQIR) was included in PyQIR v0.10.0 (released on Nov 20, 2023). This change updated PyQIR to support the spec compliant attribute names of required_num_qubits and required_num_results, so now our partner providers will automatically inherit this change whenever they update their PyQIR dependencies.
