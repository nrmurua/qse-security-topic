Below is a circuit that contains an HGate and a SXGate with power and control qubit. After saving and loading the circuit via QPY, the result state vector of the circuit changed.
Noted that SXdgGate also has this bug.
Below is a circuit with a SXGate.
The above code results in the following, representing the results changed after saving and loading via QPY.
Noted that the same behavior also happens for SXdgGate. Below is the reproduction code.
I expect the state vector results of the circuit not to change before and after saving and loading via QPY. Current behavior looks like bug to me.
