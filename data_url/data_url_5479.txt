The heuristic ordering method in ordering_circuit_simulation.py currently only accepts 2-qubit gates with Schmidt decomposition of rank 2. For gates of higher decomposed rank (e.g. fSim) we have to change how bond dimension is calculated.
The ComputeSchmidtRank function provided by utils.py will be helpful here.
It looks like Cirq added support for the fSim gate after the 0.5.0 release. In the absence of another Schmidt rank-4 gate to test against, this is blocked until the next Cirq release.

We can use iSWAP or just SWAP, which have rank-4 as fSim. Cirq 0.5.0 already implements SWAP.
We can do the same like with the amplitudes simulator. Just copy the fsimfile into our repo. I checked the source and it should work without a problem.
PR #154 uses the solution of import the fsim_gate from the code base of 0.6.0.
Issue #122 mentions this
