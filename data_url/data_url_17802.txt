backend.properties does not follow the spec.  Mixes camel case and snake case, where from the spec it should all be snake case, e.g. currently 'cooldownDate', but should be 'cooldown_date'.
Also, the gates errors should be under the 'gates' key but is currently 'multi_qubit_gates'.
In principle, all this info in optional in the spec.  However, since we have it, it should follow the format in the spec.
Make properties inline with spec.
Paul can you just link this to #1047.
