Hello,
I am not sure if this problem is in the scope of this project but currently the status returned by common function randombytes is not checked.
Would it be possible to abruptly stop the program when such a case arises?
I'm afraid none of the reference implementations does this right now. I suppose it's possible to add an abort or panic inside the randombytes function; if you need this I would suggest doing this in your own project. The common files aren't necessarily the best implementations of any of the primitives.
Thank you for your answer!
Jérôme
