I find myself using this snippet of code a bunch in my notebooks
However, when I want to move it, I resort to copypasta. Is something like this already in quantum utils? If so, where?
I don't think this is in there anywhere, and though simple, it seems like a fine thing to have. I'm not sure where it would be put, perhaps somewhere in QuantumSystems. I think the following would be more appropriate in terms of style and nomenclature:
It would also make sense to make the output compatible with AverageHamiltonian since that would be a common use case (it might already be, I just always forget if AverageHamiltonian wants a function or a matrix with a time symbol).
AverageHamiltonian wants a function of time.
