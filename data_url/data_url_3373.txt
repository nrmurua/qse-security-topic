In #873, we attempted to enable the QVM (and, later, the QPU) to let the user do post-execution analysis on all memory regions, rather than just on the contents of ro. However, in https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/blob/master/pyquil/api/_qvm.py#L544 we filter the memory regions that the QVM returns down to only those into which it MEASUREs. This is unexpected behavior, and this restriction should be lifted.
Operating System:
Python Version (python -V): Python 3.7.4
Quilc Version (quilc --version): 1.15.3 [25b95cb]
QVM Version (qvm --version): 1.15.2 [1b3d43a]
Python Environment Details (pip freeze or conda list): ðŸ’¤
Even within the 'ro' memory region, it only returns those indices that are written to by measurements:
gives
(Python 3.7.7, quilc 1.18.0, qvm 1.17.0)
Though it's possible cause of this case might be more linked to #1194
Hi @ecpeterson, this was recently fixed on master. Feel free to give it a shot and let us know how it goes :)
Gosh, is this really my ticket? I opened this while I was still working at Rigetti, and now I have no idea what the context was. Itâ€™s definitely not in service of a script I still useâ€”or even own! Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s fixed, though.
Haha, no worries. Thanks for the report nonetheless ðŸ˜„
