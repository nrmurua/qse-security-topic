I tried to install qcodes using python setup.py develop. This correctly adds qcodes to my path (and all works fine) however it raises a confusing error message which I think comes from trying to install coverage

pip list tells me I have coverage (4.1b2) installed so I don't know what is wrong here.
As far as I can tell everything is still working fine for me but I don't think I should ignore the warnings. Also qcodes got correctly added to my path so that I can now import it.
I also tried running the test suite, this also fails. I have not attempted to diagnose this further but figured that any bug-reports on these things are useful.
Nice that it's an installable package now!
@AdriaanRol try running pip install -e .
