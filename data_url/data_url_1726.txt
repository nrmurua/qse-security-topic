Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Quantum oracles implementing functions of type f: {0,1}^n -> {1,-1} (n is the number of qubits) can be represented as diagonal gates. Currently Cirq only has a ThreeQubitDiagonalGate. For larger oracles one can use the MatrixGate, however there is no decomposition logic implemented for it.
Describe the solution you'd like
Should provide a meaningful circuit diagram.
should provide a list of 1 and 2 qubit gates that allows for implementation of this gate on hardware.
[optional] Additional context (e.g. screenshots)
This came up during implementing the Fourier checking algo as a tutorial: #3687
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
It looks like #3890 took care of this. Please re-open if there is more work to do here.
