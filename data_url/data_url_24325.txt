Polish and finish updating the demo notebook I wrote for `Modeling transmon qubit Cooper-pair box Hamiltonian in the charge basis
I left todo items


Maker sure the docs work too. Update doc names and add see about executing the juptyer cell so taht we get this output in the docs

@zlatko-minev Has the rough notebook been committed somewhere?  I'm having trouble locating it.
