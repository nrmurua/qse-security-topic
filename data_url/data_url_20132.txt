See build at Homebrew/homebrew-core#73484
The reason is that the Apple clang compiler does not support -march=native for arm64 (don't ask me why):
The tests currently run by gcc_clang_intrinsics.cmake are only meaningful on x86_64, so we can just disable them on arm64. I've added this to my portable build improvements branch b1a9f0c.
For now you should be able to compile with "-DOQS_USE_CPU_EXTENSIONS=OFF".
@fxcoudert could you let us know if this is resolved on main (b36ff9f)?
I'm going to close this. We've made significant changes to the relevant part of the build system since this report came in. If we're still failing on M1 it's not for the same reason, and we need a new report.
Hi @jschanck ðŸ‘‹  it looks the new release still failed on 11-arm. I just opened a new issue tracker on this compilation problem. (#1018)
