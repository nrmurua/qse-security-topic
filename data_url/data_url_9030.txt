Because multiprocessing forks the process, and the state of the shared random number generator gets forked with it, sampling a circuit without child processes gives redundant samples. This silently lowers the statistical confidence of results.
Going to fix this by always seeding from external entropy when a sampler is created, unless a seed is specified. Forking a sampler across multiple processes will still have this behavior, but at least it could be expected in that context.
Repro:
This asserts when run instead of running to completion.
