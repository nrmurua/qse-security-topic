Currently, the gradients have special circuit construction and parameter handling techniques for the different implementations, which makes it difficult to extend the framework with new techniques. A workflow that would allow for very easy extension would be
If the base class of the gradients takes care of 1 and 3, the different implementation just have to take care of 2.
