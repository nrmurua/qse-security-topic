I've been following the installation process in the qiskit page as well as the one in github, however when I run the command pip install qiskit after activating the environment I get a bunch of errors. The full list of errors is this one:
I have already updated both python and the operating system, even though they already matched the requirements qiskit page shows.
I want to use qiskit for research purpose but I can't use it until I have it installed on my computer. How can I fix this?
Installation process on qiskit webpage
Qiskit should be installed without any complications.
Hello! I think you might need to install the XCode developer tools (it looks like a similar error to this) which you can do by running xcode-select --install in a terminal.
Thanks for answering @maddy-tod . I did what you suggested and still got the same error message.
So this is an issue with the pyeda requirement from aqua that requires building with a compiler. Qiskit is not supposed to require a compiler, so this needs to be addressed.
I tried doing this on my wifeâ€™s computer and it worked once the command line tools were installed. What is the error you are getting now?
I reinstalled everything, including the xcode developer tools and now it works perfectly.
Getting an error with the credentials now, will post in a different issue.
Thank you both.
