I am beginner to open quantum system
I used qutip to help me
Not just for numerical calculations
But code itself is readable
This is my way to learn the topic
About piqs
Congratulations for u implementation
I fellow code step by step
But I can't pass spin algebra
I can't understand permute function ,what it do
It is complicated no reference or tutorial
I wish to give us a tutorial about it
Best regards
Dear @gharib85,
Thank you for positive comments on PIQS (cc @sahmed95).
We give extensive explanations on the permutational invariance of the system and dynamics in the accompanying paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05129, see especially Sec. II, where additional useful references are provided. Further analytical understanding can be gained in the Appendix of that manuscript.
Several tutorials are already hosted at
https://github.com/nathanshammah/notebooks/tree/master/piqs_notebooks
and at
http://qutip.org/tutorials.html under the "Permutational invariant Lindblad dynamics" section.
Best wishes,
Nathan
