Users are running into installation issues that are not solved by e.g. running pip install in the cloned repo on a fresh virtual environment. For example, recently, antlr4 needed to be uninstalled and reinstalled for pyQuil to work.
We should consider including a pyquil-setup script with pyQuil, analogous to the pyquil-config-setup script, into which protections are built against these kinds of failures.
Trying to do this will just lead down a rabbit hole of trying to support all possible configurations and environments.
A better solution would be to just proceed with the plan of dropping Python 2 support so that we can remove all the dependency hacks we previously had to do.
In addition, we could potentially look into switching to Pipfile for better dependency management (cc @dangirsh )
Or conda
