The duration of a Blackman waveform is often irrelevant and what matters in fact is the maximum value it reaches, for it can influence the Rydberg radius on amplitude waveforms for Rydberg channels.
The proposal here is a class method for the BlackmanWaveform where the defining arguments are the area and the maximum value reached, so the duration of the pulse adapts accordingly.
