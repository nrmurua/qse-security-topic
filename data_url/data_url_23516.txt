In one of the latest updates the plotting functions doesnt handle partially completed 2D dataset. It now falls back to a scatter plot instead of a partially filled map.
Ideally we would like to keep the 0.22.0 version behavior for partially completed plots.
Version 0.25.0

Version 0.22.0

This is caused by the dataset now being plotted from the cache which uses nan as a filler for the empty elements rather than simply omitting them. Adding something like dataarray = dataarray[~np.isnan(dataarray)] to flatten_1D_data_for_plot seems to fix this but it is unclear if this will have problematic issues for datasets that really contain nans
A better solution would therefor be to make use of the actual shape data if available
