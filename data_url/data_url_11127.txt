May be helpful to check consistency between the active indices and occupied indices. Something like:
It's easy to make mistakes if one does not familiar with quantum chemistry. For example, the curve scanning below produces a wrong results, which is so close to the correct values that almost no way to realize the problem
I am not familiar with quantum chemistry
so apart from the energy, in the Hamiltonian what does every qubti stand for?
and how to decide the occupied_indices and active_indices?
@lcr1103 we've responded to your question in the issue you opened (#508) in the main OpenFermion repo.
