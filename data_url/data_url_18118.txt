Hello.
I am now running on the ibmqx5. However, when I have two quantum registers, I get an error:
I have traced it up the chain, and believe the issue is in the compile function in _compiler.py. num_qubits is calculated to be the total number of qubits in all registers. But initial_layout is defined such that each register has num_qubits qubits, which leads to errors. (edited)
E.g. if both registers (called 'qr' and 'qar') have just one qubit each, the current code calculates
initial_layout =  {('qar', 0): ('q', 0),  ('qar', 1): ('q', 1),  ('qr', 0): ('q', 0),  ('qr', 1): ('q', 1)} leading to errors, since qar[1] and qr[1] don't exist.
The error is resolved when I define by hand
initial_layout={('qar', 0): ('q', 1), ('qr', 0): ('q', 0)}
Are you using the latest 0.5.3 release?
There was a recent fix for that issue i. 0.5.3.
@ogamel can you please close the issue if the problem was resolved in 0.5.3?
Yes going from 0.5.2 to 0.5.3 fixed it.
Thank you
