Dear CP2K developers,
I have found that when ionic radii are used for a bulk MgO crystal the Becke weight function appears to break (see image). When using covalent radii however the weight function is calculated correctly (see image).
More generally, it appears that for certain systems the Becke weight function breaks when the constrained atoms have ATOMIC_RADII smaller than the unconstrained atoms. I have confirmed this behaviour for two different structures on two different machines using CP2K 7.1.
I include an example input and output file for the system with ionic and covalent radii.

(Originally posted on CP2K user forum, moved here as I believe this to be a bug: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/cp2k/ahart|sort:date/cp2k/1yTNsYN6nRQ/S9HSmHXBAQAJ)
This was presumably fixed by #2111.

I do not believe so. #2111 is a change to the Hirshfeld partitioning CDFT, not to the Becke partitioning CDFT which is the cause of this reported bug.
My bad, thanks for clarifying.
