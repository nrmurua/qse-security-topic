In some cases when plotting a ParameterSweep object sweep using sweep[:].plot_transitions() the spectrum disappears if there is no dressed state with bare labels (0,0,...). It might be useful to just plot the spectrum as grayscale there, as opposed to the spectrum pausing and continuing abruptly. An example is below

Tentative fix by 43538b0.
@dkweiss31 Please confirm.
Indeed I believe it is fixed! Many thanks
Fixed by treating ground state as special case. Issue will remain for other initial states though.
The "fix" to the above problem fails and can give erroneous results in ultrastrong coupling when the ground states is not derived from (0,0,..,0).
This should now be addressed by 625e204. Documentation about additional options when calling plot_transitions has been added to the RTD master.
