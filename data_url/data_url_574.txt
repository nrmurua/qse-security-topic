I was trying to run this example with tnqvm as accelerator but it runs into the following error:
AttributeError: '_pyxacc.Accelerator' object has no attribute 'createBuffer'
Hmm. Not sure how you made it to that doc page, it is old. Note that the URL relative path has 'obsolete' in it. The createBuffer() method is no longer on Accelerator. You could achieve the same code like this
Also note here I used the QPP simulator to show bit string counts, TNQVM (by default) will just get you expectation values.
Thank you so much for sharing the code snippet.  I totally missed the legacy marker :)
I quickly went through the examples in the new docs; I noticed that circuits are build using a string input to compiler(eg. xasm, openqasm... ) to generate circuits. Is natively writing circuits in python deprecated ?
No you can still write something like this
There are just more features available from using the string API. The native python functions are still more a prototype that will be elevated to a first-class feature in the future. But try it out and push it and let us know where it breaks ðŸ˜„
Perfect thanks so much. I will defiantly be testing it out over the coming days.
