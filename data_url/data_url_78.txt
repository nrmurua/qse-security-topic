The code snippet below calculates expectation values using observe and observe_async and executes fine
If I extend the hamiltonian to a list of 2 elements, I can successfully calculate the expectation value as such:
However, with obersve_async the following error is produced:
observe_async supports type(spin.z(0)) which is cudaq._pycudaq.SpinOperator but the type of hamiltonian = [spin.z(0), spin.z(1)] is a list.
This is also reflected in the documentation where observe can accept a list of a spinop but observe_async only accepts spinop
