We use Cirq as a core dependency, and the newest version (we are 2 minor releases behind) has a lot of big changes, like the vendor/backend support was pulled out into separate pip packages. Also notable, there is a circ-rigetti package now that includes the QVM servers we run in docker as just local executables which could make our own dev and packaging story much easier.
The changelog should be reviewed, and decide what and how we upgrade/adapt mitiq requirements to allow functionality with these major changes.
Not upgrading Cirq until Cirq 0.14 - module deprecation cirq_google as cirq.google for backwards compatibility causes errors with Sphinx docs. See #915.
