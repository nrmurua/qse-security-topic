Description
I'm reading a CNF file with load_cnf, but the function returns a csp object without constraints
Steps To Reproduce
nae3sat_ratio210_size10_inst1.cnf.zip
Expected Behavior
I would expect the csp object to have the constraints in the file
Environment
I believe changing line 4 to p cnf _ _ will fix it. But the function should raise a better exception.
