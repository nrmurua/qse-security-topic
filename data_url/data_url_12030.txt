The page "qiskit.providers.aer.noise.phase_damping_error"  have description "Return a single-qubit combined phase and amplitude damping quantum error channel." even though it should only create phase damping error.
Hi @gypsyzz this bug is fixed now. Please see https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/simulators/3_building_noise_models.ipynb
@nonhermitian This issue can be closed
The issue seems not to be fixed as this two pages are the same:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.aer.noise.phase_amplitude_damping_error.html#qiskit.providers.aer.noise.phase_amplitude_damping_error
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.aer.noise.phase_damping_error.html
At leaste the description of the function.
I can arrange the buf if I am assigned the issue.
I think this issue should be in the qiskit-aer repository, since the message is in the code documentation, please see:
Yes, that is true. I will open an issue in qiskit-aer
It is now fixed and pending to be accepted in Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1374 .
Looks like this was fixed in Aer. Thanks @VicentePerezSoloviev!
