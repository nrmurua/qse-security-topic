This issue has already been addressed in v4, but it needs a backport to v3.
In short: the Quil spec specifies a SWAP-PHASES instruction but that is mistakenly implemented in pyQuil v3 as SWAP-PHASE. pyQuil v3 should support both spellings during parsing, for compatibility, while outputting only SWAP-PHASES. Likewise, swap_phase and similar identifiers within the repo should be renamed to swap_phases, while adding an alias/re-export for compatibility.
