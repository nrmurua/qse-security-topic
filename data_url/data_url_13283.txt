Currently the examples in Mitiq's user guide and examples section are written using Cirq as the frontend. It would be easier for Qiskit users to have these tutorials/examples written in Qiskit, and would make Mitiq more accessible. Please consult the contributing guidelines for specific details on contributing to the documentation.
