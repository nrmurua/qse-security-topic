We should be able to generate a server cert issued by a root CA using these instructions:
The last step however fails with:
Signature verification error 140249734448896:error:0D0C50C7:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_item_verify:unknown signature algorithm:crypto/asn1/a_verify.c:111:
(tested with master branch of liboqs)
Failing function is ASN1_item_verify in a_verify.c. It fails to locate the OQS alg, because they are not registered in the sigoid_srt array in obj_xref.h, and therefore the OBJ_find_sigid_by_algs function call fails. This is only triggered when dealing with chained cert issuance, a scenario not yet coverered in our unit tests; we'll need to add one.
Working on a fix.
Resolved by PR #69.
