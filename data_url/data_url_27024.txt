We should warn the users that Quick currently uses basis functions in their Cartesian form and does not support spherical harmonic functions.
@agoetz We already have a notification about the cartesian basis in the output. I totally forgot about this.
But we have to update the manual.
OK, good. Yes, we need to update the manual.
The QUICK manual and README files are updated. Closing this issue.
