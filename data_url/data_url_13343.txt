The current H2 example could be improved in two different aspects:
If you only fixed one of the two aspects, please don't close this issue but just mark the corresponding item in the above list.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
+1 for adding a bounty on UH.
@obliviateandsurrender, thanks! Please note that there is already a PR by @lockwo for the same issue.
On the other hand, it is interesting that both of you solved the issue but in very different ways: @lockwo with OpenFermion and you with PennyLane. So we may decide to keep both examples!
Next week we'll discuss internally and let you know if we'll keep both examples and, if so, how it works with the unitaryhack bounty.
Hi @obliviateandsurrender, I have some good news!
We discussed about this and decided to also keep your H2 example in addition to the previous one by @lockwo.
If both PRs will be accepted and merged, both of you will the bounty!
Can you add the use of PennyLane in the notebook title? To differentiate from the one with OpenFermion.
