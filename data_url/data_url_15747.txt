Currently our CI uses the macOS-latest vm to run Mac tests, but this will change shortly from a 10.15 image to an 11.x one (actions/runner-images#4060), which doesn't have direct support for Python 3.6.  Since the 0.19 series will still support this version of Python, we need to make sure that we're still able to run tests on it, which we should be able to do by using a macos-10.15 image.
Right now, I'm preparing the 0.18.3 release, so I don't want to tie up CI resources at the moment swapping this over, but I'll make the change after the release.
