Trying import qiskit on a fresh install gives the following error:
It appears that the temp matrix to be stored is not c-aligned.  This is not surprising given that the decomposition routines use eigensolvers that are fortran based and return f-aligned NumPy arrays.  The suggestion is to just do something like temp = special_unitary_matrix.dot(temp) instead.  The matrix is 4x4 so not so worried about a copy here.
