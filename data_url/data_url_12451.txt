While importing tensorflow quantum, the following error is being shown:
Followed by another exception:
Some important information regarding libraries"
What should be done?
Check the requirements. The latest main branch requires tensorflow==2.7.0 . I almost always just use the latest release (which is TFQ 0.6.2).
Well, I think there is no version of tensorflow-quantum==0.6.2. I think the version that you are talking about is tensorflow-quantum==0.7.2. Also, I checked along the requirements and have upgraded (and downgraded) some of the packages according to it.
Now it shows some different type of error.
Same error occurs while import cirq. What should be done?
I was actually talking about 0.6.1 which is the latest release. You can see all the releases here: https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/releases (and that 0.6.1 is the latest). As for your error, I recommend starting a completely new environment, I have had similar experiences when trying to changes existing versions. I just started a brand new environment did
ran some example TFQ code and had no problems.
It worked for me as well. Thanks a lot ! It was really helpful.
