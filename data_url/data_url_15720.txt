There does not exist any representation method for the qiskit.dagcircuit.dagnode.DAGNode object as of yet
Just like a Qubit object, a DAGNode should be more informative and allow a user to get a basic idea about the information it contains.
A __repr__ method for the DAGNode which displays basic attribute information like qargs, cargs and type for the DAGNode object
Re-opening as I think this would be a useful improvement, especially if it could be incorporated into the dag_drawer. Feel free to let me know if there was another reason for closing this.
I thought this wasn't really necessary at the moment as there was no response. I'd be happy to add the __repr__ method.
Hello I want to assigned for this issue. I am new in qiskit but I am interested in Qiskit. I hope this issue is suitable for me.
@Osmanilge, thanks for the interest, but there was already an open pull request to close this issue.  Please feel free to look at other issues labelled "good first issue", though.
I will look at other issues. Thanks for your interest.
