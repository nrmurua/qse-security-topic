qc.draw() doesn't print the circuit when called from function in jupyter notebook.
The circuit is displayed.
print(qc) works, but qc.draw() should work from a function too.
It works with display. Thank you!
Great!
In that case, that's expected behavior. It's the way that jupyter works. Therefore, closing.
