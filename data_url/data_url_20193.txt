CPU_EXTENSIONS currently causes a CMake error when configuring for cross-compilation. If and when it becomes capable of being used in cross-compilation, two sets of instructions need to be updated to remove the -DOQS_USE_CPU_EXTENSIONS=OFF directive currently present:
@jschanck Do you think #942 brings us any closer to this one?
@dstebila Not quite. But Michael and I discussed some changes (#943, specifically OQS_TARGET_ARCH) that would allow one to target a particular microarchitecture during cross-compilation. I'll do a mock-up of that idea soon.
