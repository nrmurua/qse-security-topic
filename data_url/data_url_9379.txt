What content needs to be improved/added?
I think it could be helpful if we add a manual page to teach user how to run emulation in subspace, how to get a sparse matrix for Hamiltonian in subspace. We can also cross reference this section to blockade in the advanced topics.
Just a follow-up on this, we could also explain some related functions for independent set in this section.
