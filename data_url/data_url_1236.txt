Description of the issue
Traceback (most recent call last):

TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class TwoQubitCompilationTargetGateset with abstract method _decompose_two_qubit_operation
Hi dikoling, thanks for opening the issue! This is working as intended because TwoQubitCompilationTargetGateset is meant to be an abstract base class which users derive from and override specific methods that convey the compiler how to compile circuits for specific target gatesets. As an example, look at
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-core/cirq/transformers/target_gatesets/cz_gateset.py
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-core/cirq/transformers/target_gatesets/sqrt_iswap_gateset.py
Both of the files above defined concrete derived classes from TwoQubitCompilationTargetGateset for CZ and Sqrt-ISwap target gatesets.
I'll close the issue but please let me know if you have any further questions.
