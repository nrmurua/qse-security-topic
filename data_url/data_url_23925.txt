Observed on the HEAD of master, with the default config.json file.
(it's possible my other config files are out of sync, but this looks like a code problem, not a config problem)
Do you have networkx 2.0 installed? See 4d851f5
No: looks like I have 1.11.  Doing a conda update now.
That solved the problem.  Maybe we should have a ticket for testing package dependencies?
