Coupling maps of "big" backends (over 100 qubits) do not render well.
Take the example of IBM's ibm_washington, which has 127 qubits

Notice that the qubit nodes with 3-digit numbers are not easy to distinguish.
Having distinguishable numbers when they are large.
I see options:
I feel this is a duplicate of #9031 the reason I suggested using graphviz draw from rustworkx is that it can handle large graphs well.
My interpretation of #9031 was some form of fallback for qubit_coordinates_map. But true that solving #9031 would fix all of them. So closing as duplicated. Thanks!
