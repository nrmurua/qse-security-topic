I have a qubit object which contains a bunch of (now manual parameters).
Sadly the snapshot functionality does not work for these new type of parameters.
This issue should be quite trivial to reproduce but below an example of how you can see that it does not work.

Which makes me think, the snapshot functionality should also be in the test suite (for all kinds of parameters).
I guess if it was we would not have had this bug.
@alexcjohnson (I guess edit doesn't work :) )
Yup - should be an easy fix, thanks!
The bug was fixed in #38 but I'm going to leave this issue open for a bit until I do the refactoring we discussed there - moving snapshot to the base Parameter class and standardizing the attribute names for last recorded value and timestamp.
