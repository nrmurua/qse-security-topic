When I run pip install hiq-circuit in my python virtual environment it failed.
Which version of pip are you using?
Are you using a virtualenv?
Could you try to manually install the pybind11 package?
Did you manage to get the installation issue fixed?
I do not know why but when I remove the '--user' option this installation will success sometimes. But there are still some problem in my server, which is broken for weeks and I did not do more tests. I will try to find more servers with different OS to do test for this installation method. Thank you for reply!
