Unpacking RPC argument is the job of CPython. This fixes the problem of *args and **kwargs on the host side making functions non-RPCable.
This should make this workaround unneccessary:

Changed to 1.0 because that's the only way #366 can be fixed.
Another (user relevant) situation where this will cause trouble is when calling methods of artiq.protocols.pc_rpc.Client from the core device (chained RPC).
