Hello, This is a question, not an issue. I want to use liboqs to just print/return private key, public key and signature. I have been trying to print the keys but I am pretty sure I am doing it wrong. I have very little experience with c.
Thank you.
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <oqs/oqs.h>
#define MESSAGE_LEN 50
int main() {
/* code */
public_key = malloc(sig->length_public_key);
secret_key = malloc(sig->length_secret_key);
message = malloc(message_len);
signature = malloc(sig->length_signature);
sig = OQS_SIG_new(OQS_SIG_alg_dilithium_2);
public_key(sig->public_key);
secret_key(sig->secret_key);
return 0;
}
@prchander Please have a look at this for a full example how to use the APIs.
@prchander Without further feedback I suppose we can close this issue for now.
