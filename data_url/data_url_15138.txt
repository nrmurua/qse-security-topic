There used to be some class data Register.name_format, which is a regex for testing for valid OQ2 identifiers (ignoring keywords).  It's now deprecated as the naming restrictions on registers were relaxed in #9100, but the deprecation is done wrong - it's no longer usable as a class attribute, only an instance one.

In older Terras, Register.name_format was a re.Pattern accessible from the class.  It's not much use to need an instance of Register to get the valid name formats to pass to its constructor.

Is adding classmethod to the property method sufficient or do we need to deprecate via a different mechanism? To be honest undeprecating it isn't terrible either, just carrying around a regex class variable isn't an issue in the grand scheme of weird legacy backwards compat things we have in tree
Yeah, you can just add classmethod on top of property.  Even if you couldn't, it'd be trivial to write a custom descriptor instead.
