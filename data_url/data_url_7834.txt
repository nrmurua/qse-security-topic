The issue appears when I try to plot some wavefunction in spherical harmonics generated by the qutip.orbital function. When using qutip.sphereplot for plotting wrong image is shown.
From the source code, it seems the qutip.orbital function is using
to generate the meshgrid, while qutip.sphereplot does the opposite:
Personally I would also prefer the latter one in writing my own plotting function.
No response
correct image should be shown, which is the case when I also use phi_mesh, theta_mesh = np.meshgrid(phi, theta) in my custom plotting function.
