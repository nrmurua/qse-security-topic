Variational time evolution prototype does not support time-dependent Hamiltonians (with a t Parameter). Such case is expected to be supported in the Unified Time Evolution Framework and thus it has to be implemented in variational time evolution. A time-dependent Hamiltonian has to be bound again each time an ODE solver makes a step in time.
