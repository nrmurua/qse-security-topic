There is a filter for schedules (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/a3ae434326aefbb19a7861518b4a4f1e05528fb1/qiskit/pulse/schedule.py#L232) It would be convenient if that returned the remainder of the schedule that doesn't satisfy the filter. This makes it easier to, e.g., shift a part of a schedule.
filter(schedule, blah) << 100 + filter(schedule, not blah)
Would this be easy to do @lcapelluto?
I think it should be pretty straightforward. For the API, how about:
sure as long as schedule.filter(args)+schedule.exclude(args) == schedule
@dcmckayibm it would require | not +, but otherwise yes 👍
I meant whatever we are using for concatenating two schedules
