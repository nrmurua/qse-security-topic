ALAP scheduling should be the default for coherence reasons.
Since #166 this is now working as expected.
There can be arguments for a more advanced "balanced" scheduler (not from a physics perspective but from a computer engineering point of view). ASAP scheduling should always be avoided.
@imranashraf , I thought we discussed this but if there is a strong reason not to do this feel free to close this issue.
@AdriaanRol I agree. It will soon be the default.
PR #196 addresses it.
