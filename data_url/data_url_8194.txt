Describe the bug
As described in the title, file_ in _file_list().add(file_) already has the extension '.pyx' (this is done by _import_str() in qobjevo_codegen.py), it is unnecessary to add yet another suffix.
To Reproduce
This can be verified by add a line printing out file_ in _file_list().clean()
then run any test that can trigger it (for example test_QobjEvo_with_state()) and observe the output.
Expected behavior
Should only have a single '.pyx' in file_
Your Environment
Additional context
I discovered this when dealing with some test failures in windows, it seems that there are multiple problems in qobjevo.py (actually, what I really wanted to figure out in the first place was that some compiled modules would be deleted before being imported). Anyway, I will update this issue whenever I make any progress.
As it turns out, class _file_list does not have any practical effect, and correcting its add() method will conflict with QobjEvo().__del__(), thus removing it should be the solution.
As discussed in #1355 , it will be fixed in future updates, so close this issue ATM.
