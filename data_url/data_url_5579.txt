Qiskit/qiskit#7643 implemented mocked IBM Quantum Systems backends using the new BackendV2 interface.
However, noisy simulation of pulse job using FakeBackendV2 is not possible because Aer doesn't support generating PulseSystemModel from V2 backends yet.
Related to #1477
0.11 was released. Bumping this one to 0.12
#1545 is postponed. Also Pulse Simulation will be deprecated in 0.12.0.
