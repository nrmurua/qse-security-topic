The StructuredSolver._format_params method currently transforms the initial_state parameter from a dict to the format expected by the endpoint.
This translation, while useful for the user, makes it hard for other libraries (e.g. aws-braket-ocean-plugin) that are trying to mock the behavior of the DWaveSampler from dwave-system to do so.
It would be helpful to expose this logic in a way that can be used by other libraries. Some possible approaches:
I am inclined towards (2).
2 makes sense to me given that the transformation is specific to QPU. Where would it live in 1? Also I think with 1 it would need renaming, but that may be true for 2 also
Keeping this particular function in the cloud client makes sense to me. Why? Because it translates a nice state map into a list with 3's - very SAPI-specific, low-level and ugly.
This is related to #166 and #199.
I'd say, ideally, we don't use SAPI-specific data encoding anywhere on the client's API surface, and the translation happens internally.
