We need to decide what lives in there and what can go else where.
Fwiw, we recently added test coverage for the tool.qi.qi module in #785. We probably could improve some of the input data (since I just made most of it up) to be more realistic though.  This is independent of our decision about what we keep and/or remove from the module just wanted to point out there is at least some existing test coverage.
@chriseclectic and i will put a plan in and discuss it with you.
We are going to remove this slowly and have the functions in quantum_info in its own module.
I don't think we need to make this required for 0.7
This issue is still valid,qiskit/tools/qi/qi.py still exists. Any plan @jaygambetta ?
As of #3758 everything in this module is deprecated, so it can be deleted in future release in 3+ months time.
Updating: it's been 3 months, so these functions can be removed in 0.15
