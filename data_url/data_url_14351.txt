At the moment, the error messages that arise from trying to compile a circuit with control-flow for a backend that doesn't support it are particularly opaque.  There is no defined failure point, so in general, the messages just come from Unroll3qOrMore or BasisTranslator depending on the properties of the circuit, with their own opaque messages about failing to convert bases.
All the preset pass-managers already check for the presence of control-flow at the top level, so the information is already available to us.  This is likely just a case of adding (into O0 and O1, since O2 and O3 don't support control flow) a conditional Error pass based on the already-known information to provide better failure messages.
This should be stable for backport; the intention is that no circuit that was previously valid will become invalid, we'll just report better errors.
