When constructing a DAGCircuit using the Unroller with a specified basis, only the basiselements that are used in the circuit will be in the final object. Extra basis elements are not retained.
When specifying a basis I would expect the resulting DAGCircuit object to have all elements of that basis in the DAGCircuit's basis.
Only the basis elements in the input file are actually in the DAGCircuit basis.
For an input file of mine and the following example code
the dagcircuit object will have in its basis: h, cx, rx, sdg and s gates. But in the BASIS I define more basis elements than that. Specifically, I want "swap" to be in the basis.
Copy the input basis of the DAGBackend to the output object.
I want to construct a mapper for the qiskit developer challenge, and to debug I would like to see where SWAPs are applied in the output circuit. Therefore, I want to have them in my circuit basis.
@ajavadia @ewinston can you confirm this is a bug and not the expected behavior?
Yes the basis elements should be updated when unrolling occurs. It is a bug but low priority as it doesn't affect user code much.
The basis that is living as a property of the DAGCircuit seems to be the minimal basis that is supported for that circuit. It even has a particular format:
@ajavadia are you sure that this is not the expected behavior? What should be the content of dagcircuit.basis for gates that are not used in the input? In the submitter example, what is number_qubits, number_classical, and number_parameters if swap is not mentioned in qasm_description?
This issue is obsolete now since DAGs no longer carry a basis (its basis is whatever is inside it).
