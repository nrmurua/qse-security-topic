Properly reference Blossom5 and Python integration.
Address license issues
While the peculiar situation is being addressed, I'd still "protect" your code with the intended license. You could add a disclaimer in the Readme file, under a License section, pointing to the License template file you choose (e.g., new BSD 3.0) and remarking that Blossom5 is under another license.
Section added to README in #18  pointing to the extra license.
BlossomV should not be packaged with OpenSurfaceSim. Instead, the user should download the C package. This can be done in an assisted way through an automated script, in which case we need to make sure to list BlossomV's license before anything is downloaded. Our own interface with BlossomV can be written with Pybind11. Tips provided by @alexandrupaler
Solved in #26
No uses function to download and compile blossom V.
