I have read about Shor's algorithm and my understanding is that it can be used to factor large numbers efficiently. Can Shor's algorithm, though, be used to solve this problem:
Find the number 𝑒 e given the following information (Assume that 𝑃 P , 𝐶 C , 𝑁 N and 𝑒 e are all large, say 2048-bit integers): the integers 𝑃 P and 𝑁 N the integer 𝐶 C where 𝐶=𝑃𝑒mod𝑁 C = P e mod N If so, how does this algorithm work?
Please, could you explain it simply how can I solve this problem or a similar one using Qiskit?
I have started using Qiskit since August 2018 with jupyter notebook.
Last week I went through quantum experience website and how amazing is the dashboard and how easy is to play with quantum information.
I am studying one more time some fundamentals and then, I have plans to apply my question using Qiskit.
HI @imvieira this isn't the place for these types of questions. Please post on the qiskit slack (qiskit.slack.com)
