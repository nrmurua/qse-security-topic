The current parameterized qobj is not processed correctly when truncation is enabled.
Once truncation is processed, indices of parameters must be changed to skip truncated instructions.
However, the current implementation uses specified indices and then throw exception Invalid parameterized qobj: instruction param position out of range.
No runtime exception when the above script runs.
Resolve parameters after truncation or resolve parameters with consideration of truncation results.
