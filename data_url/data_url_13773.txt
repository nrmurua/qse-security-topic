The repository needs a license.
Apache 2.0 seems the way to go. Licenses should also comply with parts of code of other libraries that are used. Since pyquil, Cirq and Qiskit are on Apache 2.0, that is also the easiest way forward in view of current and future plugins (let me note that the basic Python scientific ecosystem is on BSD-new 3.0 however).
Just as an information, an agnostic comparison table is available here and a commentary here.
+1 for Apache 2.0
As a side comment: besides adding the license to the repository, it may be useful to add license headers to all the files. In QuTiP, there is a mess of different copyright and author messages. The license header should ideally be uniform. It may be an overkill, but I found a tool for it, licenseheaders that may help with keeping it tidy.
Thanks @nathanshammah for opening this + the links. I agree with Apached 2.0 as well as license headers to all files.
After our discussion, we can add the GPL v3 license and then think of moving to a more permissive one as Apache 2.0.
Just to make sure, @willzeng, that you were  referring to "GNU Lesser General Public License" (v.3.0, but there is also 2.1), or the more common "GNU General Public License"? We can directly add it from github with New file> LICENSE, and then the templates are available.
I was referring to GNU GPL (not LGPL which is also a good license but is more permissive). We could switch to that later.
I opened a PR at #73
