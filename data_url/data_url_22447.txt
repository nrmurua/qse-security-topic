I installed artiq using conda on the virtual machine we had in a new environment, from the main channel. I activated the environment and tried running the gui but got this error message,
I've tried deleting the environment and reinstalling it but got the same message. Any idea what's wrong?
Is your anaconda up to date?
I think so.
conda info and conda list please.
This may or may not be related. But please clean up your installation. Why are you trying to use artiq both from conda and from git?
What does python -c 'import artiq;print(artiq.__artiq_dir__)' show?
We have both the development and release version on this computer.
How do you think you achieved that?
Is artiq (/home/rabi/artiq-dev/artiq) 0.1+1212.gfb8a548           <pip> what you call "development"? How did you install that?
Please clean up your installation.
Conda might be misleading here. That is probably an old version it extracted from the tree a while ago. But still. You have messed up your installation. There are two artiq's in that python namespace.
Anyway. What do which artiq_gui and cat /home/rabi/anaconda3/envs/artiq-2016-03-29/bin/artiq_gui give you?
I'm not the only one using this computer, what's the best way of cleaning it up?
The command is which artiq_gui.
In a given environment you can only have one artiq "installed". Do both conda remove artiq and  pip uninstall artiq and then install exactly one again (conda install artiq or python setup.py develop/pip install -e .)
And please ldd /home/rabi/anaconda3/envs/artiq-2016-03-29/lib/qt5/plugins/platforms/libqxcb.so.
Then try installing (with apt or aptitude or apt-get) the packages that contain the libxcb-* components (named accordingly on Debian/Ubuntu) that could not be resolved in the ldd output. Alternatively you could install qt5 (apt) to pull in the missing libraries. There are also some xcb conda packages around but I don't know whether we should rely on them long term.
So I tried creating a new environment with with the conda package using,
but if I do a conda list after installation,
So somehow it's automatically installing artiq from artiq-dev as well.
If I uninstall artiqs like you suggested and just install it from conda, there's only one version of artiq but I still get the same error message trying to open the gui.
Trying to install it I get the following message,
How should I type in the package name?
It seems like at some point pip was use to install something on the computer, and it automatically installs those files everytime a new environment is created. I'll look into it more tomorrow.
You probably installed artiq in the conda root environment or in ~/.local/.
You can use aptitude or synaptic or the web interface or apt-file search to find packages that provide a certain file. In this case it's libxcb-image0.
Okay, i installed the missing xcb packages and the gui loads now. Thanks!
To be done: document what X libraries qt depends on or package them.
We can't package them specifically because of the xkbcommon dependency, which relies on distro-specific files.
This is about xcb which does not depend on xkbcommon AFAICT.
It does. I don't remember the exact details but I tried building xcb before resorting to pulling it from the host.
