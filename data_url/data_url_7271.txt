Trying to compare performance of different experimental implementations of gates is a maze because different groups will often insist on reporting different quantities that are largely equivalent but not directly comparable.
Quantities such as entanglement fidelity, avg fidelity, RB decay rate, equivalent depolarization rate, \chi_00, etc, are all related by simple linear functions.  For the sake of sanity, we should have functions that convert between all of these.
There are two possible approaches:
