I have two matrices A and B. I run

I did this and it works.
However, I'm also wondering if there are plans to rewrite simdiag to be more numerically stable (if possible). I've found that the eigenvalues returned and the accuracy of the eigenvectors depends significantly on the order that they are passed. For instance, I know that A has integer eigenvalues, and when I run
I get
as expected. But when I run
one of the eigenvalues listed is 19.897093031573782 even though it should return a list of the same numbers (the largest should be 8.0). Many of the other values listed are also not close to integers.
simdiag is not a well used function.  In fact, I know of no one whom has used it until now.  It is not unit tested, and was written nearly eight years ago, for compatibility with the Matlab quantum optics toolbox.  As such, it is not really a priority at the moment, and it might take some time to get around to fixing it.
Thank you @kevinsung. Closing this as the bug has been fixed by @jevonlongdell in #879. If you wish, please open a PR for the stability enhancement of simuldiag.
