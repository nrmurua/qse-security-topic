Problem V from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03719.pdf
Implement the Harrow, Hassidim, Lloyd (HHL) algorithm as an example, first the simple instance of


then a more generic version.
I'd like to work on this
HHL is not a NISQ algorithm. But the paper you linked shows that it's been demonstrated on small systems. I think it will be good for learning. How about implementing it in a pedagogical manner on a Jupyter Notebook so we can put it in a tutorials (#1002) directory?
@Strilanc Thoughts? I'm wondering where we draw the line on examples/tutorials e.t.c.
At the moment it's a very hazy line that we haven't really firmly decided on. It seems really common for people to want to try common pedagogical examples, even if they aren't NISQ-y.
Done. Please close.
