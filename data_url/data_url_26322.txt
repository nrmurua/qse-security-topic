Hello everyone,
I have noticed that cp2k outputs different forces on atoms with psmp and sopt executables when simulating systems with virtual particles. I ran the water_tip4p.inp script in tests/FIST/regtest-5 directory with psmp and sopt. The force output files are attached. With psmp, I find that the force on the virtual particle is non-zero even though its mass has been set to zero. However, with sopt, the force on the virtual particle is always 0.
