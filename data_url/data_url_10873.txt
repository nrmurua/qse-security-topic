When I try to submit a very big qmasm file (here 17'350 variables and 87'689 couplers) in qbsolv format, I expect QMASM either to produce a solution or to fail with an error (for example a timeout or a memory error). None of that happens, instead I get an empty output after about 4s:
I also tried passing a timeout parameter to qbsolv (--extra-args "-t 10") or specifying I want all the solutions (--show all), but the result is the same.
Is this the intended behavior ? How should I interpret an empty output ?
I would have expected such a large problem simply to take a long time, not to terminate after only a few seconds.
Do you get any useful information by adding -v -v --extra-args="-v3" to the qmasm command line?
Thank you for the quick reply !
here is the output using the aforementioned options:
Hmmâ€¦not much information.  Let's try running qmasm-qbsolv manually.  Add -o lala.qubo to the qmasm command line then run qmasm-qbsolv as in your output above:
If that still doesn't output anything, try running qbsolv directly:
I hope one of those commands will give us a clue as to what's going wrong.
Running qbsolv directly seems to work (it is still executing ^^). This is strange. Any idea on what causes the problem ?
Well, this seems to point to qmasm-qbsolv as the culprit.  It's still outputting nothing before exiting, right?
After about 18 minutes, it actually produced a result. I haven't validated it yet, but it seems correct ! So the problem seems to lie in between qmasm and qmasm-qbsolv.
Closing this issue because the latest version of QMASM integrates the dwave_qbsolv package in place of calling out to a separate qmasm-qbsolv program.  Please feel free to re-open the issue if you're still seeing empty output files or other bad behavior from QMASM.
