Following github's move to change the default branch name to main, I propose we rename our master branch to main.
Should be seamless: https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyRenameYourGitDefaultBranchFromMasterToMain.aspx
We could keep the master branch around for one release to allow dependent projects to switch over.
Fine with me. Let's do it after the 0.4.0 release. Actually doing it for liboqs won't be a PR, it'll just be me running the magic git commands. But downstream consumers will need PRs, and there will also be wiki documentation update.
