Should apply in the SparseSimulator, DensitySimulator, WaveFunctionSimulator, and XmonSimulator.
Introduce a utility method has_measurements on Circuit to avoid too much code duplication.
This code is in run?
Could you point at it? When I run a circuit with no measurements I just get an empty trial result. For example, cirq.Simulator().run(cirq.Circuit()) produces no error.
Whah?  I was asking whether you want to put this in the "run*" methods?
Yeah current behavior is that no measurements produce an empty trial result.
Oh, I thought you were asking "is this code in run".
Yes, I think it should be limited to the run methods, because the simulate methods have useful outputs when given no measurements.
I can take this.
@Strilanc I'm curious, you listed these 4 Simulators specifically. What kind of simulators should not throw error here? Is there an underlying property here that we can use in a parent class itself?
I was just trying to list them all. I think this applies globally to any simulator, as long as we're talking about sampling the measurement results.
