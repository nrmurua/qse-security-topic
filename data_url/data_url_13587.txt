Following the discussion in #341, we might consider pushing to TestPyPI automatically on some regular cadence. In pyQuil, I had it set up to push on every commit to master, but @nathanshammah has some reservations about this. An alternate idea would be to push nightly, like they do for tensorflow-quantum.
