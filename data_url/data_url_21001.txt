I was running the QRL master branch python tests and on one occasion it locked up and couldn't finish.  I then decided to run the tests in a loop and I found that within minutes of continuous running, the tests will hang and make no further progress.  Sometimes it happens immediately and sometimes it takes awhile.  Thinking there was a problem with parallel tests, I changed pytest.ini from -n 8 to -n 1 but the tests will still freeze.
I have reproduced this a few times and the last-reported test name changes each time so I do not believe it is specific to a single test case.
Thanks! I will investigate this
We are still investigating. Some thread leaking is documented here. PR #1233
We will add one more job for pytest repeated tests to see if we can reproduce it in CI.
#1243
#1256
These should have fixed the problem.
Is this fixed or there are still occurrences?
@som-dev Thanks for you answer. I will setup something to let them run continuously for an hour.
Ran the tests continuously for 6 hours
Closing for now, feel free to reopen if there this is still reproducible
