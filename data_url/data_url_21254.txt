Unable to measure a consistent slack for preventing DMA RTIO Underflow with KC705.
The measured value seems dependent on whether print is invoked, whether the DMA is played the first time, and possibly other unknown factors.
And tweak some parameters, such as removing the line print('upper: ', upper, ', lower: ', lower), changing upper to 10000, etc.
All of these would yield drastically different numbers, such as 2500, 1250, 1562, 3125.
Give approximately the same value. For example, the script gives around 1550 for ZC706 consistently.
The tweaks would give drastically different values.
