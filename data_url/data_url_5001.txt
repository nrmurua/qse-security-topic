The functions calcPauliSum, applyPauliSum etc currently involve copying the (potentially, very big) pauli arrays to GPU memory on every invocation. However, most use-cases involve the user maintaining a fixed pauli sum, like a static Hamiltonian.
Ergo there should exist a PauliSum object with persistent GPU memory, much like DiagonalOperator in commit 1dabef7.
