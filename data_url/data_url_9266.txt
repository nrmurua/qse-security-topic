Hey guys,
Is it possible that vm[m+1] may be read out without having been initialized in the following line?

It seems to me that it could happen if the "happy breakdown" occurs for j==m in the 1st iteration of the while loop, no?
Good catch... but I'd say this is quite an edge case for evaluation of boxed array, could you elaborate on why this needs to be a Real?
I think a simple fix could be to initialize them to zero since the actual value will be assigned later or not used anyways.
Right, I think using uninitialized memory here is fine, as the Vector{Float64}(undef, n) is usually small (tho not guaranteed), and thus err1 >> err2 is always true. So we could change the initialization from similar to zero which will be a bit costly, but probably not a big deal at all.
This is why I ask what would be the use case for Real or the above case since I think this is really an edge case, it'd be nice to make a decision if there is an actual use case effected by this.
