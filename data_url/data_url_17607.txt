job.result().get_counts() started to return results in HEX.
The Qiskit and Python version didn't change. One day it started to return values in HEX instead of BIN.


Run the notebook:
https://github.com/lukasszz/qiskit-tutorial/blob/bitstring_enc/community/hello_world/bitstring_encoding.ipynb
Information why.
I tried to run your notebook and also got results returned in hex. However when I ran it against the most recent version of Qiskit the results were returned in binary again, so I would suggest updating your Qiskit version to fix this error.
The CHANGELOG shows a change in the location of the post-processing of result (at the end of the Remove section for 0.7.0), and so if you are running against an older version of Qiskit it is likely this processing is now getting skipped, and so the results are being returned in hex instead of binary. Specifically, the post-processing to convert to binary is now called by the method get_counts() and so if you are running an older version of this method, this will not be getting called and so the processing won't happen.
Yes as @maddy-tod mentioned, updating Qiskit should resolve this issue. The devices are sending back results in hex now for efficiency, and for correct post-processing you'll need the latest qiskit. Or if you prefer to keep working with 0.6.1, you probably have to write a quick hex2bin function over the counts.
