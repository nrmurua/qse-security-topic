I installed OpenQASM using pip.
It only installed these 2 files:
and no executables.
What is the command to run .qasm files? Could you please add this information to the README?
Thanks,
Yuri
There currently is not a full reference compiler in the OpenQASM repo, just a reference parser.
See my response to #381.
