After #53 and #56 are implemented, it would be convenient to have num_reads adapt to the size of the initial_states, IFF initial_states is non-null and num_reads is not provided.
That way it's easier to adaptively sample/anneal off some initial sample set of varying size.
üëç I think this is expected behavior. For the new parameter that #56 will introduce, if it is set to tile or random, we may want to require num_reads to be provided.
Or, we can just use use a default value for num_reads (currently 10) in that case. That's backward compatible, and also seems nicer.
For example with the default, we could have:

On second thought, having implicit number of reads (the current behaviour) does seem a bit too magical -- especially if that number is some non-obvious magic constant.
I can see num_reads defaulting to 1, like we have on Tabu.sample, or requiring explicit number from the user...
