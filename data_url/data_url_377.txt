To further enable programmability via the kernel_builder, we should add the ability for one to specify a for loop within the Quake code being constructed.
Do you want to call it something like for_range?
Possibly in C++ have the first argument be either an upper bound (like Python's range(n) but without the "range" identifier) or a std::pair<int,int> (like range(lo, hi) but against without a range identifier). The full ðŸŒ¯ might be a triple of {lo, hi, step} much like range's triple form. In Python, just use range() to generate the first argument.
Believe this is complete. @anthony-santana @amccaskey ?
Closing this. It looks like it is already implemented. (Re-open if this is incorrect, please.)
