From looking at an old manual it not clear that those are actually obsolete and that newer releases are available. We should deprecate those manuals (especially 2.x) using a banner or remove them.

Seems to me this is done. Reopen if not.
Yes. Done.
Along with the new simplified release process (#1326) I propose we simply maintain /manual/ and /manual-beta/.
We also have a PDF manual now, so it's easy for users to keep a local copy of old documentation, and in any case, it can be rebuilt from the Git history.
So I don't think it's worth the hassle to maintain all the /manual-release-X/ manuals.
