I'm not sure what is happening but evolution by integration with custom linear operators is producing the wrong evolution. (Even if you simply wrap a matrix Hamiltonian as a LinearOperator). I realised this only when trying to extend the tests for something else. I will try to figure it out.
Interesting, do you have a short reproducer of the problem?
I've added LinearOperators to one of the tests that at least seems to be working.
(Hopefully) resolved by #44.
