Error when running this line:
from qiskit_aqua.input import get_input_instance
in the Qiskit-aqua tutorial notebook 'vqe.ipynb'
This notebook can be found at GitHub repo: qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/community/aqua/general/vqe.ipynb
Run the first code cell in the notebook:
I did not see the function get_input_instance() in the Qiskit-aqua repo, nor did I find it when searching through documentation. In the vqe2iqpe.ipynb notebook (found in the same directory) get_input_instance() is not imported, and instead do from qiskit_aqua.input import EnergyInput and use EnergyInput() in a similar way.
Thanks. That method was removed and it seems the notebook was not updated. Using EnergyInput directly is fine. The notebook has been updated already in a [WIP] PR in prep for Aqua version 0.5
This issue can also be found in the notebook to TSP which uses the same methods.
This is resolved
