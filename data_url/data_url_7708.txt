TDVP is very similar in sweeping structure to DMRG and should be easy to implement (essentially with local exponentials rather than local groundstates) and would be a nice alternative to TEBD.
Hey @jcmgray, I'd like to contribute to quimb. I have experience in coding, tensor networks etc., but I have never contributed to a large-scale project. Can you bring me a bit up to date with this issue please?
Hi @meandmytram, sorry for the slow response. Are you interested specifically in getting a TDVP code up and running or contributing generally? In either case, great! I do know someone has implemented TDVP in quimb now privately, so I might check in with them on whether it might be made public.
@jcmgray Sorry for the delayed response as well. I guess it wouldn't be super practical to implement something already implemented, however, I can try getting a TDVP code up. If not, I'd still be thrilled to contribute in general. Can you point me to some relevant issues, please?
