The Chi representation of channels is introduced in the documentation using an orthonormal basis, which happens to be the  {Eye(2), Pauli matrices}  / sqrt(2) for the case of a qubit.
However, the implementation in the code uses an unnormalized one, yielding wrong results.
In the file superops_reps.py, the variable _SINGLE_QUBIT_PAULI_BASIS is defined as:
The result in the Chi representation is off by a factor of 2
I don't know if I am missing something here with the dimensions of the objects.
