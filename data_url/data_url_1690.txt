Description of the issue
GateOpSerializer in cirq.google does not accept numpy numeric types as convertible to float. It's easy for a numpy.int64 types (for example) to end up getting fed in here.
How to reproduce the issue
Trying to serialize a gate that would lead to a numpy.int64 being passed to this helper method should do it.
Cirq version
0.11.0.dev
This should be trivial to fix by adding np.integer into the isinstance check: if not isinstance(value, (float, int, np.integer)): + we'll need a test. Great first issue for someone.
Hi, I'd like to tackle this issue.
It's all yours, thanks for signing up!
@dstrain115 it looks like a solution has been waiting for some time - can we merge it or close this?
Marking pre-1.0 in lieu of a decision here.
GateOpSerializer is deprecated.  Assigning myself to check if this is implemented in the new CircuitSerializer and just give an update on it.
