some of the scripts use "-" and others "_" in their file names. There is also "construct"/"create". Would it be fine to rename them with a consistent naming?
This seems like a worthwhile cleanup step. To match the other files in the repo, I think "_" is preferable. We'll need to update references to these files as well (likely places are docs, config process, and other scripts).
