At some point during a past update the runtime of Psi4 broke. While it builds just fine, running it as an executable fails with missing numpy modules:
I've no idea when exactly it happened. @markuskowa do you have any idea if something relevant in the python ecosystem in nixpkgs has changed?
I do not know when this happened or why it does find numpy anymore. You could run git bisect to find the commit in NixOS-QChem that caused this error (and then bisect nixpkgs to nail it down further).
Maybe we should have a separate psi4 test (outside of the main derivation). That would have uncovered the error.
Playing around somewhat I'm not sure the external test would help. Psi4 works with a nix develop shell when I use mkShell { buildInputs = [ pkgs.qchem.psi4 ]; } but it does not with nix shell .#psi4 or nix run .#psi4. There must be something in the wrapping that has changed on the python side.
The bisect is in principle a nice thing but testing will take forever, each Psi4 build takes around 2 hours ðŸ˜…  But I will do it if I can't fix it.
Inspecting bin/psi4  (and subsequent wraps) reveals, that the propagatedBuildInputs are not put in PYTHONPATH. Not sure why this does not work anymore.

Do you roughly know when it last worked properly? If you can give a good git revision I can run it here in the background.
