PulseSimulator was deprecated in 0.12.0 on. Mar. 10, 2023. We will release 0.13.0 at least after Jun. 10 and remove PulseSimulator in the release.
@hhorii may I try this task? And does it mean to remove class implementation itself and all integration and tests?
@hhorii is this issue still up for grabs? I noticed a linked PR that could potentially close it but hasn't been merged yet
I will merge #1809 after releasing 0.12.1. > @alt-shreya
Maybe because of configuration of this repository or organization, I cannot assign Angelo Danducci to this issue. I will merge #1809 to main soon.
Hi @AngeloDanducci
Do you mind comment on this issue so it can be assigned?
Commenting!
@AngeloDanducci I've been informed by Luciano that you'd like to donate $100 of this bounty (total value $180) back to Unitary Fund. Just want to confirm if that's the case and clear up any possible confusion in future payment.
@natestemen Please donate the entire value ($180) back to the unitary fund - thanks!
