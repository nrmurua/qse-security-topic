The return from randombytes should be tested for success before usage. For example, if in Windows, the randombytes call fails, then the resulting operation might contain zero bytes or invalid memory content, which pose a security risk (since the values are no longer random).
Unfortunately, the NIST API didn't specify that this might happen, and thus nobody checks this. We have not attempted to fix this for any implementations. I suppose we could merge a PR.

We created an issue in upstream for EMSCRIPTEN; randombytes was failing for Electron apps web assembly.
But since the return value from randombytes was not being checked, pqc keygen was silently passing and caused same key to be created each time. We have proposed a fix in upstream, but good to check return values in downstream code as well, just in case.
