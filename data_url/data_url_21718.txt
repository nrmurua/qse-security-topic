I get a timing failed error in the build of the standard sayma masterdac
artiq.gateware.targets.sayma_amc -V masterdac
python -m artiq.gateware.targets.sayma_amc -V masterdac --rtm-csr-csv artiq_sayma/rtm_gateware/rtm_csr.csv --without-sawg
This is with vivado 2018.3 (but the same error occurred also with 2018.1) and with artiq git
commit ec230d6.
The timing summary in top_timing.rpt is

I don't have time to debug this right now, please use the satellite variant.
Ok, the satellite builds fine, and we are happy to use only that for now.
@vmsch Do you have any use case for the masterdac variant or can we remove it?
We only used the masterdac for debugging, and can do everything with the satellite, so you can remove it.
OK, same here, it's only something I did for debugging - but it turns out using Kasli (+Urukul) as master instead is much simpler.
