Currently the density matrix snapshot returns the density matrix for all qubits. It should be able to support returning just the density matrix for a subset of qubits.
This will require implementing the partial trace operation in the DensityMatrix::State class (and also swap).
Eg. For a 3-qubit state  ρ =  ρ2⊗ρ1⊗ρ0 density matrix snapshots should return the follow:
Where reduced states are computed via partial trace of the full state, and shuffled qubit ordering implemented by swaps of state subsystems.
Implemented in #718
