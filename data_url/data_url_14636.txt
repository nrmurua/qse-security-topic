When running circuits involving a subset of the total number of qubits on a given backend, it would be nice to have the ability to run the same circuit on multiple subsets of qubits so that you can get additional shots for the same amount of runtime. I imagine that you could enable the compiler to find how to take the same circuit and map it to different sections of the chip. Since the current compiler likely finds the best qubits to run a given circuit, there is a possibility that the performance may suffer slightly but in some cases you may just want to gather a lot of data.
