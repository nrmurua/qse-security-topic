When testing test.python.quantum_info.operators.channel I'm getting a Segmentation fault: 11, speficically when test.python.quantum_info.operators.channel.test_kraus.TestKraus.test_circuit_init is being executed. Notice that I have not errors when executing only that test:
No idea...
I have also had this happen before.... Additionally when run with python debugging the stack it doesn't occur PYTHONMALLOC=debug python3 -m unittest discover -s test/python -v
Found the problem! (and the solution).
For future reference:
The first line in the call stack is from scipy. I noticed that requirements.txt says scipy>=1.0. However, my envs has scipy-1.3.0. Therefore, pip install scipy==1.0 did the trick.
It seems that we are not compatible (in a very ugly way) with new versions of scipy.
Could you add this to the requirements.txt?
1.1 also works, but 1.2 fails! Reopening to update the requirements.txt.
What does this say? scipy.__config__.show()
and this:
numpy.__config__.show()
scipy.__config__.show()
numpy.__config__.show()
So I have not experienced this error and am using SciPy 1.2.1.  The fact that it segfaults, and is doing so in the eigh function leads me to believe that it is an error in the BLAS function provided by whatever version of openblas you are running, or something in the interface.  I am using MKL.
Running SciPy 1.3.0 with whatever crappy BLAS implementation it is picking from conda-forge also works fine.
Travis breaks with scipy-1.1.0 https://travis-ci.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/jobs/216504908
Locally updating openblas to 0.3.6, via brew, allowed my to use scipy 1.3.0. However, the CI env issue is still there and I cannot reproduce it. However, still fails with 1.2.
I'm trying to debug this... but it's one of those tests in which we have random... this is just painful.
FWIW, this is something we started hitting fairly consistently in the macOS testing in azure pipelines when using macOS 10.14. I had to workaround it in: #2905 by downgrading to macOS 10.13.
@1ucian0 which version of macOS are you using when you hit this? I'm wondering if it could be an issue related to a system library version in mojave that scipy or whatever BLAS you're using is linking against causing this.
@1ucian0 which version of macOS are you using when you hit this?
10.14.6
@1ucian0 also what version of openblas is installed locally when you hit this? Just trying to get a handle on all the versions installed that come into play here. There was also a recent openblas release: https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/releases/tag/v0.3.7 , it's probably worth trying that too just to see if it fixes things.
I cannot reproduce this issue in my current setting and, since this seems like an openblas/numpy issue, I'm closing it.
For the record, my current setting is:
If somebody else has this issue with a current env, please reopen.
I managed to reproduce the issue just to confirm that #3884 fixes it. Thanks @nonhermitian !
