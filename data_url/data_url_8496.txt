Currently QubitCircuit.add_gate() appends a gate to the end of the circuit. If we wish to insert some gate in the middle of the circuit, we have to do a QubitCircuit.gates.insert(index=idx, gate). We can also add this functionality to add_gate by specifying a keyword argument index with default value as None. If index is specified, we could insert the gate at that position. For example, right now I would do :
Instead of that, we could do something like:
Further, if you wish to add the same gate at multiple positions you could just have more entries in the index list. Not a very big difference from using list.insert() but enables add gates to insert gates at arbitary positions in the circuit.
Sounds like a good idea
