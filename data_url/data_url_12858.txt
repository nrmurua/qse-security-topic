Hello,
I'm confused by the solution of task 1.4 for which all tests seem to be passing: Ry(2.0 * alpha, q);
This article states that Ry(a) = S.H.Rz(a).H.S^T where:
The result of such multiplication is Ry(a) = {{cos(a/2),sin(a/2)},{sin(a/2),-cos(a/2)}} (after simplification using Euler's formula) as shown in Wolfram|Alpha.
However, multiplication of the matrix with a qubit doesn't produce the required result.
The expected result is:
The expectation and actual result differ for input |1) in both signs, yet the tests pass. What am I missing?
@7rakir S^ (S-adjoint) isn't the same as S; it's {{1,0},{0,**-**i}}, not {{1,0},{0,i}}. I believe if you multiple through with the correct matrix for S^ you'll get the correct values.
Thank you very much. For some reason I misread that it's conjugate transpose (â€ ) and not a simple transpose (T).
It's all clear now.
