Take the following example:
If this circuit is laid-out in a 5-qubit linear coupling map, using CSPLayout, the result is the following:
Notice that there are other possible layout allocations besides the trivial one here. However, CSPLayout always choose this one, even when CSPLayout(..., seed=...) is set.
I would expect a uniformly distribution of all possible allocations, controlled by the seed parameter.
