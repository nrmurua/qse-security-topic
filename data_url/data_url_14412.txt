Currently DAGOutNode and DAGInNode have no op or name attributes.  This makes looking for specific operations more difficult than it has to be, and one must always do a type check first.  For example:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/16169de38ba858747e796a2acb5c96f8f37cb3b9/qiskit/dagcircuit/dagcircuit.py#L1404
It would be nice if they could be set as None ops and/or be given names like in / 'out so that they can easily be directly checked.
