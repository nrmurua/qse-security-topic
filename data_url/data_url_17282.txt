The use of ndarray in typing is not really supported; See for example: numpy/numpy#7370.  So a list just passes through.  There should be an np.asarray() call on the input times arg.  This is true for all the pulses in the continuous module.
Yes, this is a bug.
I agree typing isn't properly supported, is there a negative to leaving it as is, or is there a different way to annotate?
Do you think this is critical enough to require a backport, or is a normal bugfix fine?
The negative is that it does not work, and you still need to do what would have always been done which is do times = np.asarray(times).  I am personally against typing in Python, so others can decide.  I do not think it requires a backport.
Typing in Python is not strictly enforced, so there is no change but there is an existing bug in the methods. It is only a hint and making it clear what is expected and can be algorithmically verified by offline tools.
