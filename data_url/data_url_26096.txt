Users need to go through several steps in order to instantiate a Qrng object:
By transforming Qrng from a QuantumBitGenerator object wrapper to a class wrapper (i.e. through inheritance), the user can disregard QuantumBitGenerator altogether (i.e. step 3) and jump straight to using Qrng. Furtheremore, Qrng will then also be able to interface with NumPy.
Build facades to simplify the four-step process described above.
