I ran the test03_Hartman6 test on the SNOBFIT implementation within the test_snobfit.py file with a high threshold for stopping, setting maxfail to high values (about >20). This causes in issue with line 354 in snobfit.py when calling snobupdt.py.
Run test03_Hartman6 with options = optset(maxmp=6+6, maxfail=500), same with values for maxfail > 20:
I got the following error:
At some point in line 184 k = find(numpy.sum(x0 == numpy.ones((nxj,1))*x[j,:], axis=1) == n) of _snobupt.py k contains more than one value.
What is happening is that the area to fit has reduced to pretty much zero. It would be better if that condition led to convergence directly, but this is rather deep inside the snobfit code, so not easy to communicate back (in a clean way, that is). It won't show up if maxfail is set to anything sensible. :)
The same problem is in the original code, but the specific snippet has a workaround in several other places, so I put another one in (as well as a few more in subsequent places b/c next sampling fails, too, of course).
