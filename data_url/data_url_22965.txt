What I see on fedora 27:
$ ./pyrpl-linux
xkbcommon: ERROR: failed to add default include path /home/travis/miniconda/envs/test-environment/lib
Qt: Failed to create XKB context!
Use QT_XKB_CONFIG_ROOT environmental variable to provide an additional search path, add ':' as separator to provide several search paths and/or make sure that XKB configuration data directory contains recent enough contents, to update please see http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xkeyboard-config/ .
0 ./pyrpl-linux
Calling Pyrpl(**{})
INFO:pyrpl:Please select or create a configuration file in the file selector window!
Fontconfig error: Cannot load default config file
And then I cannot type in a hostname, or anything in any dialog boxes, nothing happens.
I am unfortunately unable to reproduce you error. But searching for it in google gets me to stackoverflow, where this bug seems to be well-known:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26974644/no-keyboard-input-in-qt-creator-after-update-to-qt5
Some are able to solve it with
If this doesnt work and you just want to start pyrpl (without needing the keyboard later during program execution), I suggest you can try to pass all the stuff as command-line arguments:
where, of course, you should put your filename and ip-address instead of the placeholders.
Running pyrpl from python (not the binaries) should also not have this issue.
I will leave this issue open for some time in case someone stumbles upon the problem again, and in that case try to automate fixing the issue.
@plauria can you let me know if the stackoverflow solution worked for you, please? thanks
Hi
See
https://lists.debian.org/debian-backports/2014/10/msg00061.html
Setting export QT_XKB_CONFIG_ROOT=/usr/share/X11/xkb fixes it for me. Thanks!
By the way for some reason I have to run pyrpl binary as sudo or it will fail to connect with lots of errors like this:
ERROR:paramiko.transport:Exception: key cannot be used for signing
ERROR:paramiko.transport:Traceback (most recent call last):

Could not connect to the Red Pitaya device with the following parameters:
Please confirm that the device is reachable by typing its hostname/ip address into a web browser and checking that a page is displayed.
It works fine if I use sudo.
this seems to be related to paramiko/paramiko#391. i will test the solution therein (ssh.connect("remotehost", username="myuser",password="mypassword", look_for_keys=False)) and see if it avoids that issue.
