It is possible to perform the loop over trials in _layer_permutation in parallel.  I.e. perform all trials and take the best result.  If using a callback function, it should be possible to stop remaining processes if a depth=1 circuit is found.
I am closing this for now, as other parts of the compiler chain are blockers over this.
What's blocking?
The DAG is the limiting factor in compile time at the moment. compose_back in particular. Therefore doing the trials in parallel is not the limiting factor at the moment.
@nonhermitian do you think it's worth reviving this with #3916 having merged and dag operations are no longer the limiting factor?
From the last timing info you showed it does seem like time to investigate this.
Ok cool, then I'll reopen this
