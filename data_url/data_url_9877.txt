Description
Building from source dimod for current version of main (SHA 927da3c) results in import error:
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
Current dimod should work
Environment
Additional Context
Updated pip
That error comes as part of the build command? Or when you try to use it? What is your setuptools version? Have you tried upgrading it?
It builds without error, that happens when trying to use it
What directory are you running commands from? You would get this error if you were still running from the root of dimod, since it would use the local file structure rather than the installed one.
Yes, thank you, that is the cause (local file structure)
Closing issue as user error in that case.
