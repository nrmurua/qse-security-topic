Over on my fork of OpenRelativity, I'm implementing a "micro-language" to use a Qrack plugin in the Entity-Component-System paradigm of Unity3D. The intended applications might be limited to pedagogy and entertainment, (though high-performance FFTs and other applications might come from the plugin, if not the ECS component embedding). It has me thinking about "getting back to basics" in terms of computer science, though.
We already have wrapped quantum AND, OR, and XOR gates, as well as variants which take one classical bit with one quantum bit. We should expand to include NAND, NOR, and XNOR, and I will include these in that other project's "Real Time QASM" micro-language. The more we can think of quantum computing in terms of classical computer science primitives of which basically everyone is aware, the quicker quantum computer science concepts might be understood and adopted.
This was implemented.
