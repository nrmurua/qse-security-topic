We have many analytical decompositions in https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/tree/master/cirq-core/cirq/transformers/analytical_decompositions which are used to decompose a given unitary matrix / operation into a specific target gateset (eg: cz/fsim/sqrt_iswap etc.). The behavior of these decompositions when trying to decompose an identity operation currently differs across implementations -- some return an empty list while some return only single qubit ops and others return a longer decomposition. Eg:
There are also other inconsistencies in the API's of these analytical decompositions. For example:
