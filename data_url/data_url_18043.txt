Subtasks to clean up the compilation flow, make it more modular, parallelize it, etc.
@ajavadia can you post the standard we are going to have for the intital_layout here so that we have a reference.
We decided to alter the format of the initial_layout to something like this:
where each tuple specifies one circuit qubit, and each position in the list corresponds to a physical qubit on the chip (in this case 5 qubits). The physical qubits are assumed to be ordered (Qobj has this assumption too).
This will hopefull have the flexibility of the current dictionary approach, but much easier to write (which was the goal of #727).
Great i want to make sure this is taken all the way though.
updated the top. We have decided that in batch mode coupling_map, basis_gates, initial_layout (maybe we change name to desired_layout) will not be customizable in compile. We will write an using qiskit to show how using transpiler.
@kdk this is where are tracking all the parts of the the transpiler
Closing as most are done and the remaining ones have separate issues.
