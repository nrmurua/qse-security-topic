For consistency and clarity I would like to rename qutip.cyQ to qutip.cython. Any objections?
Nope.  Been thinking about doing that as well but too damn lazy.
Apparently we cannot have a submodule called cython, because it collides with the cython package own module. So I'm renaming it to cy instead. I still think that this is better than cyQ, because the Q is unnecessary and there should not be any capital letters in module names.
