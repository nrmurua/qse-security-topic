My suggestion :
Thoughts ?
That's a good idea! I'll take care of it. When you say "\Omega in Mhz", you're saying that it shouldn't be the rabi frequency divided by 2\pi, right?
Yeah, right. The full \Omega and not \Omega/(2\pi).
I need some clarification on what the "default" C6 value is. Is it the 5.008e6? It doesn't seem to agree with the value of 3140 GHz.um^6 for C6/h... What am I missing here?
The value comes from imposing U/hbar = 1.5*2π Mhz  at R = 9µm. This gives C_6/hbar = 1.5*2π*9**6=5.008e6.
So, Seb, it gives C_6/\hbar = 500.8 GHz.um^6, or am I mistaken ? We need to put units here.
We can call it c_6, put specify the value of C_6/\hbar or C_6/h, as you prefer.
It is C_6/hbar = 500.8 µm^6 Ghz , indeed
The value comes from imposing U/hbar = 1.5*2π Mhz at R = 9µm. This gives C_6/hbar = 1.5*2π*9**6=5.008e6.
5.008e6 MHz.um^6 = 5008 GHz.um^6, right? Where's this order of magnitude going to in your calculations?
Then, C_6/h should be 31470 GHz.um^6 instead.
Haha, yes sorry about that mistake. It should be C_6/hbar 5008 Ghz um^6 and C_6/h = 797 Ghz µm^6
In the CZ gate notebook, I think you should only use one. I would suggest just C_6/hbar. Using C_6/h in the text and then C_6/hbar in the cell's calculations is unnecessarily confusing, in my opinion.
Sure ! I'll take care of that.
Btw, C_6/h = C_6/(2π hbar)
So C_6/h = 797 Ghz µm^6.  If I'm not mistaken this corresponds to what they report in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4262.pdf for n=62 (or n=64 which is what they take in the AFM paper)
But I agree we should put C_6/hbar, which is what I put in the simulation class
Those  2pi factors are a mess. This one is on me. I think everything is fine now in the CZ notebook. Btw, in the paper you mentionned they just suppressed the h's !
Yes, I think this is one is on Lucas ; )
