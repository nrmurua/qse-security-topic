#533 adds a variety of BQMs of different formats. Another one we could consider implementing would be a non-shapeable bqm that keeps its biases in coordinate form in numpy arrays. This would be a nice reference example to go alongside the AdjDictBQM. It would also be a useful intermediate representation for methods like BQM.to_numpy_vectors and BQM.to_serializable
Scipy provides a nice explanation of the benefits of COO format.
Another benefit over the existing BQMs is that this format would use less memory (at the cost of slower access).
Construction would look something like
