I cannot find the config file named ".pyquil_config". I have downloaded Anaconda and then installed pyquil through pip
Hello @akhil21, it's great to see that you are trying out pyquil!
The .pyquil_config file is not created upon installation; it is a file that you will have to create yourself. In your home directory you will want to create a file named .pyquil_config, and then type in the correct information as found here.
@vontell Thanks for replying. I tried making a file by .pyquil.config and placed it in the folder of Anaconda from where i am running my command prompt also. But, it's not working. can you please help?
The .pyquil_config file should be placed in the home directory of your computer user account, not within the Anaconda installation or project folder. For example, on Windows this may be C:\Users\yourUsername, on Mac this may be /Users/yourUsername, and on Ubuntu this may be /home/yourUsername.
@vontell I now placed this file in my Users\Username folder and started Anaconda prompt in that directory and tried running "pyquil.forest" but it's showing an error that this command is not recognized.
It seems as though parts of the tutorial are out of date; pyquil.forest has been replaced with pyquil.api. It would be best to follow the example at the top of this page.
@vontell I followed the procedure given in the doc but still it's not working. I will explain what I have done in detail below :
You will want to make sure that you follow these instructions:
Sorry it has taken a while to get back to you @akhil21. I would recommend taking a look at the configuration generation script for creating your pyquil configuration file automatically: https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyquil#connecting-to-the-rigetti-forest
Thanks @vontell . Now I am able to connect. Now will try to run few examples.
