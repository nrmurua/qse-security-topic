Currently, the tests checked by GitHub only take into consideration energies and forces. By also checking the results of the Run.tests.amber script, a higher degree of check would be introduced.
@vwcruzeiro This requires standalone quick to have program_error.sh and dacdif scripts. Is it possible to keep them as standalone tools in QUICK_HOME/tools directory? Or are there any other dependencies?
I think you can copy these files to a folder for GitHub, and then set AMBERHOME to this folder only inside GitHub.
