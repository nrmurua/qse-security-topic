The current paragraph, https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.2/guide/guide-pec.html should be expanded, similarly to ZNE.
Related to #908. Happy to help somehow, even just by helping add the workflow figure as #944 .
This is a more quickly actionable issue than #907, which may be broader and involve other tasks.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
