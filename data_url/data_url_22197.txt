I'm trying to interrupt a low priority experiment with a high priority experiment.
I'm running 2.0 on linux, and attempting to run the following experiments:
First, I submit ExpA with priority 0.  Second, I submit ExpB with priority 1.  I get the following error:
If I'm not mistaken, you currently need to close the core device connection manually by design (self.core.comm.close()) before calling Scheduler.pause().
Yup, that does it.  Thanks.
