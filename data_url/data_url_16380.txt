QuantumCircuit.compose runs normally if qubits argument has duplicate values. If you try to compose two circuits after converting to dag, DAGCircuit.compose raises an error. Introduced after #4762 .
But
As duplicate values in qubits is not a valid input, QuantumCircuit.compose should raise an error.
Similar to DAGCircuit.compose
I'm a little hesitant to adding checks in the compose method because it might slow down the usage and this use-case is obviously a wrong input, so that users won't be surprised if it doesn't work. But if the DAGCircuitError is too cryptic, we could improve it there? This would not give us additional overhead when users use compose correctly but would still give a proper error message.
Edit: Maybe it would be better to actually do include the check in compose. If we notice it causes performance issues we can also add a flag that deactivates the checks or use a private method like _append?
âœ… Error reproducible! Has the same 'duplicates in wire map' DAGCircuitError raised as mentioned by OP

Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
