As described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14722.pdf, the spec should be updated to allow for the classical types int, uint, bit, float, angle to occur without requiring a bit width. That is, to declare an integer, one can do either
In the first example, the bit-precision of x is defined by the particular hardware target. In the second example, x contains 3 bits. Only on types with the bit width explicitly defined is bit level access allowed. For instance, on the second example we could do  bit a = x[1]; or x[2] = 0; This is not allowed in the first example.
We should also make this "bit-level" access explicit in the spec.
This flexibility allows high level programmers to abstract away hardware details while allowing low level applications to access constraints particular to a given controller. It is expected that any given hardware unit will only support certain hardware widths.
Add complex to this list when #175 is merged. complex should also accept types w/ out specified width after this PR is complete (such as complex[int]).
