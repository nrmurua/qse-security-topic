When generating the dev docs, have a link to the wiki saying latest version is there and warning that this is dev docs which may have methods which don't exist.
Long signatures currently require scrolling to the right. It would be better if they wrapped arguments onto lines. For example, this is too wide:
def sample_write(self, shots: int, *, filepath: str, format: str = '01', prepend_observables: bool = False, append_observables: bool = False, obs_out_filepath: str = None, obs_out_format: str = '01') -> None:
Also fix typo Measurements with determinist results
