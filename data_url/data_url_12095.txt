Need to put the docs generated from here:
#890
into a CI test framework.
@mtreinish moved the tutorials make into this repo and under sphinx build that errors if tutorials do not build properly.  When you have bandwidth, can you do your CI magic and put this under automated testing via the sphinx build?
Done
