plot_bloch_vector(coords = 'spherical') modifies input coordinate list to spherical after function call when specifying coords = 'spherical'. This behaviour may not be desirable or atleast is not documented anywhere

There should be no change in input coordinate list irrespective of mode or at least the behaviour should be documented if it was desired
Culprit seems to be around here:
