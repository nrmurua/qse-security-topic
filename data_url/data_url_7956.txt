String based coefficients with time-dependent Hamiltonians in qutip 4.7 causes compiled files (.so, .o, .cpp files) to be stored into a hidden folder .pyxbld in the user's home directory. This is a problem because, when using qutip on an HPC cluster (the cluster uses Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8), I submit multiple qutip simulation jobs to the cluster, each of which generating cached file in my home directory and using up my storage. Qutip is not aware of these files and they are never deleted.
The root cause of the problem is in the top level init.py, on line 72, _pyxbuilder.install(), which calls the install() function in qutip.cy.pyxbuilder, on line 47:
Since the build_dir keyword argument is not supplied to pyximport.install, the default path is used.
Supply an option in qutip.settings, or qutiprc, or qutip.solver.Options to specify a custom path for the compiled files. This path is then passed to pyximport.install as the build_dir argument when __init__.py is run, upon first import of qutip.
