qutip-doc/guide/scripts/floquet_ex3.py raises an exception in floquet_master_equation_tensor
This should have been picked up by a test.
Tests didn't catch this one either:
You can use coverage with nose to see which part of the code is not getting caught by the tests. I have the coverage report for floquet here : http://sahmed.in/qutip_cover/qutip_floquet_py.html
This can be quite useful at times.
The equivalent functionality has tests in version 5.
