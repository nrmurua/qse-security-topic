On further investigation this appears to be the lack of antlr4-python3-runtime 4.7.1 on the python 3 version of the dev environment. This may not be properly recorded as a dependency in pyquil install
does conda install fix it?
I can't reproduce with
in a fresh python3 env
I did a fresh install with conda and did not encounter any issues
conda install -c rigetti pyquil
pyquil-config-setup
I'm on python 3.6.5
This looks related to #365
Good catch @davecyen this looks to be the same issue.
@sumeetkhatri could you try installing with conda instead of pip to see if that fixes the issue?
@sumeetkhatri any luck with conda? would appreciate it if you could let us know.
Installing with conda worked. Thanks.
