I've encountered this bug when creating a clean environment, and installing qutip (and IPython as console) through mamba.
Next, I've opened an IPython console and ran import qutip, which resulted in the exception printed below - stating that the format attribute of the fast_csr_matrix cannot be set.
I believe the latest scipy release is the culprit (released 14 hrs ago at the time of writing) - reducing from scipy==1.11.0 to scipy==1.10.1 resolves the issue for me.
I expected to be able to import qutip :)
The environment above was generated with scipy==1.10.1 (which still worked); I've changed the Scipy version to 1.11.0 manually in that list.
Forcing scipy==1.10.1, resolves the problem. Hence, I'm under the impression that the recent bump of scipy to 1.11.0 is causing the issue.
Reducing to scipy==1.10.1 gave me a different error, AttributeError: partially initialized module 'qutip' has no attribute 'settings' (most likely due to a circular import)
using:
Thank you for reporting, the fix is available in the qutip-4.7.X branch.
We will try to make a release with the fix soon.
QuTiP 4.7.2 was just released on pypi.
coda-forge release coming next.
