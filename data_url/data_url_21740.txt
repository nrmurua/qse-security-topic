@jordens what is the proper value that should be in the SPI/length register when you run spi2.set_config(config_val, 32, clk_freq, chip_select)? When I view the value in the register using artiq_coreanalyzer, it shows spi0/length[4:0]=0b11111 = 31. Is this correct, or is the register not the proper length to hold 32? I can't tell if this is an off-by-one error or designed this way. If so, how does it handle 0-length? An error?
Note: this is not for urukul, but custom EURIQA hardware.
For reference, the other vals in the SPI control regs at the relevant time:
The register holds the number of bits minus one.

It doesn't support 0-length:

Thanks for the prompt response. I guessed as much, just wanted to confirm all discrepancies I saw in the traces.
