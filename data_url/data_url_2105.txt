The B gate class in two_qubit_to_fsim.py appears to have been defined as the complex conjugate of the B gate as defined in the original reference (unless I'm making a sign error somewhere). It should be XX(a, b)**-0.5, YY(a, b)**-0.25,

In a sense this doesn't really matter, since _BGate is only used internally to the module, and B and its conjugate are related by 1-qubit gates. But it might trip someone up down the line.
I think you're right, thank you for pointing it out!!
The XX gate is defined as  and implemented as such in our XPowGate. And YY is similar. I suspect that for the 2qubit decomposition work to FSim it still worked because of some symmetry. However just simply changing the decomposition to the other direction, it breaks all the tests.
@viathor can you confirm our understanding here?
@balopat @gecrooks I agree that cirq's _BGate is the complex conjugate of B gate defined in the paper.
I think the decomposition works because the inverse B gate is locally equivalent to the B gate (e.g. conjugate by ZI), though I think some angles on the single-qubit gates may need adjustment.
We should fix this.
@gecrooks Thank you for catching this! Would you like to have a go at the fix?
