So, to do this, we don't even need the meta package, we just need to effectively to do:
This would be a good first step, but it is not exactly human readable. Do we care?
If we do want it to be human readable, then I would propose saving a copy of the channel dictionaries, and then expanding the Pulse pretty printers so that they output just enough information to reproduce the object when reconstructed from their str representation.
Since this will mainly be for experiment archaeology or debugging purposes, human readable seem desirable.
