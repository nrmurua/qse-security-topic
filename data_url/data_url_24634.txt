TableWaveform.duration is TimeType but the table entries are  of type float
The other possible fix besides #476 is to switch the internal representation to TimeType. I suspect that this will decrease the performance.
@terrorfisch In the following example the type in the tables entries is not float, but Expression
Maybe we can restrict the entries of the TablePT to be float?
The type is always expression until the pulse template gets instantiated. Then it is evaluated to an "allowed type" which is asserted in Expression._parse_evaluate_numeric_result.
Fixed in #476
