Hello developers, I'm encountering a problem in opening a jupyter notebook from this GitHub repository:
https://github.com/hsim13372/QCompress
When I run the example qae_h2_demo.ipynb
I got the following error:
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
 in 
5 import os
6
----> 7 from openfermion.hamiltonians import MolecularData
8 from openfermion.transforms import get_sparse_operator, jordan_wigner
9 from openfermion.utils import get_ground_state
ImportError: cannot import name 'MolecularData' from 'openfermion.hamiltonians' (/Downloads/QML/OpenFermion/src/openfermion/hamiltonians/init.py)
I think this error should be related to OpenFermion, and I believe that I properly download the software from the following code:
git clone https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion
cd OpenFermion
python -m pip install -e .
please shed light on it and thanks a lot!
Hi Alan,
The MolecularData class has been shifted from openfermion.hamiltonians to openfermion.chem .
More generally, all functions in openfermion are exposed at the base level, so I would recommend replacing this line with
from openfermion import MolecularData
Cheers,
Tom.
Hello Tom,
It is so nice of you helping me go through this.

I hope you or other developers can answer this question. If not, I am ok as I understand the problem may belong to pyquil but not openfermion.
Thanks a lot,
Alan
