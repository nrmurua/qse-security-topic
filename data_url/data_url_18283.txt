Hi 👋
Per the header of the Setuptools bootstrapper script (https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py), this installation method is deprecated.
Equally the "curl | python" pattern might not be a great idea - https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/one-way-curl-pipe-sh-install-scripts-can-be-dangerous/
I'll try to look for an alternative when I am I front of a laptop 👍.
Closing this issue as hopefully it has been addressed a while ago, specially since #35 and the introduction of a standard pip install qiskit method (plus the alternate installation methods on the README and documentation). Thanks for reporting, and please don't hesitate on reopening if you feel further discussion or actions are required!
