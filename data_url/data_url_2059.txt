without explicitly doing from cirq.aqt import AQTSampler although import cirq was done, the code line below raises AttributeError: module 'cirq' has no attribute 'aqt'
FYI this is pretty standard python behavior
Thank you. Did not know. Nevertheless, I find it annoying.
Yes, in Cirq we import everything, so I think #2748 is the correct change!
I think scipy doesn't do it to keep import times low
This is not an issue anymore due to the recently adopted packaging strategy.
