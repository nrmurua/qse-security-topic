ScaffCC's README states that a version of Python 2.7 or greater is required.
But when compiling with Python version 3.4
Compilation will fail with a fatal error:
But probably more concerning are these ImportErrors found throughout the compilation output:
I then tried switching to Python 2.7 and ScaffCC compiled just fine.
Ah I see. The ScaffCC code was written before Python3 was starting to gain traction, so I think "Python 2.7 or greater" was meant to mean: use Python 2.7
The "fix" will just be to update the documentation to indicate that ScaffCC requires Python 2.7.
Can you do that?
Hopefully someone can look into upgrading to Python3 later...
I think with the new version of LLVM this is no longer the case, closing.
