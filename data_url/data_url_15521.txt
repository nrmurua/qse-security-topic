I was trying to implement VQE on IBMQ, but every time I run the cell, it has AlgorithmError. I took a long time on it and right now need help on debugging. Really appreciate the help. Thanks in advance!
It should return a minimum eigenvalue(ground state energy). But no return at all.
I've successfully run this on qasm_simulator and other ibmqs, but it has no result return from ibmq. Usually, I'll wait several minutes after submission to get a return (no matter it's the correct answer or AlgorithmError), since the available IBMQs are only 5 and occupied at most times.
I hope to get help with debugging (mostly in the last part). Really appreciate it.
Your code works only changing "tqc" -> "var_form" at the VQE instantiation. You can see the job created:

The queue is taking long (more than 20 minutes):

@andrea2020liuyy does the above reply help? It seems indeed that tqc hasn't been defined. If not, do you mind posting the error that you're getting? That would help us understand what the issue might be ðŸ™‚
This issue  has been open some time with no response from the originator. It was most likely user error as it was indicated `tqc' was undefined above and worked if you altered that. It also is around the now deprecated VQE using QuantumInstance which is soon to be removed so as such I am going to close this.
@Cryoris Thanks, it's working. I forgot to come back to this community and close it. @woodsp-ibm I use the Qiskit RuntimeService estimator program to execute VQE and it works fine as well.
