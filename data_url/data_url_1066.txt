Today (1/25) the automerge labels are not picked up.
I checked the GKE workload, and it seems to be running. However, the logs stopped on 1/20 after a merge.

Seemingly the CPU requests totally stopped after that merge

Not sure what the root cause was. However there were no redeployments from master either as the trigger (redeploy-automerge-on-push-to-master) was set to manual for some reason. I changed that to every push on master. This redeployment should restart the automerge bot and fix this stalling.
