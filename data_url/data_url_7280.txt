Using Plots.jl or Makie.jl, you can make the animation so that examples like https://docs.qojulia.org/examples/wavepacket2D/ make more sense. Here is an example project I made: https://github.com/AlistairKeiller/quantum/tree/main. I don't know enough to claim that it is example worthy, but having an animation or interactive app as an example would be nice.
