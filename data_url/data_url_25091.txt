@localalex Thanks for finding the source of this error. I have been struggling to get it working. Perhaps I need to install Minetest 5.1.0 for the time being.
Links for Minetest 5.1.0. For Mac, you can download the installer here: https://github.com/krondor-game/minetest/releases?after=2019-07-23 For Windows, download here: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=23484​​​​​​​
Fixed by PR #15 Tested working on Mac with Minetest 5.2.0 Closing the issue.
