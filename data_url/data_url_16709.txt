If I use the exclude or filter methods on a schedule, it modifies the name. This doesn't follow the behavior we've selected elsewhere, such as scheduling a circuit should keep the same name, or rescheduling a schedule should keep the same name, or appending, inserting etc should keep the name of the first schedule.
This is particularly an issue when I build a bunch of programs, use exlude, and later want to use the name I chose for my schedules to grab the result data back (it's something like result.result().get_counts('name')) -- if I pass the original name, then I can't get my data back, because I don't expect to need to pass 'name-excluded'.
Initialize a schedule with a name, call exclude, see that the name has changed
sched.name should return 'x' in the example above
This can easily be fixed in pulse.schedule:Schedule.exlude/filter.
Thank you Jin-sung Kim for reporting!
