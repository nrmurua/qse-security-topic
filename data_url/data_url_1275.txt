Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
The two protocols were added to Cirq to support fast stabilizer simulations for (mostly) Clifford operations. See #2600 (review) and #2423 for historical context.
However, the coverage of these two protocols across Cirq gates is not great. For example;
Describe the solution you'd like
This feature request is to improve the coverage of has_stabilizer_effect and _decompose_into_clifford_with_qubits_ protocols so that:
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
@NoureldinYosri Do you want to take a stab at this issue?
@tanujkhattar  sure, can you assign it to me?
there are two ways to do this
The second option is more scalable and should be fast enough since we will only apply it when the unitary is relatively small.
Should we do both? We can make quick improvements to has_stabilizer_effect and _decompose_into_clifford_with_qubits_ to improve coverage (this should take a few days) and then also implement the algorithm to check if a general unitary is a clifford or not (this can take a few weeks)?
I think there is value in getting a quick fix for this this one; unless we think the general algorithm can be implemented within a week or two. What do you think?
I have a prototype for the algorithm so it shouldn't take long to get it in a decent shape and create a PR.
A minor issue of the algorithm is that it is a numerical algorithm so what we get in the end is a check that depends on the tolerance we use (yes means definatly a clifford, no means maybe a larger tolerance could turn it to yes).
so the algorithm is would be a quick fix.. but adding the has_stabilizer_effect and _decompose_into_clifford_with_qubits_ to the most commonly used gates should also be done before closing this issue
I compiled a list of classes that I think should be covered by the protocols inorder to achieve the goal of this issue:
Most of these gates have _decompose_ method defined that yields clifford gates so _decompose_into_clifford_with_qubits_ would just copy that decomposition.
