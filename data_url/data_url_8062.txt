Discussion of state vectors and density matrices in users' guide is slightly muddy
Hi Anna would you mind being a little more specific on which version/s you are currently using?
Currently for the state vectors we typically create them along the lines of creating a Fock state in |0> in a Hilbert space: vac = basis(6,0) print vac
which gives us the dimensions, shape and type of the Qobj
Quantum object: dims = [[6], [1]], shape = (6, 1), type = ket Qobj data = [[1.] [0.] [0.] [0.] [0.] [0.]]
if we have the fock state as a density matrix it will be something like fock_dm(5,2) which also gives us whether it is Hermitian or not
Closing this issue as a bit too broad / vague, but happy to discuss further if more details are provided.
