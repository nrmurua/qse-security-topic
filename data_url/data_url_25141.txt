We probably can not support every possible QNode configuration with QElectrons. It would be nice to have a single point where we verify these settings and provide informative warnings or error messages.
NOTE: This should be implemented after https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent-os-private/issues/73.
Having things break without explanation, I suppose.
