Example for ubuntu installation will look like:
@junliangtan1 sounds good to me. This seems like it includes non-python-based packages as well. Would these visualization extras just be something we add to requirements-dev.txt and setup.cfg extras? Or would there be any additional instructions or setup configs required?

Maybe will add these in an additional instruction and setup.cfg, because different operating systems got different installations for latex and related other package.
