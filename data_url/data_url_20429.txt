perhaps i didn't configure liboqs with the correct options, but my makefile links a bunch of the headers into include/oqs, but they're soft links and thus useless when naively copying them into some place more useful (like /usr/local/include/oqs).  also, not all the headers are present, so not all functionality of liboqs is exposed...
perhaps there's a better solution, have automake take care of copying all the header files into /usr/local/include when doing the make install:

this option seems appropriate, as it wouldn't require any extra steps on the end users part to start working with the library in another C/C++ project.
here are the changes to the Makefile.am which do this, but you may want to add/modify.  (note that it puts it in /usr/local/include/liboqs, though, there should be a way to do it in include/oqs if desired.)
@smashra Could we do this?
why not?  make install is pretty standard...
(forgive my ignorance!)
We probably should change the current behavior then :)
