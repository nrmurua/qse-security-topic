The beamsplitter  and two-mode squeezing operation have special symmetries, namely SU(2) and SU(1,1). This implies that their matrix elements B_{nm}^{kl}, T_{ij}^{kl} satisfy the selection rules

This implies that one can contract pure states (without loss of generality we assume only two modes) using one less loop as follows

and

where c_{ij} is the tensor representing the two mode state and n is the cutoff in Fock space.
Similarly for a mixed state one should be able to do the update of the state using two less summations.
These observations should result in significant savings when acting beamsplitters and two-mode squeezing in the Fock backend.
Note that the Rgate and the Kgate can also be contracted in a more clever way.
