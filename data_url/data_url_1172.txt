That would automatically make Foxtail programs compatible with Bristlecone.
Columns 5 and 6 of bristlecone are equivalent to foxtail, rotated on its side. We could add a function to map a foxtail circuit into those two columns.
Ah I was thinking about moving the grid of Foxtail, but probably this is a bad idea because there is a nice convention for containing box containing 0,0 as grid point.
OK so embedding seems wrong but something to convert might be useful.
I think what is missing here is just a simple method that creates the Callable between cirq.Qid's that is used in Circuit.with_device.  Actually I think can just pass lambda x: x+(1,2) to do the appropriate displacement.
Keep this open as it might be nice to add this to doc string for with_device
