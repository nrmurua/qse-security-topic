plot_transitions() is a method of class ParameterSweepBase which can be used for plotting energies associated with various transitions as a function of a scanned parameter. An example of how it can be used is presented here.
We are looking to add an enhancement where one can pass lists of tuples as arguments initial and/or final, with specific state labels that represent initial and final transition end-points of transitions that should be plotted. So for example calling:
should lead to (only) transitions between levels with labels (1,2,4)<->(0,1,0) and (1,3,1)<->(0,1,0) being plotted.
These changes should not break current code, and should be documented in the method's docstring.
(It would of course be great, if this addition would be also briefly explained in the documentation - but that is not part of the bounty).
