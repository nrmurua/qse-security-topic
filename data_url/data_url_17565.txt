get_op_nodes returns a list of node_id integers or a list of tuple of (node_id, data).
get_gate_nodes returns the same types as get_op_nodes
get_named_nodes returns a list of node_id integers
get_2q_nodes returns a list of node dictionaries
get_3q_or_more_nodes returns a list of tuples of (node_id, node dictionary).
For consistency perhaps these should all return the same data types.
I fully agree. A Node type is needed.
@1ucian0 have you started work on this? If not I would be keen to work on this.
go ahead @maddy-tod!
Should methods such as DAGCircuit.ancestors(node) be included in this change? Currently the method returns a list of node_id but it could be updated to return a list of Nodes
yes, I think so.
