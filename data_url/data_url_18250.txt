Hello,
I'm pretty new to qiskit and I may have misunderstood the issue, but I cannot build the package due to a missing package folder: simulators
I suppose that's due to the new backends interface implementation, so maybe setup.py should be updated to reflect the change, here: https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py/blob/master/setup.py#L12
Hello @r3versi,
thanks for reporting! A fix for the invalid package name declaration is included among the changes on PR #115, which is still not merged - and some other tweaks might be needed to ensure being able to build the package properly due to recent changes.
It should be fixed shortly, but in the meantime (and if applicable in your scenario) perhaps using the alternative installation methods would be an option?
Hi @diego-plan9, thanks for the fast answer. I actually installed the package simply replacing qiskit.simulators by qiskit.backends at line 12 of setup.py and everything built smoothly üëç
I'm glad you were able to get it working, @r3versi ! I'm closing the issue as the issue should be address on the mentioned PR, but don't hesitate of reopening or issuing a new one if needed.
