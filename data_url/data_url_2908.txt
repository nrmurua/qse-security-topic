Currently, the qcircuit to latex code passes through unicode characters like ↺ ↻. LaTeX may not be happy about this. We should replace the unicode characters with some that LaTeX is happy with. Or perhaps throw an error?
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} seems to do the trick.  Probably should only add it if there is unicode in the text.
Hi, could you please assign this to me?
