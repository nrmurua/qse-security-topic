In the actual code the docstring is correct,  but at https://quantumai.google/reference/python/cirq/ops/FSimGate the description for phi says that a full CZ is at pi/2, instead of pi.
This will automatically be fixed after the next Cirq release. Please reference the nightly: https://quantumai.google/reference/python/cirq/ops/FSimGate?version=nightly version of the docs for the most cutting edge documentation.
