In nac3 we allow users to modify (reduce) list length by slice assignment, so we need to pass lists by reference to match python semantic (callee able to change the list length).
This requires changing the compiler code (llvm_ir_generator) and some runtime methods, such as rtio output_wide and dma_record_start.
