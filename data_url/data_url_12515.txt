Using Linux Mint 20, python 3.8.5, and a virtual environment with tensorflow-quantum==0.4.0, tensorflow==2.3.1.
Creating a new parameterized quantum circuit (tfq.layers.PQC) fails with raised ValueError and message:
with traceback (cleaned up to remove references to my setup):
1 ValueError: Cannot serialize op cirq.Z(cirq.GridQubit(0, 0)).controlled_by(cirq.GridQubit(0, 1)) of type <class 'cirq.ops.controlled_gate.ControlledGate'> 
Cheers
Additionally: calling tfq.get_supported_gates() errors out, the function is under utils, so the call should be tfq.utils.get_supported_gates().
Hi @mikeevmm , thanks for raising the issue. You are using a gate that isn't supported by TFQ. Any Cirq gate that has been turned into a controlled gate with .controlled_by was never supported anywhere in TFQ. If you recalled using controlled Rz operations before, perhaps they were in the form of a CZPowGate, which is supported since it doesn't use controlled_by ?
Either way, it looks like the underlying issue here is that the error strings presented to a user that does not use a supported gate are misleading. Should be a quick fix :)
@mikeevmm if you are still interested we have just closed #422 which adds support for controlled_by on all of our gates, so the above snippet should now work on tfq-nightly.
