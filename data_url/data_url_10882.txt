Description
QBSolv.sample accepts num_reads as a parameter but returns a number of samples that seems to have no relation to the value provided.
To Reproduce
Here's what I observe as output:
Expected behavior
I expected the output to end with ['SPIN', 2 rows, 10 samples, 25 variables].
Environment:
Actually, it looks like num_reads is getting passed to the underlying sampler.  Perhaps this issue needs to be a documentation-clarification request and/or a feature request for a way to specify the number of samples the caller would like returned.
