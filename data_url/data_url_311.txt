Bridge is creating a malformed cc.alloca operation.
A related issue: since the example code has implicit default ctors, clang++ will omit creating them in the LLVM output. The bridge doesn't know that so assumes they will be in the .o file. This will lead to link-time errors as the ctors are not defined and silently omitted.
