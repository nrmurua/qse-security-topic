I'd like to use OQS algorithms to OpenVPN TLS control channel (--tls-auth option) but can't so far.
Still no plans for it ?

No, we don't have the bandwidth to dive into all downstream projects. What would be helpful here is code showing what exactly fails -- independent of OpenVPN, i.e., concrete openssl commands/calls.
FWIW: Just added a (passing) test to run x509 pubkey extract and dgst sign/verify cycle to oqsprovider: You may want to check out the code here to see if these openssl dgst commands are the ones you need to have working (as per #295 (comment)). Apologies for not adding the same effort to OQS-OpenSSL1.1.1 but for new (OQS-openssl) functionality my preference is to focus on a more future-proof code base (i.e., OpenSSL 3.x). Please let us know why this wouldn't work for you and provide concrete (oqs-openssl111-based) commands that don't work. Until then, closing the issue.
