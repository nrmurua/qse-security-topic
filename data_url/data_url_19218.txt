Requests from qiboteam/qibolab#643:
For now we have the fuctions "assert_connectivity" and "assert decomposition". If you want i can create an "is satisfied" method for router, unroller and pipeline that calls these function based on the connectivity/native gates. There is now a tutorial in "advanced_examples", do you want to add it somewhere specific?
Thanks @Simone-Bordoni. At this point, I think we could drop is_satisfied completely from the transpilers. It was mostly used for qibolab but we can do this check internally in the QibolabBackend if needed.
The tutorial was requested by @jykhoo1987 so I would ask him if what we now have in https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/blob/master/doc/source/code-examples/advancedexamples.rst#how-to-modify-the-transpiler (which will be rendered in the docs in the next release) is sufficient or no. I believe it is fine putting it under advanced examples.
is satisfied has been dropped, i think we can close this issue
@stavros11 thank you very much, the improved tutorial you linked is much more comprehensive than before. At first glance it looks to be sufficient. I will try it out in detail at some point and get back to you if I find something missing or unclear.
@Simone-Bordoni @stavros11 thanks for looking into this.
