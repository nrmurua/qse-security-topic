When I import qiskit on a fresh virtualenv after installing the meta-package (poetry add qiskit), everything works fine:
However, after installing GPU support (poetry add qiskit-aer-gpu):
I use Poetry to manage dependencies and also have Pennylane (including the Qiskit plugin) installed in the same virtualenv. Other than that, I am not aware of anything that might interfere with Qiskit. GPU/CUDA information is attached at the top.

Which CPU are you running on? There is a limitation with the qiskit-aer-gpu package where it requires a CPU that has avx2 support. On the qiskit-aer package it does runtime detection and only uses avx2 if the CPU supports it, but with the qiskit-aer-gpu package the way that runtime detection is built doesn't work with nvcc.
Thanks for the fast response!
That seems to be it. I'm running on an (ancient) AMD FX-6300. If this is an instruction set issue, is there any hope for a workaround (e.g. compiling from source)?
You can try building it from source, I personally don't have experience doing this on a system without avx2, but I think everything should have ifdefs to block avx2 compilation if its not available. Looking at the cmake files though you'll probably need to edit the flags when CUDA is set as the thrust method: 
@vvilpas do you have any suggestions on this?
Hi, a PR is open trying to solve this exact issue #859. We are still solving some details but it should work. You can try it. Let us know how it goes.
Hi, I might try that over the next few days (or just give in to the inevitability of a hardware upgrade). Anyway, I'm closing this for now.
Thanks so much for your help, I'll keep you posted!
Hi, Were you able to solve this issue? I am not getting this but kernelimagenotfound against my NVIDIA GPU having cuda 12.1 and GPU Geforce GTX 980ti
