OK, this one I think is a bug. I am running Python 3.9.5, and am running pyzx from the master branch.
Given the following code:
I get the following error:
This should be a valid input matrix, as it corresponds to the CNOT circuit with CNOTs where the row additions are, and I believe I have constructed the Graph, Architecture etc correctly.
@Aerylia Do you know what is going on?
Yeah, the code is functional, but the Steiner-gauss implemented in pyzx is supported for architectures with a Hamiltonian path. The given architecture does not have one.
Ah, so the recursive version of the algorithm described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00633.pdf does not have an implementation?
Not on this repo, I never made a PR and now I don't have the access anymore ðŸ˜…
Does it has an implementation somewhere else?
@cqc-melf we have a fork in CQCL. Looks like there is an implementation there.
Thanks for your help Arianne.
Yes, I was just typing. The recursive version is called rec_steiner_gauss
Perfect, I will take a look. Thank you!
If you have questions, just drop me an email: ariannemeijer@gmail.com
I will close the issue.
