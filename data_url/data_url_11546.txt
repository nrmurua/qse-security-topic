If you look at the code below, you'll find that the measurements have been replaced with StateFns, making the ComposedOps invalid and unable to eval. The same is true for statevector mode.

Code:
I believe the issue is that on lines 309, 311, and 314 of the CircuitSampler the resulting StateFn should be given the measurement status of op_c.is_measurement, but I'm not 100% positive.
After setting is_measurement=op_c.is_measurement, it is possible to eval, and for that particular example we get
