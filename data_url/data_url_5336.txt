Running the following script on macOS x86_64 using PL-Lightning and PL-Lightning-Kokkos version 0.33.1 (installed via pip) will lead to memory segfaults. These segfaults are related to the initialization of  the "lightning.kokkos" state vector.
A few notes:
I could reproduce this by building lightning.qubit and lightning.kokkos on the machine from src, and with using lldb, it seems that the issue is propagated from Kokkos vector kernels. I didn't dig more to see if this is related to the Lightning implementation or Kokkos kernels.
