The documentation of the branch dev.major raise over 50 warnings when building.
These are mostly formatting error in functions and classes doc-strings, but some of the code example also raise errors.
These warnings need to be fixed and the -W option to turn warnings into errors, restored.
A recent documentation build can be found here. The problematic doc-string need to be reworded and/or reformatted.
