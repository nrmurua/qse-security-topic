Describe the bug
When raising a 1 × 1 Qobj instance to a power using **, an exception is raised that only square operators can be exponentiated.
To Reproduce
Please provide a minimal working example. For instance:
Expected behavior
A 1 × 1 operator is square, such that exponentiating should act similarly to scalar exponentiation.
Your Environment
1x1 objects in QuTiP 4 basically just don't work at all. Here, the main problems are really that the multiplication of the two Qobj is returning a Qobj (that particular multiplication returns a scalar in QuTiP 5), and that the resulting Qobj doesn't have its type set right. It ends up with the constructor inferring it, and it always infers it to bra when it sees the 1 on the left of the shape.
There's unfortunately a lot of missing handling like that right now (and all the inference is really slow!). It should all already be fixed on the dev.major branch, at least.
I attempted to make qobj return an scalar for this case, as QuTiP 5 does, but that seems to be a no-go. Tens of tests start failing  because  QuTiP 4 doing things like:
or
Even thought fixing this is quite straightforward, I decided not to change it and open a PR to allow scalar-like qobj **.
