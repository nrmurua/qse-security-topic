TFBackend.reset() should be able to change the batching behavior of the backend by accepting the batch_size argument, like TFBackend.__init__() does.
This would allow TFBackend.reset() and TFBackend.__init__() to take the same set of input arguments. The corresponding Fock and Gaussian backend methods already do this.
Currently LocalEngine has to pop batch_size out of the backend_options dictionary before it can be passed to backend.reset().
