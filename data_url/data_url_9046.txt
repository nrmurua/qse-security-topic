tried installing using pip -install stim --user
got this error message :
building 'stim' extension
error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required. Get it with "Microsoft C++ Build Tools": https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
I'll try to install these, but I prefer not to. I have mingwin installed already
after installing tools from the link, install went ok...no need to worry about using mingwin...
I will add this to the "reasons to figure out proper prebuilding of wheels" pile.
