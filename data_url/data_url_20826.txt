I noticed that many implementations namespace extern variables.
I did not not namespace them and it did not report it.
Should extern variables be namespaced?
In principle, they should be namespaced, as they're external symbols. I'm not sure why the tests don't catch them.
However, they should not exist in the first place. Global state makes code not thread-safe. See #168.
I should clarify (after @mkannwischer made a good point) that if they're const, they are fine thread-safety wise, but should still be namespaced.
