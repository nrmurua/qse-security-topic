@liweintu @nitinshivaraman, I am opening this issue to remember and discuss about the possibility of adding composite gates to qibo. If I understand correctly, we would like to:
Note that qibo currently provides a circuit.on_qubits() (PR #254) method, which allows defining useful subroutines (such as the majority in the qasm example above) as small circuits and adding them to bigger circuits. However, if the big circuit is exported to qasm, it will not produce a result like the example.
Also, we have the FusedGate which corresponds to groups of gates that are fused to a single matrix for faster execution, if circuit.fuse() is used. This gate is also not compatible with the qasm parser.
