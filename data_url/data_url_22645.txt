For the following states of the dataset_db.py and artiq_gui.py the following program does not set xxx in the dataset_db. There are no errors.
I cannot reproduce the problem; it works fine here (except that the pyqtgraph fails to restore the dock state from the DockArea entry in the artiq_gui.pyon you provided).
Are you sure you are not just experiencing some network issue? Can you try again, and does the problem persist?
Yes. Confirmed that the problem persists even after restarting all ARTIQ processes.
Note that while the master is running, there is a delay of up to 30 seconds for dataset_db.pyon to be updated.
Noted. It doesn't appear in the GUI after 1 minute.
OK. So with some playing around... It looks like the dataset_db.pyon is getting updated correctly but the GUI Dataset pane is not being updated. See below for some examples of interaction via artiq_client. I've run the code snippet above from the GUI which generates xxx in the on-disk dataset_db.pyon but not in the GUI.
Regarding delayed updates: I was talking about the PYON file on the disk, not the GUI. The GUI is always updated immediately.
Is artiq_client show datasets also affected by this problem?
