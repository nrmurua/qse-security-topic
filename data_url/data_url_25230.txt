I started following the quick start, but using pip install -e . to install covalent, and then covalent start.
Upon starting covalent, I get the message
Visiting that page I get a web page with the text Not Found.
After that I run a workflow as in "3. Run a workflow.", but then when I try to visit the UI as in "4. View the workflow progress.", I still get the Not Found, instead of seeing my workflow in the queue as in the screenshots of the docs https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quick_start/index.html
Follow the quick start with the latest version.
Same as when using the non-editable version.
Or, we could have a note somewhere in the documentation explaining that the quick start only works for the latest PyPI release, and not the latest code with editable version.
Hey @kinow, just wanted to give you a heads up: if you choose to install in pip editable mode, keep in mind that the UI won't be automatically built. You'll need to build the UI yourself by following the instructions provided here. Once you've got that done, everything should run smoothly.
Hi @Prasy12, I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to point out that the contributing guide might be missing some steps when it comes to building the UI while developing. Do you think it would be possible to add a few steps from the UI's Readme to the contributing guide? I would really appreciate your help with this. Thank you so much in advance!
I'm going to go ahead and close the issue, but please don't hesitate to let us know if you're still experiencing any problems. We're always here to help!
Thank you @santoshkumarradha !!!
I get the same behavior when pip install-ing from a branch rather than via PyPI. Good to know how to fix it though.
