If one wants to used DistributedAnalysis.get_Qdielectric (Q_surface, etc.), there is a problem in that self.U_E is not updated and might be from a different variation. Found when I ran do_EPR_analysis on several variations and then later tried to use get_Qdielectric on the first variation. Of course, self.U_E was still on the value from the last variation and I was getting a participation ratio above 1.
Thank you, ptruitt (sorry, not sure who this is from the github name).
Yes, you are correct. That code need to be updated. Do you want to create a pull request if you have fixed it? I am a bit swamped atm, so i wouldnt be able to get to it for some time right now.
I think you fixed this, right? I guess we can close this issue now
