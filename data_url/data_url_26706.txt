See https://github.com/cp2k/dbcsr/milestone/5 for the progress on the DBCSR v2.1 final release
Some of the v2.1 issues will be moved to v2.2... What's the ETA for the v8.1?
@alazzaro end of year would be good, but we have other blockers as well (still collecting)
DBCSR v2.1.0-RC19 will (hopefully) become the v2.1.0. The RC is currently under testing in the CP2K-CI.
DBCSR 2.1.0 is out, you can update to CP2K...
@alazzaro, thanks for making the DBCSR release!
It's maybe a bit too late now, but what should we do about #1203?
@oschuett I haven't consider the #1203 a real problem for the v2.1 The bug seems related to GCC 6 only...
My plan was to have a stable release for CP2K 8.1.
Anyway, we can always have a 2.1.1, assuming someone can look at the problem and provide a patch...
I agree that it shouldn't block the cp2k 8.1 release, because it only affects a few users and does not produce any wrong results.
