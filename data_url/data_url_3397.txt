Right now, these five files pretty much only reference one another, and form a suite of Python-based simulation tools that don't currently have a whole lot of developer support:
Other than the PyQVM, which is used as a QuantumComputer backend. Of course, all of their non-private classes and functions must continue to be supported by this new interface even if there is no explicit dependence coming from other parts of the repository. However, I think that moving them into a simulation module (and making the hard cutover whenever we release pyQuil v3.0) will help improve the overall organization of the repository.
