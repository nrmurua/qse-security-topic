Hi there,
Not a bug, but a question.
I have the following hybrid model (quantum input -> PQC -> FullyConnected neural net), which In train on some data points:
I would now like to record the loss over the number of total circuit evaluations (to evaluate the performance of the ParameterShift rule). Is there a way to do that?
Thanks in advance
Probably the easiest way to do it is just to compute it based on the known information. You can just get the results of model.fit and see that each backprop (for batch_size=1) will have 2prep circuit evaluations. So each epoch will have len(X) * 2 * p * rep evaluations (and the loss is given per epoch). If you are looking for more fine grained analysis, you could use tf.GradientTape() and step through more manually and keep track of more information. You could also write your own callback (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_callback) and keep using model.fit.
Perfect, thank you very much!
