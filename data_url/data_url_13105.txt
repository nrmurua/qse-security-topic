Currently QPROGRAM is either a typing.Union of several quantum circuit types, or a single type if only Cirq is installed. It should be consistent in both cases - it was a bit of a pain to write a simple test in #745. Further, the typing.Union type is not particularly useful, notably for isinstance checks.
I have some knowledge on types can give it a try , can you share more resources/examples or starters?
