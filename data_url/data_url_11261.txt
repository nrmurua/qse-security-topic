I think we should just assume the JWT is used. If we eventually support other options, this should be controlled by a function argument rather than having different functions.
This would be a breaking change.
No, I veto this suggestion. We shouldn't rename things completely on a whim, and this is not a good reason.
I think its important that people know we're using JW to get the sparse representation.
