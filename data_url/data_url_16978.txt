I put 100 identity gates for single qubit to characterize the background noise of it, but after the state tomography the density matrix seems to imply that the qubit didn't undergo the depolarize channel.

backend = provider.get_backend('ibmq_poughkeepsie')
q = QuantumRegister(1)
circ = QuantumCircuit(q)
for i in range(100):
qst = state_tomography_circuits(circ, [q[0]])
job = qiskit.execute(qst, backend=backend,shots = 8192,optimization_level=0)
from qiskit.tools.monitor import job_monitor
job_monitor(job)
print('Time taken:', time.time() - t)
tomo_circ = StateTomographyFitter(job.result(), qst)
rho = tomo_circ.fit()
print(rho)
The density matrix should be close to I/2

In the above issue, it seems that the identity gate should not be removed in newer version for qiskit anymore, but it still looks like being removed in advance.
Thank you very much!
Hi @ZincSun , I checked quickly and for me, the identity gates are still present in the circuits after transpilation. To check this, you can either transpile circuits manually, or extract the run circuits from the job
@kdk
Thanks!
I added a X gate to excite the qubit first and apply IDs and the result seems reasonable !
I think I can close this issue! :)
