Description of the issue
Cirq install from source fails with setuptools==61.2.0. It succeeds with setuptools==54.2.0, likely higher versions (based on pypa/setuptools#3197, probably >=61.0.0)
Cirq version
0.14.1
Error Message
I can take care of this one.
My patch in drewrisinger/nur-packages@aeac9e1 should fix this, it basically just prevents setup.py from finding any packages to install. I meant to submit that as a patch but forgot.
@drewrisinger - thank you for the tip - #5330 should in effect do the same.
