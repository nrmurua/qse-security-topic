Hm, where are you opening this? The repository only has the folder tutorials/, no qiskit/tutorials. So I'm not sure how this would happen.
This repo is being archived very soon because the tutorials are moving to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra. If this is still an issue with the newest build, please reopen the issue there.
Thanks for opening this issue!
I think this was when the qiskit-tutorials folder had a different structure back in August 2022. Now it's changed and this issue is no longer reproducible. Thank you so much for following up on it! üòÅ
