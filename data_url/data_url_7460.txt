Hi,
I'm trying to use Yao.jl in the field of quantum chemistry. I just encountered a problem that I do not know how to write an empty Pauli string inside a Hamiltonian. More specifically, I need to write down the following Hamiltonian, for example:
Following this example, I know that 0.6*X1*I2*Z3 + 0.3*I1*X2*Z3 could be defined in this way:
But how about 0.13*I1*I2*I3? I tried 0.13 + 0.6*X1*Z3 + 0.3*X2Z3, however, it doesn't work.
I think it must be an easy task, but I could not find any related document.
Hi, overshiki.
Maybe you could try this:
Hi @ChenZhao44,
Yes, this solves my problem. Thanks!
