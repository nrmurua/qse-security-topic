Sayma RTM  Si5324 fails to ack write address.
Connect Sayma AMC and RTM together. Flash with latest gateware from M-Labs conda. Power on while looking at the two serial ports.
Normal boot, no panics.
Panic...
Booting Sayma and looking at the UARTs. On the primary I see
while on the secondary
any ideas @sbourdeauducq ?
@marmeladapk what's the plan for debugging this? AFAICT @sbourdeauducq hasn't seen it on any of his boards so can't debug it, CTI have seen it on a few boards, but haven't looked into it yet. When I can get my hands on a new Sayma I'll see if the problem goes away. However, it does seem like a real issue that will have to be solved properly before Sayma can be considered ready for deployment.
@hartytp I'm not sure how to proceed either right now. During our tests communication with Si5324 on RTM is checked hundreds of times and we didn't have problems with it on any board. Your boards were also tested before shipping.
You could check with a scope at Si5324 inputs if all timings and voltage levels are correct. Unfortunately I can't devote any time this week to this issue. :/
Without access to the lab, probing signals is pretty time consuming, so I won't attempt to debug this on the HW. If you send me the binary you used for testing then I'll happily try that. Otherwise I'll test out on another board when I can get access to it.
AFAIK this is fixed by 901be75
