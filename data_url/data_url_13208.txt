How should the identity scaling examples be added ? On this page, there are some examples for ZNE via Unitary folding.
Maybe a separate short example in which unitary folding and identity scaling are compared?
(I would consider this as a nice but not urgent addition, since we already have a lot of ZNE examples.)
Just trying to clean up some issues. I think other issues cover this?
@natestemen Not really. The way I see the docs are structured, there's the Users Guide and then there are separate examples for ZNE with different backends etc. I created this issue for the Examples page. I was thinking of adding some additional information/examples about identity scaling wherever an example of unitary folding exists.
