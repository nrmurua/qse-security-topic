How can MOLDEN and NBO files be generated using QUICK?
Hi @jimkress65, Thanks for reaching out. Unfortunately, this feature is currently not available in QUICK; but will be added down the line.
Thanks for pointing this out and sharing the link. We will add this feature in next release.
Hi @jimkress65, we have implemented this feature and is available in the latest quick master branch. Can you please check? You just have to add EXPORT=MOLDEN into your input file. Thanks!
