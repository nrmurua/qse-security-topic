From @priti-ashvin-shah-ibm
After looking at "path" elements in GUI, then user want to switch back to poly. User needs to click exactly where the letters are shown for poly. If user presses in the greyed out box connected to poly, the view will not change.

Click in the field but not exactly on a letter
User can navigate to poly
n/a
@priti-ashvin-shah-ibm I'm unable to reproduce.
I ran CPW Meander Simple up through and including:
But when I go into elements and click "poly" then "path" then "poly" the table changes accordingly and looks fine. What notebook were you using when you saw this issue?
Issue was fixed by someone else prior.
Thanks for the update
