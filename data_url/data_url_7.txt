The kernel keeps crashing even when executing this simple 2-qubit GHZ state (from our webpage) in a jupyter notebook using sample_async and nvidia-mqpu
When I place this code in a separate python script decorate with mpi and execute with mpi-run I get  the following error
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
what():  [custatevec] %out of memory in addQubitsToState (line 202)
[gorby:2315095] *** Process received signal ***
[gorby:2315095] Signal: Aborted (6)
[gorby:2315095] Signal code:  (-6)
I triaged this - uniqueHash there in pySampleAsync is not quite unique enough, hence a race condition here. My suggestion would be to add the provided qpu_id to the uniqueHash.
Fixed via #1114
