In #1497 the version of sphinx-gallery has been pinned to 0.10.1 since, with later
versions, the gallery examples doesn't look good.
After pinning sphinx-gallery, it looks ok, but it would be nice of the Mitiq documentation was compatible with the latest version of sphinx-gallery.
This problem is being tracked in sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery#984. Once there is a solution there we should be able to upgrade.
Once a newer version (>0.8.12) of nbsphinx is released this should be good to go.
