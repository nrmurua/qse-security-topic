The grammar is clear about Identifiers and applies that definition to both Variables and Subroutines.
In the spec text, the valid identifiers are called out for Variable but not for Subroutine.
Identifiers should be called out in the spec, and Variables and Subroutines should say they are named according to the rules of Identifiers.
