The epic #1148 decided a new bit ordering convention that needs to be followed by the simulators:
From the #1148's text:
Imagine we create two registers q and v and that q is declared
first.
The tensor product order for these registers is
Vn x ... V1 x V0 x Qn x .. Q1 x Q0
Check the simulators do this
The classical bits are order with V being the most signifcant register and Q the least significant. That way the the mapping stays 1:1 between basis states and classical bits.
Check the measurements do this if i have two classical registers. We will not have any spaced between the registers. So if the outcome is for register V is 1...01 and for Q is 0..11 then the bit string returned is 1...010..11. Currently qiskit was suppost to return it 1...01 0..11
