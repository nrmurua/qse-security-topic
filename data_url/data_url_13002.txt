In some cases, synthesizing eg a 3-qubit unitary gives a block with 4 or 5 layers of e.g.
cx q[1], q[2];
separated by single-qubit gates.
This seems like an easy type of block to look for, then the number of CNOTs on the same pair of qubits can be limited to no more than 3 in a row.
Yep! Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Awesome suggestion! We will get this fixed shortly.
