Application
There are multiple dimod samplers that handle seeding with initial states.
See:
Also noteable that the DWaveSampler in dwave-system handles initial states (docs).
I think it would make sense to define some standard behaviour across Ocean.
A couple other notes/thoughts:
If we had such a consistent API, it might also be possible to create a dwave-hybrid like syntax
Though obviously that might become confusing.
