I generate a simple layout as in the example found in Layout.from_dict() (layout.py) docstring and then execute using the layout as the initial_layout. Use a physical backend, not a simulator.
Execution completes successfully and the layout is respected.
Currently the hacky solution is to respect the _mapping.py description of the initial_layout and create a Layout such as
Perhaps _mapping.py needs to respect the Layout?
Ok, this is because internally a dict of the form dict{(reg,idx): (reg,idx)} is expected whereas the examples given in _layout.py assume the values from a dict or list are simply integers. @1ucian0 changed the way the layouts are done, so I am deferring to him as to whether the int values are the correct to way to input, and the error is in the mapper code, or if indeed the mapper is correct, and the Layout object needs to be modified.
Layout object should be maps to integers. If I remember correctly, the idea was allowing "high" level functions such as execute to support the object parameter and the "raw" parameter, in this case, the dict. In any case, the dict should be dict{(reg,idx): int}. Right @ajavadia?
I'm currently in a limited setting but, if there is no hurry, I can have a look to this in a week.
Without running the example (so take this with a grain of salt), I noticed that the problem is "old" swap mapper which will be removed soon. Does it make sense to fix it @ajavadia?
This issue was fixed at some point (I think, after the Layout object refactor #1740). In #1637 I added a test with the code from OP. @ryan-woo feel free to reopen if you consider that the issue is still there.
I've exactly the same problem as ryan, but my python version is 3.7.1
I've just updated qiskit to be sure that it is on the last release.
Another strange thing is that it works if I use only an index in the layout dict, as
 qr = QuantumRegister(1) layout =Layout( { (qr,0) : 1 } )
I'm using the ibmq_16_melbourne  backend.
If it's useful i'll upload the whole code, but it's really the same.
What's your qiskit-terra version?
It is the one visualized by the command qiskit.__version__, right?
It is 0.7.0
The last terra version is 0.7.1. Maybe you want to update it pip install -U qiskit-terra and try again?
It still gives me the same error. This is the code, maybe i've done something wrong:
and gives me the error :
thanks for your support!
Try with lay = { (qr,0): 1, (qr,1):10 } instead of lay = Layout({ (qr,0): 1, (qr,1):10 }). Maybe it's something in the format conversion. If this issue is still valid in master, can submit a new issue?
Sorry, but I'm quite new to this.
What do you  mean by "try with master"?
Ok, I've just opened a new issue, #2034
