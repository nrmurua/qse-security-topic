Task of feature #4
Not very high priority as of March 2015
The idea is to provide a simple way to simulate the expected result of programmed gate sequences.
Several complementary options to describe decoherence that will be relevant in different settings should be available.
Going beyond leading order would require additional features, e.g. a parametrization of the actual gate to be used in Monte Carlo modelling.
Check Qutip (qutip.org) to see if that framework can be built upon before independent implementation.
Part of this was implemented in Daniel Pimentel's bachelor thesis.
