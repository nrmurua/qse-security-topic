Currently, specifying 'depth' to qFlex instead of using the auto-computed depth will result in an error, since it doesn't actually limit the number of cycles processed from the circuit file.
This will probably be simplest to fix after #115 is completed - until then, documenting this issue in the help message should be enough.
Agreed. Let me change the title to be more informative.
See #115
At the moment, users cannot specify the depth so I declassify this as improvement rather than bug.
