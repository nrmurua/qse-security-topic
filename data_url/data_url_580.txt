Hi,
I want to pass the output of one circuit as the input of the next. for instance, I have two circuits,circ1 = xacc.getCompiled('circ1') circ2 = xacc.getCompiled('circ2'). It will be enough for me to be able to make a bigger circuit by combining them or be able to execute them on the same register one after the other. Both circuits have no measurements. How can I achieve this?
Here's an easy way to do it
Thank you so much.
