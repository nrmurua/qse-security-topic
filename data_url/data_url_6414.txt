(The commit to master without PR was actually an oversight, but I wanted to make a statement and open discussion on the change of license.)
Benn Bollay and I, Daniel Strano, as copyright holders of Qrack, have decided to license our original contribution of the Qrack library under the LGPL. We do not and have never depended on libraries with a strong copyleft GPL requirement for Qrack.
I think it is very important that quantum computing and simulation resources are developed for wide and maximal public utility, as a potentially extremely disruptive technology. Benn and I agreed originally, for about a year, to license our work to each other under the GPL, in Qrack. My motivation was maximizing public availability and utility of quantum simulation resources. We have both come to think that this intent is better accomplished, in Qrack's case, by the LGPL.
This Github issue is for record and archive. All comments are welcome.
+1 Approved.
I think it's worth explicitly clarifying, for any downstream developers and users, that Benn and I consider our copyright to be licensed under the LGPL. If you have not otherwise incorporated strong GPL dependencies, (depending on the terms of other licenses you have accepted,) you are free to consider our code LGPL and update your forks' and branches' licensing accordingly.
Comments are welcome on the license change, at any time.
