The test_run_workflow_does_not_deserialize test in tests/covalent_dispatcher_tests/_core/execution_test.py currently seems to be disabled due to a missing pytest.mark.asyncio. But even after enabling it or running it in a separate event loop, it doesn't seem to pass. In the former case the error says that the event loop is closed, and in the latter we get
TypeError: cannot pickle 'weakref' object
Try running the test with either pytest.mark.asyncio or in a separate event loop using asyncio.run.
Mentioned test should pass.
