New or modified version of lumped_oscillator_vs_passes which only prints out the data of the last pass.
Further, that it wouldn't need passes as an input, but checks how many passes were done for the simulation and uses that as the value automatically.
Easier analysis, user not needing to manually check for number of passes, and more quickly see the relevant parameters from the analysis.
