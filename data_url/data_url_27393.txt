Maybe it is possible to add support for RISCV-Rust.
@SteffenReith I am not quite sure what has to be done here. Official risc-v support for the default extension set was added in 2019, one can add the target using the command rustup target add riscv64-unknown-none-elf. Using a feasible configuration, one can compile the code for riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf. There is also a create for low-level access for RiscV-CPUs. Do you suggest to install the rust toolchain, add the riscv target and install some useful riscv creates like the low-level access crate?
