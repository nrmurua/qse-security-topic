The flaw is in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/tools/parallel.py
if os.getenv('QISKIT_IN_PARALLEL') == 'TRUE', the qiskit is literally expected to run in parallel, i.e., the if-branch should take the true branch. However, the current branch logic does not do this.
Actually os.getenv('QISKIT_IN_PARALLEL') = 'TRUE' means that the parallel_map is already computing something in parallel, and a new parallel run should be conducted in serial
thanks for the clarification.
will close it.
