Good morning,
my machine is a laptop satellite Pro with x32 / Windows 7
the installation with pip install qutip / SimulaQron stops at message for C++ version 10.
I have C++ 2008 (since april this year declared old), new versions are for VSC and not for free.
I have Anaconda and Python and SimulaQron installed.
why do i need C++ ?
is there a workaround ?
kind regards
Cees Riddering
ps i want to start for the competition, what i mentioned last week at the meeting.
Do you know how to use docker? If so, I have a docker image in which you can run the code.
Good evening Wojciech,
I see what docker can do, looks ok√©.
What must i do to receive your docker image?
If you  send me that image i am very grateful for your help.
Tomorrow i am away till 16.00 hrs for a demomstration of my new energy/ fast charger invention.
Thank you and kind regards,
Cees
Goodmorning,
i have searched for a docker solution and i have decided to go looking for an x64 machine next month.
docker is only for 64 bits hardware.
It looks that i can forget the competition unless you can change the qutip installation to x32 machines.
Can you advise me another simulator to work on? and to have a possibility to  export my  python programs later to SimulaQron?
Thank you for your help to get started.

Good evening Wojciech,
good evening, i have bought a new laptop intel-i5 and x64 with windows 10  PRO  to get started for the competition.
one question: when i have installed everything and also docker for x64 protocol, what must i do to use docker?
kind regards,
Cees
I don't know how to use docker on Windows, so you will have to figure it out yourself. You will need to build a docker image from a dockerfile. You can find my dockerfile here: https://github.com/Wojtek242/SimulaQron/blob/Develop/Dockerfile
However, I don't use Windows, so I can't help more than just giving you the Dockerfile, if you can manage to get that to work the comments in the dockerfile should give you some guidance in how to use it.
If it doesn't work, you may have to try a different way. I see that you are now on Windows 10 so you can look into using the Windows subsystem for Linux which will give you a Linux work environment on W10 and that could work better https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10. You would have to learn Linux etc. to use that. However, I also don't have much experience using it so I don't know how well that will work.
Unfortunately, that's all the advice I can give - I have never used Windows for coding! Good luck!
thank you, i go trying your advice, if it works i mail you,  thank you very much for your help

Hi @cees68
Did you get this working? If not, it's maybe worth trying, as @Wojtek242 writes, to install bash for Windows.
Hi AcksId and Wojtek242,
installed: ANACONDA/PYTHON 3.6/qutip/github/SimulaQron/Bash for Windows and Ubuntu/setting the export commands/setting checked in the configfile/
i installed bash for Windows and Ubuntu. thank you, took  some to to learn what it does.
Everything installed as described in the document Programming a quantum network.
till point 4 running automated tests and point 5 configuring the network.
when i run the commands sh tests/runTests.sh and the command from point 5 for the network
i see in 1 second a black command screen passing by with text in it.
from  the program/procedure:  startAll.sh Adrian Beth Claire comes a message :
syntax error "done"expecting "do"
where can i find what is in there ,  is this oke or not?
i can't find a file or textblock written with the messages.
i need this because in document point 4 is written a sentence with FAIL or OK.
idee: write the info also in a logfile
thank you and nice day
my installation:
pip install twisted
pip install service_identity
pip install qutip
qutip went wrong because of a wrong version of C++
the message was that my windows 7 had a wrong version of the installed C++ package,
this resulted in buying of another laptop with windows 10 pro, with
an intel chip core i5.
the problem, i had, with running qutip is solved.
installation of Python 3.7
installed anaconda
install docker for the docker file you advised, time for reading how it works.
i read it and couldn't get it run.
installation of the Linux Bash Shell for Windows 10 (github advice from Wojtek242 and AcksID (thank you) see https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/
this works and was the starter here:
conda create -n new-env anaconda python   (i filled new-env with testconda)
to activate this new-env (new environment) on Windows
execute:
c:\Users\user\Anaconda\envs\testconda
this takes some time but it is the best solution to let check testconda everything
and all other software packages are also
available for future use.
the next step:
install SimulaQron:
git clone https://github.com/StephanieWehner/QI-Competition2018
start simulation tests:
cd your path/QI-Competition2018/SimulaQron
then export :
export NETSIM=your path/QI-Competition2018/SimulaQron
export PYTHON=your path/QI-COMPETITION2018:$PYTHONPATH
Simulatron starten in de windows command box:
startAll.sh
check in your path/QI-Competition2018/SimulaQron/config/settings.ini the field LOGLEVEL
from warning to debug
restart SimulaQron.
i attached 2 files because there is a message in the original installation instructions/document about ok or fail and in the bash history the list fi message is a command line out the startAll.sh
i found 2 files on my system with info about my tests, (see at end of this tekst)
question: where is the output  with messages that everything is oke when you run startAll.sh etc. or is there only the text in condarc_text and bash_history.
--is it possible to add some textfiles with the progress when are programming and testing?
--can you inform me about this and is my bash_history oke?
in the mean time i am going on with  startAll.sh and the nodes and with the challenge.
note: all the commands are typed in the command block (not in the windows_powershell or the linux command boxes.
thank you so far and thank you for your advices and help
have a nice weekend
Cees
