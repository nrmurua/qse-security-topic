The same builds pass when the PR is not a draft.
Option 1 - remove the workflow for draft PR
Option 2 - figure out a way to allow changes to multiple files (as stated in the linked discussion)
The draft workflows don't take too long compared to a non-draft workflow as the tests are run only on the changes made in the PR. Option 2 would be a preferable solution but in case that doesn't work, option 1 would be the fallback solution.
I vote to remove, and spend more time on #1998
