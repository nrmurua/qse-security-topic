The qvm server crashes when it is started.
This issue is identical to the issue reported for the quilc server. For further details, (such as the drakma test) please see that issue.
The quilc server crashes when it is started.
Note: the problem can be avoided if a qvm command line option is used to disable the version check:  --check-sdk-version=False. The default is to run the version check and this causes the server to crash.
No user code is required.
