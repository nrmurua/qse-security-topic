This is just for future reference for topological quantum circuits. A lab mate of mine (https://github.com/rxnew/) has developed a nice code for visualisation of topological quantum circuits which can be seen here - http://sahmed.in/tqc_viewer/
Click on one of the samples to see the circuit visualisation. It is in 3D and you can zoom in, zoom out and pan the figure. In future, if we implement topological quantum computing, surface codes etc we may wish to use this in some way.
I also had some difficulties with the LaTeX visualisation of quantum circuits and I was wondering if that could be improved somehow. Particularly, the .png file is not created during latex compilation. I will try to reproduce the issue and post here. This should probably be marked as an enhancement.
I'm having the same issue.
