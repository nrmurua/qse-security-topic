Hi,
In the file "INSTALL.md", in the example of lines 27-30, appear the option --enable-omp to script install_cp2k_toolchain.sh. This option is not active in the script of master branch.
This was modified? In the lastest release, v7.1.0, this option appear.
Thanks for the report. The  --enable-omp option was removed because CP2K now always requires OpenMP.
