The following functions are added/overridden in SilQ init
At this point they should be integrated with our version of QCodes, as our changes to QCodes are likely never to be pushed upstream.
Since get_thing is the naming convention in the DataSet class, I would suggest renaming load_traces to get_traces and letting load_traces point to the new get_traces with a deprecation warning.
Agreed, there's no need for monkey patching anymore.
As for renaming load_traces, my original thought was that calling this can have significant consequences. For instance, loading the traces before the measurement is finished will often corrupt the hdf5 file. For this reason I opted for load_traces, as it makes a bit more explicit that it actually loads a separate file. So I'm not sure about the change, I do agree that naming-wise get_traces would make more sense
It sounds like the hdf5 files should be using the Single-writer multiple-reader mode, which is the proper way to address this potential corruption problem; currently there are no warnings that you can corrupt your raw data by attempting to read it. I don't think naming it load_traces will stop anyone from loading the traces whenever they choose. I'll raise this in a new issue and we can continue the conversation there.
