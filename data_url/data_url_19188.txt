Currently, it is not possible to (directly and straightforwardly) simulate time evolution of mixed states represented by density matrices with Qibo, as far as I understand.
I think this would be a useful feature to include in the library, and I guess it shouldn't be difficult to implement from what is already built-in. I'm thinking of something like StateEvolution(ham, dt, density_matrix=True).
@DiegoGM91 thanks for reporting this feature, if you have some implementation please open a PR or share the code with us.
@scarrazza apologies for the late reply. I'll open a PR soon.
