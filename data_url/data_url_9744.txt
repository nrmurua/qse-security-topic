Application
When adding a set of binary variables as a discrete variable, an error is raised that indicates the variable is not hashable. This is not a bug because the function expects variable labels. However, if one is using dimod.Binary or dimod.Integer to build a model, it's convenient to be able to pass a set of such variables to construct a discrete variable.
This raises error,
currently I can do:
to get around it.
How would you expect
to behave? Would you expect it to fail for anything except zero offset, one variable with linear bias of 1?
oh, that raises very good questions. I had not thought about it. For now, I think it should just raise an error.
FWIW numpy handles a similar case, bool(np.asarray([0, 1])), with ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous.
At the very least we should probably update the docstring to make the current usage clearer (credit to @pau557 for the suggestion).
#1089 adds support for
and similar.
