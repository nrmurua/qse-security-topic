We now have a convert_to_qasm3() which converts a qasm2 string to a qasm3 string. The next step is instead of simply having circuit_wrapper(qc).transpile("qasm"), we want to differentiate between circuit_wrapper(qc).transpile("qasm2") and circuit_wrapper(qc).transpile("qasm3"). To do this, we may need add another QasmCircuitWrapper class for qasm3. For conversions that start from circuit_wrapper(qasm3_str), for now, we can transpile to qiskit and then proceed as normal, e.g.
