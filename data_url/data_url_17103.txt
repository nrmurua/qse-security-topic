Validation logic defined in qiskit.validation.base is not working properly for marshmallow.fields.DateTime filed.
Any raw date time string (in any format) gets rejected by the validator.
Define sample schema with DateTime field:
Then try to deserialize raw date time string in ISO format:
Result:
Serialize and pass validation of a scheme with DateTime field.
Take a closer look at the implementation of _validate_after_init method in _SchemaBinder class under qiskit.validation.base. It might have a bug where it tries to do post validation on deserialized object i.e. tries to deserialize already deserialized DateTime object.
I'm closing this as out of date since we removed the marshmallow based validation a long time ago and this doesn't really apply anymore (as it never really belonged in terra or the client code).
