It would be useful if the XY gate could be added to the existing circuit library https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html
The use case is for a basis gate for the qiskit transpiler.
Hi @epelofske-LANL, just to clarify: do you mean XY as in Pauli-X on qubit 1 and Pauli-Y on qubit 2 or the R_{XY} rotation gate as in exp(it XY)?
@Cryoris I mean the 2 qubit gate R_{XY}
Hi, if possible, I'd like to work on this!
If the gate is defined as Rxy(theta) = exp(i theta/2 XY), I think the decomposition would be:
Which gives us the matrix:

If it is defined as Rxy(theta) = exp(-i theta/2 XY) (with a negative sign, which I think is more common), I think the decomposition is:
Which gives us the matrix:

Let me know which one is the intended decomposition :)
It should be defined with the minus sign, so option 2 ðŸ˜„ I'll assign you @epelaaez!
The implementation should be pretty similar to the RZX gate (in qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/rzx.py) if you want to have a look.
It should be defined as e^(-i * angle/2 * (XX+YY)/2) (as in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04424.pdf, where the unitary is shown in equation 1 on page 1).
I think Qiskit follows the convention of defining rotation gates as exp(-i theta/2 R) where R is the desired rotation, as you can see for the RZXGate, RXXGate, etc. To get, exp(-i  theta/2  (XX+YY)/2), I think you could do RXX(theta / 2)RYY(theta / 2). And both of these are already in Qiskit's library.
I made the following snippet to make sure this was right.
Both output the following matrix:

As I said, I think the convention is to go with exp(-i theta/2 XY), but if needed I'll do it as exp(-i theta/2  (XX+YY)/2). Any thoughts @Cryoris?
Ok, I see, thanks for referencing the paper @epelofske-LANL! In Qiskit we usually use R_{XY} to denote exp(-i t X \otimes Y) but this is not the gate you're looking for. Maybe XYGate would be the correct name for that since this is what it's called in the paper.
However I don't think the decomposition XY = R_XX R_YY is ideal since that'll use 4 CNOTs. Maybe @ajavadia can help us out for that ðŸ˜„
@Cryoris - This makes sense to call it the XYgate.
@Cryoris, yes, I agree that doing XY = R_XX R_YY directly would be very much not ideal.
@epelofske-LANL do you happen to have any source with the ideal construction of such gate?
@Cryoris @epelaaez
Here are two  references for the XY gate:
https://rsl.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/RSL_Theses/jmcthesis.pdf
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04424.pdf (it is a native gate on Rigetti systems)
Here is an implementation with only two CNOTs (but I am not sure if it is optimal)

Thanks, @epelofske-LANL. Using that as a reference, the circuit would be
Which gives the matrix

This matrix is equal to the one in arXiv:1912.04424 with Î²=0. Does this look good to both of you?
Looks good. Optionally, you could include a negative factor in the angle, this would make XY=RXX*RYY
I would probably not use YGate().power(0.5) but the direct decomposition in native gates as
but other than that it looks good (up to the negative factor @epelofske-LANL mentioned).
Thanks @Cryoris, I'll do that.
For the negative factor, since in the paper it is defined as some phase for some Î², wouldn't it make sense to let the user determine what Î² is? So XYGate would be a two-parameter gate. If this is not necessary, then yes I'll just go with the option to make it XY = RXX RYY. Once this is decided, I'll implement it :)
Adding an option with some default value is definitely a good idea. Since the paper defines XY(theta) = XY(beta=0, theta) I think using 0 as default, as you have right now, makes sense.
Sure, sounds good!
Sorry for the delay, but I've created a draft pull request adding the gate, feel free to leave any comments.
@Cryoris I am not sure about the way I implemented the default value for beta in QuantumCircuit.xy and in XYGate, could you check that out and tell me if I should make any changes? Also, what tests should I create/modify for the new gate?
