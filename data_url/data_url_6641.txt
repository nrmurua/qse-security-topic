I want to do the simulation of error correction code. So I read the manual and play with NoiseAmp.fsx and QECC.fsx. I don't understand the noise model used in NoiseAmp.fsx. Can anyone help me?
Here are several questions:
It really depends on the circuit you're analyzing as to what you should expect.  Make a change to NoiseAmp.fsx where:
is replaced with:
Now you're doing a Hadamard at on both qubits. You'll now see the effect you're expecting after a hard amplitude damping event. Here is the summary at the end of one such run:
Looking around time 352, you see the expected behavior:
See that after the event, the remaining qubit continues to degrade. Now take a look where the second amplitude damping happens (at 486):
I think this is what you were looking for. It all depends on how the qubits were entangled. This is from the noise model used, not necessarily the behavior of the physical system. If you want to be more accurate, I'd use the Kraus operator model demonstrated in Kraus.fsx and documented in the User's Manual on Advanced Models (specifically Channels and POVMs).
