Hello,
i installed correctly the package on Ubuntu 20.04 with Mathematica 12.1. But when i try to run the test it returns:
There appears to be an issue with the way strings are handled in this version of Mathematica. Even though things like testing will fail, many of the functions still appear to work. Namely, CircleTimes and PartialTr.
