Hi!
I'm hoping to get clarity on whether we're able to do patch releases for specific pypi packages, in this case, cirq-ionq
We recently changed to return a more specific 'target' value in our API, which means fe7fe4e needs to be released, or cirq will treat 'qpu.target' jobs as being probabilistic simulation results.
Is it possible to do a patch release with this included?
Feature-request because not sure what to tag this with :)
@MichaelBroughton any more info needed to move forward on this? Thanks for considering it!
Hmmm can you confirm that if you install the v0.14 release branch and then cherry pick this commit in, it is everything we need (no other follow ons needed) ? If that's the case I will do the same and cut a release on the weekend.
Yes, that's right, can confirm
And thank you!!
