Description
DWaveSampler().sample(bqm, num_reads=np.int8(123)) gives an error.
Why np.int8(123)? Occurs in scenarios such as np.linspace(2, 6, 10, dtype=np.int8)[0]
To Reproduce
this will fail with the following error: TypeError: Object of type int8 is not JSON serializable
this will work:
Environment:
@randomir IMO we should migrate this issue to the cloud-client. Unless you think the DWaveSampler should be handling this case?
@arcondello, I agree. Sampling params are just passed down to the QPU solver, and we can handle conversion there.
