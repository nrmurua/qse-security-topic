CI build scripts have become excessively long due to hundreds of warnings being emitted from building the pulse simulator cython files. In some cases this can cause the build to fail due to the log file becoming too large.
These warnings should be suppressed from the build logs.
Disable the offending warnings in the CMake build script for openpulse/cy and openpulse/qutip_lite/cy directories.
