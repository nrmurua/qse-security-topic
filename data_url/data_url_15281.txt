Estimated value can be incorrect when using an Estimator for different observables.
Run this code. Uncomment the Estimator in the loop to see the alternating values it should produce
It should give the right values
This is related to #8725 which cached and matched circuits by id(). The estimator is still doing this for observables and causes issues if Python reuses an id for different operator content.
Oh yeah. Originally it was supposed to have to be passed as Iterable, but we relaxed that restriction introducing run method, which caused the collision. Thanks.
