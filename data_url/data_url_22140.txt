This is
It crashes after about 2 minutes of running that loop.
I am working on ed8edf3. Runtime/ksupport is unaltered from 1ee3f96.
I have not made any attempt to reduce it.
How do I debug?
exception 6 at PC 0x40840490, EA 0x4084406c
That's quite baffling. It's an unaligned access exception, but it's reported at an aligned address.
Anyway what I would do is to apply objdump to ksupport.elf and then see the function in which the problem is. In ksupport specifically we can also use the builtin libunwind to extract a backtrace so let me know if that's not enough and I'll implement that.
i remember you (or someone) reporting that same thing (unaligned access with aligned address reported) a few months ago. what was the issue back then?
I have no recollection of that.
Should I wait for you to reduce the crash (or dissect it at all), or do it myself?
I'll look into it.
Can't reproduce.
May have been old/bad runtime.
