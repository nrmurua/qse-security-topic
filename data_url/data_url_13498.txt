Mitiq currently does not support symmetry-based techniques for quantum error mitigation.
A design document could be added, possibly using a MEP #563, to begin discussing and conceptualize the interface of Mitiq with symmetry-based techniques for quantum error mitigation. These include symmetry verification [1], subspace expansion [2], virtual distillation [3,4]. In any case, even if the outcome of the design document is to just adapt Mitiq to external APIs or do not change at all the code base, a more thorough discussion of such techniques could be made in the documentation.

Since the code design document in the form of a MEP has been created in #599, I am closing this issue.
