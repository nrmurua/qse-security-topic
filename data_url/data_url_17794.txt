When running visualizations that have an interactive mode if you're system meets the requirements we unconditionally use the interactive visualizations. We need to provide an option to let users override this and use the non-interactive visualizations.
@jaygambetta is this what you're looking for?
I think these are the only three functions we have
and i think we also want to have all aspects of them documented.
One thing I just thought of is do we want to deprecate the current default behavior for plot state and plot_histogram where they use the interactive mode if in jupyter and have network connectivity? The fix for this #1229 will add a mode kwarg that will let users select mpl or interactive.
@mtreinish is this for 0.7
Yes, this is going to be fixed in 0.7, it's part of #1229
