QM-cp2k_Sp.inp.txt
I am new to CP2K and I am trying to simulate a system containing ~150 QM atoms. I have manipulated the input file used for CIC tutorial and added my system's prmtop and inpcrd file. The box size was taken from the last line of inpcrd file. The input file used is also attached. I was able to run this tutorial https://www.cp2k.org/howto:biochem_qmmm successfully. But I am getting error while running it for my system. The command used was
mpirun -np 24 cp2k.popt -i QM-cp2k_Sp.inp > QM-cp2k_Sp.out
**ERROR
mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:
Process name: [[41014,1],12]
Exit code:    2**
I think that your question is better asked to the Google user group. The github repository targets the developers.
I am not familiar with the method but your error message is definitely too unspecific. Could you enclose the output files if there are any?
Thanks for your response.
QM-cp2k_Sp.out.txt
I was not sure where to post this query so I thought this could probably be the right place to at least get an idea about the error. The output files are attached.
"CP2K version 6.1", really? I don't think we can help you, the version is too old. You can ask in teh google forum, as suggested above: https://groups.google.com/g/cp2k?hl=it
Thanks.
Apparently, this issue is resolved.
