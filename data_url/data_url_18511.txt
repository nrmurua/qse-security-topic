We should implement a couple of algorithms (perhaps one general-purpose and one specialized to a particular gate-set) that target a gate-set suitable for use as a "logical" native gate set in some fault-tolerant scheme. This would significantly widen the interested audience in quilc.
This one is especially aesthetically pleasing to me: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03888.pdf . It remains (mildly) flexible about the native gate set, and it involves some basic algebraic number theory.
Of course, an implementation of Solovay-Kitaev would also be welcome, and a much easier place to start. :)
This is adjacent to #191, which will be covered by #432 .
