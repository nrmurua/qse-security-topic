MLTomo requires the observables to be POVMS.  If we're hacking in Hermeticity,, we should try to do the same for other requirements in MLTomo: positive-semidefinite and trace >1.
There are currently no checks in Qlab.jl for these conditions or ways to pick the closest CPTP obs.
So we currently build the effects from the cal data.  Not sure this is the best way to go about it.
