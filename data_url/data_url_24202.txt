Add any missing components to the Circuit Library docs

such as transmon_pocket_cl is not in there. Let's add all the available components

@JeremyDrysdale-ibm   perhaps for Sagarika when she add her new qubit design or a good test project for the interns, @ThomasGM4 @marcolincs  to create and test all the components and add them in here?

Do we want all components covered, just primary parents (eg. transmon with flux line another separate or just transmon pocket), or just basic subset of common components used?
