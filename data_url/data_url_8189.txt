Hi.
I was wondering while playing with the permutational invariant solver, if there is any way to customize your Lindblad in the dicke basis. I meas, suppose I have a collapse of the form, J_+ + J_-. The class Dicke does not include any flexibility a part from the collective emission/pumping and the corresponding individual emission/pumping.
Or am I missing something?
Thanks
