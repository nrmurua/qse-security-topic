If I use a device that supports both CZ and XY gates, e.g. (currently) Aspen-4, and if I provide explicit commands to use either the CZ or XY gate, then the compiler knows to use those gates. For example, CZ 0 1 compiles to CZ 0 1 and XY(0.3) 0 1 compiles to XY(0.3) 0 1.
For generic programs that may not be written in terms of the native gate set, the compiler doesn't seem to make use of the XY gate. For example, the following QAOA circuit borrowed from https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04424:
compiles to a circuit that uses only CZ and no XYs, even though the paper claims that there are more optimal choices of the compilation if one uses both those gates.
