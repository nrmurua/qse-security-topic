The following code prints ['u3', 'u2', ..]
The only definition was id, circuit.definitions should only have [id].
The Unroller uses a "default QuantumCircuit" (qiskit/unroll/_circuitbackend.py:40) meaning a QuantumCircuit with all the standard definitions. I think a possible solution would be to create QuantumCircuit with an empty set of definitions and extended later (or at construction time) based on the context that it was created.
again is this an issue of the parser of the unroller.
This issue is still valid. It seems that the root of the issue is that a QuantumCircuit object is created with a fully populated definitions property (renaming to reflect that fact):
okey.. at some point we over corrected this:
but...
So, I'm closing this and opening a new one.
