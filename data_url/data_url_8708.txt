Help!
I installed Simulaqron on my Unbuntu 20.04.03 Desktop system following the instructions provided on the Getting Started page located here: https://softwarequtech.github.io/SimulaQron/html/GettingStarted.html.
The "pip3 install simulaqron" runs without errors.
However, when run "simulaqron -h", I obtain the following errors:
grimaila$ /home/grimaila/.local/bin/simulaqron-h
Traceback(most recent call last):
File "/home/grimaila/.local/bin/simulaqron",line 5, in 
from simulaqron.simulaqron import cli
File "/home/grimaila/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/simulaqron/simulaqron.py",line 234, in 
@click.argument('value', type=click.Choice([b.value for b in SimBackend.value]))
File "/usr/lib/python3.8/enum.py", line 384, in getattr
raise AttributeError(name) from None
AttributeError:value
I also tried multiple other flavors of Linux (Centos 7, Unbuntu 18.04, Unbuntu 20.04, Debian 11) and I also tried setting up a Docker image using the method presented here: https://veriqloud.com/simulaqron/.
Unfortunately, I obtained the same error message as above.
Can you help resolve this error or provide a link to a virtual machine I could download?
Is there a recommended version of Linux that you would recommend to eliminate the errors?
Thanks,
Michael
@grimaila there seemed to indeed be a bug, should be fixed by #278
