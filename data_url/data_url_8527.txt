Here is a screenshot that demonstrates the problem:

(running on Linux, built from source this morning)
Did you grab the latest version from git?  I cant seem to reproduce the error. Perhaps something has changed in diags since scipy 0.15
The git version matches the latest, so I am a bit confused. We have unit tests for expm that work fine and I pulled the latest version here at work and everything works. I also couldnt find any changes to diags in the scipy changelog.
Maybe remove the old qutip in the sitepackages dir and reinstall.
I'll give that a shot. Are there any other hidden dependencies that could be at fault?
It's worth noting that this does not occur on the same system with QuTiP 3.1.0
Have you tried running the qutip tests? Do those fail?  Again, I cannot reproduce the issue.
Closing this now since no response.
