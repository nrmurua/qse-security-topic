Quick understanding question: (Why) Do we truly still (need to?) maintain the 'curve ID' in the oqs-template/generate.yml file? If I understand it right, those 'nids' have no relationship whatsoever with the true NIDs (which are generated by the crypto/objects/obj_mac.num generator in combination with the openssl make generate_crypto_objects script) and which in all other places are referenced by #defines, right?
--> Anything speaking against dropping them (in favour of using the true NIDs)? As the structure of openssl has changed (evp_int.h, asn1_int.h gone, ssl_locl.h renamed) since the last time the tool was run, we anyway have to touch more things than just generate.yml....
@dstebila The closing happened automatically on Merge.... Should we keep this open until HQC is fixed and integrated?

The NIDs in obj_mac.num are OpenSSL-internal identifiers. The curve IDs in the generate.yml file are TLS 1.3 (private-use) identifiers, and are referenced here and here for example.
@xvzcf Thanks for the pointers. The first use I was aware of, the second eluded me. I'd then consider this PR truly closed.
