Description
Using EmbeddingComposite I get back samples for what look like auxiliary variables
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
No auxiliary variables
Environment
Additional Context
Also, the solution (the samples for the problem variables) looks wrong -- low energy for invalid solutions
This is resolved by
if you look at the generated bqm from the linear in the way you are
you'll see that the variable 'x0' is interpreted as an interaction between variables 'x' and '0'. One way to see this would be to change variable 'x0' to 'x10', in this case an error will be raised
versus
Makes sense. Thank you!
