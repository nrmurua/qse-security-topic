Almost all of these are being removed from Qiskit 1.0 - the only two that are remaining are the two base classes from qiskit.quantum_info, which maybe should be documented, but they're funny. They're not really meant to be user subclassable, they're kind of just implementation details of qiskit.quantum_info.
Ah okay, let's close this then. Thanks for the context!
We reference them in the migration guides, which is where we noticed them. But this is fine with me to not document them.
