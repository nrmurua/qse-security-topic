is * the tensor product operator? So what is the Kron operator?
* is the usual multiplication operator. kron is the tensor product.
I try make this in C++:
$\operatorname{CNOT}(H \otimes I)\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle$
Appear here:https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/24181/epr-pairs-bell-states-preparation-circuit-in-sympy
Can make help?
ket result = gt.CNOT*kron(gt.H, gt.Id2)*kron(psi1, psi2);
Or, more simply for the Bell state, ket bell = gt.CNOT*kron(gt.H, gt.Id2)*00_ket;
How know when use multiply, and when use Kron?
Thanks you
