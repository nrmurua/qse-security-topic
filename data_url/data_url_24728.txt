For very long pulses there might be numerical errors when calculating the pulse duration in samples.
For now I will use fractions.Fraction as a type for times. If we need the performance there is the possibility to switch to gmpy2.mpq.
Should be solved now.
gmpy2.mpq gives a speedup of a few seconds for very long and complicated pulses.
