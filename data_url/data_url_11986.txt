Many (if not all) repos in qiskit github org has renamed master branch to main branch, we should do that in this repo as well. I am not sure about the implications and the steps to do that though.
Related to Qiskit/qiskit#1493
I think it is not necessary to rename the branchs
This repository is being archived very soon in favor of qiskit-terra, so this is no longer relevant.
