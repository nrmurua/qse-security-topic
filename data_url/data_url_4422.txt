Defining a Pauli observable in the two following ways the matrices are different.
Is this expected?
Does the range should start from 0?
Does the range should start from 0?
I wanted to reproduce the simple 1 qubit non interacting Pauli Z.  I think a better form of the code follows:
In particular, I am puzzled by the form of h.matrix. I expected it to be in the same form of h1.
Just a quick remark, our hamiltonians.Z(1) is defined as $H = - Z_0$ therefore you see a negative sign and you have to introduce a pauli_symbol = - Z(0) if you want to reproduce the previous definition.

Thank you. Now all is clear.
