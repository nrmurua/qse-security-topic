From the finance tutorials, concretely the fixed income pricing notebook, when running the following code after previously executing all the cells above.
result = ae.run(quantum_instance = BasicAer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')) 
The error is :
~/anaconda3/envs/Qiskit0.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/qiskit_aqua/components/initial_states/custom.py in _convert_to_basis_gates(gates)
108         else:
109             if isinstance(gates, RYGate):
--> 110                 return U3Gate(gates.param[0], 0, 0, gates.qargs[0])
111             elif isinstance(gates, RZGate):
112                 return U1Gate(gates.param[0], gates.qargs[0])
AttributeError: 'RYGate' object has no attribute 'param'
Once you have downloaded the qiskit-tutorials folders, find the notebook at:
qiskit-tutorials/qiskit/aqua/finance/fixed_income_pricing.ipynb
Execute the cell of the  notebook , when running Amplitude estimation, the compilation of initial state fails.
No errors  should appear when preparing the initial/custom state
Are you running from a cloned version of qiskit-terra from master branch on the repo? Since the last official release on Pypi the name param and been changed to params and would cause the above failure.
The tutorials are coded to work with the official released versions of qiskit and may not work when run from the latest code in master. I just ran the referenced notebook after installing the official releases from Pypi and it completed without error.
OK, so my qiskit-terra was version 0.8.0  on my conda environment whichis not the latest official release , I don't quite remember cloning the latest master branch from Terra however.
Downgrading the qiskit-terra package to 0.7.0  has worked! I've re-run the notebook and everything worked like charm. Thank you!
