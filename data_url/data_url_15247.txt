The below code will reproduce the error pasted above
My understanding is, that the VF2 layout method tries to score the layout based on average error rates, but fails because instructions do not have properties hence no average error rate is available.
Note that the properties for CXGate instructions are specified as None, which is a valid value and indicates that any properties are not available. The documentation of qiskit.transpiler.Target.add_instruction says Properties are optional for any instruction implementation, if there are no InstructionProperties available for the backend the value can be None..
Note, that optimization_level=2 is important here. The error does not happen with lower optimization levels.
I am not well aware of the full philosophy behind the design of VF2 layout method, but I think at least one of the following two options should be happening instead of the error pasted above:
No response
Yeah, this is a bug VF2Layout, should operate even if there are no error rates present in the target. In those cases it just shouldn't do the heuristic scoring and just pick the first isomorphic subgraph it finds.
Just for posterity the VF2PostLayout pass is different and does require scores, but in that case it still shouldn't raise it should just exit if no error rates are present.
