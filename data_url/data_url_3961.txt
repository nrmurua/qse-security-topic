After compiling an algorithm in OpenQL with cc-light as compiler back-end the QASM version is not the pure cQASMv1.0
For instance, OpenQL exports:
but the proper cQASM notation would be:
Most of the files that I'm using can be found the qbench repo. Specially, the configuration file that I'm using and the file of the example code
I propose to add an option "output_qasm_version" which by default is "1" (or "1.0"?) and could be set to "2" by Daniel and which parameterizes qasm printing in OpenQL; with "1", the output is unchanged from the current one
@Gonaco which branch did you try? I asked you (in the email) to test it on enh/libqasm-integration. on this branch for a simple test i get the following output:
and the following for the scheduled one:
I have modified this issue to address cQASM v1.0 specification first. I will create a separate issue for cQASM v2.0 support.
