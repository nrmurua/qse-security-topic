That's wonderful. @sbourdeauducq, are you paying for anaconda? I really hope so, because then there's at least a tiny chance anyone at all would care about this.
I filed this as ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues#490 but they have three hundred open issues, some dating back to 2013.
Nevermind, the entirety of https://conda.anaconda.org/ is down. This is an upstream issue.
It work. Thanks for the quick save Peter.
But not out of the woods all together. By "it works" I mean the conda install works. But now it can't find the bitfiles.
That's expected after #146. I will update the manual shortly.
So far I suggest doing conda install artiq-pipistrello-nist_qc1 artiq-kc705-nist_qc1 artiq-kc705-nist_qc2 to get the old behavior.
No go.
Hm, seems to be a bug in conda's dependency resolver. I can reproduce it locally, though no idea why it happens or what can we do...
Conda has a funny way of specifying specific builds. It's not officially documented as far as I could find. The following permits me to choose a specific ARTIQ build.
And to install a package with a specific dependency override...
The bug is conda/conda#1740. I've tried working around it in f384142 but that didn't work as it just sends conda into infinite recursion. I am looking at other solutions now.
My patch also doesn't work because if the artiq package is not already installed, resolution fails. There is also the problem that there is no public conda recipe to build conda, and my quick attempt at it results in bin/conda being deleted for some reason I have not quite figured out.
Conda was fixed.
