The marginal_counts method acts on a Result by marginalizing the counts in the ExperimentResultData object. It does act on the counts field, but not in the memory field.
A minimal example:
The results in the fields counts and memory from  data are not consistent.
The memory field should be updated by the marginal_counts method. (or as a fallback: the memory field should be made empty)
