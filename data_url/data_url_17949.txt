According to #854, qobj emitted in Qiskit has to validate twice. One validation goes against the general Qobj schema. The second validation will go against a backend-specific one.
I think the idea here is validate against the general qobj schema, pull the backend schema using backend.schema() and validate against that.
^ @dcmckayibm yes.
Closing after the meta #851.
