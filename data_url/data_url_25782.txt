We also need to make sure that we are providing image builds for all supported architectures.
Previously, for the main covalent image, this was done with buildx. For example, https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/pull/426/files#diff-6a2c1c7dcb3282310b9ec03f86840a3e867bece97b538e65d142cfc9b99b4ff8L65
buildx might be the right way to do it for the service images or there might be a better way, but either way we need to make sure it's done right
re: buildx, see also #27
