The peek gate can give per-write conditional probabilities, but seeing intermediate partial quantum states would also be useful.
Bloch sphere display and density matrix displays are in, though currently the glsl code to power them is in flux in my head so they just display the probability. That's more of a circuit computation issue though; the gates themselves will work without modification.
