Hi @kcLin2708 , I am taking a look. Also, I made a minor edit to your original comment for formatting, hope that's ok!
It actually appears that the error appears when it's trying to install numpy before trying to install dimod.
I am surprised that it's installing the source distributions of numpy/dimod rather than the wheels though. You should be on a OS/Python supported by both. Can you tell me your setuptools version?
I am also wondering if https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26304916/mingw-gcc-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command might be helpful.
Hi Alexander,
Thank you for your quick reply. I tried to install numpy in venv but still get almost the same error. I suppose this problem is due to my windows environment. I'll try to debug it, thanks!
Hi @kcLin2708 , were you able to resolve this? If so can we close this issue?
Yes, you can close it. Thanks!
