qupulse generated an exception when trying to render a simple pulse with repetitions. The exception seems to be caused by rounding errors. A minimal example:
This generated the following error:
When setting the number of repetitions lower (e.g. 8), the exception does not occur.
Might be related to #176

works. I'll look into it.
The value is off by 10e-8 which seems very large
I have a fix which takes the problem and puts it somewhere else because the check which throws the error is not done in SequenceWaveform.get_sample as it uses Waveform.unsafe_sample internally.
I think the error happens now here:
A problem can occur if sample_times[indices]-np.float64(time) has a big enough numeric error to make the searchsorted call obsolete.
The test still passes if I replace unsafe_sample with get_sampled.
