I've been running into issues with multi valued parameters.
i.e. in the magnet driver, I want a fld parameter that returns and sets x, y, z values, reading the values works just fine with the Anything validator, but setting failes.
For reference, something like this:
There are at least two issues here:
The multi valued parameters no longer have a name, and a _vals attribute anymore.
If I do
It kindof works, but at least the docstring and units is broken (and I have to use the Anything validator)
2. The validators only work on single-valued inputs, not on multi-values.
I also encountered a command in which I need to pass two arguments. It would be nice if this was included in the functionality of the Parameter class.
@MerlinSmiles let's look at this when you are back here, it seems like  that can be fixed creating a custom parameter instead of the standardparameter that add_parameter uses by default.
related to #378, #166 and #498
I believe this was solved along with #166
