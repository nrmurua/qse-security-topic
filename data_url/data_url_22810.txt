I tried to hack the pyEPR/core_distributed_analysis.py file to compute the current across an external resistor as a crude attempt to model an RSCJ Josephson junction with a nonzero normal resistance.
could be replaced by something like this
Notes on the experimental capacitance feature: It is set to a constant (2 fF) in master pyEPR/core_distributed:
Yes,Cjs[junc_name] = 2E-15  should be an optional property of the junction properties, I agree.
The voltage is in parallel, so all the voltages are equal across RLC, but if there is an R, the R will such some of the energy and current out
