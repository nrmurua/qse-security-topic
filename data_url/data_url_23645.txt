In PR #859 new variables ._valid_values are added to the String validator. The default validator object qcodes.utils.validators.String() now has a size of 1 GB.
The AWG5014 driver uses the String validator four times, so the driver now is 4GB. If one reloads the driver 8 GB is occupied, which crashes a system with limited amount of RAM.

I am not sure how the ._valid_values field is used, but I think it does not make a lot of sens for a String. Can we set the _valid_values field to None as a solution?

Woops... Luckily the fix is straightforward.
I can even disclose that the _valid_values are not currently used for anything, but the great plan is to eventually use them to auto-generate simulated instruments from an instrument's parameters.
