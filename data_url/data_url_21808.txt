In the manual at https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-master/installing.html under "Configuring the Core Device" the instructions read:
$ artiq_coreconfig write -f idle_kernel idle.elf
and
$ artiq_coreconfig write -s rtio_clock i  # internal clock (default)
$ artiq_coreconfig write -s rtio_clock e  # external clock
as well as several others.
Every instance of
artiq_coreconfig
should be replaced with
artiq_coremgmt config
on this page as well as on https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-master/core_device.html?highlight=artiq_coreconfig
