I attempted to recreate this animation of the Bloch sphere using the instructions in the Plotting on the Bloch Sphere/Directly Generating an Animation section of the user guide. Using Matplotlib 3.4.3 gives a warning,
MatplotlibDeprecationWarning: Axes3D(fig) adding itself to the figure is deprecated since 3.4. Pass the keyword argument auto_add_to_figure=False and use fig.add_axes(ax) to suppress this warning. The default value of auto_add_to_figure will change to False in mpl3.5 and True values will no longer work in 3.6.  This is consistent with other Axes classes.
The movie is produced fine. If I use Matplotlib 3.7.1, the movie file contains a white background and no drawn Bloch sphere; see here.
This issue appears to be fixed by modifying the line ax = Axes3D(fig, azim=-40, elev=30) in the example to ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection="3d", elev=30, azim=-40).
