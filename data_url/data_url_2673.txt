Only need to support exponents that return Clifford results. For example, cirq.CliffordGate.Z**0.5 should be cirq.CliffordGate.Z_sqrt.
@Strilanc Done? 
Ah, good catch @vtomole . Renamed issue to focus on the specific missing case.
Forgot to add "closes" on #1431. Please close.
Closed per vtomole.  Also added on assignee, since he did all the work!!!
