Do you plan to implement Schrieffer–Wolff Transformation? I refer to methods in [1] to study the superconducting circuits as effective Hamiltonians. I use it often to connect superconducting circuits to algorithms formulated on a computational basis in terms of Pauli matrices.
If you think the SWT matches your strategy of scQubits, I would consider contributing it to the code.

Thanks for reaching out and your suggestion @tibidabo.
At this very  moment we have no plans to implement SW transformations within scqubits. At first glace I would think this is maybe a job for some other, separate package?
I will close this for now, but if something changes on our side, we will keep this in in mind.
