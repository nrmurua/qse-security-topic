Within the measurement context manager, add_result fails for large ArrayParameter. For instance an array with shape (10, 1000001) works but an array with shape (16, 1000001) yields the error sqlite3.DataError: string or blob too big during the execution of flush_data_to_database.
The data should be flushed to the database without error.

Side note: having 3 parameters is probably not necessary to reproduce the error. In my specific case it is necessary because the oscilloscope's buffer will not store more than 16 million samples.
