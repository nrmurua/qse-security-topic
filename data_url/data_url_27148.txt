Right now the overlay is still a bare overlay, which is applied to the system installed nixpkgs set. However, this is problematic since it requires a matching version of nixpkgs. Locally, I do this by carefully hand selecting nixpkgs/NixOS-QChem versions from my Hydra builds. This is not very user-friendly and potentially error-prone.
A better version could be:
This would allow for a sensible default, which is guaranteed to work but does not allow for further modifications via additional overlays. If one needs a more customized set, e.g. replace MPI, then one still use the overlay directly via overlay.nix
Sounds like a very good idea. This avoids problems as in #111 (which NixOS-QChem still has with recent nixpkgs-unstable, as the QCEngine fix hasn't propagated, yet).
Keeping the overlay.nix still allows to combine everything on demand when using Niv or similar.
