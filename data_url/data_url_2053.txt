and it is no longer a PauliString
ps == eval(repr(ps)) is True though, which is perhaps all that matters.
If you try to include a single-qubit pauli string as part of an object for the json_serialization test it doesn't work because it compares jsonify(ps) == jsonify(eval(repr(ps)))
Should cirq.testing.assert_equivalent_repr also test repr(val) == repr(eval(repr(val)))?
AFAIK Python types by themselves aren't expected to be round-trippable.
SingleQubitPauliStringGateOperation inherits from PauliString, so it is technically still a pauli string.
Is this still an issue?
the behavior has not changed (I just ran the snippet provided)
