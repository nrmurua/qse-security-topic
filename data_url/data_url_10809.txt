Description
When embedding some QUBOs using minorminer, we get the mentioned error. By trial and error, increasing the value of solver_limit to 10000 prevents the error for appearing.
To Reproduce
Please download a MWE from https://megaupload.nz/meWbFdj2bb/minimal-qubo-model_zip and run solver_qbsolv.py changing use_minorminer=False to True in the last line. Other QUBOs saved in the data folder also have the same problem.
Expected behavior
Theoretically, the embedding should either fail or succeed. Instead, it succeeds but complaints about matching. Unexpectedly, the solver_limit parameter affects this behavior.
Environment:
Unfortunately we can't/shouldn't download files to run locally. Would you be able to create a mcve to post here?
This has been open for a year without update; please submit a proper mcve or I'll close this ticket.
Hi Carlos,
I'm not sure how you were accessing the system.  I'm told that if you have a leap account and you haven't linked it to your github account, you're eligible for additional time.  If this doesn't help, please email me at boothby@dwavesys.com and I'll try and sort something out internally.
Thanks!
