Current lscheduler depends on gates being referentially different, because it uses an EQL hash table. This has led to at least one difficult-to-track bug.
Either make it so that the objects don't need to be referentially different, or do the work to make them distinct automatically, or error if you try to do some kind of operation (like add to the lscheduler when something already exists)
My preference is for “(or something)” over the title.
I think I agree; the hash tables will be hard to replace.
