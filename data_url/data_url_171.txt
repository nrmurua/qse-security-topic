This is a proposal to add the ability to specify an initial state when declaring a qubit.
We add new constructors to qubit and qvector to take a initializer_list or vector<complex<double>> that is $2^N$ double values in length and where $N$ is the number of qubit in the qvector object. (qubit would be restricted to 2 double values.
New constructors
Some examples in a CUDA Quake kernel might be the following.
New builder method
When using the builder the builder would be called as in the following.
The Python builder would be similar as in the following.
