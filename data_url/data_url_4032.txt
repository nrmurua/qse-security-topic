In the file openql.i docstrings are provided for many of the python functions. On my system (ubuntu 16.04) these do not result in docstrings in openql.py. It seems that the issue is that the openql.i is case sensitive. Changing
fixes the issue.  Why are the docstrings provided in openql.i? We could also document the openql.h and use %feature("autodoc", "2") (or similar)?

@peendebak I can confirm that I still have this issue. I see that @imranashraf made a commit that should address this. I'll try that out when the develop and the spin qubit branch get merged.
