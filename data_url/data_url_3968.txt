As found in the  hardware_config_cc_light.json, the qubit number is incorrect for some CNOT instructions:

The same bug might appear in other JSON files.  Is this a bug in the PycQED script?
@AdriaanRol
@gtaifu , I have checked the config that is being used in PycQED. This problem is not present there.
Additionally, I am certain this is not a bug with PycQED as the CNOT instruction can not be directly implemented on our hardware. Instead it is implemented using a "gate decomposition" :
If it is not a but in PycQED, then we should update the configuration file as used in OpenQL. @imranashraf @Nader-Khammassi
sure @gtaifu
Done in PR #183
Further found that the connection_map for edges is incorrect in the file hardware_config_cc_light.json:

For CC-Light, the largest qubit number should be 6, instead of 16.
The correct connection_map for CC-Light should be:
@jvansomeren , thanks for your explanation quite a lot! That is very helpful and answers my question!
