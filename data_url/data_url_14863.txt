The GateDirection transpiler pass has an unnecessary check that input circuits only contain 1 register:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/qiskit/transpiler/passes/utils/gate_direction.py#L328-L332
raises
If the check is removed it works as you would expect:
Remove the incorrect check for a single register from the GateDirection.run method
