Requires that the user skip errors with "s" and run twice to make sure the ToC is built correctly. Would be great to fix those two issues if possible.
I was just revisiting this, and I can't get the PDF docs to build at all in a clean ubuntu container. Will look into this and try to make it more robust.
I want to maybe leave this one for future events and focus more on CI related issues for 0.6. Bumping.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
