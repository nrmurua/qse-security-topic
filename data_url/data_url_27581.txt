Because fmt is much faster than Boost.Format.
Although I rewrote bra in the fmt branch, it counldn't successfully compiled with C++03 compile options in my workstation and in K.
In my workstation, I got errors like;
This macro FMT_MAYBE_UNUSED would be defined if a macro __has_cpp_attribute is defined and #if __has_cpp_attribute(maybe_unused).
Possibly this is a bug of GCC/libstdc++? (gcc's version is 7.2.0)
In K, errors are reported while reading /opt/FJSVXosDevkit/sparc64fx/target/usr/include/math.h. This is very strange because I have never seen such errors when I simply use <cmath>. I have no idea to solve this problem.
I keep the branch fmt as is, and don't merge it into master.
Because the present version of braket reuqires C++11, we can use {fmt} library now.
