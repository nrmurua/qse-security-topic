I wanted to run PennyLane's notebook "Quantum transfer learning":
I tried it and it works quite fine, when using dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=n_qubits) as device, so PennyLane's default device.
However, if I test it on an actual IBM machine (e.g. ibm_cairo) it does not work or runs for days.
The queue time is not the problem may be rather some other issues. I also tested it on some of the other IBM backends.
But the result was all the same.
When calling the train_model command quite at the end of the notebook, it arises the following UserWarning:
Maybe this is in some sense the reason for it, but I do not know.
I want to get something similar to the paper Transfer learning in hybrid classical-quantum neural networks, where they showed it with the ibmqx4 backend and an execution time of 26 seconds for the full dataset.
I would expect a longer execution time due to the queue and the execution of the circuit on the backends themselves. I expect some similar results as I get on the qasm_simulator or some fake backends. But not the error message showed above in every execution.
No response
The bug can be fixed by updating Pennylane and Pennlane-qiskit to the version 0.21.0 instead of the previous used 0.18.0
