When running ipykernel >= 6.0.0 (latest at the time of writing is ipykernel==6.0.3) on Jupyter Notebooks (also in Jupyter Lab) displaying any matplotlib figure using Qiskit (a Quantum Circuit or a visualization of an output) the output is displayed twice. This doesn't seem to happen when running an example of matplotlib in the same notebook.
To display the figures only once.
N/A
Thanks for the report.  This is due to changes in the interaction between matplotlib and ipykernel new in version 6.0.  There is now a new package called matplotlib_inline which provides the integration between the two, and it registers itself as a different backend.  We weren't accounting for it, so our usual code that handles the de-duplication didn't run.  Should be fixed by #6890.
A quick workaround that sometimes works for me is to add a semicolon after your call to draw, eg., circuit.draw('mpl');
