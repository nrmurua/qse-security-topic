Hello,
I don't know why but I can't use  CPHASE in simulaqron, with (at least) projectq backend. Indeed, the code:
Fails on last line with error AttributeError: 'qubit' object has no attribute 'CPHASE'... According to https://softwarequtech.github.io/SimulaQron/html/UsefulCommands.html#qubit, it should work no?
Any idea why it's failing?
Hi @tobiasBora! There was a typo in the docs, the methods are cphase and cnot. This is now fixed, see https://softwarequtech.github.io/CQC-Python/useful_commands.html#qubit and the api.
