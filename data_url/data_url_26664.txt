virial%pv_exc = virial%pv_exc - virial%pv_xc
the undefined variable virial%pv_xc is referenced.
do you maybe meant "uninitialized" ?
Fixed via #1309.
I still get access to undefined variable virial%pv_xc.
In my opinion the origin of the bug is in xc.F lines 122 and 1064
where the  INTENT should be INOUT.
I remind you that INTENT(OUT) undefines the formal argument and the associated actual argument.
@vzecca thanks for double checking. You seem to have a very good understanding of this problem. Maybe you could just prepare a pull request?
It's not me, but I am using an excellent tool as the NAG nagfor compiler.
I do not know git enough to use it in a professional way, so I better leave it to people
that knows it better.
What I can say is that cp2k makes a liberal use of INTENT(OUT) also because
gfortran does not undefine the actual argument. The day gfortran will strictly obey the Fortran standard cp2k will probably break here and there.
Better to prevent than to cure.
Fixed via #1333.
