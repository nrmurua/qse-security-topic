For perspective how slow this is, in dimod 0.9/0.10, using AdjVectorBQM:
Ok - I did some digging. The performance regression comes from the custom iterators that were implemented in #818 and #827. It's not too surprising that they are slower than std::vector<std::pair<int, float>>::iterator but the performance hit is pretty rough. Measured on my system with g++

I think there is some low-hanging performance fruit to pick
I guess this partially explains dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client#487 as well.
Indeed, though in that case the python object creation has more of a (constant) effect. E.g.
the difference is
not insignificant, but not quite as bad as in energy calculation which is done entirely at the cython level.
