The Phaser upconverter phase-frequency detector is not configured at the frequency targeted by the hardware design.
Phaser was designed targeting a phase-frequency detector clock of 62.5 MHz. This frequency should be kept high to keep phase noise low. However, the current default is a 6 MHz phase-frequency detector clock.
Phaser defaults to a 125 MHz clock from Kasli, instead of an external reference. The phase-frequency detector should default to 62.5 MHz.
Default to rdiv = 2.
To keep the calibration clock within it's 1 MHz spec, we will also need cal_clk_sel = 0b1110  (DIV64)

As discussed, the user needs to investigate and tune PLL parameters depending on the application. The current default ones are mostly just the ones Greg found to simply work.
