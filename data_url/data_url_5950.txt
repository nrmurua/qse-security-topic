Before being interpreted, a schedule should be filtered to only include channels acting exclusively on the qubits in the model. I think it makes sense to tackle this after the configurable backends PR is in, as it will be easier/make more sense to handle this there.
(As an aside: the model itself is already "filtered" to only include the specified qubits, and this needs to be done for the schedules.)
