The current (20211101) version of Falcon supports three different signature formats. Currently, we intend to support the "padded" format, which has fixed-length signatures. (As of writing, we don't actually do that and neither does PQClean: see #1561 and PQClean/PQClean#523.) It would be nice to support both "compressed" and "padded" formats in liboqs, and possibly the "constant time" format as well.
More detail on formatting from the Falcon reference implementation:
127  * There are three formats for signatures:
128  *
129  *   - COMPRESSED: this is the default format, which yields the shortest
130  *     signatures on average. However, the size is variable (see below)
131  *     though within a limited range.
132  *
133  *   - PADDED: this is the compressed format, but with extra padding bytes
134  *     to obtain a fixed size known at compile-time. The size depends only
135  *     on the degree; the FALCON_SIG_PADDED_SIZE macro computes it. The
136  *     signature process enforces that size by restarting the process
137  *     until an appropriate size is obtained (such restarts are uncommon
138  *     enough that the computational overhead is negligible).
139  *
140  *   - CT: this is a fixed-size format, which furthermore allows
141  *     constant-time processing with regard to the signature value and
142  *     message data. This is meant for uncommon situations in which
143  *     the signed data is secret but of low entropy, and the public key
144  *     is not actually public. The CT format is larger than the
145  *     COMPRESSED and PADDED formats.
