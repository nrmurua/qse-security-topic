Examples:
U2 has the frames both before the gate
U3 has not frames and only a single pulse

There's also no id gate in the fake backend
can you use backend = qiskit.test.mock.FakeBurlington()?
This contains a snapshot of Burlington's config/properties/defaults.. so should be correct.
I think we should discontinue the Fake2QPulse and Fake3QPulse backends which are constructed manually.
Ok, I'll test it out
I think we should discontinue the Fake2QPulse and Fake3QPulse backends which are constructed manually.
I think this would be fine. Is this the approach circuits took for implementing tests that required a backend? My only worry is that as devices change Burlington might become unavailable and as we added features / change the package we might have to change all of the tests reference backend.
FakeBurlington worked well.
