This addition allows RPCs from the core device which do not require a return value from the master/worker to return immediately, without incurring the cost of a network round trip plus latencies associated with the master/worker processes. This frees the core device kernel CPU to process further code, reducing experimental dead times.
Let's call those "background RPCs" instead. There should be some error reporting, and nothing should be "forgotten".
Needs testing:
All done, tested, and documented.
