I would like to understand why it is required to have the submit function in the basejob. I notice this in needed in the  https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/terra/creating_a_provider.ipynb and i am not sure we should require it.
basically, i see why we have it as in the backend run we create a job instance and then submit the job  to be run. But what I don't get is why can the backend.run start the job and then once it has been started it creates the job instance.
Basically i see we do this following
I would prefer to have
I see that we put a lock by having it such that if the job has an id then it can't be submitted again. But this requires the backend provider to have this coded into them.  What happens if the provider does not or I remove the id then I can rerun it. Since this is a job method that is displayed to the user i think we should rethink it.
This makes a bit more sense from the stand point that a backend does in fact run the job, and the job instance is just a ref for this.
We already discussed this in #1046 and we agreed #1046 (comment) the submit action should be in the backend and the job should be no more than a container. Should we change it for 0.8.0?
@jaygambetta any update?
I'm closing this as out of date. The submit() method isn't needed and is duplicated with run(), it's slated to be removed in the next version of the abstract job interface (it was only left in JobV1 for backwards compatibility with BaseJob)
