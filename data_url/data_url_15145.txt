The Qiskit Terra API Reference list (Qiskit Terra API Reference) does not include Circuit Library (https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html). It used to be linked from the sidebar but now it should be there.
Go to Qiskit Terra API Reference page https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/terra.html and try to find Circuit Library
Circuit Library (https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html) should be listed in Qiskit Terra API Reference page (https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/terra.html)
