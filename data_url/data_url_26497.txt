Dear developer,
Hi, I'm calculating some MGGA functionals and found XC term is not applied when the alpha_beta_gamma value of the cell is not 90 90 90 degrees.
My input is below and if I change
But if I just run the input below, I get
Exchange-correlation energy:                                  0.00000000000000
which seems like XC term is not considered at all.
I'm not sure if this is a bug or if something strange thing happened to me when I'm installing the cp2k...
Thanks
Suhwan

I cannot reproduce your result, E(xc) = 0, with your input using the current CP2K release version 2022.1. E(xc) is -4.24195 Hartree.

Dear Prof. Matthias Krack,
Thanks for testing. I also tested this with another cluster and found that MGGA works fine. Something seems wrong with installing in the previous cluster... And this is weird because all other things work fine but MGGA.
Thank you for the help.
This issue was resolved when I installed all packages using --install-all using install_cp2k_toolchain.sh.
