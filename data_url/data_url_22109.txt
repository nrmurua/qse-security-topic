Testing SAWG absolute/relative phase modes. I see undesired oscillation.
Here's what I see with scope triggered on ttl_sma.

Is this an implication of FIR filters?
Most likely a balun/cable/termination/filter/scope effect. Try smaller amplitude, longer/shorter cable, termination at scope, probe actual DAC output etc. c.f. #742
Switched to using 1 GS/s old school LeCroy 9354AM.
Still looking at SMA output of the prototype board. I observe strong nonlinear behavior for small changes in waveform parameters. Same program as above but with the following changes.
Compare scope traces for two phase jumps. This is too nonlinear to be balun/cable/termination/filter/scope.


Vary the phase in a loop.

The sharp nonlinearity persists for some phases while phase looping when amplitude is 0.8 but is gone altogether when amplitude is  0.78.
Ok. Looks like the HBF is clipping. Does it also do that if you jump the phase of the DUC (phase0)?
Here's my test code for sweeping phase0.
I do not see the sharp non-linearity observed for phase1.
@jordens Do you have enough information to address this Issue?
Yes.
TL;DR: The FIR interpolator before the DUC overshoots. That is correct behavior.
I moved things around a little and added some headroom. You shouldn't see this again unless you intentionally provoke it by maxing out both DDS per channel and then do phase/amplitude jumps on top of that. But it should be obvious that that is unwise for several other reasons.
Flashed using latest build bot build... flashing artiq-kc705-phaser... but can't ping. https://gist.github.com/jbqubit/95840c0bf6ea65e5a244faa9068f99da
Discussion taking place on IRC. https://irclog.whitequark.org/m-labs
Please reopen and I'll test.
File a new issue if you still see a problem. This one is closed.
Please re-open this Issue as I haven't tested it. Patch 9a8a7b9 didn't even build successfully until today.

And simpler things with swag are not working... #751.
Confirmed that this is resolved. Here's the updated test code.
