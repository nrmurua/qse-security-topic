Description of the issue
I get a TypeError when using cirq.kraus on this gate.
How to reproduce the issue
Produces:
Cirq version
I get this error both for 0.12.0.dev20210630205305 and 0.12.0
Seems like this is an error in the kraus protocol; it should call cirq.unitary to get the unitary representation of the object in question, rather than looking for a _unitary_ method directly, because PhasedXZGate does work with the unitary protocol:
We could also implement _unitary_ directly on PhasedXZGate; currently it has to decompose the gate to get the unitary.
I see the same issue in mixtures as well
The problem is that has_[kraus|mixture] methods check only for _has_[kraus|mixture]_  member functions and then fallback on kraus/mixture methods to check for _kraus_ | _mixture_. However, the former has a allow_decompose argument but the latter doesn't.
I can send a PR to fix this but I have a question -- do we need a allow_decompose argument in kraus, mixture protocols? unitary protocol doesn't have the allow_decompose argument even though has_unitary does, but they both work fine because has_unitary doesn't depend on unitary as a fallback.
Note that simply using cirq.unitary instead of checking for _unitary_ is not enough. In has_kraus, we check whether all(has_kraus(val) for val in decomposed_operations) then the primary operation also has_kraus. Therefore, in the kraus method, we will need to recursively compute the kraus of all decomposed operations and combine their kraus operators by serial concatenation.
This will be useful, for eg, to automatically compute the kraus operators of a PauliMeasurementGate (requested in #4127) which decomposes into pauli operations + measurement gate -- both of which have different types of kraus operators (unitary vs measurement).
This is a duplicate of #3965, which came to a similar conclusion (add allow_decompose to kraus/mixture). It's important to note that limits must be placed on this decomposition, as number of Kraus operators / mixture elements can exponentially explode.
