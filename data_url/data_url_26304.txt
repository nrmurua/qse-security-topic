We're looking at updating cp2k in Fedora Rawhide to the latest git version and using cmake (see https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/cp2k/pull-request/5).  I've re-enabled the regtests to get a baseline on their status.  I'm seeing the following on ppc64le:
The error is slightly higher than expected but the results are still sound.  What are the dependencies installed (especially openblas). Do you always get the same failing tests if you run them twice.
BTW, if you encounter anything breaking in the cmake build system (it is fairly stable but we keep finding small issues) do not hesitate to open an issue.
It seems pretty consistent so far, even with mpich:

Thanks. I would not worry too much about such small errors. The reasons can be multiple (different order in the arithmetic operation, bug, or something else). Maybe @oschuett can give his opinion about this but I am not too worried.
Yeah, they are not to concerning -but  it would be nice if thresholds could be increased so they don't fail.  Otherwise we have to ignore errors and might miss a real breaking change.
