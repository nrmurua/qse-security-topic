The three modules in the overview section of the Tutorials page:
Each has a jupyter notebook link in the NOTE  section which is broken
The links should redirect to the Qiskit Metal GitHub tutorials page:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metal/blob/main/docs/tut/1-Overview/1.1-Bird's-eye-view-of-Qiskit-Metal.ipynb
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metal/blob/main/docs/tut/1-Overview/1.2-Quick-start.ipynb
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metal/blob/main/docs/tut/1-Overview/1.3-Saving-Your-Chip-Design.ipynb
OR
There is actually a single hyphen missing in all of these links. Adding this will fix the issue.

Hi @bopardikarsoham , thank you for helping our docs look at their best.  There was a recent release of sphinx for docs. We consequently have updated few commits to address the changes.  Could you get the latest commit on main and see if you still have this issue? For me, these links work and I am not able to repeat this issue.
I went on the qiskit.org/metal site after that I clicked on the tutorials present in the 'Overview' Section and I saw that it's not working on the frontend
Still it does not work with the recent release of sphinx I guess at least for me
I saw it with @obrienpja , we are pusing a fix.
@bopardikarsoham , do you still see the problem?
