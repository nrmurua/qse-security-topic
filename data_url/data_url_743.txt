It appears I am unable to either understand the manual or be imaginative enough.
I have two separate kets and I wish to create an entanglement between them.
What I seek to accomplish is something akin to the snippet below:
I'm using QPP in a project of mine at Avalon PL where users declare qubits that are represented internally as kets so I'm trying to figure out how QPP is to handle things like entanglement between two separate variables.
Any and all suggestions will be extremely useful.
You need to apply an entangling gate (like CNOT) on the Kronecker product of ket1 and ket2, like
See also the examples/teleport_qubit.cpp for more details.
