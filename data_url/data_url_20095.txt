SIKE uses __inline to mark some inline code, but this appears to be an MSVC-specific keyword.  The more portable way seems to be either inline or __inline__, although there are some subtle differences between these two that I'm not entirely sure of.  @christianpaquin do you know if __inline was chosen for a specific reason?
No, I don't know. I'll have to check if this is part of the upstream (@patricklonga, do you know?), or added in the OQS integration.
So the __inline are from the upstream project; I'll defer to @patricklonga.
FYI, I'll take a look at this when I'm back at the keyboard, starting next week.
