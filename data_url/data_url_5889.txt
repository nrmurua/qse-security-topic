Import the pulse simulator with aer from release on a numpy version < 1.20.0
Aer works
Fix the numpy compatibility. My assumption is that this will be fixed in aer 0.8 since the pulse simulator cython code has been removed from master already. That being said we might need to make sure to build with an old numpy version to avoid binary incompatibility if this becomes an issue moving forward.
This was fixed in #1131 which was released as 0.7.5 so closing this as fixed, if there are still incompatibilities with 0.7.5 and numpy versions we can open a separate issue on those.
