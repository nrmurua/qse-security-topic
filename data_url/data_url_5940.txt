It seems inconsistent that in the first equation (i.e. the equation defining how to use ReadoutError), the LHS depends only on j while the RHS depends only on m.
Based on the accompanying text and example, it seems likely that the LHS should change to probabilities[m]. It may be worth verifying this is the correct definition in the source code before updating the docs given the past confusion: #422 .

Yes it should be probabilities[m] = [P(0|m), ...]
