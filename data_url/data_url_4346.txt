Many of the tests we have in Qibo take long times.
It should be useful to reduce them to minimal working examples (e.g. less qubits or less iterations in the variational examples).
In #1144 I have reduced the execution time of some tests, e.g. VQE/TSP, however it looks like the quantum info package is consuming a non negligible amount of time.
@renatomello could you please check if you can reduce some of the timings below?
