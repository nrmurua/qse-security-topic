The output of the reference function TwoBitstringSuperposition_Reference doesn't seem to be correct: For the bit string input b1=(false,true); b2=(true, false), calling DumpRegister on the qubit state returns:
Ids:	[1;0;] Wavefunction: 0:	1	0 1:	0	0 2:	0	0 3:	0	0 
The way I understand the problem, I would expect an output such as:
Ids:	[2;1;] Wavefunction: 0:	0	0 1:	0.707107	0 2:	0.707107	0 3:	0	0 
I'd welcome feedback on this issue.
Could you please share the code you're using to get this result?
I ran the following code:
And it dutifully printed the expected state:
(After that it proceeded to throw ReleasedQubitsAreNotInZeroState exception, which confirms that the qubits are indeed not in zero state)
Strangely enough, when I was running the same code again today, it gave the expected output. Thanks for the feedback!
