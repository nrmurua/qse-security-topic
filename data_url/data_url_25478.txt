Cells 3 and 5 in the Construct Bash Lepton tutorial generate the errors when they are run in a jupyter notebook session.
Cell 3: TypeError: __init__() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 4 were given
Cell 5: ValueError: Specify either library_name or command using this language
Run cells 3 and 5 in the Construct Bash Lepton tutorial to reproduce the errors
All cells in the tutorial are expected to run without errors.
No response
I've fixed what I could in #1044 . I am unable to test the Slack bot example though (don't have a token). At least there are no TypeErrors or ValueErrors.
In the future, some documentation would be nice for Bash leptons.
The handling of kwargs for bash (like CPP=gcc in the tutorial) will need some follow up work. For some reason, all kwargs are echoed back in the output. This would involve a small fix in lepton.py:
@AlejandroEsquivel would that be in scope? Without the patch, the notebook would run correctly but would not display the expected output for the gcc version task.
