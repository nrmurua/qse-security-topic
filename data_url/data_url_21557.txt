The compiler fails to infer the type of NumPy array when dealing with the following code on artiq 6. But it works on artiq 5.
Run the following code on artiq 6.7526 and artiq 5.7114 will see different result.
It works on artiq 5 but not on artiq 6.
On artiq 6, it threw out an error:
This code should have the same behavior under artiq 5 and artiq 6.
See the error message.
Thanks for the bug report. The issue here is that the array is empty, so the only way the type can be inferred is through the loop variable being used to call the same function that is later called with 0.0. There are probably two separate issues here: 1) We should embed host NumPy values (self.points) in a way where the type is specified separately from the values, and 2), type inference should (?) work in that case still. Fixing either would make this code compile.
Thanks for checking. I get your point. I think it not surprising that people sometimes need to scan over an array without knowing if it is empty. Following your suggestion, I found a workaround that could make this work. But, I think we should support empty arrays, though.
Oh, yes, it should definitely be supported! This was just a note to other developers/my future self on what is going on here internally/what needs fixing.
