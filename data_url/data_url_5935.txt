statevector_simulator produces wrong phase for 2*pi rotations.
Code example produces phase: 0, statevector: [1 0].
Jupyter Notebook Screenshot:

Correct result from example would be: phase: pi, statevector: [-1 0]
IQX Screenshot from application of single Rz(2*pi) gate:

If you use the master branches of terra and aer it will work as you expect.
Global phase was not supported in qiskit-terra 0.15, but is being added in the next release.
Hi. I'm using qiskit-terra 0.19.1 and still get the same phase error. Is there any workaround for this issue?
