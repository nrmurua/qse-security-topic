When switching on an Urukul channel TTL with cfg_sw(), the other Urukul channels on the same board are set to a value corresponding to their sw attribute value (either from the device_db entry or from other instances set before).
Both urukul0_ch0 and  urukul0_ch1 stay on.
urukul0_ch0 stays on, but urukul0_ch1 switches off.
If I execute the following experiment,  urukul0_ch1 is switched on and stays on, even if I execute UrukulTTLA now.
This is documented: rf_sw â€“ Initial CPLD RF switch register setting (default: 0x0). Knowledge of this state is not transferred between experiments. It's a consequence of the configuration register/status register design. This can be changed by changing the CPLD firmware and API.
I previously understood this to be the configuration of the SW TTL line, that is mentioned in the documentation of cfg_sw of the AD9912, which can be accessed through the sw attribute. But yes, now that I read it again, I see what you mean. But why is this not mentioned in the documentation of cfg_sw of the AD9912?
It seems better placed in the CPLD documentation. Not every bit of information is copied to every possible location where one might look for it. You can argue that there should be a reference to the CPLD docs and I'd be happy to accept a PR. That PR should also synchronize the AD9910 and AD9912 docs.
