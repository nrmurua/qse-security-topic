Hard to follow
Would be helpful to have something like this here: “A penalty model is a small Ising problem or QUBO that has ground states that match the feasible configurations and excited states that have a classical energy greater than the ground energy by at least the classical gap.”
class BinaryQuadraticModel(linear, quadratic, offset, vartype)
•	“linear (dict) – The linear biases as a dict.” --> better to be consistent about types: either rely on the generate type “(dict)” or specify in first sentence for all parameters/attributes, but currently some do and some don’t
•	 “linear biases” and “quadratic biases” --> I would expect terminology of coefficients in this context, then an explanation that these are the bias of qubits and strengths of couplers (that’s the usual terminology elsewhere in our stuff). It can be helpful to show this with a simple polynomial for non-English speakers
•	“quadratic should be upper triangular, that is if (u, v) in quadratic ” --> would help to mention a matrix and self loops could be explained as the diagonal of the matrix.
•	Note is unclear and not complete
•	 “Returns:	The linear biases. dict: The quadratic biases. The offset.” --> not very clear what the format is and has typo
•	“The qubo biases as an edge dict” --> edge dict? Needs knowledge of networkx terminology. Can that be assumed?
•	to_networkx_graph(node_attribute… has empty example
•	“case to a tuple” --> cast. More than one place
•	“linear_energy_ranges (dict[no… for each variable v ” versus other uses of variables: “ bias associated with each pair of variables” and “for each edge in graph” and “The node labels will be used as the variable labels ” --> should variables be standard variables or vertices and edges? I found it unclear whether “variables” were just nodes or nodes & edges.
•	“dict[tuple[int], number] – The set of feasible configurations. The value is the (relative) energy of each of the feasible configurations” but the example above it has “feasible_configurations = {(-1, -1), (1, 1)}” that looks like tuples of spins with no “, number”
•	“ground_energy numeric” --> float?
•	“If not provided, tried to infer” --> typo (tries)
