I can control and receive return values from calls to the novatech_wall device using artiq_rpctool.
I can control the novatech_wall device using artiq_run.
However, None is returned from rpc calls made by  artiq_run and  artiq_gui.
Below is transcript of artiq_master log. It shows that the master can successfully ping the device and receive the correct return value. But the program when run by artiq_run always obtains None as the return value.
device_db.pyon on master
Submitted prematurely... More info:
This is same problem as #149. But the problem is more clearly defined. If I run the same program but with "best_effort": False in the device_db.pyon then it works fine. It appears there's a bug with best_effort option.
Works fine here.
The relevant message is this:
WARNING:worker(9990):artiq.protocols.pc_rpc:connection failed while attempting RPC to 68810artiq1.bw.nist.gov:50001[novatech409b], re-establishing connection in the background
Do you confirm that this is printed all the time when you use best_effort=True, and it works with the exact same code when best_effort=False?
Yes, that's right. If I change best_effort to 'True' that is always printed when running the above. Changing only the value of best_effort to 'False' and it works just fine.
