Hi, I tried implementing U gate via the decomposition of it given on qiskit docs (https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.UGate.html) . However the results from the decomposition and U gate are not concurrent.
u3(pi/2,pi/3,pi/4) q[0] gives:  [ 0.707+0j, 0.354+0.612j ]
while
rz(pi/3) q[0];
rx(-pi/2) q[0];
rz(pi/2) q[0];
rx(pi/2) q[0];
rz(pi/4) q[0];
gives: [ 0.43-0.561j, -0.701+0.092j ]
Is it an issue or am I doing something wrong?
Yes, I guess you are right. I just run a simulation and got different results. But chances are that I may be wrong too. I would love to have the mistake pointed out (if there is one).

Did you account for the global phase factor into the implementation? I rapidly computed the unitary matrix for this sequence of gates on paper, I think you can easily check that RZ(phi-pi/2)*RX(pi/2)*RZ(pi-theta)*RX(pi/2)*RZ(lambda-pi/2) = exp(-j(phi+lambda)/2)U3(theta,phi,lambda).
If you account for this phase factor in your example, which will be exp(-7pi/24j), I believe you should get the desired result.
