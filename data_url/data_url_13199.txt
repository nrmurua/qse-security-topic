We'd like to add (in mitiq/benchmarks) support for two new benchmarking circuits.
+1 for W state circuits. It can be similar to the ghz state ones, https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidoc.html#module-mitiq.benchmarks.ghz_circuits.
Does this need to be finished by the end of the current milestone ? If not, I can take it for the next one.
My PhD proposal is close to being accepted by the end of next week. So, I know I will have more time to work on mitiq issues.

ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽˆ that's so exciting! Congratulations. Would love to hear more about your thesis at some point.

No rush on this ticket! I did notice that you have a lot of things assigned to you at the moment, however (https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/issues/assigned/purva-thakre). Would you mind unassigning yourself from the things you aren't working on?
Sure ! I can unassign one for now because I got lost and stopped working on it. #746
I haven't had the chance to look at what has been completed by you and Misty in the documentation for identity scaling.
#1426 is a quick one but I was waiting for a comment on where to put the tutorial in the docs.
#987 and #513 are two WIP proposals currently. I am close to finishing a draft for Pauli Twirling. The paper linked in the issue is not what I settled on. This is what I had in September  and Andrea's suggestion was to try a few easy examples to understand which technique to pick. I need to compare my examples and create an RFC for it.
Makes sense, thanks for the details. I think our push for the end of the year will be to make some improvements to our docs, so lets try and wrap up the identity scaling stuff in particular.
hi @purva-thakre, still planning to work on this in this milestone?
Yep !
Removing this from the 0.25 milestone. A major portion of this ticket is now completed with #1723.
@natestemen @andreamari For the QPE circuit, is better to restrict the input U to be a cirq.Gate ?
I was thinking of also allowing np.array and then using cirq.deconstruct_single_qubit_matrix_into_angles to describe the unitary in terms of valid quantum gates. This does increase the size of the circuit.
The other option would be to create a custom gate with the provided input array. I had tried this with the W-state circuit and noticed there were quite a few issues to fix when I created a controlled-U version of my custom gate.
Or the convenient thing would be to add a link to Cirq docs (in the docstring) on how to create a custom gate using a 1-qubit matrix and limit the input to be cirq.Gate
Hi @purva-thakre, we mainly need circuits for benchmarking Mitiq techniques and not for applicaitons, so I would keep it as simple as possible. For example, by setting $U=R_Z(\theta)$, where theta is the a phase which is supposed to be estimated by the QPE circuit.
Maybe I was complicating things for myself unnecessarily.
But based on the example you provided, if U only supposed to be a 1-qubit unitary, I don't have to worry too much about what I wrote in my previous comment.
Woohoo! Congrats on getting both of these done Purva! It would be great if they were also added to the API doc to ensure they are more discoverable.
