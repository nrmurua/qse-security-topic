pip install qiskit-aer --no-binary :all: does not install qiskit-aer.
qiskit-aer is installed correctly.
I believe that this bug is critical for POWER users.
Ok, so with latest version of scikit-build (== 0.9) and not the latest version of pip ( <= 18 ), this should just work.
I have noticed though, there's a problem with scikit-build and pip 19, so I have filed a new issue accordingly:  scikit-build/scikit-build#390.
@hhorii could you try to build using these versions, and show me the output of this command if it doesn't build?:
Ok, this is  a bug of pip: pypa/pip#6222
I'm will keep this issue open until a fix is released.
@hhorii in the meantime, I have to add something to the MANIFEST file so you can build on Power9.
PR is comming...
