Specified coupling map not accepted

Defining the following coupling map as shown below but keep getting an error, the topology is attached in the image. Any ideas whats going on?

Coupling map should work
The problem is that your coupling map misses nodes 8 and 9. However, the CouplingMap on works only on contiguous nodes, creating a disconnected coupling map of size 18:
Nodes 8 and 9 are loose. If you rename your nodes, that will make it. The full faulty-qubit infrastructure creates a "proxy" coupling map that maps the biggest connected sub-coupling map into a continues one and back. I'm not sure what's the solution to this.
