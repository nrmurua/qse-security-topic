RB utility supports function to count number of gate per Clifford and the EPC can be extracted by the RB fitter. Combining these two, we can estimate EPGs of u1, u2, u3 gate and then the EPG of two qubit gate is also able to be calculated without contribution of single qubit gate errors.
This is very convenient to compare the RB results with backend reported gate fidelity.
(transferred from #360) This is TODO list to track merging process of EPG utils.
