Hi,
I have been calling the compiler call after passing a workflow to it and the error is as follows:
Exception ignored in: <function Compiler.del at 0x7f966cdc8430>
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "./conda/envs/quantum-venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/bqskit/compiler/compiler.py", line 227, in del
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
Hi,
Can you please share the workflow you are trying to run?, or maybe even a minimal reproducible code?
Alon
@alonkukl Thanks for responding so quickly! This issue arose during a meeting, and I know the details. I will be looking into this shortly.
@mwalidcharrwi Are you importing or using atexit directly in your code at all? I know you might not want to share your code publically, but can you put it in a private repo and provide access to me?
@edyounis @alonkukl thanks for your response no there is no atexit imported in the code. Only bqskit.passes and bqskit.compiler (compiler and compilation task) is imported.
I will do that and share it with you.
@edyounis I sent you an invitation for the private repository with the script uploaded
