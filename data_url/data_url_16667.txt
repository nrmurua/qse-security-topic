#4234 is a temporary fix to QuantumCircuit's append to accept a few objects which previously could be appended because they had a to_instruction but are not OperatorBases. We should fix this permanently to have a clear contract about what can be appended into QuantumCircuits. So far, Pauli and Aer's QuantumError do not seem to fall into any of the appendable categories (Instruction, QuantumCircuit, OperatorBase) but currently are appended elsewhere in Qiskit (including tutorials).

I'll close this and open another one with more explanation.
