TTL in and out done.
Freq gen (port)
Zotino (to Sampler)
Sampler (from Zotino, from Urukul)
Urukul (to Sampler)
I have the hardware for those, all needs to be done is connect some SMA/BNC cables and write the tests. @jordens do you want to do the latter?
Maybe with satellite/master setup as well
I have a second Kasli (1.0) as well, I can put it in the crate and connect its SFP to the main Kasli. Adding a pair of TTLs (one in each direction) connected to the main Kasli would go a long way to test DRTIO.
Another problem will be building the bitstreams in parallel to speed up tests.
I'm going to add a AD9912 Urukul to the CI setup, there have been a few frustrating issues with it lately.
Current status of tests:
