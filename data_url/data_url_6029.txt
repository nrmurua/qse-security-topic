When building a device noise model the noise model with only depolarizing error can have error rates significantly lower than with thermal_relaxation + depolarizing error.
Run the following
It returns something like
The gate error in the first column should be close to the value in the second column (P(relax+depol) ~ P(depol only)), instead it is approx equal to the relaxation only error rate which is independent of the gate_error param in backend properties.
This appears to be due to an issue in unit conversion when calculating the effective depolarizing error parameter for the depol+relaxation gate error.
