I have been looking at the source code of the QGAN.set_generator method. Apparently, it accepts a parameter (generator_optimizer) that is the optimizer to be used when training the generator. However, I don't see that it is used anywhere in the code (https://qiskit.org/documentation/_modules/qiskit/aqua/algorithms/distribution_learners/qgan.html#QGAN.set_generator). Is this a non-implemented feature? If so, could you please implement it in a future version.
Thanks in advance

The required feature is implemented in PR #1253.
Thank you!
