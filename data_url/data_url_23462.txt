When exporting non-gridded data to netcdf, the "missing" grid points are filled with NaNs. This causes such datasets to not roundtrip and can drastically increase file size.
When exporting non-gridded data to the netcdf format, I expect the resulting file to accurately represent the data without introducing NaN values to fill in "missing" grid points. For the example code, I would expect the file size to be several 10 kilobytes.
The exported netcdf file contains NaN values in place of "missing" grid points within the non-gridded data. Additionally, the exported file size is 16 megabytes (MB), which is significantly larger than expected.
The underlying problem seems to be the conversion from a pandas Multiindex Dataframe to an xarray Dataset. During this conversion the NaNs are added. Technically, xarray would allow creating a sparse dataset. However, xarray does not support exporting sparse datasets to netcdf, yet.
I added this hacky code to qcodes.dataset.exporters.export_to_xarray:
This solves the file size problem. But I guess it will also break roundtripping for gridded data.
operating system
Operating system: Windows 10, MacOS 11.7.3
qcodes version
QCoDeS version: 0.39.1
Other packages
Python version: 3.10.5
xarray version: 2023.8.0
h5netcdf version: 1.0.1
Thank you in advance for any help on this matter.
Also please let me know if I can provide additional information or improve this issue in a different way.
And lastly, thanks for making qcodes! I really enjoy using it.
@paul-lehmann-unibas Thanks for the report. I am working on a more general solution that will hopefully land soon
@jenshnielsen thats great to hear! Thank you very much!
