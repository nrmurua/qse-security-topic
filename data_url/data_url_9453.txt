Note:
If we use GenericLinearAlgebra, there is another issue
I think, on the other hand, we can consider giving forward diff a custom gradient for expv (treat it as primitive), the forward derivative is just the partial derivative of each Dual number if I'm correct.
For the GenericAlgebra case, it seems somehow ForwardDiff doesn't know how to go through the register type, could be easier to fix.
You are right, it works! My loss was wrong.
I guess I'll just try to polish the interface a bit then, and let people just use GenericLinearAlgebra, then keep working on the reverse mode adjoint.
Sounds great. BTW: I just confirmed this gradient is consistent with finite difference.
