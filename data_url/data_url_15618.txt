I am trying to build a quantum support vector machine by going through qiskit machine learning tutorial. I came across several issues involving importing qiskit.ml and qiskit.aqua. I tried to do pip3 install qiskit[all] using the anaconda terminal within my environment. I opened up jupyter notebook and attempted to import both qiskit.ml and qiskit.aqua, but apparently the module still does not exist. I looked at the download log and it appears that at least qiskit-machine-learning-0.3.0.
Open anaconda terminal:
activate quantum to activate my environment
Download:
pip3 install qiskit[all]
Open Jupyter Notebook:
Jupyter Notebook
Import:
Error:
Not sure why, but everything should be imported just fine.
No response
I see you found the Quantum Support Vector Machine tutorial here: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stable/0.24/tutorials/machine_learning/01_qsvm_classification.html. However, as you can see, this is the 0.24.1 Qiskit documentation, which is very old. Instead, use this: https://qiskit.org/documentation/machine-learning/tutorials/index.html, which is the most recent(0.34.1) Quantum Machine Learning tutorials page.
Thanks for letting me know.
Using the from qiskit_machine_learning.datasets import ad_hoc_data still gives me ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit.qiskit_machine_learning', what am I missing here?
Same issue with me as well
I'm unable to reproduce that error on the latest Qiskit ML release. Could you try running that import statement just in a Python shell or a simple script? What Qiskit and Python versions are you using?
You could check the versions with

Having the same issue.


but already installed everything thats neccesary.
have a look at this and just if i did something wrong just let me :)
