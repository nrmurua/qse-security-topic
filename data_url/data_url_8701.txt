Thanks for pointing this out! The issues pointed out is the use of eval. Two occurrences of this are very easy to fix by making use of ast.literal_eval. However, we also make use of this to evaluate the name of a class as a string to the actual class. Not sure directly how to do this in general without using eval. It should be stated that these calls to eval do not use strings coming from a user so should not be a problem as far as I can tell.
