The armv7l compiler detects an implicit function declaration which triggers the following compilation error:
It has to be checked if this is true, since other compilers do not detect this issue.
This is probably a case of leaked-in includes through the system headers for X86. src/grid/cpu/grid_context_cpu.c does not contain #include <math.h> as it should according to POSIX for the exp function.
