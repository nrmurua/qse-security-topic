The Bison parser generator version required by libqasm and tree-gen is 3.0 or newer.
When such Bison is not present on the system, the source for Bison 3.0 is downloaded and built by calling CMake.
Github actions use the Bison in container quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_x86_64, which is 3.0.4. No newer bison can be installed directly from the repos in that container.
The issue with Bison 3.0 is that
I suggest bumping the Bison required version to 3.8, unfortunately that requires building it from source in the CI, as long as we keep the same manylinux 2014 container, which can increase the build time.
Alternatively, I will look into adding an extra repo with Bison 3.8 in the workflow files, so that Bison doesn't have to be built in the CI.
fwiw a patch to get bison to build on newer glibc is available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rdslw/openwrt/e5d47f32131849a69a9267de51a30d6be1f0d0ac/tools/bison/patches/110-glibc-change-work-around.patch
(bison version should absolutely be bumped, but until then..)
