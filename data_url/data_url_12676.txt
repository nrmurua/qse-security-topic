There is a small bug in the comparison view. When two algorithms do not have common molecules, a following error is printed to the console:
Uncaught (in promise) Error: Argument given to addRows must be either a number or an array
Note that the comparison view needs to be overhauled to support comparing molecules instead of just algorithms. Changes are probably also needed when real data is available.

@tapanih are there any particular example algorithms that print the error to any console?
