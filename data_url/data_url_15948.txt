#6396 updated QAOA and results in a unit test failure at qiskit-optimization (CI result).
This is due to the change of the parameter order. Such change affects the result of VQE.
I suggest to mention it in the release note. It looks like an API change.
I visualize two circuits of a QAOA ansatz used in qiskit-optimization unit test with Terra stable and main.

There seems a bug too. #6396 (comment)
Good catch! I didn't intend to change the parameter order. Maybe it would be better trying to revert to the old parameter order.
Thanks. If the parameter order and bounds come back, I think qiskit-optimization unit tests pass.
