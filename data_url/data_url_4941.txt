I am running the following on my machine
Does this pose an issue for running QuEST?
Hi Jonathan,
QuEST should compile fine on a wide range of compilers, but we do not explicitly test every possible version of every compiler. If you want to make sure everything works properly, you can run the test suite as described in the documentation.
Hope it helps,
Cheers!
