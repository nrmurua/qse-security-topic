Describe the bug
Both Falcon-512 and Falcon-1024 variants return a variable length signature. This is observed in the test_sig correctness test by
printing the output variable signature_len  after the sign() function is called:  https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/tests/test_sig.c. The test will pass because signature_len is an output computed internally by the sign() function specifying the length of the generated signature returned and the same length signature is verified by the verify() function.  signature_len is given as input to verify().
sign() and verify() should be updated to fixed length signatures.
rc = OQS_SIG_sign(sig, signature, &signature_len, message, message_len, secret_key);
rc = OQS_SIG_verify(sig, message, message_len, signature, signature_len, public_key);
for pqclean_falcon-512_clean, internally that would be:
PQCLEAN_FALCON512_CLEAN_comp_encode()
in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_clean/codec.c
called by:
static int do_sign(uint8_t *nonce, uint8_t *sigbuf, size_t *sigbuflen, const uint8_t *m, size_t mlen, const uint8_t *sk) ()
in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c
which is called by:
PQCLEAN_FALCON512_CLEAN_crypto_sign_signature()
in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/src/sig/falcon/pqclean_falcon-512_clean/pqclean.c
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Expected behavior
./test_sig Falcon-512
sig->length_signature = 666
signature_len = 654
./test_sig Falcon-1024
sig->length_signature = 1280
signature_len = 1277
Environment (please complete the following information):
Additional context
cross-compiled for aarch64.
sign() and verify() should be updated to fixed length signatures.
IMO fixed length sigs are just one option in the Falcon specs; for the NIST competition--which OQS tracks-- variable length sigs have been spec'd (see algorithm specs, section 3.11.6): the siglen size thus is a maximum value not a guaranteed one and the APIs operate as designed (and desirable from a "small is better" perspective; what advantages for longer, fixed sizes do you see?).
I do recall reading/hearing somewhere (yes citation needed, but sadly I don't have one :-() that the "final" version of Falcon will be fixed length. It just hasn't made it to pqclean and thus liboqs.
@baentsch might it be worth exposing the different falcon modes through liboqs somehow?
Looking at the codebase on the falcon website vs the pqclean codebase makes it look like pqclean only supports the variable length version... So I guess it would be a non-trivial amount of work to bring the PADDED and CT falcon formats into liboqs

A reference would be good. @dstebila Are you aware of something? Otherwise it seems, Falcon will go the same way as Kyber: Not updateable due to differences between authors and NIST (competition).

I don't know off the top of my head what the intentions are with respect to the NIST version of Falcon.
It was mentioned on the pqc forum. I've been trying to find the original quote, but it seems generally accepted that falcon signatures will be fixed length: https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/3Cu70s0doYY/m/i55BTiGgBwAJ
Closing as this is currently being tracked by #1608.
