I've seen a CI failure cause by a seemingly flaky cyclicity test in AdaptVQE, added in #7930. It doesn't seem to happen that often, but the commit only merged yesterday and we've had a CI failure of it since, so it's got too high a chance.
The CI failure was
Tests are reliable.
Possibly there's somewhere in that test that needs to set a random seed (algorithm_globals.rng or something?). I haven't looked at the test case, to know if it could possibly be a true failure, or if it's just bad luck with an optimiser stuck in a very non-optimal plateau. If the issue appears again and we can't immediately find the problem, we might consider disabling that test temporarily to avoid jamming CI during the potential RC release.
That is not good.. Will take a look right now üëç
Looks like this still appears to be an issue: https://dev.azure.com/qiskit-ci/qiskit-terra/_build/results?buildId=40314&view=logs&j=f6ccd89d-3934-51bf-5c91-df7a7550b1a5&t=28300182-9c62-50f4-80d6-8fa111cef733&l=17957
I am going to open a PR in a second which will hopefully address this once and for all...
