The ISwapPowGate and FSim gate rotate in different directions on the |01>, |10> subspace.  This feels a bit odd to me.
This morning I meant to change signs of the angles in fSim only to notice that @maffoo has already done this in #1726. It seems that his PR missed ISwapPowGate. I'll send out a fix soon.

Changing these kinds of conventions is a silent breaking change on our users. The iswap gate has been around for several versions now; we can't just change what it means.
Personally I don't mind so much if iswap is at fsim(-90deg) instead of fsim(+90deg).
If we want to change this convention, we first need to deprecate iswap for one version then delete it for one version then re-introduce it with the new convention.
OK.
