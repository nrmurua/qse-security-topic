Re: #4611, the display portion of that issue was fixed in #4616, but there are obvious instances of pi that are not being modified to the pi symbol by pi_check.
pi_check should work on any of the numeric values inside the parameter expression.

This is a duplicate of #4170 ðŸ™‚
Thanks. Missed that.
