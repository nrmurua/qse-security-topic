This is the output of cz-gate of two qubits with state of |11>
Code:
Display CZ Gate output value of |11> = |-11> in qsphere diagram.
The image isn't wrong per se, it's just fixed the gauge of the global phase - there's no difference between |11> and -|11> in a 2q Hilbert space.  I don't know the original reasoning behind that design choice, but I would expect it's to make it easier to compare two separate plots to each other.
I'll close this issue now, but there was a bit of on-going discussion in #7512, of which this issue is a duplicate.
