Refactor matters
Dry the code, as there are many reusable and similar modules in Circuit, DMCircuit and MPSCircuit class.
After the refactoring, the functionality of DMCircuit will be as much as Circuit, with many features now lacking.
No issue on compatibility.
Currently, I decided to take a progressive approach. This TEP only achieves the follows:
Only consider the common base of Circuit and DMCircuit classes, leave MPSCircuit class alone for this stage.
Build reusable functions in basecircuit.py, and use BaseCircuit class as parent of Circuit as well as DMCircuit classes. This stage can persist smoothly for a while and users should not be affected.
After this refactoring, I will further consider whether compose all functions in commons.py as a BaseCircuit class.
will release this tep based refactor version as 0.3
