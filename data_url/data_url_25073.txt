Thank you so much for making a printer-friendly board. Could you also make the rulebook in light-colors? I know I can use the pdf, but I'd like to have the rulebook in the box.

Entanglion v1.3 has just been released with a light-themed version of the rulebook. Enjoy!

You guys rock! I'm looking forward to introducing it to my work lunch gaming group.
