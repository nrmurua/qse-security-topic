If I run install_cp2k_toolchain.sh and leave plumed to default of no, this file arch/Linux-x86-64-gfortran.psmp requires plumed  on line 10
include       $(MPI_PATH)/plumed/2.5.2/lib/plumed/src/lib/Plumed.inc.static
producing
/opt/ohpc/admin/UAbuild/cp2k/cp2k/arch/Linux-x86-64-gfortran.psmp:10: /plumed/2.5.2/lib/plumed/src/lib/Plumed.inc.static: No such file or directory
It seems you're not really following the instructions given by the toolchain at the end:
The ARCH to use together with the arch files generated by the toolchain is local: make ARCH=local ....
The arch files already present in arch/ when checking out the source code (or unpacking the tarball) are example files for different environments. There is no guarantee that they work your environment or the environment generated by the toolchain.
Thank you. "local" works better than "Linux-x86-64-gfortran". I wasn't understanding the concept of local
