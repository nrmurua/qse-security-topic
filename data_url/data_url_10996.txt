The asymptotic complexity of all functions in FermiLib should be written into the doc strings. Understanding where the bottlenecks are is quite important for the ultimate scalability of the library. When code is unacceptably slow, people should add an example to performance_benchmarks.py, in the examples folder, so we can work on speeding those things up.
