If you use cirq.final_wavefunction it says:
there is a test: mux_test:test_deprecated that must be broken as well. It uses cirq.testing.assert_logs
This is an issue with the deprecation function's text itself - I'll have a look
E.g.
The tests are just matching on the substring of the new function name to be there but not the structure of the whole text.
the mux test deprecated searches for both the new name but also the old function name which isn't (wasn't ... I see you've already fixed the underlying issue) in the message
