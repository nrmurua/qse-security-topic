The following example breaks Deutsch-Josza for two-qubit case with error:
Code producing the error:
Is fixable by changing the offending line to:
but I'm not sure if that's the most elegant solution.
You might also want to consider adding it to tests (they lack working 2-qubit mapping examples, only the ones that are invalid).

Hey @amyfbrown
Was there a fix for this? I'm unable to make DJ algorithm run for 1+ qubit.
