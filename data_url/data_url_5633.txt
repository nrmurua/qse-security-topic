Not able to execute the code taken from the Qiskit tutorials.
<ipython-input-3-7b667a2e8e7c>:24: DeprecationWarning: Using a qobj for run() is deprecated as of qiskit-aer 0.9.0 and will be removed no sooner than 3 months from that release date. Transpiled circuits should now be passed directly using backend.run(circuits, **run_options). job = self.backend.run(q_obj, **{'parameter_binds': None})
TypeError: AerBackend._run_qobj() got multiple values for argument 'parameter_binds'
How should I modify the code inorder to execute ?
Could you try 0.12.1? I think this issue was already resolved.
Please reopen this issue if you still encounter the same problem with the latest qiskit-aer.
