As one can see in the following picture I am getting negative eigenvalues for a pure state density matrix. This leads to negative entropy. Another mistake is that there should only be one non-zero eigenvalue ( = 1) for a pure state density matrix. This is extremely worrisome as this makes me doubt many of the results I receive from the library. I have check and the density matrix is hermitian with trace 1.
Those results are floating point zeros.  Run Q.tidyup() on it and see what the cleaned up operator looks like.

No difference with tidyup on density operator.
Well then that needs to ve checked.  However, the main result is still the same, those values are in essence floating-point zeros. We just need to verify that they get removed properly in this case.
However I do see what you are saying though, that those numbers are actually meant to be zero. Thank you, this actually helps me, I will just treat any number around the size 10^(-15) as zero.
Can you send me the code.that generates the Hamiltonian?
from itertools import*
from qutip import*
n= 4
S = [0.5sigmax(), 0.5sigmay(), 0.5*sigmaz()]
C = list(combinations(range(n), 2))
def dist(ind): return float(min(abs(ind[0]-ind[1]), abs(n - abs(ind[0]-ind[1]))))
def tens(oper,ind):
I = [qeye(2) for i in range(n)]
for i in range(len(ind)):
print i
I[ind[i]] = oper[i]
return I
H = sum(tensor(tens([S[0],S[0]],ind))/dist(ind) for ind in C)
