Check that make uses -j$(nproc) (or similar) where possible (we found that it is used already very often, but it would be nice to keep the eyes open whether it is missing somewhere).
Thanks for noting. I paid attention to include this everywhere, so that the scripts use all cores if possible.
@.Everybody Feel free to indicate make calls that miss the -j$(nproc) flag here, or even create pull requests which already append the missing flag to the invocation of make
