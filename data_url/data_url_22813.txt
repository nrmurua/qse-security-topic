Suggestion by Vadiraj:
"I saw the paper on arxiv. Congratulations! this is big.
As I was perusing the paper, I wondered if you had some plans of introducing these ideas in a more presentation like format? I guess these group meetings serve this goal?
I very much would like to learn the techniques and so I would appreciate if you can organize workshop like formats to make it more accessible.
I look forward to these meetings. Thank you for organizing them."
