The documentation for qutip.wigner says the following about the output:
W (array) â€“ Values representing the Wigner function calculated over the specified range [xvec,yvec].
However, it does not specify the axis order. I think that W[j,k] corresponds to the point xs[k], ys[j].
Is this correct? If so, can it be added to the documentation?
