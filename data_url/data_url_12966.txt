Hi notmgsk!
Thank you for your feedback. This issue is related to the Cirq issue.
The reason is that Cirq did not fix the version of google-api-core, but the new google-api-core release is not compatible with Cirq 0.6.0. It can be fixed by setting a certain version of google-api-core.
This command should fix your problem:
pip install google-api-core==1.20.0
Awesome, I'll give it a try later and then close this.
