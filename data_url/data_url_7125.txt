Currently forced to use 3 wires. Would be better if adding/removing wires was possible, with appropriate changes in displayed information.
Wires are now added dynamically. Whenever the user starts dragging a gate and the bottom wire is used, a new wire appears as a possible drop target and disappears if not used.
