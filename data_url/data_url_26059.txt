Currently, we use a dictionary to map strings to gate objects and thus require as many else-if statements as there are supported gates to extract data. This is highly inefficient, and we should Instead use a data structure and/or search algorithm to eliminate this excessive branching in each qbraid.transpiler._utils sub-module.
