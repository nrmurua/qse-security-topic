The iSWAP gate is pretty useful in quantum simulation and can be implemented straightforwardly wtih gmon qubits (hopefully, also for xmon in the near future).
What's the matrix for the iSWAP gate?
It's in OpenFermion-Cirq. It's the same as XXYY, i.e. ISWAP = XXYY. It might make sense to port XXYYGate over completely.
Okay. So the matrix at exponent=1 is
?
Or is it
?
Oooh @john6060 is gonna have to answer that. I might have defined it wrong.
I asked on the quantum computing stack exchange: https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/2594/what-is-the-matrix-of-the-iswap-gate
He said it's the second one (no negative sign). That would be XXYY^-1
Stack exchange agrees.
