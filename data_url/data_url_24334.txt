See what i did in v0.1. Need to add wirebonds every x mm along CPW paths for long CPWs. Relly only needed in EM sims, but can also be larger part of metal. Needed fro eigenmode and Z analysis.
Tagging:
@marcolincs  for cpw knowledge and architecture decision and
@dwang429 for ansys hfss renderer
find help/main developer for this as needed
Great work!
