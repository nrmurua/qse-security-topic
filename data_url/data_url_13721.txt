Although the total number of gates is correct the number of moments is quite different between
the stretch=2.99 and stretch=3.0.
In the body of fold_gates_at_random we treat the case stretch==3.0 as a particular case.
This is probably the reason of the noise scaling discontinuity.
This is because stretch=3.0 means folding all gates. Since we don't need any randomness here, this case is done by folding all moments which produces 2 * # moments.
The case of stretch = 2.99 is done by folding gates until the stretch is reached, which produces 2 * # gates folded new moments.
This is expected based on the implementation, which could be changed. Note that something like #25 can reduce the number of moments.
