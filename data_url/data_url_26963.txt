As it stands, the installer sort of pollutes the Applications folder. It would be possible to modify the init.m file with a line that adds the src folder to the path everytime Mathematica starts. I am aware of no other way to acheive this that does not require the user to manually run a command at the beginnig of a session. This method has the down side of having to automatically modify a file that some users may modify themselves.
