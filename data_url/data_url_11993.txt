I believe there is an error with a line of code, given the description immediately before. In section:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/textbook/01_IQPE.html#All-substeps-of-the-3rd-step
should the code entry
qc.p(-3pi/2,0).c_if(c,3)
actually be
qc.p(-3pi/4,0).c_if(c,3) ?
@cribetti yep it should be 3pi/4 and not 3pi/2. But it doesn't make any difference on the output, the final probabilities remains same 0.125 . Only the circuit will change
can i be assigned to update this on the docs?
Feel free to open a PR and start working
