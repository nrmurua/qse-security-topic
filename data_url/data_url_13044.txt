The code of mitiq.shadows is now implemented but it just works with Cirq circuits. We need to extend it to all Mitiq-compatible frontends.
Use the tools in mitiq.interface to make mitiq.shadows multiplatform.
Hint: check how this problem has been solved for other  techniques (mitiq.xxx) and see if something similar can be applied in mitiq.shadows .
Link to papers related to shadows:
cc @bdg221 @Aaron-Robertson since both of y'all were interested in getting more familiar with the shadows theory.
