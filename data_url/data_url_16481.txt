When placing the same parameterized gate into multiple circuits and binding the parameter value in place, the parameter in the gate instance is updated but the circuits containing this gate still have the old parameter in their parameter table (at least I think that's what's happening). This leads to issues as:
I don't think this is very pressing but definitely should be fixed in the future.
These options have different behaviour, in the second one can change the parameter of the gates "from the outside" by modifying the gate instance. Probably the safer behaviour is therefore the first option.
