There are certain functions in covalent which are not being used currently and may as well be removed. Some examples include check_consumable, check_constraint_specific_sum in lattice.py, some utility functions, the schedule condition in _plan_workflow (_plan_workflow may itself be removed but that isn't that big a deal).
