Hello everyone,
I am doing most of my calculations using version 9.1 of cp2k, however I wanted to move to the newer 2023.2 version. I Installed this on the same machine using the same flags for the toolchain and ultimately the make command. ./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh --with-sirius=no --with-spla=no --with-elpa=no --with-plumed=install make -j 4 ARCH=local VERSION="ssmp sdbg psmp pdbg"
But now i see around a ~5x decrease in performance for the newer version while also using the exact same input file. I am unsure what is causing this drop in performance. Could someone help me out with this?
Here is a zip file with the 2 calculations I ran.

Hi,
That did the trick. In fact it is now even slightly faster!
Thanks for the help!
