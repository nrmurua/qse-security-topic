Tell us what should happen
The connection should be well operated and it worked well before.
Tell us what happens instead
Now when I try to connect them, it shows me 'module 'pyvisa.constants' has no attribute 'BufferOperation''
I set both RS232 and keithley2400 with
Baud: Rate 9600
Data: Bits 8
Stop: Bits 1
Parity: None
Terminal: LF
And I checked it's working well when I type command via NI MAX.
What should I consider to solve this problem?

Please try upgrading to qcodes 0.19.2 You have an incopatible combination qcodes and pyvisa installed. QCoDeS 0.19.2 should have support for both pyvisa 1.10 and 1.11
