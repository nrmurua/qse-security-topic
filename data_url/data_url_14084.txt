The statevector is an exponentially growing object so it does not make sense to print the amplitudes. Similarly we don't print the contents of a unitary.

the box should just print State Prep or \psi or something.
I tried doing this myself but couldn't find the right place to modify to not print params for a specific instruction (how is it done for unitary?)
This is where you can check if it's an Initialize instruction. It will remove the params for both the text and the mpl drawers. 
Thanks. So the issue seems to be that StatePreparation and Initialize don't store their state vector as one ndarray inside params[0], but expand it into the full list of params. This is in contrast to UnitaryGate, Isometry, etc. So I think that should be fixed.
Ali: it's not a perfect situation, but it's a valid representation of the data, and changing it would break all consumers of the Initialize and StatePreparation, such as the QPY transport layer and Aer (which supports the instruction natively).  I think it'll be cleaner to put a manual override into the visualisers, which are the only place that actually has the problem.
