Operator estimation is using an older, less general version of the symmetrization code found in api._quantum_computer. Using this newer code will simplify measure_observables and enable more symmetrization options.
The symmetrization argument needs to accommodate the different integer levels used in qpu.run_symmetrized_readout. Beyond that, we simply need to replace the old code with a single call to this method.
