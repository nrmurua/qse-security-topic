After the pr #1383 I noticed we have very few tests on the Quaternions. We should fix this in a followup PR.
@jaygambetta @1ucian0  I am new to this repo but if it's alright with you, I would love to take on this issue.
sounds great.
any update @npdeep ?
Been distracted with travels lately. I will try to make a PR by this weekend.
@jaygambetta @1ucian0  I have made a PR (#2123) with a couple of more tests. Would appreciate some feedback. Please do let me know if there are any low-lying tests I am missing.
Closed via #2123
