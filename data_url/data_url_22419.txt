I'm trying to test out the pause function to see if I can make it turn off an experiment at a particular state. I'm running the following experiment which I want to pause by running another at a higher priority
I get the following error,
It seems like I can't implement self.scheduler.pause() using @kernel? How should I write this instead?
Break the kernel in two parts and call them from a host function (run does not need to be a kernel) with pause in between.
And by the way - not only doesn't pause work on coredevice, but you also should disconnect from it before calling pause (otherwise, if another experiment preempts and connects to the device, you'll have problems). self.core.comm.close(), reconnection is automatic with the next kernel.
Why doesn't pause() call comm.close()?
It now does in master/2.0.
