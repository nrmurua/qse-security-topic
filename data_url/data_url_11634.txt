The kwargs that are passed to optimizers are not unified. e.g.:
ADAM: maxiter
SPSA: max_trials
GSLS: max_iter
The interface should be standardized.
In general the philosophy has been when using the external libraries, in this case optimizers where we use scipy etc, is to use the same parameter names as is done in the library so we do not confuse by wrapping them with different names than the library gives/documents them with. However the above ones you list are custom for Aqua so in that regard we have more freedom and it seems a fair comment for where we have that level of control.
I agree with @nonhermitian . We discussed this some time ago and we concluded that we wanted to keep the scipy arguments. I think the unification makes full sense, as long as we keep the standarisation along all optimizers.
