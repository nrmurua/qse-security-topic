Hello, this is the current text for the include statements:
The statement include "filename"; continues parsing filename as if the contents of the file were inserted at the location of the include statement. This statement can only be used at the global scope.
However, this does not specify whether bit string-like strings should be valid.  Per the syntax described for bit strings, the following could be valid or invalid depending on if an implementation tokenized the path as a bit string and validates the path as a string literal.
Although, these are valid paths on Windows, for example.  Therefore, I think we should adjust the spec to state that any sort of string is allowed for this value.
