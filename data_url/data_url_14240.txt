As of https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/b4bc559228c3898817978c3d8c3fc97372beecad/qiskit/circuit/bit.py#L65
Qiskit Terra allows clbits to not be in registers (or be in multiple registers!). This seems to break result handling.
Related to Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1783
Gives
Should yield
One solution would be to add dummy registers for empty clbits.
I was able to reproduce this issue with BasicAer in terra 0.24
Notice it works with qiskit-aer 0.12.0 (and without the No classical registers in circuit warning)  if the first line is replaced with from qiskit import Aer
