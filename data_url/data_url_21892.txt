Right. Overloading is not currently supported. Note that because of static dispatch, even once it's implemented, the results may be surprising.
Can we just have a better error message?
Sure. You don't have to repeat this every time there's an issue in the compiler. You know I take error messages very seriously and fix every instance.
Note the "just" - I was proposing only improving the error message and not implementing overloading.
I don't remember the reason for not having overloading. It might be that once I fix the bug, it'll just work, with the caveat above (which already kicks in under different circumstances).
Your example does in fact work after the fix, enjoy. Though you wouldn't be able to call C.f directly in more than one subclass, so the utility is not very high.
