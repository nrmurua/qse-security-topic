Assume the following workflow:
This is motivated from an algorithm but simplified :Smi
Which prints the same circuit, but different results:
I would expect that the results are the same, but I might also have the wrong expectation for circuit.copy here. If the cached circuit and the copied circuit reference to the same list of circuit instructions (i.e. circuit.data) of course modifying the copy also affects the cached object.
