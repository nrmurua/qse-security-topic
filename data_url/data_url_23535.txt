I have a general question about using datasaver in a style that is slightly different from the examples.
Datasaver is designed in a very nested loop fashion.  With the assumption that if I set x and measure y I get a dataset (x,y). This is well and good.  But there are more complicated situations and I am unsure how to deal with them.
Ex 1:
Let's say I set x and measure many y i.e. y = {y1,y2,y3,y4,y5 ...}.  What is the right way to save the data in datasaver?  Is there a convenient method or would I have to build a for loop to add each y individually with the same x? Psuedo code below:
Ex 2:
Let's say I wanted to add a finished array of results at the end of the loop to datasaver instead of at each step in datasaver.  Is there an easy way to do this? Pseudo code below.
Hello @pyquest1
I need to be a bit certain how your question can be handled with datasaver in Measurement context manager. But, what I am certain about is that you can use qcodes doNd functions for the same reason. Please look at my PR #2306 , where Measurement is compared with doNd. Basically you only need to set values you want to measure and as many parameters you want to measure over in a single line:
for example:
do1d(sweeping_parameter, 0, 10, 1, 1, measured_parameter1, measured_parameter2, ...)
Basically, doNd has Measurement and datasaver wrapped in it and you don't need to set any of those yourself.
In the mentioned PR, you see that that I used arrayed parameters for both measuring and measured parameters.
But, if you want to explicitly use Measurement context manager, I can respond to that ASAP.
Hi Farbo,
I'm having some trouble accessing your file.
In any event.  I'm not trying to do a multidimensional sweep.  It's just that there are instances where multiple y values are returned.  For instance an oscilliscope might return N points and not a single point after a function call.  So I am trying to understand the right use in this situation.

You need to do some clicks in order to view the notebook. Anyway, I think you can find your answer here (section: Performing several measuments concurrently):
https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/docs/examples/DataSet/Performing-measurements-using-qcodes-parameters-and-dataset.ipynb
Let me know if it solves your issue :)
Update: Maybe it is easier to look at this link, instead:
