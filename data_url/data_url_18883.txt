Current parsing rule for expressionStatement is too general. Timing statement (which is also quantumStatement) like delay[lengthof(a)] q[2], q[3]; is parsed as expressionStatement. expressionStatement has to be more specifically defined.
At the same time, it means delay[lengthof(a)] is parsed as indexIdentifier as opposed to TimingInstruction. The solution can be defining DELAY: 'delay' so it will overwrite identifier.
The expressionStatements look like are 1. incrementor 2. builtInCall 3. subroutineCall 4. kernelCall.
I parsed delay[lengthof(a)] q[2], q[3]; with the master 89e93e7, and then got following tree:
