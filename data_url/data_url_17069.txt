Schedule drawing fails if schedule is empty
Thanks for reporting the issue. I noticed this issue and have two options;
I can't find useful example to visualize an empty schedule, and I think it won't be a problem to do the first one. but It's still worth to take second option?
We should replicate the null behaviour of the QuantumCircuit.draw which is to output a null canvas. However, please note in the example I gave above the Schedule is not empty, and is failing.
Ok, so the second option seems to be the best.
