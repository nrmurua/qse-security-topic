With Aqua and Terra latest versions from main branches:
Here is what I find. Using Aqua operators, just looking at the first part as we see a difference that helps understand the final failure
using Terra opflow
Now Aqua - adding the @(Plus^Plus) to the expression to complete it as per the failure
where using Terra opflow it fails
this is in some to_circuit logic where the i is not managed since it seems to only expect X,Y,Z I in the mapping and in mapping each element it goes wrong. In Aqua it was just XY with the i being part of coeff. Now it moved to iXY and the to_circuit fails.
As originally reported on Qiskit Slack aqua channel here https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/CB6C24TPB/p1623208786231500
Thanks. I see. This is caused by Pauli symplectic refactoring.
