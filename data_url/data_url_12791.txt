Hello everyone!
I know that it's kinda not the right place for that question, but I don't really know where else I can ask it. So I apologize beforehand.
I can't find the true difference between Quantum Neural Network (QNN) and Quantum-Inspired Neural Network (QINN).
I have multiple guesses:
Thank you a lot for any information! Sorry again for asking it here.
The best place for this kind of quantum computing questions is https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/, so I would recommend you to post this question there. The Quantum Katas are still some time away from featuring either QNN or QINN :-)
