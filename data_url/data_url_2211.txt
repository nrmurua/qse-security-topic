At the moment, running dev_tools/builds-docs.sh takes several minutes. It would be convenient if we could only build the documentation that has been changed, which should hopefully take seconds instead of minutes.
This can be done by temporarily rewriting the api.rst file to only contain classes and objects from the modified files. Which require some sort of "where did you come from?" analysis.
Closing in favor of #2477
