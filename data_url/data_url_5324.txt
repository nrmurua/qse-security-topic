Currently DDSIM uses OpenMP to parallelize the hybrid Schrodinger-Feynman simulation approach. There are two places where OpenMP is used:
The DDSIM project provides Python wheels that essentially bundle all needed libraries into a portable wheel. OpenMP is known to cause all kinds of troubles/incompatibilities (see, e.g., pytorch/pytorch/issues/44282 or dmlc/xgboost/issues/1715).
As a consequence, it would be great to get rid of this dependency altogether.
With the near-term integration of #30, the taskflow (https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow) library is available as an external dependency of DDSIM. It is certainly possible to reformulate the above use cases in taskflow.
Any contributions are welcome!
#30 is merged. Next step: Get rid of the OpenMP dependency :)
