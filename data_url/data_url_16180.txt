qiskit-terra version: master
gate.control() where gate is a U3 gate may result in an incorrect controlled gate.
This creates a matrix:
You can check that this matrix is incorrect. This bug was introduced in #5342 . In particular in the changes in qiskit/circuit/add_control.py. These changes only affect how the global phase in the input gate is handled.
This is perhaps not quite a MWE. But, omitting the method call circ.power(2) does not trigger the bug, that is the matrix is correct in this case.
I think this might also be fixed by #5588, at least when I check locally the matrix produced by Operator(getcont()) matches the one from Operator(simplecirc()).data ** 2.
This is also fixed by reverting the change @jlapeyre suggested.
Yes. As discussed out of band with @Cryoris, and in agreement with the two comments above, I find that either reverting the change mentioned here, or making the change in the new PR from @Cryoris fixes this issue. But, of course, only either or, not both. There is another closely related bug that I am writing up. We may need to consider them together.
Both our issues are around power/repeat though right? If #5342 fixed some other issues I'm not sure we should revert it. @jlapeyre did you also find problems that are not related to power/repeat?
Exactly, I presume there is a test in  #5342 specifically for the file that implements control, but I did not check. Anyway (as we discussed!) the global phase in repeat is wrong on it's own and needs to be fixed. It was probably two bugs, one in control and one in repeat that cancelled one another.
Fixed by #5588
