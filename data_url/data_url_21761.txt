Successful connection.
You are using old firmware (4.0.dev+1236.g701c93d4) with a newer dashboard (4.0.dev=1483+git0b2661a3).
Please reflash the board completely (not just the storage area) with the same version as the dashboard and this problem should go away.
You shouldn't have to mess with /usr/share "in order to make flashing work". What was the problem exactly?
thank you, now it works!

I had a problem with artiq_flash not finding the bitstreams in an older revision, but I can't reproduce it anymore; now it works fine without the link, thank you!
