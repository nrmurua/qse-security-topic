#7666 introduced the StatePreparation class. However, a couple of places in the documentation have erroneous references to the class, namely:
Checkout documentation at https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.extensions.Initialize.html
Reference in the docs should be to the updated class.
qiskit.circuit.library.data_preparation.StatePreparation seems to be the correct reference.
Thanks for this.  The correct reference is probably actually qiskit.circuit.library.StatePreparation - the important thing here is which module the object is documented as living under, not the fully specified path.  To do things more easily, though, we can use Sphinx's search functionality: a reference to :class:`.StatePreparation` (note the leading dot) will trigger a suffix lookup, and will find the class wherever it is.
Oh! I wrote that initially then changed it to the full path later ðŸ˜…. Thanks for the explanation.
The search functionality seems great and better as it would prevent changing docstrings on future refactors (I think?).
