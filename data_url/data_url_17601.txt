If a Qiskitenv conda env exists but is not a case-match for the name of the env as specified in the Makefile then running make will result in an attempt to create the pre-existing env and an error message. It's harmless, but annoying (and this makes for a good first contribution since I fixed it and I'll try to pull requestf or it).
Recognize the conda env already exists since they're case insensitive.
Do a case insensitive test:
if test $(findstring qiskitenv, $(shell conda info --envs | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')); then \
Fixed via #1693
