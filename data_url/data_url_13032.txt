In an interview with a Mitiq user this week, we heard that Mitiq can be noticeably slower when using large non-Cirq circuits.
The scope of this issue is to diagnose the extent of this issue. This means answering the question how much more time does it take to use some of Mitiq's core functionality with non-Cirq circuits, than it does with Cirq circuits? As for "core functionality" I suggest we test both ZNE and PEC. Since we only want to test the conversion portion of this pipeline, executors and such can be mocked. In essence, fill out a table like this:
If there are dramatic differences, we will create an issue(s) to help alleviate this problem to the extent that we can.
