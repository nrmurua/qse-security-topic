@tehruhn and I found that trying to install qutip from pip with the latest python 3.9 fails. When we run the installations from a fresh conda env (conda 4.8.5) using pip as
or with conda (using both)
we get different errors. The errors do not occur if we use python3.8 while creating the conda environment as
Looking at the error it seems there is specification that prohibits python 3.9. @jakelishman @Ericgig any idea  about this?
qutip has binary built extensions and we distribute binary releases through conda.  These generally have to be built against a specific version of CPython, so we haven't released a cp39 candidate package yet, and conda will recognise that as effectively a requirement that python<3.9.
pip should install from source, because we haven't yet built wheels to distribute that way (though I've been looking into that a bit more recently), so the error will likely be completely different - what sort of error do you get from that?
Closing this now, unless you have more problems - QuTiP has binary release candidates for 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 on conda-forge (I think they rebuilt 4.5.2 since this issue), and I couldn't reproduce any build failures on pip with 3.9.
