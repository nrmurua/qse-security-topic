Some of our CI tests are not repeatable (with respect to getting the same answers in back to back runs), and this can cause 2 issues.
For example, nvqpp_VQEH2Builder can take anywhere from ~20 seconds to >10 minutes.
There are at least 3 reasons for our non-repeatability.
This part is obviously up for debate, but I'd recommend we provide a new variant of cudaq::random_vector() where we allow the caller to set the seed, and then in the tests that need it, we specify the seed. I believe that is qaoa_maxcut.cpp, vqe_h2.cpp, qaoa_max_cut_builder.cpp, vqe_h2_builder.cpp, ChemistryTester.cpp, and mqpu_tester.cpp. Furthermore, I'd recommend that we find an improved way to set the number of OMP threads. Perhaps that means we set it to 1 for most tests. Or perhaps we find a way to make OpenMP more repeatable.
I believe this new issue is somewhat related to Issue #191, but it's broader than #191.
@1tnguyen had a good finding described here. We should probably do his suggestion under a new PR associated with this issue.
