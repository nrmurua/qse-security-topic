We should lift the fidelity estimation notebook into our regular docs/tutorials folder.
Currently it's also untestable as it fails with:
@balopat Lifting the notebook is trivial, but where can the direct_fidelity_estimation.py file be put? This is the only place where an import examples.Something is done? I don't see a good place for it to be imported. However, I don't know whether removing the notebook is an option either.
Also affecting stabilizer_code if #3935 gets accepted.
