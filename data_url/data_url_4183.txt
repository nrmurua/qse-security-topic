I am using the tikz output for a circuit, but the gates are not drawn in the order I am sending them. How can I force the gates to be in the specified order?
Could you post a minimal working example that reproduces your issue ? Without context it is difficult to understand your exact problem.
That being said, the CircuitDrawer does not perform any gate reordering. This probably occurs because you have an optimiser (or other) engine somewhere in your engine list that may cache gates before sending them further down the pipeline.
I am using MainEngine(CircuitDrawer()) to draw, and nothing else.
I will post an example, but  away from the source code.
So you do have by default a few optimiser engines that may cache some gates on some qubits but not on others.
One solution would be to insert eng.flush() statements after each gates or simply remove all the optimisers from your engine list:
I see. Thank you.
I made sure that only the CircuitDrawer is used in the MainEngine.
The circuit look like in the attached figure.

Is it because of the ComputeEngine?
@Takishima: Please reopen this issue.
_to_latex.py is the source of evil in the reordering of gates. (see line 269) The gates are not drawn in the order they were appended to the circuit, but on a line-by-line basis (wire-by-wire basis). If a certain gates are left undrawn (due to its precedence in the gate - list), then the preceding gates are drawn.
This is like a topological sort of drawing the circuit, and not the user specified order.
