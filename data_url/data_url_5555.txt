It's somewhat confusing that setting approximation=True is necessary to get the exact expectation value. For example, consider this sentence from the documentation:
If None and approximation is True, it calculates the exact expectation values.
I suggest renaming the argument to simulate_sampling_error or just simulate_error.
Hi @hhorii this PR is ready for review.
Yes. This requires some DeprecationWarning. I'll redesign overall with options (with flexible dataclass) align with qiskit-ibm-runtime.
