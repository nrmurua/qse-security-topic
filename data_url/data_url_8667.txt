qutip.testing.run() returns "Ran 0 tests in 0.000s \ OK" after installing QuTip 2.2.0 with f90 solver on OSX 10.8
This was reproducible on two macs. Before installing with fortran solver the QuTip installation and testing function normally. After installation with fortran solver the testing returns the above message. The installation seems to be fine though: mcsolve_f90 ran successfully in my simulation, and QuTip examples appear to work normally.
To get fortran to compile I installed Xcode developer tools, and gfortran for OSX Mountain Lion from HPC following instructions from http://web.mit.edu/mfloyd/www/computing/mac/gfortran/
Hi. Thanks for reporting this problem. I'm not sure what the reason for this behavior might be. Do you see the same thing when you install with and without the f90 solver? Are you running the tests in the python interpreter or from IPython?
This problem appears to have resolved itself. Testing now runs correctly.
The only change to the system has been keeping SciPy packages up to date using the Enthought Canopy package manager. Originally the problem only occurred when installing with the f90 solver, installing without the f90 solver everything ran normally. I was using IPython to run the tests. Testing now runs successfully from IPython (qtconsole and notebook) and from the python interpreter.
