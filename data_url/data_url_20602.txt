I saw in some blogs that you can change algorithm with engine and mark the changed algorithm in RSA_mothod, DSA_method etc. If I want to change signature algorithm in this case, what should I do? What's the relation between RSA and dilithium for example?
Thanks for your interest in OQS-OpenSSL. Did you read the TLS demo section in the README? I'm a bit uncertain, though, what you mean by "relation" between RSA and dilithium? Both can operate as signature algorithms, but obviously have pretty different cryptographic properties. Would it be helpful to point to the blog you read? If you want to use an OpenSSL engine, please check out this subproject but be aware that both the engine concept as well as that code base is not exactly actively supported any more (see OpenSSL Strategic Architecture on engines vs providers).
Closing due to inactivity. Please re-open if the issue persists (and provide further input as per the questions above).
