If a QuantumInstance has a bound_pass_manager but not an unbound_pass_manager, QuantumInstance.transpile will use bound_pass_manager even on unbound circuits. This happens silently, which can be misleading for the user, see the discussion here
Initialize a QuantumInstance with no pass_manager but with  bound_pass_manager.
No immediate solution comes to mind, but I think at the very least terra should throw a warning that this is happening.
No response
The original issue was from usage by Qiskit Machine Learning which was resolved there in the PR there linked above. QuantumInstance is deprecated and soon to be removed. Since it was resolved in ML and since no feature changes will be happending to QI ahead of its removal I am closing this.
