We need to update the QCS SDK bindings such that they return opaque pointers to internal data types instead of serializing them as dictionaries.
See qcs-sdk-rust#208
Should we close this out, since all the work is captured in the referenced qcs-sdk-rust issue?
Yeah, I think we are good to close this out. We removed all the serialization code from qcs-sdk-rust in favor of opaque pointers.
