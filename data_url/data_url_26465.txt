When running the latest regtest python scripts with python3.9 I get
Copying test files ... done
Traceback (most recent call last):

I thought the new requirement was python version >= 3.8?
Is this the complete message? I does not seem to contain the actual error.
Generally, I'm trying to keep the do_regtest.py as backwards compatible as possible. It should work with Python 3.6 and perhaps even 3.5.
Sorry, missed the last line (now update).
Here is the same for python 3.6

It fails to parse one of the TEST_FILES files.
You can add a print statement here to figure out the offending file and one here to find the specific line.
Thank you. I had introduced an error in TEST_FILES and updated the do_regtest.py at the same time.
