When an instruction has a label, the label should be used. If a no-boxing instruction has a label, a box should be used.

Something like the text drawer:
"Unitary" can be fixed by using op.op.label  in matplotlib.py
I'm trying to find a better way...
When the text is long, it comes out of the box.
In order to fix it elegantly, some more knowledge seems to be needed.  I think I need to study more about qiskit code.
I hope somebody can fix this issue.
When the text is long, it comes out of the box.
I think @mtreinish had somes ideas about how to dynamically adjust the box
This should be fixed for all gates not just unitary. When op.op.label exists, it should always take precedence over op.name. And the box width should be adjusted accordingly.
