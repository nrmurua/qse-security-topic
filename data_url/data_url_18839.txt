pyright errors due to ast.QubitDeclaration.size not having a value.
Notice that QubitDeclaration.size is an integer and should be hinted as a IntegerLiteral, rather than an Expression.
pyright passes
replace
size: Optional[Expression] = None
with
size: Optional[IntegerLiteral] = None
It can also be an Expression built from types declared const, such as
As long as the type of the expression in the size is const uint[?], it's valid, so we need Expression to represent that.
OK, I see.  I think the openqasm3 repo is not accommodating of pyright.  I will disable pyright for my codes that import openqasm3.
There's a pretty large chance that there's minor typing errors somewhere, but that particular one should already work?  An IntegerLiteral is a subclass of Expression, so having an AST node
should still type check just fine.  If there are full typing errors in the AST package, please do report them - it might be a bug.
(Apologies if you knew this already, but the size field would generally be an ast.IntegerLiteral node, not a raw Python int - if you're supplying a raw Python int, that might be where a typing error is coming from?)
