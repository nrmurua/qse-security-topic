When applying an RZ gate to a circuit, the function calls the sz attribute on the Register, which does not exist.
Probably .size should be called instead.
When calling rz in the following manner:
with target a QuantumRegister I get the exception
Replace .sz by .size
Should be fairly self-explanatory.
Add an rz gate to my circuit.
rx and ry contain the same code. (You should apply DRY here)
This is tracked in #352. I will push a fix soon.
Sorry about the duplication
no worries, thanks for looking at the code in detail and raising the issues.
