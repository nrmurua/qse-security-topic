The options object from in the fake backends don't get passed down to the underlying simulator.
100 should print not 1024
In the run() method defined in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/test/mock/fake_backend.py#L118 we should copy self.options and set the internal simulator backend object's options attribute to be that copy. This will propagate any changes made by the user to the options to the underlying simulation when we call the internal simulator backend's run() method.
I would like to work on this issue @mtreinish. Could you please complete what you observed in the "What is happening?" section?
Assigned to you @bopardikarsoham! Remember to read the contributing guidelines and let us know if you have any questions!
I think the unfinished sentence in "What is happening" is just a typo and there should be enough in the rest of the description for you to get started ðŸ˜„
