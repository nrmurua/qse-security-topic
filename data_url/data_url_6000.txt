Running tests with cvxpy 1.1.0 installed fails:
https://travis-ci.com/github/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/jobs/342857594#L14782
They pass
Find underlying cause of the failure and open a bug on cvxpy if necessary.
It looks like 1.1.1 did not fix the failure so we'll still have to keep the cap. It looks like other people are seeing this too: https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy/issues/1051 so it's probably not an aer bug. But let's keep this open to track the cap
Would you like the cvxpy devs to look at this? My guess is there's an issue with mixed eigenvalues.
@SteveDiamond yeah that would be great. I haven't found the time to dig into it myself
I can simplify the problem a little. The following optimization fails because of non-DCP:
Until we understand what's going on in CVXPY, I'm removing the test (in #832). I tried debugging my code but could not find any concrete problem with it.
@gadial the problem solves fine with the master branch of cvxpy. I also pushed a new version with the fix.
