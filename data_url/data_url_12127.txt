Currently all contains of calibrating a qubit tutorial use level1 measurement and the measured quantum state is expressed by normalized microwave amplitude. The behavior of get_amplitude helper function is unintelligible at first glance, and there are meaningless initial parameters to be set for Rabi curve fitting because measured microwave amplitude depends on backend hardware. Using level 2 measurement may improve this tutorial.
Running Rabi Experiment
use level2 measurement and the vertical axis of Rabi figure should be replaced by <sigma_z>.
Measuring the IQ Distribution from the 0 and 1 States
no change
Running Rabi Experiment with Different Frequencies
use level2 measurement and the color axis of figure should be replaced by <sigma_z>
This is no longer in scope as the tutorials should not require access to the devices
