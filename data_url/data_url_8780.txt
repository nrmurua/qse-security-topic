Currently running a SimulaQron network involves a number of bash scripts:
These scripts do not have a standard interface (e.g. "--help" prints help message) and are difficult to understand for people without knowledge of Linux and bash scripting.
Furthermore bash has a large number of pit-falls which are easy to fall into (e.g. forgetting to escape variables using "" can cause problems).
Moving to a single python CLI entry-point for interacting with a SimulaQron network.
