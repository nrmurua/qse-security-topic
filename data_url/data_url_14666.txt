The Schedule and ScheduleBlock object should have a method to get all pulses used within them. Currently, each pulse does not have a unique name within a Schedule so it must be a list of pulses, unless we modify each Instruction to have a unique name with the Schedule/ScheduleBlock (what do you think here @nkanazawa1989 ?)
This would look like
It might also be desirable to supply a method to get a pulse by name.
I will try this one
Thank you very much! I've assigned to you. Please feel free to ask questions you may have.
Hi @taalexander is this issue still open? I'd be happy to help with this one if needed, I'm looking for a good first issue and saw this one in the list.
Sorry I missed this. This sounds like a library in the assembler.

What is the purpose of this method?

What do you mean @nkanazawa1989 ?

I can reassign this to you if you still wish @Aku-Silvenius
@taalexander please do reassign, happy to work on this. So my understanding is that the following is needed:
Thank you @Aku-Silvenius. 1., and 2. seem good. We will also need to verify the behavior of 2 when two pulses have the same name. If this is not already happening we should deduplicate pulses (modify the name of the pulse) if one exists with the same name when added to a schedule.
Hi @Aku-Silvenius , Are you still working on this?
@Aku-Silvenius Hey, just want to check in to see if you are still working on this issue. Please let us know if you need any help!
as there is no response from the original assignee I am un-assigning so this issue is now open for others to pick up ðŸ˜„
I would like to try this
