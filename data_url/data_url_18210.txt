I built the latest cpp simulator on my computer and it can't run any programs because it throws an error.
The cpp simulator should run my QASM program; but it isn't.
contents of test_load.json:
Hmmm, it is currently a bit hidden in the simulator documentation, but at the moment the simulator is meant to accept a full QObj as a parameter - which has a different structure than the json you are currently passing. The actual error (basic_ios::clear: iostream error) is also a bit misleading, but it seems to be related to not being able to parse the input according to what it expects.
We are actually working on a clearer definition of the QObj, but in the meantime, it might help to check what is passed to the simulator here. Would this be useful to your needs? Depending on your use case, it might also be worth considering using the existing functionality to generate the JSON, which you can then use indepently, using a variation of:
And then use myjson.json as input when running the simulator manually.
@vtomole I'm closing this issue per @diego-plan9 explanation. Anyway, if you feel that we should reopen it, ping me and I will do so.
I also noticed that. Commenting the line
ifile.exceptions(std::ifstream::failbit | std::ifstream::badbit);
solved it for me.
