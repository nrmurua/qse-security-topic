Often when writing code that uses Engine you really want a Sampler so that you can easily swap in a simulator. It seems unwieldy to have both these classes around and one kind of has to look around or be told about QuantumEngineSampler to realize it exists.
Ok the plan is to make Engine implement Sampler by moving keyword arguments from Engine.run to Engine.__init__.
It would also be useful to implement a "copy" method that creates a new engine instance with some parameters changed (for example you might want to change JobConfig or priority but leave auth info the same). Then you can do things like:
