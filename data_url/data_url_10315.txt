should prefer the solver with the highest
Alternative would be to just handle this in LeapHybridSampler, something like
I am actually inclined to go with the alternative (just doing it in LeapHybridSampler), but thought I should open the discussion.
I would go with the alternative.
The default order_by="avg_load" tries to balance the load (within the group of solvers that satisfy all constraints/features).
Changing that to prefer version, but only for hybrid solvers, seems unintuitive.
