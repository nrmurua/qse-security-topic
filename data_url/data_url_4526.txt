The parameter conventions we use for some gates in Qibo are different when compared to other libraries. For example compare the U3 gate in Qibo with the corresponding gate in Qiskit. The difference is only a global phase which will not change the physics but will change the state vectors simulated and may confuse some users.
The issue mainly appears if one tries to build circuits using OpenQASM code. Particularly a Qasm command like:
will create a different gate in Qibo and Qiskit. Given that OpenQASM was published by IBM, I would guess that Qiskit's conventions should be considered the "correct" ones.
Two potential solutions to this are the following:
The second solution is slightly more complicated and may be more confusing.
I prefer the first solution as well. @igres26 do you see problems if we adopt the qiskit convention?
I am fine with adopting the Qiskit convention if that is what the community uses. It might have value to double-check other libraries to see if this is a wide spread convention or only a Qiskit one.
I had a look at our definition of U3 and we are using the original qasm paper expressions from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03429.pdf, so I believe we can keep our original convention in order to avoid confusion, and eventually change that in the future if we identify clear advantages.
