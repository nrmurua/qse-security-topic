Looks related to #991
@1ucian0, I made a fix for issue #991  (the bug you found with MPS on QFT) in PR #1188 . I would like to check if the fix is relevant for this bug as well. However, I am unable to run this example on master (only on stable). Can you update the test case to run on master?
Could it be that is already solved in master?
@1ucian0 This should be fixed by #1188 which was just merged into master. You can reopen if you find more bugs
I think there is another bug here, I am investigating at the moment. Let's keep it open until I understand more.
I think we can finally close this one now
