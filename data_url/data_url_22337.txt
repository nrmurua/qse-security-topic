Using 1.0 on Windows. If I start the gui and enable 2 plot_xy applets with the default commands,
And then try to close the GUI , the applet goes blank and some of the windows don't close, and the windows then say they're not responding.

I then get a python is not responding notification.
The artiq_gui traceback looks like this,
This seems to happen quite reliably as long as there are at least two applets open, at least one of which calling a dataset that is empty. This happened using the big number applet as well.
