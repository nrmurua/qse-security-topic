Currently ion and neutral, which are devices plus decomposition methods sit at the top level of cirq and get imported into the cirq.* namespace.  Having these as top level modules is a bit odd since they are really about a particular device (and gates).  I suggest that we move the files in these directories into the devices module (or maybe subdirectories of devices?)
I think they are generic enough that we can keep them at the cirq.* namespace, (aqt relies on them as does the coming pasqal).
The question then comes up about the device in aqt.  But aqt is an api, so I think having api's in submodules cirq.aqt and cirq.google which also have devices is a good encapsulation.
Alternative: create separate module which contains them (architectures)?
This is part of #3228. I believe that we should do this.
xref #5130 , #5128
Discussion from cirq cync:  Let's move neutral atoms into Pasqal, let's either move IonDevice into ionq (or delete it).  Reason is that neither is used by more than one package.  cirq-core will have a stronger deprecation policy so let's put them into vendor packages, so that, if needed, they can be a feature add rather than a later deletion.
