I tried to execute the examples from
7_different_qubit_technologies.ipynb
When I executed aqt_provider.backends(),
Why did I only find the aqt device 'aqt_innsbruck' without the 'aqt_qasm_simulator'?
Then I tried the first example 'standard GHZ state',
there was always some errors.

How can I solve this problem?
Thanks!

It does now if you sign up for an account with them.
