Warn when using elements shorter than 250 points that software sequencing mode is used which has several limitations including not being able to jump and trigger on elements in the middle of the sequence. This happens silently and is first revealed when trying to turn on the channel. Furthermore,
remote activating the channel with awg.ch1_state(1) fails silently
See Sequencer Mode in the awg5k7.chm help file
Note: For subsequences, only the software sequencer mode is used.
