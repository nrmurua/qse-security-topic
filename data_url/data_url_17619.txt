I'm using qasm to generate a circuit. In this qasm (used in previous version) I had following definition
gate hx a { u2(0,0) a; }
and used it as such
hx q;
or
hx q[0];
when I try to use it now i get following error:
qiskit.qiskiterror.QiskitError: "unknown operation for ast node name hx"
and the script finishes executing (obviously).
Just try to define gate as proposed above and use it in a qasm-generated circuit.
The defined gate gets accepted and processed appropriately.
There may be new way to define gates in qasm, I, however, failed to find it.

Thank you very much.
