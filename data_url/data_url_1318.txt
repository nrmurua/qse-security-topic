Description of the issue
In the Cirq modules documentation, at the bottom, the command line to list modules is given as
but in fact, attempting to use --list will result in an error, because the argument should actually be list (without the dashes).
How to reproduce the issue
In a shell, with the current directory being the top of the Cirq repo, running python dev_tools/modules.py --list results in the following error:
Cirq version
0.15.0.dev
Discussion: this has already been fixed.
Fixed by #5638
