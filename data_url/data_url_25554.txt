Currently, some of the node values that are being written to the DB field are stored as TransportableObjects which is not consistent with DB schema. Furthermore, some of the filenames are called .txt files but stored as pickle files. These need to be changed.
Acceptance criteria:
Separate issue for the .log and .txt files #837
To recap our Slack conversation, the schema will be updated to reflect that the files now hold TransportableObjects. The UI should not deserialize TransportableObjects but instead access the string representation of the decoded object via the object_string attribute. See here and  here for how the TransportableObject lattice and node attributes were presented to the UI using the old DB schema.
A potential future revision would be to store the JSON-representations of the TransportableObjects, not the object instances, and reconstitute the TransportableObjects when reading from the datastore.
