Hi , was trying to run qft on qasm simulator and it works fine , but one observation that i made was that when i run qft on higher number of qbits ( greater that 17 ), the simulator still uses only one cpu with 100% usage and all the other cpu are not utilized.
Is there a way we can make use of all the cpu available on the machine.
For me out of 56 cores only one is being utilized .
I am using qiskit-terra/qiskit/providers/basicaer/qasm_simulator.py for running my experiments
Did you try the Backend Options for Qasm simulator?
It has parameters where you can set max parallel  cores, threads, etc.
Let me know if you have any doubt

@deeplokhande  "max_parallel_threads" option is available in qasm_simulator  present in qiskt-aer module which is cpp implementation  with support of OpenMP and uses all the core by default .  But i am trying to parallelize the python implementation of qasm_simulator  that's available in qiskit-terra/qiskit/providers/basicaer/qasm_simulator.py
Any help or pointers in that directions are appreciated .
The basicaer simulators is... well... basic. It's full point of existence is to provide some simulation capabilities included in terra. For any slightly serious work, qiskit-aer is the way to go.
I'm closing this as wont fix, but feel free to reopen if you think you might have a use-case for basicaer that aer does not cover.
(also, would it make sense to raise a warning if you try to use basicaer with "big" circuits, pointing users into the qiskit-aer direction?)
