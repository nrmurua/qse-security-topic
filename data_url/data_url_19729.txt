Recent changes in the imports in qiskit/ignis/verification/__init__.py make many (maybe all) verification tests fail. I wonder how in the first place it was technically possible to merge code with failing tests.
The current state of master passed all the unit tests prior to merging. The branch protection settings on master prevent merging a PR unless travis succeeds. I am also not able to reproduce this locally. I expect this is a local issue in your environment caused by having a stale directory or pycache from before import changes. Try running git clean -fdX in the repo prior to running the tests.
Solved when I ran git clean -fdX in the Terra clone. Thanks @mtreinish !
