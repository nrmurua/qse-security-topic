At times when there is a burst of workflow dispatches to the covalent server, status of certain workflows fail to update to complete and are left in the RUNNING state even when the computations have finished. It always seems to happen after all tasks in a workflow have finished. It seems as if the final update to the database gets skipped occasionally.

After starting covalent, one can run the all the tasks in the notebook tests/stress_tests/stress.ipynb to reproduce this issue
When the notebook is run, a burst of workflows get dispatched to the covalent server which can result in some DB writes to get missed resulting in the UI not being able to update/display the correct status of a workflow
