when I using jit as the decorator it failed to transfer Tensor to Numpy
'0.2.2'
jit 函数里面不能转 numpy，这个是预期行为，建议把 numpy 转换放到 jit 函数外部。另外建议升级下 tc 的版本，现在已经 0.8 了。 Therefore, you must put the numpy function outside of the jitted function, this is the designed behavior for tf and jax's jit
closed for now, if you have further question on this issue feel free to reopen it
