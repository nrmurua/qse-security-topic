Hi!
I'm now using lockbox module, but the website of pyrpl have a little information, Could you give me a more detailed document or update your pyrpl website?
The  other question is when i running pyrpl GUI's lockbox module to lock frequency,  which configure is CustomLockbox. The fast output is out2 and slow output is pwm0, now i need to record the fast output and  slow output voltage,could you have any suggest?
Thanks!
Jim
