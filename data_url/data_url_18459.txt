CL-QUIL has gate fusion, but it only fuses trivial cases that never make the program "worse". The following are prototypes of what gets fused:
Currently, gates operating on different qubits aren't fused, e.g.
Sometimes, fusing these cases can simplify a program significantly and make things faster. In fact, on the QVM, 2q gates are faster than 1q gates. So It Would Be NIce (TM) if we could fuse, putting a limit on the maximum gate size or something like that. It Would Also Be Nice if we could fuse intelligently so as to open the most opportunities to fuse as much as possible.
