As far as I understand, this is against our philosophy; we do not want the __init__ of a driver to change the state of the instrument.
I agree with the philosophy.
So, for HP, i think we can get rid of it.
But for agilent, it looks like a safety thing (to set everything to 0).
Safety... -it's just a signal generator. I'd say it's an arbitrary choice, just like an amplitude of 0.1

ok. then no mercy to "state changes in __init__".
