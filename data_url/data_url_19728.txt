Having binary pickle files stored and executed is a security risk and they need to be removed from all tests.
This also makes the tests difficult to reproduce because the method of generating the target data in the pickle files is not anywhere in the code base.
A list of the tests that have pkl files:
 accreditation
 characterization (Pickle files generation for characterization fitters #387)
 measurement_calibration
 quantum_volume
 rb
A possible solution is to replace the pickle files with json files.
Usually, the pickle files contain the experiment results. These results can be saved in json format, here is a code example.
Code example:
Output:

During this work, be aware that according to #98, need to refrain from running simulators inside tests. Storing the result in a json file, as described above, is great.
Closed by #411, I will make a follow up issue for scripts to generate new JSON files.
