I encountered some problem in running my code using pyquil at qcs-qmi.rigetti. So I checked again the VQE tutorial https://github.com/rigetti/forest-tutorials/blob/master/notebooks/VariationalQuantumEigensolver.ipynb . I changed
to
in order to get the compiler involved., but get the COMPILER-DOES-NOT-APPLY error at the step of qc.experiment.
If useful, provide a numbered list of the steps that result in the error.
Otherwise, just fill out the "Code Snippet" and "Error Output" sections below.
Operating System:
Python Version (python -V): Python 3.7.4
Quilc Version (quilc --version):
QVM Version (qvm --version):
Python Environment Details (pip freeze or conda list):
@yaoyongxin I believe this should be fixed in the latest version of the compiler. Issue sudo update_forest_sdk on your QMI to get the fix.
