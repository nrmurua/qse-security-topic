Hi everyone,
I am curious why we can remove the charge impedance noise when calculating the effective T1 and T2 of transmon. This code is from scqubits/scqubits/core/transmon.py
Thanks in advance!!
In most experimental setups, these days, qubits are typically not directly coupled to an open transmission line, but instead live behind some (detuned) resonator. For "typical" parameters the t_charge_impedance would completely dominate any sort of t1 that you get from any of the other channels we implement. Since this situation is not applicable to most people, we removed this channel being the default (i.e. used when, say, the effective noise is calculated).
Having said that, as this noise channel is a supported one, you can manually include it in any calculations you're doing. Also worth stressing that t1_charge_impedance optionally can take the impedance Z(omega) as a parameter, allowing one to not just model open transmission lines, but also arbitrary environment-circuits.
Thanks for your question. I will close this for now, but please let me know if you have other thoughts.
