Describe the bug
I am trying to use your GHZ demo in order to build  and demonstrate a blockchain consensus algorithm for a project I am working on. I have gone through your installation, set up the virtual environment and have successfully been able to run templater.py and the test python script that is created from it.
I do not have a C++ compiler so I did what the instructions told me and removed the ProjectQ requirement in requirements.txt. One thing I have noticed is that the GHZ code at https://tqsd.github.io/QuNetSim/_build/examples/anonymous_transfer.html is different from the one in the repository. Regardless, I failed to have either work... The one in the repository did not work because it require ProjectQ (which I previously mentioned I omitted). I copied the code in the html into a file named GHZ.py and ran the code failed as seen below.

Additional context
I am just starting to get comfortable with your project. I found it to be the best quantum network simulator I have seen. I want to learn as much as I can and may want to build my own backend eventually. I would appreciate an guidance and/or help.
Thanks for your report.
I'll look into this right away. We've made some updates lately and maybe the issue is solved with a version update.
I'll post back with an update.
I was able to reproduce this and now I'm looking into the issue.
@witt-designs If you update the pip library to 0.1.0post3, we've (@benjione and I) uploaded a new version with the fix.
Thanks for pointing out the bug!
