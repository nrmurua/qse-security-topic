Looks like there are some illegal keyword arguments being passed to all target variants.

It looks to me like the 'dds' argument should only be passed if the 'tester' variant was selected.  Modifying this to the following:
fails in another way:
I don't think anyone uses kasli.py anymore and it should be removed/trimmed/merged with kasli_generic.py.
Your documentation says to use that flow:  https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual/developing.html
Do you want some help with a PR to clean this up?  Tell me what to do and I'll have a go.  What is the "correct" way to build Kasli? Using a JSON file with kasli_generic?
For now yes but such documentation will also need to be updated again when the aforementioned removal/merge of kasli.py happens.
What's the issue with updating documentation?
Where are there any generic JSON description files in the artiq repo?  Or should I just copy one from artiq-zynq?
We are still using the base classes (MasterBase, etc.) for custom gateware internally that is not exposed via the JSON interface here, so "getting rid of kasli" should only involve the default Master/Satellite and command line builder.
