Cirq 0.8 is out. Lets see if we can upgrade to depending on it.
It seems that TFQ 0.2 is not suitable for Cirq 0.8. I expect the new version of TFQ.
Yes. TFQ 0.2 does NOT work with cirq 0.8. We also made the mistake of accidentally doing cirq >=0.7.0 in our setup.py file for 0.2. This will be changed when the next TFQ comes out and pin us to a particular version so a user doesn't accidentally install cirq 0.8 and have tfq error out when using it.
