Example use case:
The user wrote a complex pulse template. The user now wants to add a channel with a constant value to that pulse template (for example a marker channel with value '0').
Idea:
Wrap all returned waveforms with a MultiChannelWaveform that sets the added channels to the given value.
Was implemented with #429
