Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
The only place that uses atol in that function is cirq.linalg.linalg.allclose_up_to_global_phase and it too takes in a default atol.
Describe the solution you'd like
Make atol an optional argument for assert_circuits_with_terminal_measurements_are_equivalent.
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
Passing in 1.0e-8 each time I call assert_circuits_with_terminal_measurements_are_equivalent which can be a bit of a hassle.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
