mesolve([],...) fails while mesolve(identity,...) works
There is no failure if rhs_reuse is not involved.
Offtopic: is qutip trying to decide on its own when to use rhs_reuse? I had this phantom bug that never appeared in the ipython notebook, but appeared in batch scripts.
[] is a list while 'identity' is function, so they will invoke two different type of time-dependent functions (list-string or list-function type or function callback type, respectively). rhs_reuse only applies to the list-string type, so it should only affect the first type of call to mesolve. It might be that we have a bug in handing of empty lists as first argument to mesolve, I will look into that.
Regarding rhs_reuse it can behave a bit differently in a script and the notebook because a notebook is one long-running python process, so the state of rhs_reuse might be retained from one call to mesolve to another, while a script would get reset between successive calls (runs of the script). I guess this is the reason for the backtrace error you show. Note that you cannot use rhs_reuse with successive calls to mesolve if you change the function signature. If this is not the case, then it would be useful with a small minimum example (script or notebook) that reproduces the error.
ps..
In your second use-case you qouted mesolve(identity, ..). In this case I would rather use mesolve(identity(), ..), so that the first argument is a Qobj instance rather than the function that returns one.
I'm not able to reproduce this so perhaps it has been fixed.
