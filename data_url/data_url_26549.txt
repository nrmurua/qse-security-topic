I haven't found this option in the new do_regtest script but it was available in the old one: Retesting failed tests of the last run.
It might also be interesting to have an option to explicitly skip certain directories.
I've implemented --skipdir via ccdbba7.
I actually don't want to implement the re-run feature because regtest reports are difficult to parse and I feel it would bloat the do_regtest.py script unreasonably.
