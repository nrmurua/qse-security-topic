.from_dict() will error out if (actual) complex numbers are present where complex numbers should be present. It's requiring that complex numbers be specified as lists when it should instead allow them to be specified as lists but also allow them to be complex numbers
See these currently failing unit tests
There's no reason for it to fail - when serializing things we should change complex to lists but '_deserialization' (from_dict) should be able to handle complex numbers (as well as the list format).
Don't throw an error if the thing we're trying to deserialize is already a complex number here
