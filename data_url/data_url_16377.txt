rz gate produces different states when the control and target qubit is switched. Symmetry is not preserved.
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(i)
qc.crz (PI/4, 0, 1)
Switching of target qubit and control qubit should result in the same state vector
I think the issue is using theta/2 instead of theta which is inconsistent with rz gate behaviour which doesn't use theta/2
Correct me if I'm wrong but, CRZ is not symmetric under swapping control and target, right? The applied phase on the states |01> and |10> is different:
but if we swap the role of control and target
Feel free to re-open if I'm missing something
