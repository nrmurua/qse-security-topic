Right now, the schedules are only "equal" if their instructions are the same. This means that schedules are "not equal" if one has an extra ShiftPhase(0, chan) or an extra Delay() anywhere.
The task is to fix this issue.
In particular, with Itoko's new scheduled circuit, the transpile + sequence path yields programs that are functionally equivalent to directly scheduling the circuit, but the resulting schedules are not __equal__. If it can be done efficiently, it should be the default __equal__ implementation.
Just to confirm, under no circumstances should Delay() affect equality?
Hello I want to assigned for this issue. I am new in qiskit but I am interested in Qiskit so may you inform me about issue? I hope this issue is suitable for me.
Hi @Osmanilge ! I can assigned you. You might want to consider continuing the work from @jonathanortega2023 in #5398 by branching out their PR.
@Osmanilge Hey, just want to check in to see if you are still working on this issue. Please let us know if you need help!
as there is no response from the original assignee I am un-assigning so this issue is now open for others to pick up ðŸ˜„
Hello, my name is Yuri Han, and it is my first time participating in an open-source project. I saw this issue is open, so I wanted to know if I could get assigned. I am still in the process of learning Qiskit and Git, so I probably will ask for a lot of help.
Hi @urihan welcome! I can assign to you. If this is your first time contributing to qiskit I recommend taking a look at the following resources, and feel free to reach out if you need any help
Also, for general tips about github and contributing to terra you may also find these workshops helpful:
Hi, @javabster! Thank you for sharing those resources! I will read and watch them carefully. Also, the second link on GitHub/CI tips seems like it's not opening. Can you please check on that?
ah sorry about that! The same content should be covered in the last link i think
