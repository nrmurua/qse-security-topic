If type checks are done locally, the following errors are raised.
Can you post the output of these commands:
@natestemen Looks like my version of mypy is not what's in devrequirements.txt.
Will upgrade to a newer version and check if I get the same errors.
I did not know check-types, check-style and check-format are run for Python 3.11 only.

My local environment was using Python 3.8.10 which still led to one error after installing the requirements as specified in devrequirements.txt.
I propose we close this issue but add details about the checks being restricted to Python 3.11 in #2029 or we could instead change the Contributing guidelines to have a Python 3.11 environment.
We will be dropping support for python 3.8 soon, and I believe these errors do not occur with python 3.9.
Closing this issue as the errors are due to an older Python environment.
