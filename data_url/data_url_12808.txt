In the solution to "Exercise 1: Powers of i" there is a table provided with "Power of i" on top and "Result" on bottom. I believe the answers for i^3 and i^7 should be -i instead of i? I thought my math might be wrong but double checked here and it seems correct

Do you want to open a pull request with a fix? If not, I'll get to fixing it some time over the weekend.
Just made one!
Fixed in #271.
