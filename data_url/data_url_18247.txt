Another topic for discussion thanks to Andreas Fuhrer contribution.
Currently, we do support Anaconda/Conda virtual environment for various platforms (Linux, Mac and Windows). We encourage the use of Anaconda because in some platforms, it comes with a preinstalled version of some our dependencies, more notably numpy, especially on Windows.
I was just wondering if there could be users who want/need to use other virtual environments like virutalenv or virtualenvwrapper, we have to make sure that those new virtual envs work in all supported platforms (thinking mostly about Windows and numpy).
This support could be included in the Makefile's "env" target.
This issue hasn't attracted attention for a while, so closing it to keep repo clean.
Please, feel free to reopen it if considered necessary.
