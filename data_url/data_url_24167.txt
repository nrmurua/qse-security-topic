Please be as descriptive as possible, including: what is expected, why is this feature needed, what is the objective, etc.
It would be useful to be able to add different boundary conditions other than PerfE e.g. impedance, and different excitation methods
In the analysis of kinetic inductance, for instance
pyaedt renderer for Ansys can address this later when released.
