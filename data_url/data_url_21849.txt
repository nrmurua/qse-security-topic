Several kasli variants don't meet timing anymore in the majority of the compilation attempts (HUB, LUH, SUServo last I checked).
c.f. #891
All three now seem to pass timing with Vivado 2018.2 and b0a47ddc + 83c83547 on MiSoC.
Here is the current situation, tested on all 13 variants:
So let's have 14.5 now (CPU clock 113MHz), then use speed grade 3 on Kasli 2.0 (sinara-hw/Kasli#8) and increase it to 16.0 (125MHz) then.
@sbourdeauducq I tried building a DRTIO master (master, not switching) with an 8-channel SUServo and found some quite large timing violations.
Without the higher-speed FPGA, this gives a lot of ~1ns timing violations. With the faster FPGA, it builds fine.
Side note, do the false path constrains look correct, or am I missing something?
Now that we have a lot more variants, this problem is coming back :(
Haven't seen this again recently...
