Currently the decompose method of QuantumCircuit objects utilizes the Decompose transpiler pass to expand gates one level down according to their internally defined decomposition rules. Often, however, one would like to conveniently rewrite their circuit in terms of a specific set of gates. To do this we could add e.g. a translate method to QuantumCircuit which does this;
results in,
