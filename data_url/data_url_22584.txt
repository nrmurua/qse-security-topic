@sbourdeauducq I can't do this, since I don't have admin access to m-labs repositories. Hypothetically it should be enough to point a custom hook to http://101.78.236.68/buildbot/change_hook/github?project=PROJECT where PROJECT is artiq, misoc, migen.
The server seems to return HTTP 500 to github.
Hm:
Hmm maybe it works for actual pushes...
Yeah, I recall something like that. Try it.
Didn't work, still 500.
Should I use json content type or x-www-form-urlencoded?
application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
OK that works now, can you disable auto build for non-master branches?
Done
