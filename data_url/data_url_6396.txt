Now that we just merged in the example, I realized I missed a critical piece of Shor's. Specifically, the integer measured after the inverse QFT represents a fraction of the maximum capacity of the register which can be used to guess the period from continued fraction expansion.
(This is... a pain in the rear, to understand, and to implement in a language like C++.)
This needs to be fixed. It's not first on my list of priorities, but I'll get to after I address the other current development work, if no one else does.
Noted.
See #212. I am testing for edge cases, before merging that.
