Suggestion from @mvd-ows:
SIDH CLN16 uses what I consider to be an anti-pattern. It aborts if NULL was passed in place of one of the parameters. This has the effect that it masks coding errors. For example, passing NULL instead of &alice_msg results in an early return, whereas for all other algorithms, it results in a crash. I strongly recommend implementing a consistent behavior for all algorithms.
