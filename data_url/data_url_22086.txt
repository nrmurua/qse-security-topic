Details? Obviously it doesn't do that every time.
I've flashed that version three times and saw erratic LED blinking each time. That's why I reverted to g07f5e991. What additional information would be helpful?
Does this happen with current master? Does it happen every time?
bb reports timing failed for build of artiq-kc705-phaser for current master. Please let me know when there's a binary available and I'll test again.

Don't assume that if it fails timing on the buildbot it will also do so on your machine - Xilinx software is not that consistent. This bug also smells like the usual intermittent Xilinx breakage, we did not touch that part.
What is it that you want to test that would not work with the previous build?
Anyway, there is a recent package now.
ping
I no longer get this error with build 3.0.dev+1207.g5b26e5de.
