The article "Encoding Electronic Spectra in Quantum Circuits with Linear T Complexity" suggests using Gausslets as a basis, since they are more compact than dual wave basis. Including Gausslets as a basis option is something I would like to see available.
I would like to see this too. However, the Gausslets are quite complicated. This would be a very large project.
