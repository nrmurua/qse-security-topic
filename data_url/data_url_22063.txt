Allows DMA buffers to be stored in the local SDRAM of each Sayma and played back in parallel.
Is this funded?
Yes, by ARL.
Wonderful.
To check: this is still outputs only with a singe DMA engine, right? And, will this work on other DRTIO slaves, such Kasli or a slave Metlino as well, or just Sayma?
This is outputs only, and generic code that in theory should be straightforward to integrate into Kasli as well.
Done.
