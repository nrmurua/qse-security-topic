CMake should look for Thrust library headers and fail gracefully if they are not found when building with AER_THRUST_BACKEND=OMP. Currently it will fail during compiling because it can't find Thrust header files.
We could also consider adding the Thrust library to third-party as a gitmodule so users do not have to download it themselves. Though this is only necessary if they want to build the CPU targeted thrust on a machine without CUDA, which is not default compiler behavior.
This is done right @atilag ?
