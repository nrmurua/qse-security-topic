Hello,
It seems that there is a case sensitivity bug for the reference potential for the vdw potential you choose in &PAIR_POTENTIAL.
In particular, I'm using version 2023.1 of CP2K and if you choose REFERENCE_FUNCTIONAL PBESol, it cannot find the appropriate parameters where as REFERENCE_FUNCTIONAL PBEsol works.
Thanks for reporting. The issue should be fixed now in the current CP2K development version.
