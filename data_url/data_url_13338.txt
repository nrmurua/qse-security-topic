This issue is a first step towards the implementation of learnig-based technique for PEC (see #821 and  #1088).
We currently have a function that generate an OperationRepresentation associated to an operation assuming depolarizing nose.

A preliminary step before implementing the core part of the learning-based PEC technique (see #821 and  #1088), is having a similar function that depends on two noise parameters corresponding to a more general "biased noise" model that depends on two parameters epsilon and eta. Something like:
I am removing this from the 0.13 milestone since I think it is a useful issue but not urgent with respect to time.
Our main objective was planning and approving the associated RFC (see #821 and #1088) and this was done üëç !
