Kasli fails to boot when Phaser is assigned to last available EEM port in JSON.
Disclaimer: I'm not 100% clear on how the EEM ports work with phaser - it has 2 connectors but only one is designated in the JSON. Does it silently use the next one as well?
Regardless, on a Kasli with the extension board connected, there are 12 EEM connectors. If the phaser is assigned to port 11, the gateware build succeeds and can be flashed, but after doing so the Kasli fails to boot. No UART output at all and can't e.g. ping.
If the phaser is actually silently using the second EEM port, that should be in the JSON schema (i.e. not silent). If it's not using the second EEM port, then the build should work. Right?
Fails to boot.
Phaser does not currently use any other EEM ports silently.
Which version of ARTIQ are you building for your crate? I just built the gateware on newest ARTIQ 8 beta branch, and with the exact JSON file you had it built nicely. Flashed it onto a Kasli 1.1 (no cards connected though!) and it booted too.
Does the gateware meet timing? Look for All user specified timing constraints are met. in Vivado logs.
Please use the supported version. Older ones are known to have bugs that manifest themselves with this symptom.
