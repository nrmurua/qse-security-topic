I am new F# and Liquid. my doctorate thesis is about quantum computing. i want to use Liquid for studies.  i have a few questions about liquid.
let ket = Ket(1)
let q = ket.Qubits
my first question: is there anything for bra state (<0|, <1| or <psi|)?
how can i do this operation: |0><0| |psi> or |a>|b><c|
let ket = Ket(1)
let a = ket.Qubits
let ket2 = Ket(1)
let b = ket2.Qubits
my second question: how can i get (|a> + |b>) or (|a>⊗|b>) as c or d that is a  new qubit state
let ket3 = Ket(1)
let c = ket3.Qubits
let ket4 = Ket(2)
let d = ket4.Qubits
c = a + b ?? or
d = a ⊗ b ??
Thank you for your interest.
LIQUi|> was not designed to do arbitrary state vector manipulations. It is intended for simulating unitary quantum operations and measurements. I would suggest using something like Sage (http://www.sagemath.org/) which will give you an online (Python notebook based) tool for manipulating general state arithmetic. This is how I debug new gates that I’m working on. Here a few examples:
