How do I update to cirq version 0.5? I currently have version 0.4, and am getting an import error when I try to import the DensityMatrixSimulator (which I assume is a problem that is arising from having the old version)
pip install cirq --upgrade
Accidentally closed. @sashananda  Did the command i posted work?
Hey @sashananda, did my suggestion work for you?
I'm going to close this as stale. Feel free to ping me if the command I suggested doesn't work.
