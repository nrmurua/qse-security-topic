Currently there is a single header for communication qubit ID measurement outcomes etc from the backend to the application. We should split this up into multiple headers to minimise communication. These changes will make the CQC version to 2. I will make it such that if the backend receives a message which is of version less than 2, then the old notify header will be sent back. I will update the Python library to use CQC version 2 but not the C and rust library for now.
