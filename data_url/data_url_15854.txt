Setting the shots kwarg in execute is no longer obeyed:
gives 1024
Perhaps it is not execute as this also does not work:
also gives 1024.
It's a bug (a pretty obvious one) in the base fake backend class: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/test/mock/fake_backend.py#L151 is missing a **kwargs so none of the runtime options are getting passed through.
Hmm, this also does not work:
gives 1024.
Perhaps a second bug?
Ahh scratch the above, not setting the variable of raw_counts.  Was thinking it was an Aer issue because of that.
