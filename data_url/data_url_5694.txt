When trying to build qiskit-aer, I encounter the following error (build log):
I think this is a bit tricky but the simplest way would be to use conda and conda-build to try to build the recipe in conda-forge/staged-recipes#21404 for qiskit-aer (install conda-build, check out that branch, and run conda-build recipes/qiskit-aer/meta.yaml).
qiskit-aer builds successfully.
Comparing the build environment in the qiskit-aer GitHub Actions CI with the environment from the conda-forge CI (like the one in the build log), what stands out to me is that in the qiskit-aer CI cmake reports the compiler as AppleClang 14.0.0.14000029 while in the conda-forge CI it is reported as Clang 14.0.6. My guess is that _SC_PHYS_PAGES is included in an Apple specific header that the conda build of clang does not include?
Searching for _SC_PHYS_PAGES and osx turns up a few things, mostly related to people trying to compile Linux programs on macOS using gcc. Could qiskit-aer do something like this?
Could you give steps to reproduce this problem? I got following message after pip install conda-build, checked out conda-forge/staged-recipes@15d761a, and conda-build recipes/qiskit-aer/meta.yaml.
Please let me close this issue because of no response in more than 2 months. Please create a new issue if this issue still remains.
Oh, wow, I never noticed that you replied to this. I had been waiting for a response. Can we just reopen this? I will make a new issue if not.
