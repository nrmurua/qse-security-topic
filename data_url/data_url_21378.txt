On Windows, the dashboard does not close.

Verbose log output shown here, only the parts from the moment the window close button is pressed:
the last line keeps repeating (tested up to 2 minutes).
This is a qasync bug, see CabbageDevelopment/qasync@5f6580e. It should go away with qasync 0.25 or 0.26. They have just managed to release a completely broken 0.27.0, so don't update to that (yet).
Do we need to update some dependencies for this somewhere, or provide a newer qasync on the M-Labs channel?
ah good catch, appreciate that. I can work around that, but another option is to set the qasync dependency for artiq to <0.27 for example.
so that would be here https://git.m-labs.hk/M-Labs/nix-scripts/src/branch/master/artiq-fast/conda/artiq.nix#L17 , though actually I don't know why it currently resolves to 0.24.2 conda-forge only serves up to 0.24.2
should be fixed, see conda-forge/qasync-feedstock#14 (comment)
