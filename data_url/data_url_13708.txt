This is a less general function than cirq.testing.random_circuit and unfortunately shares the same name. I propose we get rid of mitiq.utils.random_circuit in favor of cirq.testing.random_circuit. Thoughts?
Also note that cirq.testing.random_circuit, not the mitiq function, is used in mitiq.benchmakrs.random_circ.py.
Good find. Agreed!
Agree!
I can take this issue.
I think there may be a bug in cirq's random circuit function. I'm getting:
@rmlarose Do you get the same thing? This looks like a cirq bug
The problem with single qubit random circuits is that one has to explicitly pass a gate_domain argument which contains only single qubit gates. E.g.
GATE_DOMAIN={ops.X:1, ops.Y:1, ops.Y:1, ops.T:1, ops.H:1, ops.S:1,}
cirq.testing.random_circuit(qubits=1, n_moments=4, op_density=0.99,gate_domain=GATE_DOMAIN)
Good find. I feel like a useful update would be for cirq to notice that you asked for one qubit and then to default to a different one qubit gate set. (or at least to throw a warning) @rmlarose
Thanks @andreamari and @willzeng. I opened an issue on Cirq's GitHub for this. The change really is that simple and I think that should be the default behavior. We'll see what they say.
The PR fixing cirq.testing.random_circuit for single qubit gates was approved and merged. PR #178 removes mitiq.utils.random_circuit to fix this issue.
