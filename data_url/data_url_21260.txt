the urukul coredevice driver defaults to clk_sel = 0 but refclk = 125e6, which is strange since clk_sel = 0 is always the on-board 100 MHz XO;
the AD9910 coredevice driver defaults to pll_n = 40 which produces an invalid sysclk (greater than 1 GHz) when using the Urukul defaults (refclk = 125e6, clk_div = 0 (divide by 4));
When using the artiq_ddb_template, the following JSON snippet leads to a working but inconsistent driver configuration:
artiq_ddb_template most of the time writes refclk = 125e6 and pll_n = 32 [ref] so, indeed, sysclk = 1e9 when clk_div = 0 but this is the same issue as point 1;
Use consistent defaults in AD9910/Urukul coredevice drivers. For example clk_sel = 0, refclk = 100e6, clk_div = 0, pll_n = 40 sounds the safest to me, since the 100 MHz XO is present on all boards and doesn't require extra hardware configuration;
Make artiq_ddb_template set refclk = 100e6 and pll_n = 40 when clk_sel = 0 for AD9910;
Alternatively (to b), make artiq_ddb_template fail when refclk (and pll_n?) is not present. This might make most sense since it would force users to document what the external reference frequency is supposed to be when clk_sel = 2.
I'd be happy to prepare PRs for such patches if there's a consensus.
