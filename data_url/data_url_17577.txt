In the StochasticSwap mapper the Layout class takes up most of the compile time:
Compare to old compile chain, with old swap_mapper (here with a register fix I did):
As you can see, the Layout makes the new swapper ~6x slower than the old one.
The compiler should not be made slower than before.
The mapper should use simpler data structures, e.g. NumPy arrays or the like, and then reconstitute them to the desired format when returning the new DAG.  Once done, we can then look to push the whole routine down to lower code.
@1ucian0 I just pushed a branch that's a start on this. https://github.com/kdk/qiskit-terra/tree/1731-layout-class-takes-up-most-of-compile-time
