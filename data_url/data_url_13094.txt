Latest supported versions of optional dependencies are not well documented. It is unclear which frontend version(s) to install after a user installs through pip install mitiq, but wants to use Qiskit, Pennylane, Braket, and/or PyQuil.
e.g. something like: WARNING: Mitiq is tested with version xxx of Qiskit. Your version is higher and may be incompatible...
Discussed in Mitiq meeting 04/01/22. See this thread on discord.
@andreamari label/change this issue as you see fit. As written I think it would be a good first issue.
Thanks @Aaron-Robertson!
