Current scenario:
Expectation:

PS : @Prasy12  if you are anyway using python backend you can potentially simplify this by doing tthis a=(base64.b64decode(TransportableObject._object.encode("utf-8"))) and copying
as this reduces the complexity a bit more from user side
Hi @Prasy12, this is an interesting feature. Would the encoded object be decoded when it is saved to the user's clipboard? If so, in what Python environment would the decoding take place, and how would it be accessed from the web browser?
@cjao The feature would look something like this.
screen-capture (29).webm
We will be giving them a 2 liner when they give a copy button and when they run the decoding will happen. It is just the pure python code and they can run it in any python environment that they desire.

A small correction they can run it on any environment where the dependencies are installed to unpickle it. The expectation is that the ability to unpickle the object is assumed.
