Linting the code base is beginning to take an unreasonably large amount of time. It would be convenient to be able to only lint files that changed.
Basically, this change amounts to rebasing the diffs of check/pytest-changed-files vs check/pytest onto check/pylint.
Note that check/all has an --only-changed-files flag, and when this flag is set it should call the only-changes version of pylint.
Should also update docs/development.md
check/pytest-changed-files now exists and check-all with --only-changed-files uses it.  Can be a considerable savings.
