The evolution converters in Opflow do a typecheck for a SummedOp and break if passed PauliSumOp. This is a problem because we implicitly return a PauliSumOp for expressions that used to be a SummedOp, e.g for X + Z.
Allow passing PauliSumOp to the evolutions.
Thank you. I supported only PauliTrotterEvolution and forgot to support using Suzuki directly.
