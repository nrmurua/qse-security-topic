There seems to be an issue when one attempts to compute the wavefunction on 20 or more qubits. Here's a repro:
It is known that this is purely a communications issue. 20-qubit computations can be done with non-wavefunction calls. Moreover, the wavefunction does get computed, and it does get sent from the application server, but it doesn't jump through all the hoops to get back to pyQuil.
The API response for a 20-qubit wavefunction call is 16 MiB in size, which is no doubt hefty.
What if instead of returning the 16 MiB response, the API can send back a URL which can be used to query different parts of the response?
I like this idea @vontell.  We are already planning to move to a post and query setup and allowing users to request part of the wavefunction is an interesting idea.
Closing issue since the sync/async APIs are available.
