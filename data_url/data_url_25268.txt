Functional tests for How To guides are failing.
In the CI pipeline the How To functional tests have been failing recently. We should be able to reproduce it locally with pytest. One example run of these failed tests: https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/actions/runs/4324808464/jobs/7550126950
Functional tests should pass.
No response
I cannot reproduce this + the CI passes on develop branch as well, maybe this should be closed?
@kessler-frost We can close this!
