When a (local) channel acts on several qubits, there's a maximum number of pulses until the draw() method gives an error.
Here's an example of running 17 pulses on different qubits with duration 500ns:

If I now do the same thing with 18 qubits, I get the following error:

I don't know if this is necessarily an issue (it might not be a problem in actual applications of PulseR), but I think we should have in mind how far can the draw()method be pushed.
What's interesting is that if one fixes the target to the same qubit, one can draw a lot of pulses (although their duration is modified):

Can you try again with the latest commit? It actually didn't have to do with the number of qubits, just the rescaling done in the time axis once the total time is greater than 10 us.
Awesome, It's plotting nice now, thanks a lot
