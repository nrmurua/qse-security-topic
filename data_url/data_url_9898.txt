It would be good to have binary quadratic model generators for various basic gates. At least the same set found in dwavebinarycsp.factories.constraint.gates. Something like
and
Or something more generic, like
though in this case you'll need to generate a name for the auxiliary variables. And since it can be constructed by the 3-variable gate my inclination is to stick with the simpler and_gate(in0, in1, out)
