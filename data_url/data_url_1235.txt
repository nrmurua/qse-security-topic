Description of the issue
You are currently using the old networkx~=2.4 version in the cirq-core python package. Would it be possible for you to upgrade to networkx~=3.0?
See file cirq-core/requirements.txt
Cirq version
1.1.0
Does anyone know why this restriction is in place? git blame is not helpful. @cqc-melf did you try manually installing networkx and seeing if any of the tests break?

Looks like we have a conflict with pyquil
surely this shouldn't affect cirq-core
It should not. I would guess we only pinned it to pass our CI/CDs. Will test locally.
Just confirmed that cirq-core tests pass with networkx==3.1
Thank you for taking a look! I have not run any tests, if there is something I can do to help you, please let me know!

Not sure if you have seen this, I have already reported a similar problem to pyquil
rigetti/pyquil#1553
We can update cirq-core's networkx version to >=3.0 but unfortunately we won't be able to deploy it until pyquil also updates theirs.
What does "deploy" mean here?
I'd imagine we'd want to ship networkx>=2.4 since I think you're saying our code base works with both networkx 2 and 3
Our code base works with both networkx 2 and 3 but our checks don't work with networkx==3. This means that we won't be able to merge the update to the master branch.
We don't have a CI check that tests cirq-core in isolation? In any event I think it's kindof pathological to kneecap our library because we don't have our testing infrastructure set up properly.
Looks like loosening the requirements  to >=2 instead of >=3 fixes this issue: #6105

The actual problem is that the pinned networkx version in  cirq-core is too strict. My bad.
@cqc-melf Please let us know if this version of cirq-core fixes your issue.
Thank you all for the update! I will try this in the next days!
