Describe the bug
When running through the Jupyter notebook example for Zero pi, the images did not show up. The exact error was "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/srv/conda/envs/notebook/lib/python3.7/site-packages/scqubits/core/qubit_img/zeropi.jpg'"
Expected behavior
I expected the image to show up.
To Reproduce
Run through each cell of the Zero Pi example notebook.
OS and version used (please complete the following information):
This indicates that image files were not properly packaged to become part of the library for the releases on PyPi / conda-forge.
The culprit is a missing update in MANIFEST.in, I believe.
Need to replace graft scqubits/core/qubit_pngs with graft scqubits/core/qubit_img.
Resolved in v1.3.2
