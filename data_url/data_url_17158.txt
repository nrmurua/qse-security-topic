Notice that the following works

I would like to see the qubit name in the beginning of the circuit, always.
I think this is also fixed by: #2840 From what I can tell the name is getting clipped in the first example with 2 gates for the same reason as in #2780, we're not factoring the register name length into the depth calculation. Running your example circuit with #2840 applied fixes it locally for me. That being said I feel like both of these bugs are recent regressions, because I don't remember this behavior before (especially this one which is pretty bad), I'm assuming it was #1977, but I'll bisect to be sure.
