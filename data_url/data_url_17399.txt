This was broken in #1909 .
As we are getting close to the release, you need to run terra master with the release candidate for qiskit-ibmq-provider: 0.1rc3
Try: pip install -U  "qiskit-ibmq-provider==0.1rc3"
I installed the latest which is 0.1 with no rc.
I have resolved this.  It turns out that installing terra from source does not overwrite version 0.7, so imports from qiskit still point to the old version
I am getting the "ImportError: cannot import name 'IBMQ'" after having installed qiskit from source from master today using instructions on this page: https://qiskit.org/documentation/install/terra.html
@JavaFXpert the ibmq provider was split out as a separate package qiskit-ibmq-provider that needs to be installed when running 0.8 or master. The published documentation is only for 0.7 and will need to be updated. It is in the release notes when the release is published (they are still in progress: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/pull/213/files#diff-914e35a2b47de12e2476c825cab9209bR41 )
It's also worth pointing out that the package will be added to the set of installed packages in the meta-package so pip install qiskit will include it.
