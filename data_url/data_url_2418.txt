We currently have cirq.Rx which is a method, not a gate.  Method names should be snake case.  This is confusing since it makes it seem that cirq.Rx is a class name.  Especially considering that users expect there to be a cirq.Rx gate and not cirq.XPowGate
What is the method style guide? Is it snake case? You are saying that we should rename methods like cirq.Rx to a snake case convention?
Yep, methods should be snake_case.
#2508 is a duplicate of this issue. I'll close this one since the other one has a more thorough discussion of the conventions we considered.
