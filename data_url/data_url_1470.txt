Description of the issue
Density matrix separates qubit states after measurement when split_untanged_states=True. However when ignore_measurement_results=True, this should not happen, as the this changes the measurement into a dephase and does not make the state separable.
For instance, when measuring a Bell state, the resulting DM should be 0.5 |00> + 0.5 |11>. However, separating those states (partial tracing each qubit) and re-kronning them gives 0.25 of each; i.e. it causes each qubit to be 0.5 |0> and 0.5 |1> independently. Therefore we need to avoid separating states after measurements if ignore_measurement_results=True.
