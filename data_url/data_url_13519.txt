Qiskit register transformations were introduced in #524 with a "custom method" -- i.e., one which doesn't use any Qiskit tools. If possible, it would be nice to use Qiskit here, or otherwise simplify this method.
One possibility is using qiskit.QuantumCircuit.to_instruction and appending this with new qubits / bits. This was tried in #524 but ran into a few issues, notably when you have an unused classical register as in
which raises
It may be possible to modify this example and use this strategy, or a different strategy altogether may exist in Qiskit.
Such a function for transforming registers should satisfy all criteria currently checked by unit tests, in particular:
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
