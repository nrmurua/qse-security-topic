Using the new wait gate, as in:
Will generate a qasm file with wait instructions, but the parameters (the waiting time and qubits) are not printed, so that the qasm file is slightly useless:
@imranashraf just to clarify, not including the duration of the wait in the qasm will have as a consequence that we can not accurately simulate it.
This will be a problem for doing proper simulation in any circuit that includes waits (not only T1). As such I think it is important we resolve this before the Nov28 demo so we can show that the simulation works with this.
Edit: let me know if you disagree with any of this or think it is not important we resolve this before then. For now I'm upping prio to medium.
@AdriaanRol if it is necessary for the Demo, then it should be resolved. I am on it.
This has been fixed now and the following is generated:
