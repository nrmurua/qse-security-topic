I was trying to use OpenQAOA to run only the optimised circuit of my QAOA instance. I have used the simulator to derive the optimal variational parameters, and I wanted to run only the final circuit on the IBMQ cloud.
I used the following command (where qsim_qiskit is my QAOA() object)
qsim_qiskit.set_classical_optimizer(optimize=False)
While it worked on the local qiskit simulator, on the cloud it sent multiple jobs (I am not sure how many iterations it was considering, eventually I killed the jobs).
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
I want to be able to run only one circuit on the IBMQ cloud
Note that the following command works (but it's not ideal)
#qsim_qiskit.set_classical_optimizer(optimize=False) qsim_qiskit.set_classical_optimizer(method='cobyla', maxiter=0, cost_progress=True, parameter_log=True, optimization_progress=True)

new method to execute the QAOA circuit at a specific value of parameters in #192 fixes the issue.
