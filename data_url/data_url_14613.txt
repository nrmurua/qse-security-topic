The decision on whether to replace a gate or not should be made based on gate errors (reported by a backend), and if that is not available then based on whether the replacement makes the circuit shorter. None of the passes currently do this (prominent examples are Optimize1qGatesDecomposition, UnitarySynthesis, BasisTranslator, TemplateMatching)
e.g. recognize that RZ.SX.RZ is cheaper than U, even though U is shorter as a sequence.
