Fix linting configuration to allow linting to pass and ignore the long lines we want to keep long
Some FYI information.
To run pylint, on the command line at top of qiskit-metal.
$ pylint qiskit_metal | tee  hold_output.txt
Metal repo has the .pylint file at
qiskit-metal/.pylint
A good file to compare Metal's pylint to is the pylint with Qiskit Terra.
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/.pylintrc
There is a branch called "linting" on metal.
Fixed linting errors in the test module.
Everything has not been linted, but we have been linting as merging has been happening.
