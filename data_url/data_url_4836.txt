Hello, I found some issues in tensorcircuit.Circuit.from_qiskit. For some qiskit circuit, the state vector computed by qiskit and tensorcircuit differs. Reproducer below:
with qiskit 0.45.0, I'm seeing qiskit versus tc err 0.024371880366666862
thanks for the report. identified as a bug in qiskit for cu gate: the base gate matrix is not consistent with the gate matrix provided by cu, and this will induce error in the translation.
Therefore, CU gate in qiskit may fail tc translation due to this inconsistent bug in qiskit. I am considering to take special care in tc on this case for new releases to avoid the qiskit bug.
fixed in fc2fb06
