Often calls to the gate methods of the StateVector class can be repeated, and hence have some amount of repeated work. By enabling the use of LRU caching for the outputs from the StateVector::generateBitPatterns and StateVector::getIndicesAfterExclusion methods, we can avoid some amount of repeated work, and reuse the previously called method results, at the expense of some additional RAM.
