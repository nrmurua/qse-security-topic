I am logging this before I forget the issue, but there is a breaking change in one of the newer versions of the requests library that needs to be investigated and included in setup.py.
A user submitted an error related to this:
with requests version 2.7.0.  We will need to do some digging to find out what change in requests introduces this error and modify pyquil to depend on the newer version.
This issue likely comes from introducing a dependency on a package inside of requests in api.py.  The line is from requests.packages.urllib3.util import Retry. Instead an explicit versioned dependency on urllib3 needs to be added.
Even after downgrading requests to 2.7.0 the connection won't sync in Python 3.5.2. Runs fine in Python 2.7 though.

Hi @markf94 ! I was able to reproduce this using requests 2.7.0. Once I upgraded to the latest version of requests though it worked fine.
The following configuration worked for me, all libraries are on their latest version:
pyquil==1.1.1
requests==2.18.4
urllib3==1.22
This is the configuration that gave me an error like you got:
pyquil==1.1.1
requests==2.7.0
urllib3==1.22
Can you try that out for a quick fix for now? I'll keep this issue open so we can modify our setup.py to prevent this from happening again.
