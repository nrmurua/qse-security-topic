"The algorithm works as follows:
Choose the wi and wij in the target Ising problem. In principle, even higher powers of Z are allowed.
Choose the depth of the quantum circuit m. Note that the depth can be modified adaptively.
Choose a set of controls θ and make a trial function |ψ(θ)⟩, built using a quantum circuit made of C-Phase gates and single-qubit Y rotations, parameterized by the components of θ.
Evaluate

Hey @leonox I think this bug is fix now.
@nonhermitian  You can close this issue
Sounds like this was fixed. Either way, the tutorial no longer lives in this repository.
