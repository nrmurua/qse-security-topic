The Test Suite is showing errors when run on MacOS running Apple M1 Pro.
It seems that on the M1 Pro's GPU, exp2(x) is returning a slightly incorrect number $x &lt; 0$.
I have texted it on the following values:
This causes any shader that uses PACK_BYTES_INTO_FLOAT_CODE or PACK_FLOAT_INTO_BYTES_CODE to work incorrectly.  These are used by the test suite, but are not used by Quirk itself on the Mac, since it can use the more direct float options.  I looked at the shaders used by all the example circuits, and the only use of exp2 was a guaranteed non-negative exponent.
Replacing exp2(exponent) with exp2(max(exponent, 0)) / exp2(max(-exponent, 0)) does work correctly.  When I replaced the two code snippets above to use this alternate version, all tests passed (except for the Painter print_line aligned, which claims it is very machine and browser specific.)
I'm not quite sure what the best way to deal with this is.  Ignore it? I at least wanted there to be some documentation.
