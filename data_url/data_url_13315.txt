Implement the insert_ddd_sequences() function described in the RFC for dynamical decoupling.
This function serves to fill slack windows of idling qubits with the optionally provided dynamical decoupling rule, and defaults to the random rule (i.e. a semi-random sequence of spin echoes).
An implementation skeleton with pseudo-code is present in the RFC but, of course, a different approach can be used.
Chronologically, this issue should be addressed after #1162 is implemented.
