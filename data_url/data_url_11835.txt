Operator.matrix of aqua-0.4 returns a different matrix compared with that of aqua-0.3.1
Output of aqua-0.3.1

@t-imamichi  it is related to the qubit order in Pauli string.
At Terra 0.7, the qubit order in the pauli string is q_{n-1} ... q_0 now. It was q_0 ... q_{n-1}.
So I believe you need to change the pauli string to 'XI' in your example in Aqua 0.4.
This behavior change is confusing. Do you mention it in any document? I cannot find it in the changelog.
In Terra's change log, here is the related change
The issue will only exist if you exported the operator into a JSON before.
The reason to change that is to align the bitstring order of qubits, as you may know that the qubit order in the bitstring is q_{n-1} ... q_0 but pauli was q_0 ... q_{n-1}. Therefore, we make the orders of the two representations are aligned.
We can probably add a reminder to Aqua's change log.
Yes. Users may have used Operator.save_to_file of Aqua 0.3.1 https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/0.3.1/qiskit_aqua/operator.py#L423
I send a PR that supports old format, after that I will encounter to re-save the operator to assure the format. Thx.
Thanks!
