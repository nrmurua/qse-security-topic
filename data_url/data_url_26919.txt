I don't have sufficient permissions for this. Maybe @mkrack or @juerghutter could have a look?
I logged in to sourceforge, but there is not much more we can do unless we want to remove the project files or even ask to remove the whole CP2K project from sourceforge. Personally, I would not mind to remove the project completely when everything has been migrated safely to github. The latter option might be the only choice if we want avoid that people will still end up on the old sourceforge pages instead of the new ones.
Maybe we can start by removing more stuff from the Sourceforge project? In particular the download files and the svn repo could be scrapped.
I just checked, the files are gone but the svn repo is still there. Is this the final state in which we want to leave the sourceforge project behind?
I think we can only request now to delete the whole sourceforge project, since I found nothing more to drain or drop.
I once proposed to empty the svn repository and got some opposition. I guess removing the entire project will upset even more people. So, should we just leave it as is and close this issue?
I did not recognise such opposition, but if there is still somebody interested in the svn repositories of CP2K at sourceforge then this is fine and we can close this issue.
