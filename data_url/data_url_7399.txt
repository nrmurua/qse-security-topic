Dear all,
is setting the angle theta in the range of [0, 1], which is probably not wanted.
Thank you

Hi, thanks for the issue. The following patch would immediately fix the issue:
Do you think we should merge it to Yao so that it can be the default behavior? I am a bit worried that users would think this behavior can be not very predictable. For example, the time evolution block still generate random t in range [0, 1] for no reason.
