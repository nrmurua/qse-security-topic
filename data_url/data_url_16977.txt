The doc strings in DAGNode class report incorrect info. For example, DAGNode.qargs method claims to Returns list of (QuantumRegister, int) tuples where the int is the index of the qubit else an empty list when in practice it returns a list of Qubit objects.
Run any test appends qargs, cargs, and/or wires under a DAGNode instance, and manually check types of values against info provided in doc strings.
Docs are supposed to represent correct data for maintainability.
Update doc strings in DAGNode class.
