Prior to 0.8.0, if some (but not all) of the circuits in a job fails, the resulting JSON is still schema compliant and can be loaded using Result.from_dict(). More specifically, result data for the failed circuit was "data": {}.
In 0.8.0, this is now "data:" null and also "metadata": null, which cannot be used in Result.from_dict().
This applies to the standalone simulator (e.g. ibmq_qasm_simulator).
Prepare a qobj with 1 good and 1 bad circuit:
Run the qobj using standalone: qasm_simulator qobj.json.
Partial result should still be schema compliant and can be loaded using Result.from_dict().
This looks like a bug with JSON serialization function when data/metadata classes are empty. I think the initial JSON structures just needs to be initialized explicitly as an object, not the library default (which I guess is null).
