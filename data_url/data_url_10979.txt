The method signature is build_state_predictor(obs::Vector{Matrix}). The problem is that without specifying a type for Matrix, the only thing that will match this is another Matrix with unspecified type. Solution is either to explicitly allow allow types, i.e. write this as:
Or just drop the Matrix and let any Vector suffice.
I assumed that the current signature was equivalent to what you suggested.  I lean towards using the type parameter. Thoughts?
I think we should just add the type parameter. Incidentally, I noticed you have sprinkled Matrix types in front of various Vectors throughout the test code. Note that something like Matrix[rand(2,2)] produces a vector of type Array{Array{T,2},1} (note the T still hanging around there), whereas if you drop the Matrix you get the tighter type Array{Array{Float64,2},1}. I guess the lesson is that when you write Vector or Matrix, there is an implied type parameter that you ought to either specify, or allow it to be generic and capture it in the method signature.
