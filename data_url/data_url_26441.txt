Hi,
I am trying to run the scf calculations in cp2k with optB88-vdw functional, and this is my input file:
However, I encountered a error:
" unknown subsection LIBXC of section XC_FUNCTIONAL"
I think the LIBXC has already compiled successfully, so I have no idea about this issue. Could you give me some advices? Thanks!
Cheers,
zezhu
Can you share the version of CP2K (source code or revision release version)?  Is this report about CP2K master revision?
The version is cp2k/2022.1 in our cluster.
Thank you Professor, I am not familiar with CP2K and I will learn it now!
Thanks Prof, It is working now.
Cheers,
zezhu
