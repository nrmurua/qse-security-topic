Hello, this is just a question. With liboqs python, I was able to generate both the public and private key with the following script
algorithm = oqs.Signature(algorithm)
public_key = algorithm.generate_keypair()
private_key = algorithm.export_secret_key()
How would I be able to do this in C++? I have been able to generate the private key but confused about the public key.
Are you using liboqs directly or the liboqs-cpp wrapper for C++?
If you are using liboqs directly, the OQS_SIG_keypair function generates the public key and private key simultaneously.
Closing, please make future questions on the discussions board rather than as an issue.
