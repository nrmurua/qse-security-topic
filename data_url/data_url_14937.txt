Statevector draws bra notation also like ket. Following screenshot clears it more.

Just try to draw any bra Statevector you will get the wrong visualisation.
Correct output should be <0|.
I found this bug first time while running IBM Quantum QGSS-23 lab 1 and reported to the team on discord too.
The Statevector class only represents pure quantum states; it doesn't represent bras, which mathematically are vectors in the dual of the state space.  Holding a Statevector implies that you've got a state (ket) only, and generally, Statevector only allows raw vectors or explicit column vectors.
If you want to write an explicit row vector for your bra, the matrix would be [[1, 0]] (a nested list), but Statevector will reject this, because it's not a valid statevector.
(That's all expected behaviour: Statevector only "represents" bras in the sense that it represents the state that the bra corresponds to.)
@jakelishman Thanks for your quick response. I also got that qiskit only supports ket in Latex form line 1288.
