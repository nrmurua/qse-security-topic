In my own workflow I've switched over entirely to the scripts in the check/ folder, which are significantly faster (if not quite as bullet proof in terms of agreeing with Travis-ci).
I ask because without maintenance these scripts gradually bit-rot and stop working. E.g. @cduck had some trouble with continuous-integration/check.sh .
I was about to make this issue.

I use continuous-integration/simple_check.sh.
I haven't been using it.  Do we have a script that runs all the relevant scripts in the check folder?
No, there's not a "run all" script.
Because we now have continuous integration checks across platforms, it's not actually possible for one person to run all the checks anymore (without VMs anyways).
Yes I understand that.  But right now it is annoying that there isn't one thing I can run which gives me some idea that the build is going to fail or not.  Instead I run each of these by hand.
though sometimes I do the incremental coverage.   It would be nice to have a single script that does this
We could definitely add an all script.
It would be a bit unusual for the all script to apply formatting changes instead of checking for them.
@dabacon simple_check.py does the latter three things (with coverage). Its omission of the formatting I think is just because it hasn't been updated since formatting was introduced.
I've been using pytest on my own machine and relying on travis to tell me what else I need to fix.
