The method set_classical_optimizer for the QAOA and RQAOA classes doesn't have the proper documentation. It should be the same as the documentation of the ClassicalOptimizer class. The parameters optimization_progress, cost_progress, parameter_log, and save_intermediate are missing. Also, these names could be changed to be more descriptive.
Closing this as it has been dealt by PR153
