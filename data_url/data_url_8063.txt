Qutip works fine with numpy 1.21.1, but fails on import with 1.22 numpy, released Dec 31st.  Tested on ubuntu and MacOS.
Failure occurs here,

which is kind of mysterious since line 339 explicitly checks that the 'blas_opt_info' attribute exists, and then fails at line 340 because the attribute doesn't exist.
It's fixed in master with #1752. A patch should be released soon.
We should release the patch soon. @hodgestar Let me know if you need any help with the release.

Please do release that patch! ðŸ˜‰
I'm working on a 4.6.3 release at the moment.
4.6.3 has been released.
