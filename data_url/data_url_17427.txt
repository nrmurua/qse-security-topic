This should have been fixed by #1866. Can you check if you still have this issue on master? I can push up a patch adding a test for this (since no output and no exception is easy to test against) to verify it doesn't regress in the future.
Ok cool.  I am currently travelling and making slides from 0.7 so do not have time to check.  But it does look like that PR solves the problem, so feel free to close.
