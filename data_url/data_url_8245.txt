Is Python Headers a package? How to install? It is required for the following reason.
Python Headers 2.7+ Linux only. Needed for compiling Cython files
http://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html
Thanks~
I carefully followed the instruction and installed qutip on an ubuntu system in windows. It seems the the only package I did not explicitly install is Python Headers.
After installing qutip and running the test, I got the following:

If you've installed qutip from conda following the recommended instructions here, then you should have a valid installation without any issues, and Cython should have sorted itself out.  The general principle is that installing qutip is as easy as running
conda install qutip
if you've got the conda-forge channel activated.
