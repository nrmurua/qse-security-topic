This has been going on for a while now - test_diag_liou_mult fails about ~5-10% of the time on Travis runs, with only 1 or 2 elements of the huge matrix differing by a small relative tolerance.  I think this started around the time that scipy 1.5 was released, which changed how scipy.linalg.eigh chose its underlying LAPACK driver, and broke a load of tests that relied on our custom eigh functions reproducing the scipy behaviour exactly (#1299).  At the time we fixed those tests (#1298, #1301), but this intermittent failure of test_diag_liou_mult may have slipped through.
Equally, at the same time on dev.major I think I was moving the brtools internals to use the new CSR types, which involved rewriting things like diag_liou_mult.  I don't think this is the cause (though I may have done at the time), because we see the intermittent test failures still on master, which does not use the new types yet.
I'm not absolutely certain the eigh changes are the cause, which is why I don't want to just bump up atol/rtol in the test without going through and calculating what the acceptable tolerance should be.
This is a note for posterity.  I'll look into it myself and try and determine the true root cause, and PR an appropriate change.
