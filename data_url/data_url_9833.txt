Description
If the 'first' item in SampleSet is Sample, shouldn't all objects returned by the iteration of SampleSet have the same type?
Sample prints sample vector, energy and other fields, but SampleView for some reason only prints sample vector.
I agree ideally they would be consistent. Support for for sample in sampleset: ... is old and returns only the samples themselves for legacy/backwards compatibility reasons. .first returns the actual contents of the sample set.
We generally encourage users to use
or
which are more explicit. .first returns the first value of that latter.
sampleset.samples() returns the list of SampleView objects.
sampleset.data() returns the list of Sample objects which have more information.
Thank you for your answer.
