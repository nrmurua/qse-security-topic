For creating a lattice with atom position fluctuations, the code below does not seem to work:
dx= 6.7 Â± 0.1
atoms = generate_sites(SquareLattice(), nx, ny, scale=dx)
Besides entering the atom position by hand, is there other way to create such a lattice where each atom position is fluctuated independently?
Try the following code
Thanks! This works well!
