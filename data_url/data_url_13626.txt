Apparently due to a timeout error.

Any ideas what's going on here? @nathanshammah @karalekas
I re-ran the tests on master and they passed. It looks like this error also happened for #285
No idea.
codecov/codecov-action#37
afaik this happens when the codecov API times out. simply re-running the test should be sufficient. as you can see, I enabled fail_ci_if_error: true (which I think they added for exactly this reason). if this becomes a persistent issue, we could consider disabling the error flag, but that would somewhat defeat the purpose of having a code coverage tool
Looks like this is not something to do with our own infrastructure. I'd propose we close this for now and if it becomes a big enough hassle then we can re-open and maybe switch coverage tooling.
