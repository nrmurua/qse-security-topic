I am running Python 3.9.5, and have installed pyzx from pip.
Given the following code:
I receive the message:
IndexError: list index out of range
The input matrix should be a representation of a valid CNOT circuit with 4 qubits. Specifically, the circuit with two CNOTs between qubits (1, 3) and then (3, 1). The architecture is connected.
We have a hunch the error happens when the diagonal contains entries with 0, as it is replicable with other matrices with this property, and I haven't been able to replicate it with matrices without that property.
Closing this for now, as I realised my initialisation of the Architecture class was incorrect.
