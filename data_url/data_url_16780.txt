We have seen this before, but I thought it was fixed.
This is due to the multicontrolled gates being in both elements. There's already qiskit-community/qiskit-aqua#755 concerning the same issue. The gates are currently still in Aqua because Aqua has some tests Terra doesn't. That's fixed by #3714 which is ready to merge but blocked by #3739 (which should be merged very soon).
This should be fixed with the latest Aqua version, @nonhermitian do you mind testing if the issue is resolved for you as well?
Closing this as it seems to be resolved.
