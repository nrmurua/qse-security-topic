The second box in the tutorial notebook "quantum_state_tomography_bell_states" doesn't run successfully.
I expect that box of code to silently import some modules.
ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

1 # import tomography libary
----> 2 import tools.qcvv.tomography as tomo
3
4 # useful additional packages
5 from tools.visualization import plot_state, plot_histogram
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tools'
Change that line to this and it works:
from qiskit.tools.qcvv import tomography as tomo
N/A
N/A
thanks for pointing this out,
this is similar to pull request #55, I will put together a new PR
apparently I did not catch all tools import occurences
fixed thanks to @alfrisch.
