When trying to install cmake using pip
sudo -H python3 -m pip install cmake
I get the message
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'skbuild'
Am I supposed to install skbuild as well?  If so, what's the best way to do that?
I've run across this, here's what fixed it for me
Thanks that gets me most of the way there.
In order to get an example to work I needed to install qiskit.
To build the tnqvm simulator I need to install gfortran.
When I tried to install the tnqvm simulator I had to use sudo.
Are there other python packages I need to install?  For Rigetti or D-Wave for example?
In order to run any python examples that leverage the aer Accelerator, you'll have to install qiskit.
By default, XACC should install to $HOME/.xacc, so should be no need to use sudo for further plugin installs like TNQVM. If you did, make sure that XACC is installing to $HOME/.xacc and that the permissions didn't get messed up for some reason.
We do have a D-Wave Accelerator implementation that delegates to D-Wave Ocean SDK. So if you'd like to use that then you'll also have to pip install dwave-ocean-sdk. You don't have to though, we have a D-Wave Accelerator that makes direct REST calls to the D-Wave QPU server (if you have access to it)
Thanks.
