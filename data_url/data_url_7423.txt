Is there a way to run these programs on actual available quantum hardware?
Like compilation into openqasm code which could be imported on ibm quantum experience?
unfortunately, we don't yet have the support for real hardware. There are some early stage work about this here: https://github.com/QuantumBFS/YaoQASM.jl
but we do have plans to support hardware from YaoLang compiler side
some updates on this:
we are planning to support IBM Q and AWS Braket now, which means supporting IBM, Rigetti, IonQ machines as well as their simulators.
Progress:
besides the above hardware integration, the QASM compilation is done via YaoLang and the parser is in a single package now: https://github.com/QuantumBFS/OpenQASM.jl
the above features will be in YaoLang repo and eventually goes into Yao.jl functionality when they are stable.
