Hello!
Would it be possible to add support for outputting NMR-related quantities from cp2k into the standardised .magres file format as specified here:
https://www.ccpnc.ac.uk/output/magres/magres-format.pdf
This would enable users to take advantage of the magres-capable post-processing tools such as MagresView as well as being able to contribute to the NMR database.
I hope that this would be a relatively straightforward feature to add.
Many thanks,
Kane
