The example fails with the error: ValueError: ('unrecognized DataSet mode', None)
This is due to recent changes in data_set.py
Maybe it would be good to run the example ipython notebooks as part of the testing procedure. For example add the following to test.py
Oh, that's cool, I didn't know about NotebookRunner! We'd have to be a bit careful to make the other notebook run straight through, since it has background tasks and you can't run one Loop until the previous has finished...
But yeah, I committed that notebook accidentally, wondered if anyone would notice. You caught me ðŸ˜³
@alexcjohnson I think mode=qcodes.DataMode.LOCAL might be a good default setting for a DataSet.
I suggest we make qcodes.DataMode.LOCAL the default (which will solve the problem) and close the issue. The alternative is to fix the example notebook.
I just ran into this, and agree with @eendebakpt that we should just make the LOCAL the default one, any reasons to not do this @alexcjohnson ?
