Black box quantization techniques that build on existing EPR code and incorporate loss effects
Quantum circuit analysis for driven modal simulations
Based on Grace's and my discussion with Hanhee, her old paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.0587.pdf) is outdated and the new BBQ analysis based on Firat's paper ought to be used instead.
Is it not better to implement the newest one by Solgun, DiVincenzo, and Gambetta https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8633444 ?

Yep, that is now the plan. We just haven't had time to start working on the new analysis code for it, but we do have it in mind. If anyone wanted to start trying to take a stab at it I would certainly encourage that!
We encourage the community to contribute the BBQ stand-alone analysis of simulation data.
