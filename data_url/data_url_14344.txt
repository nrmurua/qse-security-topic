The docstring of C4XGate's _define method has this QASM implementation:
but the constructed circuit is slightly different.
It makes sense that line rc3x a,b,c,d; (at 1Q) corresponds to (RC3XGate(), [q[0], q[1], q[2], q[3]], []) (at 1P) but rc3x a,b,c,d; (at 2Q) corresponds to  (RC3XGate().inverse(), [q[0], q[1], q[2], q[3]], []), (at 2P) inverse version of the gate?
I'm not sure if I understand.
It's a doc issue.
The doc string should be explicit or fixed.
One idea is to use rcccx_dg gate that qiskit constructs when an inverse of RC3XGate is required. Or use some other convention to differentiate between gates and its inverses as specified by QASM.
I'd be happy to open up a PR if that's the case.
Maybe the best way would be using the same definition as in the qelib1.inc, which is
I think the convention is usually that the docstring matches that decomposition there.
