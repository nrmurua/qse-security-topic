Currently, measurement window position may not be dependent on volatile parameters at all. This is because sequencing pulse templates like ForLoopPT and SequencePT do not create their own Loop object that their measurement windows can be attached to, but just insert their measurement window with an offset (duration of previous children) into the parent Loop. If this offset depends on a volatile parameter the measurement windows will silently be wrong if this parameter is changed.
