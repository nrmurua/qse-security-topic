Dear Rigetti gods,
my code failed to connect to 8Q-Agave device and asked me to send you the following snippet:
@ens-lg4  Your program might be too big for the QPU. Are you still experiencing this problem?
It was intermittent (for virtually the same program about 3-4% of the runs failed for this reason).
So I just worked around it by capturing the exception and retrying again.
Unfortunately I cannot say whether I still have it or not, because I was only allowed to use the hardware for 4 hours last Friday. If I get another chance to try, I'll let you know.
@ens-lg4 hey Leo, can you please give more details on what you were trying to run? We would like to try to replicate the issue.
