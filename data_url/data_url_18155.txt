Providing incorrect number of arguments.
Here: https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py/blob/master/qiskit/extensions/quantum_initializer/_initializer.py#L103
The method circ.initialize only takes 2 arguments but 3 is given. (https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py/blob/master/qiskit/extensions/quantum_initializer/_initializer.py#L438)
change that line to self._modifiers(circ.initialize(self.param, self.arg))
Thanks @chunfuchen ! It has been fixed in #443 and will be included in the next release.
