A Google search for "qiskit barrier" leads one to its entry in the API reference as the first hit.  Unfortunately, this page contains only a circular definition, and does not even explain what a barrier does:
Barrier instruction.
Create new barrier instruction.
There is a much more useful description by @chriseclectic on StackExchange, with tens of upvotes.  I believe a similar explanation should be incorporated into the Barrier docstring(s).
For reference, this is Chris's answer on stackexchange.  The relevant docstrings that need updating are the QuantumCircuit.barrier method and the Barrier class.
How is it going with this issue? I am interested to learn more and contributing.
