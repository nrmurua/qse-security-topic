A limitation of the arbstudio is that it only accepts 512 waveforms. At the moment each pulse creates its own waveform, while in principle it should be possible to recycle waveforms. Perhaps each PulseImplementation should have its own sort of satisfies_conditions, but that only checks the relevant properties.
As an example, for the Arbstudio, the waveform of a DC pulse only depends on its amplitude. t_start, t_stop etc. are irrelevant.
Found out it was not the number of waveforms, but the number of elements in its sequence that's capped at 512. I improved the arbstudio such that it now searches for pre-existing waveforms, so it does not have duplicates. Furthermore, it checks if its sequence actually loops over a subsequence, and if so reduces the sequence to that subsequence. In many cases this should solve the issue.
