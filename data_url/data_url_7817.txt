I have a function which uses mesolve to simulate our system (shown below). The Hamiltonian and the collapse operator includes both the time-dependent and time-independent terms. We find that the result differs a lot when we run the function get_moments with or without QobjEvo() on the time-dependent terms.
But in principle, the two alternatives should give us the same result, right? We are not sure which alternative is the one to follow.
Hi Simon,
Thank you for the fast response.
With QobjEvo, we have:
Without two lines, they become:
