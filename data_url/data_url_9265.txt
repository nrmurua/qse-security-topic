Currently, I think we don't really check if the schema generated by v0.1.0 is parsed by v0.2.0 BloqadeSchema, which as a result they may end up incompatible without warnings. I think we should check the version of the schema and tag the schema version in some way.
This is originally brought up by Danylo when he accidentally installed 0.2.0 but parsed a 0.1.0 schema generated from BloqadeSchema.

I think @weinbe58 is probably the best person to answer this since you write all the schema checkers we have at the moment, maybe it doesn't hurt to somehow verify the version number too.
