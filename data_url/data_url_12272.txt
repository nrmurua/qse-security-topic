The local_qasm_simulator is too slow and not efficient for simulating 10 or more qubits.
The alternative is to use the new ibmqx_hpc_qasm_simulator or ibmqx_qasm_simulator.
In the next release the local_qasm_simulator will be a fast c++ simulator, and can handle large qubits.
I think it is preferable to use local simulators that don't require internet connection.
Thanks! My concern is that the simplest introductory in the tutorial, quantum_emoticon.py uses 16 qubit simulator. When run with the local_qasm_simulator, it takes several minutes while it takes just several seconds with the online simulators.
For this reason, I would like to keep this open until the next release of qiskit-sdk-py.
Lets close this as it is related to the QISKit Core. The functionality will not change.
I encounter LookupError: backend "ibmqx_hpc_qasm_simulator" not found. when I try to use ibmqx_hpc_qasm_simulator.
Sorry for the confusion. The name has changed.
Please run print(available_backends()) to list the valid names of simulators.
