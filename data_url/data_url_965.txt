#5480 added support for confusion maps to measurement gates. The feature request is to extend this support to cirq.PauliMeasurementGate as well.
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters
@tanujkhattar , can I work on this issue?
I am new to open source, in case of any queries where can I reach out for help ?
@tanujkhattar was this resolved by #5480? If so, apologies for not closing it at that time.
Welcome to the community @Tarun-Kumar07!
@95-martin-orion and @tanujkhattar , the constructors in pauli_measurement_gates.py don't take confusion map as parameter, but they are taken in measurement_gate.py.
So is this issue still open ?

You are absolutely right - I glossed over the fact that this issue is specific to Pauli measurements. I've been away from Cirq for a while, but I suspect this is still open and useful to have. @tanujkhattar can confirm, but until then you're welcome to start working on it. Thanks!
As far as questions go, you can join the cirq-dev googlegroup to get an invite to the public Cirq sync. The meeting is a good place to ask questions, and the associated doc has links to other support options.
Great, I will start looking into this
Thank you  @95-martin-orion !!
Hi, @Tarun-Kumar07
Are you still working on this issue, or is it free to take?
@Kirs67 I'm working on this issue
@Tarun-Kumar07 Can you please share a summary of the progress you've made so far and whether you have any questions? Also, any estimate of by when you might be able to send a PR ? This has been open for a while now and it'll be good to gain some traction here.
Hi @tanujkhattar, Can you assign this issue to me ?

PS - I am new to quantum computing and Cirq, will take some time to get to speed ðŸ˜„ .
