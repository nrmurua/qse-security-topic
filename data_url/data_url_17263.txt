The current pulse overlap error message reads: PulseError: 'Child schedules <Schedule 0>, <Schedule 1> overlap.'
For a user building pulse schedules, it would be nice for the error to give more information about how they overlapped, so the user could more easily debug their mistake.
(For example, in my case, schedule 0 involved only qubit 0, and I thought schedule 1 involved only qubit 1, but I was actually measuring qubit 1 into mem slot 0, causing the conflict.)
@lcapelluto
Looks like exception logged here -> schedule.py#L65
which is raised by merging timeslots here -> timeslots.py#L284
which already have information regarding how timeslots are overlaped.
Does this means that we can just append ts_err message to Schedule PulseError? like
And this will be rendered nicely as timeslots.py#L187.
Am I missing something? If it is simple as that I can create a PR and jump on other issues.
Anyway I can work on that if you tell me what I'm missing :)
Best wishes,

This is the code to reproduce what @lcapelluto pointed as an example case:
I got an error message below and I think error message has been improved.
But this is still not sufficient for novice users, especially who don't know __repr__ of TimeSlot. This is because error message just reuse representation of TimeSlot object. We can rewrite error message to be like
We can get more confusing case by rewriting sched1 as
The error message is now
Actually, in above schedule, a section where two schedules are overlapped is [5, 10], but error message says whole section of sched1 is overlapped. In this case, error message should be
Sorry, I noticed we have another option to reproduce the example case.
Then I got an error
You're right. This is not readable.
@IceKhan13 thanks for pointing out simple solution. we have two things to be done.
Rewrite below error message
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/277407c0550cf8e4cfc0e1844113594933efa903/qiskit/pulse/timeslots.py#L284
throw the message to Schedule. Representation object of schedule should be replaced by more readable one.
