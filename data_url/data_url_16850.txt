Schedule.filter currently expects its input arguments to be a list. This should be extended to also accept a scalar value.
Hi, I just started to get into Qiskit. I was wondering if you would give me a shot at this?
Welcome to Qiskit @NuoWenLei! This is an excellent issue to cut your teeth on. I have assigned it to you, feel free to ask for any pointers on how to go about this.
Ok thank you!
Hi, I noticed that inputs for schedule.filter() usually come in pairs, such as DriveChannel + AcquireChannel. Should it be better to change only the instruction_types or change all inputs to accept scalar values?
I would recommend letting all accept both a scalar and a list.
Ok that sounds good
Is this issue still open?
#3768 should fix this issue.
Fixed via #3646
