rz gate should split the phase in half and apply phase on both components as per RZGate docs, not just on ket_1
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.h (0)
qc.rz (PI/2,0)

The Rphi gate is also called the Rz gate according to the textbook. But in the docs it is mentioned that it is infact the Rphi gate with an additional phase
I think this is fixed by now
feel free to re-open if I'm missing something.
