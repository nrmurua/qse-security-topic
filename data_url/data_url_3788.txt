It would be useful for the docs to have our deprecation policy spelled out.
Also having an official "deprecation text" would be useful so we can be more consistent across Ocean. I was speaking with @JoelPasvolsky and we recommend something like
in the code and
in the docstring. .. deprecated prepends Deprecated since version X.Y.Z: to the notice.
