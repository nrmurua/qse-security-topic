It's nice to have in the README, and your coverage is so good it would be nice to show it off.
Yao.jl is a meta package,  code coverage is shown in
https://github.com/QuantumBFS/YaoBlocks.jl
https://github.com/QuantumBFS/YaoArrayRegister.jl
Maybe showing the test coverage of YaBlocks in README?
@Roger-luo
If we are gonna show the test coverage, we should list all the components test coverage. Not just YaoBlocks. I could add a table of this.
@kshyatt so I just added badges, the coverage of YaoBase is pretty low, but since it's just abstract interfaces, we didn't push this coverage up very high. The rest component packages are just OK actually.
I'll close this issue since it's done now. thanks for the suggestion.
