Description of the issue
This report is a follow-up to a comment by @vtomole on PR #5637. The current version of dev_tools/modules.py exits with an error if given the argument print_version (which is one of arguments it is supposed to accept).
How to reproduce the issue
In a shell, with the current directory being the top level of the Cirq source code repo cloned from GitHub, run the following command:
Cirq version
0.16.0.dev
This was fixed by PR #5705, which has been merged, but I didn't quite name the PR in the right way and so this issue didn't get closed automatically. Closing it manually.
