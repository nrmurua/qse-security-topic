Currently TFQ only supports GridQubit instances in circuits. It would be good to add the functionality for cirq.LineQubit as well as cirq.NamedQubit. This would require upding our core/serializer as well as some surrounding C++ code and proto files. https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/master/tensorflow_quantum/core/serialize/serializer.py#L826
As far as implementation steps go, a good way to do this in pieces would be:
