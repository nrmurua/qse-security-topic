First of all, thanks again for all of your help so far. This is another issue related to the circuit optimization task that I have been working on for a while. Right now, I am trying to experiment with different optimizer methods, such as Adam and SGD. When I try to use these methods, I get a message like this:
 File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/quimb/tensor/optimize.py", line 946, in optimize_basinhopping self.res = basinhopping( File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/scipy/optimize/_basinhopping.py", line 680, in basinhopping bh = BasinHoppingRunner(x0, wrapped_minimizer, take_step_wrapped, File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/scipy/optimize/_basinhopping.py", line 72, in __init__ minres = minimizer(self.x) File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/scipy/optimize/_basinhopping.py", line 284, in __call__ return self.minimizer(self.func, x0, **self.kwargs) File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/scipy/optimize/_minimize.py", line 646, in minimize raise ValueError('Unknown solver %s' % method) ValueError: Unknown solver sgd
I get the same error for 'adam' as well. I was therefore wondering what the correct method would be to call these optimizer algorithms so that my optimizer object will recognize them.
Yes this is because the adam and sgd etc. methods are custom optimizers not built in to scipy. I think optimize_basinhopping just needs to be updated here:

with method=self.optimizer changed to method=self._method. Do you want to try that fix and maybe submit a PR with the change if it works?
Thank you very much for getting back to be about that. I will try the modification and submit a PR if it works. Right now, however, there is an import error in the current github revision:
    import quimb.tensor as qtn
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'quimb.tensor'
There doesn't seem to be any problems with a fresh install of the github version of quimb, I suspect you have a broken installation / uninstallation of quimb somehow - try uninstalling and then deleting the folder entirely from the site_packages folder of your environment and then reinstalling.
Should be fixed by 6738d16.
