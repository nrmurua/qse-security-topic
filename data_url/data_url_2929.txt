@maffoo Pointed out that after dividing a string into digit and non-digit chunks, there's no need to put them back together into text in order to get a comparable object. He's right.
Actually, this may not be a safe change. For example, when trying to order NamedQubit("a1") vs NamedQubit("1a") this would try to compare an integer to a string and raise an error.
I'm a bit worried that str_lexicographic_respecting_int_order is doing secret magic which may confuse users.  I understand that people sometimes don't pad out their integers, but do we really want to do this for them?  If all our default qubits do this nicely, then we won't have to worry about this as much (and can put a warning in NamedQubit)?
This would be obsoleted by #336
