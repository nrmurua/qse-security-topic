Like #2182, but for quantum channels.
I think this would be a useful addition to cirq for the sake of having a more complete quantum computing package, but implementations that I've found for this have tended to be too slow for practical use in circuit optimization/compilation.
I'd expect that. My primary goal in filing this was to explicitly descope non-unitary operations from #2182. Secondary goal was completeness of cirq. In any case, this is low priority and as you point out any expectations with regards to speed should be realistic.
@viathor Can this be done with qiskit.quantum_info.diamond_norm?
We've decided to list some "popular" distance methods. The PR can be closed once they are implemented.
The two most popular distance measures for channels are the diamond norm and the entanglement fidelity. See this paper for interesting and principled evaluation of a number of distance measures.
We already have entanglement fidelity in cirq:
(This checks out: by the formula in this QCSE answer we have that the amplitude damping channel with gamma=0.36 has average fidelity Favg=131/150 which by the Horodecki formula (see eq (3) in this paper) yields Fent=81/100.)
At minimum we should also implement the diamond norm. If folks have a need for other metrics, please say so on this issue.
