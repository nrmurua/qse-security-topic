@vprusso Do you mind pointing me to a reference that might have an example to cover the above lines? I only the surface-level basics of how non-local games work.
Hmm, I think the best reference to point to here would just be the docs page, and specifically any of the subsections under:
https://toqito.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.nonlocal_games.html
Even more specifically, an example like this:
should hit that section of nonlocal_game.py.
Does that help?
