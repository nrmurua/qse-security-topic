DefFrame supports generic attributes but there is not a direct way to access any that aren't defined as a @property in the public API. One example is channel_delay. It was added to the constructor parameters in V4, but doesn't have an associated property and requires going through the underlying quil API to access it. We should make the current _get_attribute and _set_attribute methods public so any key/value pairs can be fetched or modified.
The DefFrame channel_delay property wasn't carried over from V3. We should add a special @property definition for it so it works as it used to.
Historical note: it wasn't carried over because it didn't exist, right? This is a new feature of the v2 translation backend.
And simultaneously, frames changed in the Quil spec to have dynamic key-value pairs. So I don't think the right answer here is to add more properties, but rather to allow looking them up by string key, and deprecating the property-based lookups.
Ah, yeah, that is correct, channel_delay is new to V4. We should make the current get/set attribute methods public, and point users to it instead.
