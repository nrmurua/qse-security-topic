Unbound clbits and qubits are output in QASM into registers invariably called regless.  This is a valid identifier for other registers, and the same name is emitted whether or not clashes exist, presumably because QuantumCircuit usually keeps names unique when the registers are added to the circuit, so there usually can't be a clash.
A similar failure occurs with a QuantumRegister(..., name="regless").
The automatically generated qreg regless[1] and creg regless[1] should have unique names.
As far as I know there are no universally reserved names, but we can just generate a name like _[cq]regless_<entropy>, which should be good enough - by <entropy> I mostly just mean noise to prevent users from accidentally shadowing the name.  QuantumCircuit.qasm() should (I've got to assume!) be deterministic, so the entropy could just be a string like _qiskitprivate, or if we really want to make sure users can't create a clash then
That seems like overkill to me, though.
