Hello,
When running the PyRPL GUI, when I try to load any module I get the error below, and nothing else happens:
AttributeError: module 'qtpy.QtCore' has no attribute 'pyqtBoundSignal'.
I installed PyRPL via the conda command on the documentation - I'm running it on MacOS Catalina. I checked on python command line and I have PyQT5, and it has the class PyQt5.QtCore.pyqtBoundSignal, however qtpy.QtCore.pyqtBoundSignal does not exist. I'm saying this in case it helps, I thought pyqt would wrap PyQT5.
I took a look at the my installed version of pyqt (using version 1.11.2) and it seems it renames the pyqtBoundSignal object:
from PyQt5.QtCore import pyqtBoundSignal as SignalInstance.
So I looked at older versions of qtpy, and I installed version 1.9.0 which doesn't rename the pyqtBoundSignal, so now I can load the modules I tried, IQ and SpectrumAnalyzer.
Is it simply the case that pyRPL is meant to run with version 1.9.0 of qtpy or did I miss something along the way ?
I believe this bug has been fixed in the branch python3-only
Thanks for the reply, that seems to be the case. Is there one package version that I could install with pip that compiles that branch ? Or I should just install it manually from source ?
Nope, I don't think so... also @lneuhaus, I think now python3-only was merged into master... Probably we should just remerge the few new commits that were made on python3only into master and delete it definitively ?
I got the has no attribute 'pyqtBoundSignal' error when using pyrpl from master branch with Python 3.7, but the python3-only branch seems to work fine.
