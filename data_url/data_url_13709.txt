As we have been refactoring the testing, it is worth reviewing the tests to see if there is tech debt that can be reduced.
For example, I believe that this test:
https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/blob/master/mitiq/tests/test_zne.py#L40
Is now redundant thanks to the doc tests that we have now got introduced.
