Quantum Experience Instruction Glossary U3 gate shows incorrectly the rotations. It shows how u3(pi/2, pi/2, pi/2) moves the state vector from |0> to |+> however it should be from |0> to |i>
The animation induces to believe that the three parameter theta, phi, lambda, correspond with the rotation around the three axes X, Y and Z, which is not correct
Thanks toural!
I let the documentation team know about the issue and they are working on it.
