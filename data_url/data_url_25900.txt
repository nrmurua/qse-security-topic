example of the problem 89f21cd
This is a squashed merge commit to develop. The version workflow should not run on it, since it is in develop which is ignored in the workflow.
However, you can see the red ‚ùå showing "some checks were not successful". Those checks are version runs when the commit is pushed as part of a rebased branch, after it has been merged to develop. They are expected to fail. We need to find some way to prevent the check from running on such pushes.
