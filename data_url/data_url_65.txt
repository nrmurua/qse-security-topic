The from_state seems to work as expected for up to 2 qubits, but for the 3 and 4 qubit examples I tested, several discrepancies show up. For e.g., the statevector (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1) should correspond to state |111>, but the sampling result is |110> instead.
from_state on (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1) should lead to |111> upon sampling
Not a regression
No response
This might be my lack of understanding, but I am also confused about what convention we are following here - the little endian or the big endian. When initializing from statevector (0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0), you get |001>. Shouldn't it be |100> as per the cudaq convention? Thank you!
To be tackled as part of #1086.
