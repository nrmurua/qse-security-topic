(Z^I).to_circuit().to_gate().control(3) or (I^Z).to_circuit().to_gate().control(3)

QiskitError: "Error decomposing node of instruction 'id': 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'global_phase'. Unable to define instruction 'id' in the given basis."
whereas any other combination such as (X^X) or (Z^X) etc. doesn't create the same error.
