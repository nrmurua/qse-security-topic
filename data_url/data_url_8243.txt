Feature request
It would be nice to add more information about the support from non-profit organizations NumFOCUS and Unitary Fund.
Proposed solution
Badges can be added for both NumFOCUS and Unitary Fund on the README, to show that they support QuTiP.
Information about Unitary Fund can be added in the documentation and on the website, both in the homepage and in the news section, with info on the program supporting mentorship for students and researchers projects, similarly to Google Summer of Code, but running at any time of the year.
