Hi,
I don't know if this is a symptom of a more serious bug---because I haven't looked at the code---but for some reason the isherm flag of a Qobj() returned by liouvillian_fast() is set wrong.
Example:
In [202]: (liouvillian(sigmaz(),[sigmam()])).isherm
Out[202]: False
In [203]: (liouvillian_fast(sigmaz(),[sigmam()])).isherm
Out[203]: True

liouvillian_fast doesn't set the isherm flag at all, so it becomes the default value True. Unless H=0, the liouvillian should usually be nonhermitian, so False would be a better default value.. Will fix this. Don't think I want to do a full check of the underlaying data in this funciton, because the point of liouvillian_fast is to avoid some unnecessary overhead (although it is still a bit experimental).
