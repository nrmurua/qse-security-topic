If I interrupt and rerun a Jupyter notebook after assigning a new value to aqua_globals.num_processes, it seems to retain that in the next execution session. Is this caching is an expected behavior?
Step : 1
Execute the following code on Jupyter notebook.
The output will be 8 and 5 in separate lines.
Step : 2
Now, interrupt the kernel and comment out aqua_globals.num_processes = 5. Rerun the code.
The output will be 16 and 5 in separate lines.
The output will be 8 and 8 in separate lines.
N?A
If you update the global variable it will persist while that Python session is running. You will need to set it explictly again to update it or simply restart the Jupyter kernel which will re-load all the classes again and it will be restored back to default.
Understood.
Ok, I close this issue off then.
