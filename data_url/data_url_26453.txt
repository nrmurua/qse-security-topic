The CRAY regression tester are failing because of the build issues related to COSTA and COSMA.
We fixed these issues in the latest master. We will soon release a new version of COSTA and COSMA then I can update the toolchain.
we never picked this up with the toolchain. Surprizing.
The problem appears with the toolchain only if an installation using CRAY_LIBSCI is requested.
should be fixed with this PR #2738
@mtaillefumier Thanks for the fix.
no problem.
