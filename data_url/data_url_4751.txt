When I try to run the circuit (mentioned below) I occasionally end up with the error mentioned above.
*Expected behaviour: Ideally when it works, it is supposed to give me the two quadrature values.
Reproduces how often: 30-40% of the time.
*System information:
To reproduce this, I didn't have to particularly do anything. I just have to repeat the process multiple times. I tried it on multiple devices, both on Linux and macOS. I get the same error.
Thanks @biveenslal for catching this, we'll look into it and see where this bug might be occuring.
From the traceback, it looks like you are using the Fock backend. Could you send through:
the backend options (i.e., what is your value of cutoff_dim?)
The value of a used in creating your cat state.
the value of a used in creating my cate state is 2 and the cutoff_dim is 30.
I had tried it with several other lower and higher values and still ends up with the same error.
Thanks @biveenslal --- a value of a=2 is certainly reasonable, so this looks like it might be a bug in the MeasureHomodyne implementation in the Fock backend.
@josh146 Yeah. Seems like that. I started off with a large value of a and thought it would've been causing trouble. I reduced it and still manage to reproduce the error.
Hey @josh146 , any updates on the problem?
Thank you.
Hi @biveenslal, the cause has been found (and hopefully fixed) in #364. This will be merged in shortly, and a new release of Strawberry Fields made. Let me know if this fixes your issue!
