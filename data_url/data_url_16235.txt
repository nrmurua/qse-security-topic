Transpilation of ExcitationPreserving to basis gates u1, u2, u3, cx is extremely slow, so much that it just can't be used.
Here is code to demonstrate it:
Output on my machine:
Looking quickly, BasisTranslator is the slowest pass, with most of its time replacing the translated instructions. On my machine, the num_qubits=16 example with logging.basicConfig(level='INFO'):
This is likely the same issue as described in #5174 (comment) , but seems exceptional in this case.
Note that this probably affects any user who wishes to run VQE on a device, with ExcitationPreserving variational form.
I looked into this issue a little further, and the runtime cost here appears to come from building the symbolic expression to track the global phase during transpilation.
For example, ExcitationPreserving(num_qubits=12, reps=6)and (num_qubits=24, reps=12) have 480 and 3624 parameters, and so after transpilation, end up with a symbolic expression like global phase: -0.5*θ[0] - 2.0*θ[100] - 2.0*θ[101] - 2.0*θ[102] - 2.0*θ[103] - 2.0*θ[104] - ... which currently takes a surprising amount of our time to build.

This looks to be a problem in how we're using sympy (possibly unrelated to #5174 ), in that building and summing large parameterized expressions in sympy is relatively quick (e.g. b = sum(sp.symbols(['x' + str(i) for i in range(1000)])) takes 6.4s on my machine) compared to the extremely slow transpile times seen here.
As a short term workaround, binding parameters prior to transpilation reduces the time considerably (down from almost 4000s to 21s for (num_qubits=24, reps=12) on my machine) but some further investigation is needed to resolve the core issue.
Does it make sense to allow ignoring the global phase in transpilation? @yaelbh I assume you want to execute the transpiled circuit and the global phase doesn't matter?
The global phase doesn't matter
Global phases don't matter only if you compute probabilities of the state. But if you use the circuit and do further processing, like controlling the entire circuit, it becomes a relative phase and does matter. Therefore I don't think we can just generally ignore it upon transpilation.
