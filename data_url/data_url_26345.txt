CDFT and LDA+U seem not to have k-point sampling support. Is there any source that I can learn from to understand the challenge behind it? (i.e., the challenge to generalize the Gamma-point KS potential to each k-point KS potential.)
I am especially curious about the k-point implementation in CP2K, (for example, how is the real-space density matrix obtained?)
https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0007045 says:
An extension of Eq. (9) to include a k-point sampling within the first Brillouin zone is also available in CP2K.
but left without any references. Maybe there are some unpublished developers' notes?
