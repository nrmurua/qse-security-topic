Here is a trivial bug, but it can be quite unsettling.
I run this. It will be fine.
./staq -S  input.qasm
Now, if I remove the space in the second comment line in the test.v to make it look like this:
  //whatever
It will cause an arcane error:
Could not map network into klut network
If I remove the space in the first comment line in the test.v:
//test.v
It will crash outright.
Fixed, but let me know if further issues come up. The parser in Lorina is a litte sketchy.
When this comment line shows up on the top of the Verilog file, it will still crash. No spaces between the // and test.v, I mean.
//test.v
