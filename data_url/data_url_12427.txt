Let's investigate why this happens:
and if it is possible that:
This might have to do with: quantumlib/qsim#69
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
I figured out what's going on the weird path. In bazel, it's creating the temporary cache directory path bazel_{project_name}. For example, for tensorflow quantum, it has quantum as project name, so it creates bazel_quantum directory. Inside it, it collects the whole dependency library path as well as tensorflow_quantum itself. So, in the directory, we can observe:
so to access the qsim directory, we need to use ../ as prefix.
To make the qsim itself as default include path, like #include "qsim/", we can use the bazel's cc_library(includes = ["PATH"]) option. To do that, we may re-organize qsim directory structure. For example, add qsim directory, and put lib directory under it, then we can use #include "qsim/lib/...".
Let me prepare a PR to fix this, and maybe this will be a starter for migrating qsim to full bazel supports as mentioned in quantumlib/qsim#69
