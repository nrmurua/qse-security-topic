Run through PyTest.

Same test .py files run fine separately.
hey I am facing this similar issue is there any headway on this
from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit. This is the line that breaks for me in Python 3.9.16
Not sure why, but in my case, this error (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit._accelerate') will be resolved after running a tox test like tox -epy38.
This is usually caused by an changes in the Rust code, which can be resolved by rebuilding in case you already have an editable install (this command would be executed at root level)
or just by re-installing Qiskit locally
Using tox you should not have this error as a new environment is set up.
@plutoniumm @yurivict do you still encounter these problems? ðŸ™‚
Hi @Cryoris, no problems now :)
I just recreate the whole container everytime I need do it :p so there's no dependency issues
Thanks a lot <3
