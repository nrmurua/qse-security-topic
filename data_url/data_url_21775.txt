When bug reporting, it's useful to have an idea what ARTIQ version is causing the issue. I suggest adding a --version flag to artiq_run or artiq_master to print the version number.
It could be added elsewhere, but this seems one of the easiest places.
Implementation (neglecting adding flag to argparse):
That can be obtained with conda list or running that code in the python repl. The issue is to which tool the flag should be added. Why not dashboard, browser, or compile?
artiq_run and _master are fine by me. Why not just add it to verbosity_args()? That covers a lot.
Maybe rename verbosity_args to e.g. common_args then?
@sbourdeauducq That would require a fair amount of refactoring, though I agree with the idea. A quick scan of the repo shows ~15 files where verbosity_args is used, not counting code built on top of it.
Also, processing the --version flag could be abstracted to some common function, maybe something like (in artiq.tools):
Edit: removed bind processing b/c needs special return, doesn't process in place
