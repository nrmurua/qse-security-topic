A list of dependencies on getting started tutorial and how to install them (if possible).
Here's what is needed for the circuit drawing part. I will write a separate tutorial on circuit visualization.
Thanks! This is really helpful.
Ninad also told me a script installing all dependencies as here:
https://github.ibm.com/nsathaye/qiskit_dsx/blob/master/qiskit_dependencies.sh
@ajavadia on Linux I required texlive packages But  installing those packages need quite a bit of additional space.  Is there any lightweight alternative to the circuit visualization?
I will create a public version of the script I have written ( @rraymondhp mentioned this in earlier note) Essentially this is what it has --
The current circuit plotter goes like qasm->latex->pdf->png
We have an open issue to make the dependencies lighter:
Qiskit/qiskit#311
@ajavadia what is the status of this. Rather than a tutorial can we just make sure we add to the INSTALL a link for making sure you have the requirements and some steps to installing
