I cannot access the Forest SDK.
On the installation page: https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/v2.0.0/start.html
if I follow the link "Request the Forest SDK here." ( https://www.rigetti.com/forest ), I get a white page.
How can I get the Forest SDK? I need to run the pyquil test locally and I need qvm and quilc. Am I right?

Via Chrome and Firefox on linux ubuntu
