Update the file names for the sample_result class from the old measure_counts name. Will also entail updating any relevant includes of this file around the codebase. There should be no other changes required to actual code implementations beyond that.
See: runtime/common/MeasureCounts*
Hey,
I would like to work on this issue, I am new to open source and this would give me the confidence and experience of working on a big project. I have gone through the task and will complete it and create a PR.
Hi @abhikumar63, I just saw this and have assigned it to you!
@anthony-santana, Is this still being done by @abhikumar63? Or, is it open for contribution?
Looks like there is no open PR or any activity yet.
Hi @abhikumar63, are you still interested in picking this issue up? If not, I will reassign it to @shabeebk and am happy to find you another good first issue for you ðŸ˜„
Hey @anthony-santana, sorry for the ultimate delay but it got totally off my mind. I will be creating a pull request soon. It would be really helpful if you could guide me about issues for beginners and contributing to open source.
