Problem: The version of the git submodules used in riscv-gnu-toolchain can currently only be set to default (the version riscv-gnu-toolchain provides) or a tag, branch or commit hash. The options "latest" and "stable" are missing. 
This is not expedient because in all the riscv-tools repository the stable branch is the default branch which is the latest branch most of the time. Sometimes branches that are commits ahead exist, but those are development branches. In this case it is better to let the users explicitly configure the branch name or commit hash.
