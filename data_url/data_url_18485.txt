quilc integrates optimizing compilation techniques for classical control flow with optimizing techniques for classical instructions. Naive attempts to test this get pretty computationally intensive, but there must be a sane way to write unit tests for this. Figure this out and implement them.
See also #92 and perhaps #77.
Now that #263 is in, there's a template to work from.
