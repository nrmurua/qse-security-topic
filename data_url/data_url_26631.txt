Dear CP2K developers,
I am trying to set up the prerequisites for compiling CP2K 8.1 with the toolchain, but am having two (connected) problems with Cosma. The first is that I am setting --with-cosma=no, but despite this, the toolchain attempts to install Cosma. This gives rise to the second issue, which is the Cosma install failing, with the following error being the initial one: /home/pts28/mtg_bin/cp2k-8.1/tools/toolchain/build/cosma-2.2.0/libs/grid2grid/src/grid2grid/scalapack_layout.cpp(68): error: copy-list-initialization cannot use a constructor marked "explicit" return {idx_block_proc * block_dimension + idx_in_block, owner};
I would be grateful for any help and am happy to provide more details if needed. Apologies if this isn't the right place to raise this issue.
Concerning your first problem, SIRIUS requires COSMA and the default for --with-sirius is install. Thus adding --with-sirius=no might help unless you want to have SIRIUS and/or COSMA installed.
Thank you very much for your response, the toolchain worked after adding --with-sirius=no.
COSMA is not a hard dependency for SIRIUS. The toolchain imposes this but it is not requested. I will prepare a patch that fixes this issue so that SIRIUS can be compiled without explicit need of cosma.
Hi @PascalSalzbrenner ,  I am the developer of COSMA and am interested in the installation problem you had. Which compiler did you use?
We are preparing a new release of COSMA soon, that will bring multiple performance improvements and we would also like to fix all the issues that were discovered in the meantime.
Hi Marko! The compiler is used is g++, I believe the GNU version is 4.8.5. I'm attaching the full cmake.log and make.log in case they are helpful to you.
cmake.log
make.log
Please note that 4.8.5 is not supported in CP2K (see https://www.cp2k.org/dev:compiler_support )
I see - thank you for clearing this up, I should really have checked more carefully!
@PascalSalzbrenner and @alazzaro Thanks Pascal and Alfio for clarifications. Indeed, GCC 4.8.5 is probably too old.
