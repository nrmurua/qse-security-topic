move https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/advanced/terra/calibrating_a_qubit.ipynb to Ignis/
I know that this does not use ignis yet -- but I could image we build a function for making a pulse sequence and then a fitter for fitting the Rabi. My view is that this is noise and showing how to measure it so it fits in ignis more than terra.
