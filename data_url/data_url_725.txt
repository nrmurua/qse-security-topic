Would you please consider setting that to YES in the Doxyfile?
I think the search engine costs very little, but offers a lot of convenience. After all, the staq project sets that to YES by default.
Otherwise, the git would have to deal with that whenever I pull the master, after I make a local change to YES.
Thanks.
Thanks, for some reason that flag ended up with NO (although the default was YES). Set back to YES now in the devel branch which will be merged with the future release.
