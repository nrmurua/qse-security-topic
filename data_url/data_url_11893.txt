Due to the fact that users might interest the scale of the quantum circuits they are running, it will be nice to summarize the circuits.
Print out the summary of submitted circuits in the DEBUG level.
We can get width, size, depth from the to-be-submitted circuit objects.
And we can try to get those stats right after we submit jobs since we wait for results, it is a good place to summarize the circuits.
Feature request.
