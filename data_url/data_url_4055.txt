As mentioned by @kel85uk and @stanvn , it is very inconvenient when the sweep point array file is not generated. Often it suffices to have a default sweep point array which corresponds to total number of measurement instructions.
I think this would be a nice addition to OpenQL. @imranashraf we should probably discuss some details together.
sure @AdriaanRol
@AdriaanRol what can a suitable default for sweep point array?
@imranashraf , I propose we get rid of the "sweep_point_array" entirely.
If you want to have a sensible default, the number of distinct measurement events is a sensible default, but we generally extract that by reading it from the generated .qisa instructions ourselves.
