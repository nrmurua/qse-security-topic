Using 1.1 on Windows,
Gives me 1.
Raises the following error,
This is expected behavior. Rounding an integer is a no-op, and since kernel code has no polymorphism, such a round call is completely pointless as it will never perform any operation.
How is this done in regular python where round(1) just returns 1?
Regular Python has polymorphism; expressions can have many types. In ARTIQ Python any expression belongs to exactly one type, so if it is int then the round call can simply be removed.
