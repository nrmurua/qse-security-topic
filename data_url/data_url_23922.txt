I am getting an error when I run a EchoCRLen function in jupyter notebook (please see the attached screen capture).  Depending on the 'length' parameter of q2 that I set in GUI, the error does or does not occur. For example, if I choose 63 ns, no error, but if I choose 60ns, the error. I  have no idea what the message "Unable to find a uniform set of entries" means. I wish to be able to understand the codes appearing in Traceback, but I am not near it yet. Any thought would be helpful.
Currently, I am using this branch for QGL : https://github.com/Plourde-Research-Lab/QGL/tree/JPM
If you would need any addition info, let me know.
