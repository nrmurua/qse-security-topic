NVIDIA cuQuantum has a demo for dynamically linking both CUDA and cuQuantum. This could significantly simplify our build process, and possibly enable workflows that are currently infeasible (e.g. a simple multinode GPU workflow).
Yes, plz ping me, @ahehn-nv, or @tlubowe if you have any questions! ðŸ™‚
We just released cuQuantum 23.03 and this includes APIs to introduce multinode GPU emulations to qsim. The documentation can be found here.
