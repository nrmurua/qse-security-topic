When I append barriers with empty list of target qubits I get no warnings, but then the generated qasm is invalid.
Run this python script:
Produces this error:
The error happens only when importing the qasm file, whereas I believe the mistake is done by the exporter, which generates the barrier; statement, see below.
This is the genrated QASM:
I would have expected the QASM exporter to generate a valid qasm, ready to be reimported.
I would suggest to make the addition of barrier with empty lists raise a warning to the developer, because the problem happens also with qc.barrier([]), and the qiskit is silently generating invalid qasm.
Thanks - there's oddly enough two separate bugs here, because the new OQ2 parser accepts barrier;.  By the letter of the OQ2 spec, the barrier; statement is invalid, but OQ3 adds meaning to that to mean "all qubits in scope".  I think when I wrote the new parser I was still thinking about OQ3, because I put in very specific handling for the barrier; case.
In #10469 I've made the new parser reject such statements when running in strict mode since I think the broadcasting behaviour is actually a useful quality-of-life improvement to the specification, like us accepting trailing commas, empty statements, not errorring if there's no version, etc).  I also made the OQ2 exporter skip barriers that act on no qubits, since such a statement already has no effect on anything, and can't be exported to OQ2 safely.
