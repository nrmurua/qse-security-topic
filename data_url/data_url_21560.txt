The ARTIQ core device tutorial calls for using a RTIO LED, which is causing confusion to new Kasli 2.0 users as there is no RTIO LED by default. It is straightforward for more experienced people to use a TTL instead, but this isn't too friendly to beginners.
So a front panel USER LED should be connected to RTIO and present in the DDB templates.
Similarly, I think the board USER LED should not be connected to RTIO so that it cannot be inadvertently used by people taking the tutorial for the first time with a Kasli card already in a crate where the board LED isn't visible.
