#3626 pinned openfermion and openfermionpyscf as a temporary fix.
This issue is to update the notebook based on the latest version of the API.
cc @rmlarose - will you have bandwidth to fix this?
Can do!
Question for @ncrubin or @kevinsung
Most API changes are very small except for the variational energy calculation section, in particular the line
The ofc.variational module was not copied over when merging OpenFermion-Cirq into OpenFermion (quantumlib/OpenFermion#619 (comment)). Is there a new equivalent of the ofc.LowRankTrotterAnsatz in OpenFermion? Or should this section be removed from the docs now?
@rmlarose Indeed, we decided to scrap the old ofc.variational module, and there is no equivalent of ofc.LowRankTrotterAnsatz in OpenFermion, so that section of the docs should be removed.
