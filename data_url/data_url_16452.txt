I have a list of quantum circuit that looks like this:
I'd like to pass in an initial_layout like [[0,1],[1,0,3],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,2,3,4]], but obviously it doesn't work (when I use it on the measurement calibration in here, I put the initial_layout on the transpile part and the num_qubits is the length of the initial_layout element, it says "Unexpected state label '11', verify the fitter's state labels correpsond to the input data" where  so I think it doesn't understand the list).
Is there a way I could do this, or do I have to split the qc_list out? Thank you!
If I understand correctly, what you're asking for should already be possible (example code below). Can you provide some example code that reproduces the failure you're seeing?
ping @mx73 ?
