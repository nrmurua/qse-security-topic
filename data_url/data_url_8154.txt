Describe the issue
I want to calculate the teleportation fidelity for a two qubit mixed entangled state. I am writing a generalised mixed state for two qubit in density matrix form and then I create a random qubit to be teleported.
I am able to write a teleportation program when I create the entanglement in the form of kets and use snot and cnot gates to teleport a qubit, but I am unable to do it in when I create in the form of density matrices.
Is there a way in QuTip to do teleportation when we create the mixed entangled pairs in the form of density matrices?
To Reproduce
If applicable, Please provide a minimal working example. For instance:
The terminal out put is
QuTiP QubitCircuit does not support density matrices. (Please correct me if I'm wrong @sarsid). But you can easily do it yourself. Applying a gate on a density matrix can be represented as C * rho * C.dag() where C is your gate operator.
