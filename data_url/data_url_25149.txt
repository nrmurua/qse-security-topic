Now, electron have call_after hooks, which means electron can do something after electron completed successfully. However, there isn't some hooks to let electron do something when status of electron is Failed or Cancelled. Maybe there should have some callback hooks for electron when it is failure or cancelled.
There is a suggested UX to use callback hooks.
This example will create a file named data.txt, and when function get_my_value* goes to a certain status, data.txt will be removed.
