A couple optimization passes would be able to work transparently with ParameterizedValues if they supported the __neg__ operation. For example, to multiply an ExpW gate by X you negate its axis_half_turns parameter.
This would also require updating the API to support the scale factor.
Obsoleted by design discussions of ParameterizedValue.
