I just tried to set up pyEPR with Ansys on a new PC. Created a new environment and installed all required packages. Now, when I try to connect to Ansys with epr.ProjectInfo,
pinfo = epr.ProjectInfo(project_path = os.getcwd(),
project_name = 'TripleCats',)
it connects to Ansys and finds the correct file path, but then spits out this error
There was the same problem for the previous setup, which could be resolved by reinstalling everything from scratch. Ideas for an easier fix?
👏👏👏 You are awesome! Thank you for making your first issue to pyEPR ' first issue
