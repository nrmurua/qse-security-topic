I'll start with: I really don't know much about the systems and I apologize if I end up wasting some of your time.
That out of the way, would running redundant systems fight against the potential for noise?
Hey @Uleyra
The theory of quantum error correction addresses exactly what you're suggesting.
This post is more appropriate for the Quantum Computing StackExchange  than here. This space is strictly for Cirq related issues.  Please post future general questions about quantum computing on the StackExchange.
Thanks.
