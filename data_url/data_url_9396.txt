The multiplication operation should work on waveforms, in the sense of it creating an algebraic field with the reals and/or a vector space.
For example,
delta = piecewise_linear(clocks=[0,1],values=[ 0, 1])
delta2 = 2 * delta2
Additionally, multiplication by a vector should generate a vector of waveforms, eg
delta = [ 0.3, 0.524, 1.35, -2.21 ] * delta
These are extremely intuitive uses; for example, multiplication by a vector can be used for weighted MIS.
