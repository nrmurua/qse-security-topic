I was creating the key and certificate using falcon-512 and to perform the same I used the below command
sudo apps/openssl req -new -newkey rsa3072_falcon512 -key private_key.pem -out request.csr -config apps/openssl.cnf
sudo apps/openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in request.csr -signkey private_key.pem -out certificate.pem
and I am using those key and certificate in my DOT using stunnel4

but getting an below error

Can you please help me to resolve this error
Apologies for the tardiness responding: We're really moving off (oqs-)openssl111 to only support OpenSSL3. So, if you can reproduce the same problem there (?), please open an issue in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider/issues
Closing due to inactivity.
