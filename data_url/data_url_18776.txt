What is the exact semantics of gphase() ? The paper and spec only said adds a global phase of e^(iÎ³) to the scope containing the instruction.
For example, the following code
What is the matrix of gate foo for q0, q1, and q2~q3?
I'm not sure if we ever defined what happens when multiple global phases are added. There are three choices for your example:

I've studied the implementation in Amazon Braket. gphase(x) in Braket works as an n-qubits global phase gate applies in all qubits in current scope. There's no limit on where and how many times it appears.
The n-qubits global phase gate is:
$$
\text{gphase}_n(x) = e^{i x} I _ {2^n}
$$
I think the semantics of gphase() should be more specific in the spec.
The TSC discussed today and agreed that gphases should accumulate. @nakrakiiya would you like to open a PR and add a sentence to the spec outlining this detail?
