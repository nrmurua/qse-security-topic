The core-analyzer trace contains corrupt message (cf #1263)
The core analyzer log seems to contain frequent (every 10 minutes or so) corrupted messages, causing
artiq_coreanalyzer to give an error:
The ExceptionType seems to be either 202 or 252.
Adding some debug prints to comm_analyzer to print the hex encoded message and the decoded message:
This last message is corrupt - it does not have a sensible rtio_counter or channel value, and the padding is non-zero. Any ideas what could be causing this? Could this indicate some memory corruption on the core device that is also causing #1263 ?
