Build docs action failing to install pyscf:
@balopat, is this a known issue?
Haven't seen that one before. But it seems to be passing now - I'll open a flake issue for it just in case we see it again, maybe we can reproduce it / understand it better.

I don't think we've seen this in a while.  Closing.
