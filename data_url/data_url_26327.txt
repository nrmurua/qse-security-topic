It seems the following keywords in PW_DFT/CONTROL section have no effect on what is printed in the output:
PRINT_FORCES
PRINT_STRESS
PRINT_TIMERS
In addition, keyword OUTPUT is not recognized in CONTROL section.
CC: @mtaillefumier
they have been removed from the list of available options as they are only intended for debugging purpose. Forces and stress are not automatically calculated and an explicit call the cp2k dedicated functions should be made to retrieve the values.
Thanks! Indeed, these keywords no longer exist in the FORCE_EVAL/PW_DFT/PRINT section.
The keywords are in the PW_DFT/CONTROL section.
My bad. I guess, we should remove those keywords?
