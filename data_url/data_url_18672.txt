Though I installed the latest code, quilc reports as 1.5.0
I think that this might cause the CL-QUIL version error when I try to build QVM later, but I can't be sure:
Yikes! That's weird.
What does the following show:
Package QL does not exist.
When I run sbcl --load ~/quicklisp/setup.lisp first
I ought to retry this later on a different machine and I'll be more careful how I install QuickLisp. Will report back in the next day or so that fixes the issue
Update: worth noting, I tried building the QVM repo on this machine before QuilC, so I dunno if that might have downloaded or set something?
Cloning the current master branch into ~/quicklisp/local-projects/ avoided the delay in QuickLisp updates. Fixed
