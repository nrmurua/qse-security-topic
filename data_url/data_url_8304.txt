Hi
RT=1/sqrt(2)*(tensor(ket0,ket0)+tensor(ket1,ket1))
RR=ket2dm(RT)
print(entropy_vn(RR, base=2, sparse=False))
in above program I want calculate the entropy
We know that it is 1 for bell state
But output is 3.2034265038149176e-16!!!!
can you help me?
it not work
I want to obtain  entropy of 4*4 density matrix
The state you defined is a pure state, so even if you write it as a density matrix it has zero entropy.
So that output is correct.
The entropy being 1 for a Bell state is true when you trace out one of the two systems, so that the reduced state is now mixed,
e.g.,
