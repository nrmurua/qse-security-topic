With Gnome 3:

I only notice this bug on Arch Linux. Ubuntu and Windows are not affected. @jordens @whitequark can you reproduce this?
Theme-related perhaps?
Fine here with our conda qt. Looks like it breaks when switching between the wrapped rendering and the one-line editing.
Bug is not present when run under KDE.
Bug still present with Qt5.6.
Fine now. Could be the upgrade to 5.7.
