Lloyd's paper uses a rather unique parameterization. A tutorial using a more canonical unitary parameterization as is used in eq(4) of  Quantum generalization of feedforward neural networks would be nice to have.
This has exponentials of Pauli matrices. Hence, not auto-differentiable for now. Closing this
