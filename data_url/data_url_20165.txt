There are three total instances of OQS_PORTABLE_BUILD being spelled as OQS_BUILD_PORTABLE
OQS_PORTABLE_BUILD is defined and is ON, by default.
OQS_BUILD_PORTABLE is not defined anywhere and is, by default, OFF
The build logic that mistakenly uses OQS_BUILD_PORTABLE is building as a non-portable build in all cases.
Fixing these instances, results in the tests failing to link as the sha3/sha3x4.c sha-3 implementation would no longer be the default on portable builds.
Fixed by #864.
