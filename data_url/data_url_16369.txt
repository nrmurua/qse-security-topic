As @kdk explains in this comment, the CommutationAnalysis pass is storing internal state and that (probably) creates invalid results when run is called more than once.
In a deeper look it seems safe to share CommutationAnalysis.cache. I will explore a bit longer.
CommutationAnalysis.gates_on_wire is not used and can be removed (PR #5000)

Agree, since the cache only records commutation relations which are globally true (and not specific to a particular DAG or call to run), this is okay.
