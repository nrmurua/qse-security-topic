I'm trying to construct a circuit which uses mid-circuit resets. When I try to compile the program an error is thrown. I've found that the error is only thrown when trying to reset a single qubit, resetting all qubits works fine.
Using the standard jupyterhub available at jupyterhub.qcs.rigetti.com. Based my code on the example tutorials found there.
