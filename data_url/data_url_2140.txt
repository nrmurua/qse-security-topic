Not sure if this is intentional or not, but the AQT device is entirely unmentioned in the v0.6 (stable) docs.
This could be fixed with something like sphinx-apidoc if this project uses that.

Thanks for the report.
We need to gradually expand docs/docs_coverage_test.py to cover all packages (instead of a few whitelisted ones). The aqt package is one of the packages that is not tested for doc coverage yet.
I improved the aqt device documentation. See PR #2578
