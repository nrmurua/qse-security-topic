Describe the bug
After updating gcc to version 13.1.1 I cannot build the library anymore. Main branch is okay. On top of that, I still need to manually apply the fix for sha3. It's getting difficult to maintain a package for Arch Linux. Also, note that other distros are starting to use gcc 13 as well (Fedora 38, for example).
Is there a plan for a new release?

Is there a plan for a new release?
Yes. We wanted to get this out last month. Sole issue remaining for milestone 0.8.0 has a PR that needs fixing.
Closing this issue since it's a duplicate of #1375 which was fixed in #1377 and will be available in the forthcoming liboqs 0.8.0 release.
