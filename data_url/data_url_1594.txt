Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
I need a function that takes in a state_vector and returns the probabilities of it's amplitudes.
Describe the solution you'd like
Add a def state_vector_to_probabilities() to
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-core/cirq/value/probability.py
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
Defined my own:
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
I would love to take this up.
Also go through and see where in Cirq probabilities are being used and replace with this function
Is someone currently working on this issue because the corresponding pull request failed tests and is not updated since past 14 days. I think there is no need to validate the probability if we normalize the state_vector first.
Hey @prathameshbhole, I've pinged @Patil2099.
Hi @vtomole if no one's working on this ATM I would love to take this up
@ishmum123 It seems like @Patil2099 hasn't responded to my ping. Feel free to look at this issue.
@prathameshbhole Yeah, that's right.
@mpharrigan there seems to be a quite a few cases where this functionality is being used. Should I try to refactor them?
Yes, I believe my comment #4322 (comment) was me hastily transcribing notes from the Cirq Cync call that requested exactly that.
@mpharrigan I refactored some of the files. However, these files -
fidelity_esitmation.py, measures.py, projector.py, state_vector.py, states.py
fail to pass the tests after refactor. Throwing errors along the lines of shape mismatch and invalid norm
