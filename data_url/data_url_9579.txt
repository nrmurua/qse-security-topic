A global pulse with any noise (but dephasing) is translated into a local pulse on each qubit.
The way the code is written now, if a local Ising pulse and a global Ising pulse with noise act on the same qubit at the same time, the two pulses do not add, but rather the last one that is processed overwrites the other.
Attached you can find a minimal working example.

Here's the minimal code explicit for future reference and testing:
One should get True from the final assertion.
This one seems fit for a hotfix into the master branch. I will create the corresponding branch (hotfix-global-errors). To be sure I'm not skipping any places where this is corrected, would you like to fix the bug, @julien-bremont ?
I might be wrong, but the fix could be as simple as replacing = with +=  in the following block:
in Simulation.write_samples
I believe in @sebgrijalva's minimal example one should compare the off-diagonal components of the Hamiltonian, not the whole thing, because doppler noise adds a random detuning term.
So something like this:
where the last statement should return True
I added a pull request for the issue directly into master, correct @sebgrijalva?
Yes, hotfixes are meant to be only from and back to the master branch. Unfortunately you merged develop to the hotfix branch and this should be avoided until we are ready to merge many new changes to master.
But since it's such a minor difference this time, I can edit the file (_version.py).
