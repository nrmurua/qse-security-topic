We could adapt the current fix_variables function to also determine pair-wise whether variables are equal or not equal in the ground states.
Additional Context
roof duality is polynomial time, so the pairwise algorithm would be as well.
This is some dangerous territory. there is no guarantee that the pair-wise behavior will be that of the ground state if the spin is fixed in wrong direction.
Would the case where the spins are equal or not equal for both possible fixed values work?
no it won't
Closing now that roof duality has been moved to dwave-preprocessing
