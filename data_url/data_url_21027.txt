Seems to incorrectly detect setuptools being out of date, causing a cascading set of failures; preventing QRL (specifically pyqrllib and pyqryptonight) from being installed.
Hacking away the checks (and a seemingly obvious git submodule init/update) seems to result in a working installation..?

Could you provide log files about this? We have not seen this in any of our tests or reported before.
The problem, sounds to me very similar to what Travis was facing few weeks before, even when setuptools was mentioned with latest version.
Apologies for the delay, just spun up a DigitalOcean Ubuntu 16.04 VPS to get a log for you guys.
I can't get around this (without hacking PyScafford's setup.py to remove the check).
pyscaffold.log
(putty seems to echo chars a few times by the way)
Hmm.. I think error is similar to https://travis-ci.org/theQRL/QRL/jobs/354971598
Try uninstalling this:
 sudo apt purge python-pkg-resources
This should leave you with the python3 pkg resources.
If that doesn't work:
To check the manual pkg for python (not python3):
python -c 'import pkg_resources; print(pkg_resources.__file__)'
Then remove it (maybe)
sudo rm /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py*
Then attempt to install python3-pkg-resources
sudo apt install python3-pkg-resources

It's a compatibility issue with setuptools 39, an earlier version should work as a workaround for now, e.g: pip install "setuptools<39"
Should be fixed in the next pyscaffold point release (3.0.2) in the next day or so.

Appears to be fine in master now?
yes, it seems it got fixed. We need to upgrade qrllib and test that everything is ok when upgrading. We are actually a few versions behind at the moment.
