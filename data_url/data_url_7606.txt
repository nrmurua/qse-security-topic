Register is something contains a quantum states. Since a quantum state of N qubits is actually a rank-N tensor. All quantum registers supports the interface of julia arrays.
To preserve memory contiguous, we use the last dimension as our batch dimension.  An naive implementation could be
where M is the number of qubits, and B is the number of batches.
