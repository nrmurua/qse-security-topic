I ran into an interesting issue. When creating a specific operator Julia stops and returns
Julia has stopped: null, SIGKILL
Here is a minimal code that produces this error for me:
Changing "systemsize" to '1' in the definition of b_mb seems to resolve the problem (which is enough for my calculations)
Looking at your code, it is clear that the system size you chose leads to a ridiculous dimension. I am not surprised at all that Julia crashes.
Looking at b_total.shape we see that the total dimension of the composite space is
Since you are using the projector function (which returns a DenseOperator) to build your operator, you are trying to build a matrix dim^2 complex floats as entries. A complex float uses 16 bytes, meaning that this
is the amount of GB ram you would require to even store one column of the created operator.
In general, I recommend you stick to SparseOperator types for large systems (e.g. by using sparse(projector(KetSite(j)))), but even that won't help for your current choice of dimensions. The only thing left to do is what you already did, namely reducing the systemsize parameter.
