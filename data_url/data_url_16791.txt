Passing execute() a list of circuits gives BrokenProcessPool error if the circuit has been drawn with mpl and has a reset in it.
Create list of circuits with resets:
Draw one using mpl:
circuits[0].draw(output='mpl')
Execute:
job = execute(circuits, Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'))
Properly executed circuits.
I just tried this locally on linux (mostly out of curiosity) and was not able to reproduce this failure. This makes me think that this is related to #3491 which was a change for only macos in 0.12.0 as part of the py3.8 entablement. The one thing I'm still not sure about is how the reset gate or mpl draw is the trigger for the parallel execution to fail. Do you have the full traceback from the failure?
I agree it seems quite strange, but if I remove the resets or the mpl drawing the error disappears.
I have just tried to reproduce this on a Windows machine and also cannot see the exception.
This is an issue with Matplotlib that they have said they would fix in version 3.3.
