Following from #139. We have few issues that nee to be solved at once and for all :P
The first issue at hand is, given the parameter foo:
I would pick shortest, lower case string.
then
I would just pick all-lower case, because easier simpler, more predictable (albeit less scienc-y).
Last about f.ex.
Some how I think that a lot of things can be "booleanized", but I don't know what you scientists want.
I would like foo.is_running-->bool, rather than foo.status--> "too many options will break eventually".
It may be less sexy and look less clever, but it's just miles easier. But just IMHO.
Now, fight!  @alexcjohnson @AdriaanRol @spauka @MerlinSmiles .
Currently I'd say lowercase would be a good standard, because 1. explicit, 2. works if extra options get added in firmware.
However looking in the future at (passive) gui elements it would make sense to show status with an LED type indicator, in which case a Bool or an int is a natural thing to use. But I guess we can also just define the mapping explicitly for every driver at that point.
