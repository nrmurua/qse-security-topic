The input adjacency matrix A for HiddenLinearFunction should be required to be a symmetric matrix. A check for the same seems to be missing in qiskit/circuit/library/hidden_linear_function.py
Please let me know if I'm missing something here.
No you're right, it should be symmetric. Do you want to add the check?
Surely! I'll send in a PR, thanks!
