I think we should have a new page for wrapped common observables and measurement.
1, how to measure observables, the example can show a simple register, e.g. product state. This also covers the introduction how to initialize certain states.
2, what observables have been wrapped up, Rydberg density, correlation, entanglement?
3, hamiltonian can be treated as observable?
4, measuring in subspace. This should also cover how to initialize state in subspace.
@Roger Let us start working on this once we have stable API for expect, and wrapped observables.
useful observable wrapper:
Rydberg density=  R_density(psi_t), output is vector
Rydberg correlation= R_corre(psi_t), output is matrix
Xi= get_X(psi)
figure out correlation wrapper, and a list of observable wrapper
some thoughts below
expect(put(i=>X), psi)
expect (psi, [ [X, I] ])
expect (psi, [ [ X, I ], [x, j ] ] )
correlation_operator(n) =
expect(correlation_operator(n), psi)
expect(I=>X, psi)
