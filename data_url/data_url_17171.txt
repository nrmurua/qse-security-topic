Comparing two instructions that have matrix parameters fails ungracefully with
ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
Matrix parameters for instructions are currently generated when converting Aer's errors to instructions.
The following code raises this error:
Correct element-by-element comparison of the matrices, using numpy.isclose for almost-identical matrices.
Line 99 in instruction.py needs to be modified; it seems type-checking the parameter is needed (maybe isinstance(self_param, numpy.ndarray?). For Numpy arrays numpy.equalandnumpy.iscloseworks and returns a boolean array of results, on whichall()` can be used.
This is currently blocking a PR in Aer: Qiskit/qiskit-aer#239
