QFTs are great, but nothing about quantum mechanics is really perfectly linear or sines/cosines is it?

I think it is a great idea to add a QWT benchmark ... the project is open for anyone to submit enhancements.
One could easily add the QWT as a "method 3"   within the QFT benchmark framework (if you think of QWT as a "variation").
Or, the QFT benchmark could be copied and renamed "qwt" and modified to be its own benchmark type.
(this is preferred so as to keep the current QFT benchmark as simple as possible).
You could create the code for this in a fork of the QED-C repo and submit via a PR ...
or submit it as a more detailed proposal that we could consider for future work.
(the first is preferred of course!)
