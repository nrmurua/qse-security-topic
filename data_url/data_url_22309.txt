Not user-visible and only with Python 3.5.2, so not that serious.
Well, we need to fix the CI anyway, because there is no point in even having it if it's always red.
(Also, right now docs aren't updated at the end of the build, because win64 fails first.)
Yes. But it still runs the other tests and the same ones on Linux.
It is still useless because of how hard to notice it is that the kind of failure has changed.
IMHO all that and if it is not serious then we don't need to hold 1.2.

Workarounds: use 127.0.0.1 or localhost.
Problem commit/line is: python/cpython@03df54d#diff-08afa52ab2b1511bee8527814ad44d80R138
Python 3.5.2 tries to skip calling getaddrinfo() if the host is already an IP address. The function which is called instead, _ipaddr_info(), should be returning a 4-tuple for AF_INET6 family. Instead it only returns 2, and the Windows function ConnectEx() doesn't like that some IPv6 fields are missing when Python converts from a tuple to a C struct.
