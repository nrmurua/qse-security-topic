Given a quantum channel, compute the input, output, and environment dimensions of the quantum channel.
The channel should be provided as input as either a Choi matrix or a List or Kraus operators.
In spirit, the approach for computing these dimensions align with the QETLAB function superoperator_dims found here.
For reference, here is some code written that partially implements the solution:
