The notebook tests fail with jupyter_client.kernelspec.NoSuchKernel: No such kernel named python3 
Examples:
Since the failure arises from the execute_notebook method, #6158 should help fix this issue.
But I'm not sure why this is failing right now
I ran into this bumping dependencies in qualtran
quantumlib/Qualtran@cee761e
From cirq cynque: need to add an explicit dependency to ipykernel
