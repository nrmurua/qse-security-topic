The Kraus class documents as valid inputs
However the Kraus.compose method has cases where it uses the initializer with data = tuple(np.ndarray, None). This case is not documented and leads to a problem with NumPy as the Kraus initializer tries to wrap data into a matrix, but constructing arrays from ragged inputs is removed in NumPy 1.24.0.
Run e.g. the TestStinespring.test_compose test.
Update the docs and handle the tuple properly.
