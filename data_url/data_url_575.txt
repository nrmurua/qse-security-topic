I'm trying to use HWE ansatz, but the output circuit always comes out to be blank.
xacc.qasm(f'''
.compiler xasm
.circuit ansatz
.parameters t0
.qbit q
hwe(q, t0, { {"nq", {num_qubits}}, {"layers", {layers}}, {"coupling",  str(coupling) }});
''')
where the coupling is of type List[Tuple(Int, Int)], num_qubits and layers are integers.
Preview:

I couldn't find any documentation regarding using this. Any help will be appreciated.
Looks like you've found a bug in how the XASM compiler processes circuit generator options. We'll work on a fix for this. In the meantime, you could generate the hwe ansatz with for loops or with the hwe generator directly. Check this out:
Is anyone working on this?  I could give it a shot.
