The code to create a new DAG and then copy over the metadata from another DAG is used in many passes, e.g. in lookahead swap
It might be good to have this functionality as a method on the original DAG, so you could call dag.blank_copy() or similar to retrive a copy of the DAG with the same name/creg/qreg.
I think we have to move towards a model where that kind of copy is not needed. The target dag should be extended automatically, with no need to pre-add the regs.
