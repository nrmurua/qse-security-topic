Hi @taalexander. Happy to look into this. Will come back if I have any questions.
Awesome, thank you! Assigned!
Hi @taalexander. I've added the parameters but noticed that on 'to_dict()' these parameters are being multiplied by 1e-9 a second time (first time is on initialisation of the class). Is this the expected results?
Hello @scottkelso, this is a bug. They should be multiplied by 1e9 so as to correct the scaling factor that is added when deserializing. Would you mind fixing this? This is correct in the PulseBackendConfiguration https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/f6f60f02227dd18e196a11c4e592631a8f379d50/qiskit/providers/models/backendconfiguration.py#L640
Ah, I see now. Sure thing @taalexander.
I've also added dt/dtm to backend_configuration_openqasm_example and backend_configuration_openqasm_simulator_example, and bumped version from 1.1.1 -> 1.1.2. Let me know if there are any others I'm missing.
Could you give some advice on how you would go about testing these added values? I was thinking of a test similar to test_simple_config from test_backendconfiguration but for fake_qasm_simulator. Would that suffice?
Closed via #5141 Thanks!
