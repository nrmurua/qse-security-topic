"The Lecture 20 by John Watrous." link in CHSHGame/README.md is dead.
https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/CPSC519/LectureNotes/20.pdf is no longer available and I can't find a mirror -_-
Looks like John Watrous did some reorganizing of his lecture notes, and it now resides at https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/QC-notes/ (still as lecture 20).
We'll need to go through the rest of the links to his lecture notes and fix them as well.
Thank you for reporting!
