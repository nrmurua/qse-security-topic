A qasm simulator created by sim_1= qiskit.providers.aer.QasmSimulator(noise_model=n) will behave as expected. (well, except for issue #1346)
Unfortunately,  a simulator created by
Will not behave as a noisy simulator, even though sim_1.options == sim_2.options will return True.
prints out  {1:1000}, but should be something like {0:100,1:900}
Both simulators should return the same result on average; However, one method of creating a noisy simulator seems not to apply noise at all!
the set_option function must not be changing all the attributes of the object that need to be changed.
Edit: formatting
I found that the problem is fixed if using set_options instead of set_option, but it strikes me as the case that those two functions should have identical behavior in the case where I'm setting a single option.
