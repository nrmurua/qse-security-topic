The insert strategy NEW_THEN_INLINE should not be an option provided to a circuit, but rather an option attached to a gate.  This is because if you write code that yields gates and then embed those gates in a circuit using cirq.Circuit.from_ops there is no ability (without creating moments) to specify how the moments should be constructed.
Food for thought

Hey @ijdavis , how about #2775?
I think that this is a reasonable idea, but I don't think that it provides enough benefit to outweigh the cost implementing it and explaining it. The insertion into circuits is already unfortunately complicated..
I think there are some good points raised here, but I don't think we're going to add insertion operations to gates per se. I also don't think we want to change the default circuit construction or risk breaking everyone's code.
I'm going to close this, but we can continue the discussion on #2775 and also #3235 for your other "nesting" point
