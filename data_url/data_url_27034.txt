The following input file is not properly read by QUICK.

As you can see, there is a tab between atom labels and x coordinate column. If you print out coordinates from here: https://github.com/merzlab/QUICK/blob/master/src/modules/quick_molspec_module.f90#L376-L377 this is what you get.
The input reader must be capable of handling these things.  Lets fix this. We also have to try different experiments to break the reader and make sure its robust.
@agoetz Please let us know your suggestions.
String handling is quite limited in Fortran. A quick fix in subroutine rdword in the code block here 
and also remove the label from the do loop, and format the file better.
If you don't know what to do with your time, here is a discussion about string libraries for Fortran
fortran-lang/stdlib#69
@agoetz Thanks for the suggestions. @Altaimorin Can you take care of this issue?
This has been fixed in PR #152 so I will close this issue.
