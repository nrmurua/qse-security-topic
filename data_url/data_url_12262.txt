For local simulation of 10 qubits or more, the local_qiskit_simulator should be used.
Here is a comparison of running quantum_emoticon tutorial: local_qiskit_simulator takes 3.6 seconds vs local_qasm_simulator takes more than 1200 seconds.
Don't change this. In v0.5, local_qasm_simulator will automatically select the faster simulator, if it is installed.
Noted. But for classical optimization and the above hello word program it can take more than 20 minutes to run the program. I suggest you to use local_qiskit_simulator as the generic name. In particular, because qiskit sounds familiar than qasm.
Anyway, isn't it we are using qobj instead of qasm?
closing as with qiskit 0.5 this is not longer an issue
