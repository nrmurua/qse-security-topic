TFQ 0.5 depends on "grpcio==1.30.0", but TF 2.4.1 depends on grpcio (>=1.32.0,<1.33.0).
Am using poetry to manage dependencies on another project, when trying to upgrade to tfq 0.5 I get the following error:
Yes, I ran into the same issue just now trying to run the install and import cells in the MNIST tutorial notebook.
Strange.... It doesn't seem to lead to any breakages, despite the error. @zaqqwerty do you want to try a grpcio upgrade and see what happens ?
