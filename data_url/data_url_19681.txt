Since Qiskit/qiskit#5432 was merged in Terra, the CNOT-Dihedral tests in ignis are failing with the following error:
AttributeError: 'CNOTDihedral' object has no attribute '_op_shape'.
The code of the CNOTDihedral class in ignis should be fixed to support the new OpShape class.
Later, the CNOTDihedral class should be moved to Terra: Qiskit/qiskit#5442
