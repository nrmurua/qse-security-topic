QGL.ChannelLibrary was renamed to QGL.ChannelLibraries, but pyqgl2 was not updated.  This is a small change, but touches many modules.
It's possible that there were other name changes that happened during the same refactoring; if so they will be addressed as well.
@dellard Please take a look at this branch https://github.com/BBN-Q/pyqgl2/commits/fix/qgl1
It doesn't pass tests, but it includes that and other fixes.
There were also some changes to the names of class members.
Diego also pointed out that there is a branch https://github.com/BBN-Q/pyqgl2/commits/fix/qgl1 that addresses some or all of this issue.
Working on branch fixbasicseq
I believe I've caught all the renaming; things all work against current QGL.
