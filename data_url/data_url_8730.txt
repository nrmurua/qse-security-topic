I am trying the exact same code (magic square) with two differents backend: the default one based on stabilizer and projectq. On projectq, it just works:
but on the default backend I get wrong outcomes:
I tried to repeat several times, and projectq always give good results while the default backend gives random results. Any idea why?
Code:
Hi @tobiasBora! Was this line
uncommented in both cases?
Yes sure. I used exactly the same code. Here is a demo with several tries, some cat, some get backend/set backend, which is (up to a removal of the PATH) an exact copy/paste of my terminal, without any intermediate editing. I just copied the above code, ran it with the two backends, and I can observe 6/6 runs with the three conditions passed on the projectq backend, and with the stabilizer backend, 4/4 runs have at least one condition that does not pass (and on 3 of them, all three conditions fail together).
Note that the simulaqron version is 3.0.4, I'm running it on debian unstable, but I also tried with debian 9 on docker and I can observe the exact same phenomenon.
Here are the log (log-level=10 at the end):
And I tried to run also a run with the stabilizer backend with log-level=10:
Hello @tobiasBora! I finally managed to track down the issue. There was indeed a bug, so thanks for finding this. The issue was in some cases when measuring a qubit in the eigenstate of Z. I now fixed this, see PR #225. If you want you can check that your code indead works in that branch and I will then release a new version.
You can see that there is a test (test_measure_eigenstate) with the case
which is in fact the state you had in your example and was previously failing.
