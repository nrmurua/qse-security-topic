Functions from BIKE, such as OQS_KEM_bike_l3_encaps, do not seem to be exported from the shared library:
Thanks for letting us know about this difference. The error is a missing OQS_API declaration for these BIKE functions in their implementation(s). @dkostic : Is this something you would want to address while finalizing #1369?
@crockeea @dstebila As you both approved #1369 without addressing this issue, can we safely close this issue then, assuming it is intentional that BIKE functions (unlike those of the other PQ algs) shall not be directly referenceable?

I wouldn't say that. I'd forgotten about your suggestion in #1374 (comment), but if it's as easy as that, then probably worth trying to add to #1369 while it's open.
that's reasonable, I'll fix it.
#1369 updated, the symbols should be exported now.
@fantostisch with #1369 merged, can you confirm the issue can be closed?
Issue is fixed, thanks!
