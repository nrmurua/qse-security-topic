Two identical measurements:

just an example data from a different dataset, see the lines marked with love, columns 2 and 3 switch around...
Thats really bad. I tried reproducing it with a couple of dummy instruments but didn't see it. Are you measuring the 3 parameters from the same instrument? I am wondering if it's the driver which is not thread safe?
@jenshnielsen  I think that's def a possibility.
yup, just commented to @giulioungaretti on slack, it happens when I use two parameters on the same instrument, in this case its an SR830 lock-in
and works fine with only on parameter per instrument
