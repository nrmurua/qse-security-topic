The documentation for the logger and results is empty (https://el-openqaoa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logger_and_results.html). I'm not sure if it doesn't exist or isn't being generated properly, but it is valuable documentation to have available.

Well spotted! This is indeed a bug! Actually, there was an issue with the doc-building test (it turns out that sphinx-build needs the flag -W in order to return 1 and signal that to the user) ... so we were fooled by tests always being green!
I have started fixing this and issue #106 too.
Regarding the status of the underlying docstrings: the result one should be fairly complete, while the logger one requires some improvements.
Closing this issue, the docs were fixed in PR113
