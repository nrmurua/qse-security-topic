Description
When a sampleset is returned from the Hybrid BQM model, sometimes the variable labels are not present in the sampleset, only the variable indexes are returned.  It happens inconsistently on large models.
To Reproduce
Can provide code via email.
Expected behavior
Variable labels are returned
Environment:
Hi @scerto, can you provide a minimal reproducible example?
For large BQMs, we strip the labels and then restore them so perhaps the bug in present in that code, but I am not able to reproduce.

Hi Alexander, attached is the model and input data used when I encountered this error.  This was also shared with Tanvi.  When i changed the penalty coefficients for constraints to higher numbers sometimes the labels would not be returned, while other times they would.  I think if you play around with changing those parameters you should encounter the bug, although it appears inconsistently.
Thanks! Will look
Hi @scerto , can you share the version of dimod and dwave-system that you are using?  I have not yet been able to reproduce this using the code/data that you shared, with dimod 0.11.0 and dwave-system 1.14.0.  I ran the code about 10 times, and each time the sampleset did contain the original variable labels.
@mcfarljm Hi John, I have the same versions for dimod and dwave-system.  I haven't seen the error show up again.  I think we can close this and i'll reopen it if/when I have a consistent and reproducible result.  Thank you!
