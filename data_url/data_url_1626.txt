Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Currently the circuit optimizer cirq.MergeInteractions produces circuits with CZ (or parameterized CZ) gates by using cirq.two_qubit_matrix_to_operations() to decompose arbitrary two-qubit unitaries.  Now that decompositions exist for the FSim gate (cirq.decompose_two_qubit_interaction_into_four_fsim_gates() with a different API) and soon the sqrt-iSWAP gate, there should be a single or consistent API to access these.
I noticed this while working on #4083.
Describe the solution you'd like
MergeInteractions and two_qubit_matrix_to_operations could have a gate set parameter that lets them choose which decomposition to use.  It could simply be an argument gate=CZ or gate=FSim(theta, phi) but I'm not sure the best design.
Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
Write separate circuit optimizers for FSim and other primitive gates.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
This is something @tanujkhattar is looking into as part of #3243 - in the long term, we'd like to migrate all of these into the decomposition API. Adding new decompositions before then is fine, but they'll also need to be migrated.
