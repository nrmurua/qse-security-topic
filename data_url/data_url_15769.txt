Currently, accessing the preset passmanagers (outside of a call to transpile) requires building a pass_manager_config by hand, like:
which is a fair amount of boilerplate if one already has access to a backend and a set of transpiler options (and prone to going stale as new options are added). I also don't think we document this anywhere.
One option would be to add a PassManagerConfig.from_backend(backend, **pass_manager_options) so that users can level_1_pass_manager(PassManagerConfig.from_backend(backend, **pass_manager_options)) and we can extract some of the argument parsing and backend extraction logic from qiskit.compiler.transpiler.
Another would be to build upon the builder for the preset pass managers being introduced in #6403 and have something like pm = FullPassManager.from_backend(backend, **pass_manager_options)
(Related to #3118 .)
Should this issue be closed since it's fixed by #7163?
Closing as resolved by #7163 .
