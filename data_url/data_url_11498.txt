IBM released CPLEX 20.1 community version at PyPI and it contains a file for Python3.8.
But, I tried to install it on macOS and Linux and failed.
On the other hand, I confirmed that cplex can be installed in Python 3.7.
It might be good to exclude cplex for Python3.8 from requirements.txt and setup.py
New files for Python 3.8 are uploaded on Jan 23. I confirmed that I can install cplex 20.1 on both macOS and Linux
