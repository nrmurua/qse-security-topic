The default Dask serialization protocol fails when using Pennylane's QAOA optimizer. Thus electrons that call the QAOA optimizer currently have to be executed with the Local Executor.
A workflow/electron that uses Pennylane's QAOA optimizer will fail execution when dispatched to the Covalent server.
Dask should properly serialize objects in electrons that use the QAOA optimizer.

Does setting serializers=["pickle"] help?
