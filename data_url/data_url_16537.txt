When num_ctrl_qubits=0, creating controlled gates will produce an AttributeError.
Create a gate without control bits successfully.
This bug happens because the control function inqiskit/circuit/add_control.py directly returns operation (the first argument) when num_ctrl_qubits=0, but the add_control function expects that the return value from the control function has the base_gate attribute.
Either the control function should always return a Gate object with the base_gate attribute, or the add_control function should not assume that the base_gate attribute always exists.
Another option would be to raise an exception if num_ctrl_qubits=0. Then whenever control is called a ControlledGate is always returned. Letting num_ctrl_qubits=0 doesn't seem necessary to support since one could just use the original gate.
Indeed a ControlledGate with 0 control bits does not seem to be necessary to be supported. However having such support would be a little bit more user-friendly. I discovered this bug when I try to implement "multiply amplitude by -1 when all n qubits are |1>" for arbitrary n with the following code:
The code fails when n=1, so I have to deal with this case separately.
Since it seems the intention is to create a controlled gate then having n>=2 doesn't seem like an unreasonable assumption.
