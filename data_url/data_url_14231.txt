There is a follow up investigation and work we need to do to ensure that with our truncated search that we try and ensure we're still getting the highest quality output from the passes. @kevinhartman has been looking at a way to do this by presorting the input graphs to vf2_mapping in order of error rates. I'll open a follow up issue to track this work as part of 0.25.0
