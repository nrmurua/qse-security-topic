Current way Offline Plotting Tutorial is written, confuses users, as they think that they should use DataSet directly, while the preferred way is to use Measurement object and with measurement.run() as datasaver: ... context manager construct.
Hence the notebook should be rewritten to reflect the preferred approach. The DataSet approach can be preserved in an appendix of the notebook.
Hear, hear! The dataset documentation needs a clean-up where we make it clear that the Measurement object is the way to save data. I don't think we even need examples of using the dataset directly, as long as we document the API.
Shall I rename the issue then, and make improving Offline Plotting Tutorial as a sub-task? :)
That'd be spot on.
In addition to the above it is really slow to run adding around 10 min to the docs build time on Azure pipelines
Okay, let me take this one.
