@Nader-Khammassi @imranashraf , the develop and spin qubit branches have diverged quite a bit.
What version should I be using for the demo this Thrusday, we'll be showing single qubit CBox + single qubit CCL.
Also is it possible to update the spin qubit branch with the progress on develop?  I think it is important we resolve conflicts now rather than just pre-deadline.
@AdriaanRol  we had a brief discussion yesterday. @Nader-Khammassi will soon merge spin qubit branch to develop branch.
@AdriaanRol  I am fixing the pulse/trigger bug, then I will merge with the develop.
merged. so this can be closed
