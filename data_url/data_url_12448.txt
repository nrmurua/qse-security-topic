Hi, I was following this to create quantum circuits. After building the circuit he simulated it using "cirq.Simulator()". Does "cirq.Simulator()" simulate Google's quantum Sycamore processor ?
If not what does it simulate ?
It stimulates a fully connected, noiseless system by default (which sycamore is neither)
Okay, is there any name for the quantum hardware that it simulates ?
I'm not sure if there is a special term, if you call it a simulator people will know what you are talking about. It simulates perfect, all to all connected, hardware.
Okay
