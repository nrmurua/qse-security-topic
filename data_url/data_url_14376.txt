Trying to use DAGCircuit.remove_ancestors_of(node) fails with this error:
Line 1512 is passing the entire node to rx.ancestors, but it should be passing node.nodeid (hence the error about looking for an integer). So maybe we just need to add .nodeid to fix this. Related DAGCircuit methods (remove_descendants_of(), ...) may have the same problem.
In contrast, DAGCircuit.ancestors() works, because it correctly passes the nodeid to rx (see screenshot from the docs).

Make a DAGCircuit (e.g. using converters.circuit_to_dag), get a node, and call dag.remove_ancestors_of(node).
Function should run without error.
No response
on playing with this a little more, maybe it's best to just call self.ancestors(...) inside of remove_ancestors_of. Otherwise you may anyway need to copy over the rest of the comprehension from ancestors, which is basically the whole function definition.  (Since currently it looks like rx.ancestors may not return objects of the expected node types).
