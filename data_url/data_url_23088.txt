I have been struggling all the afternoon with SD cards. The aim was to make a backup .img file of the system v0.92 , because it cannot become corrupted unlike the subsequent ubuntu-based systems.
Problem: it is impossible to find an img file of such an old system on the web (or at least I didn't find one yet), but we have some 32 GB bootable SD cards with the system on it.
I could successfully make an image of one of these cards using win32imager (on leon/software/redpitaya/image for sd cards/sheon_os0.92.img), but it is more than 30 GB of void...
--> it can be flashed on a 32 GB SD card, and then the system works fine
--> Unfortunately, it cannot be flashed onto a smaller SD card.
I tried two things to reduce the file size :
This sounds like a silly problem, basically, whenever you copy the system onto a card, there is no way to use this as a copy to be flashed on a smaller card, or at least, not with the rudimentary win32diskimager that we are using... I will try to look a bit more through the internet for a reasonable sized image of the v92 system.
I finally figured out how to flash the bootable sd card from the files...
The procedure is the following:
---> Eject the card, that should be fine.
Now that I coud apply this procedure on a 4 GB SD card, I have been able to make a 4 GB image of it (which hopefully includes the right boot flag) using win32diskImager (in /leon/omq/software/redpitaya/image for sd card/redpitaya_v0.92.img) In principle, it is only necessary to do a win32diskimager write operation using this file on any sd card that is larger or equal to 4GB
