pylint 2.6.1 stops by error.
Need to avoid pylint 2.6.1?
pylint team recommends as follows.
pylint-dev/pylint#4096 (comment)
pylint 2.6.2 is released. https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/releases/tag/pylint-2.6.2
pylint 2.6.2 fixed all the issues by pinning astroid. No need to change our code
Also, in the CI we test against the version used by Terra (2.4.4) and then test again against whatever the latest version is. We never test against intermediate pylint versions. I don't think we need to worry about them.
Yes, I see pylint 2.6.2 fixes the issues in #1522
