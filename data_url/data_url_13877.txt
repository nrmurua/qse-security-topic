Hi, the mixed spelling of functions makes it hard to remember, for instance, normalise(), but optimize(). In the document also, optimization has spelled in both ways, so search does not find all matches.
Yeah that is a good point. I'll discuss with Aleks what we should do about this
Initially, it was my intention to use US spellings everywhere, as this is sortof an unwritten rule for international coding standards, but I haven't been following that very well. Shall we make that a written rule?
Yeah let's do that
I've just pushed a commit that takes care of at least 4 functions that had british spelling, i.e. any that had one of the following words in it: normalise, optimise, colour, neighbour.
I think this covers most of the Britishness, but if there is anything else, let me know.

I think this is fully resolved now.
