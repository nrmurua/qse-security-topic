We need to supply 2 theta values to observe in order to run the circuit above which we do below via torch.rand(2)
We can also supply 3 batches of values to automatically broadcast the input
All of the above works fine.
If we now change the Hamiltonian to a list, we get the following:
results should contain 3*2 values but instead is a list of length 3 where each element is a float rather than 2 floats.
NA
NA
Not a regression
NA
There is no overload yet for observe to broadcast and take a list of spin_ops.
Any chance we can prioritise this please?
Thanks team
