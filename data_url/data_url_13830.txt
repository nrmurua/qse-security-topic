Hi @jvdwetering, I faced the problem of phase(p), and controlled phase(cp) gate when parsing the qasm string. I thought I might try working on this issue to add p and cp gate support. Your guidance and input would be greatly appreciated.
I think @dlyongemallo might have just already added this support.
Hi, @rahulsust,
Thanks for the offer of help.
PR #151 adds support for p but not yet for cp. I have ongoing work to support as much of the OpenQASM 3 standard gate set as is possible or makes sense, but it's not ready yet. If you have an urgent need to support the cp gate, it shouldn't be too hard to add it in an ad hoc manner, using PR #151 as a template.
Hi, @dlyongemallo,
Thank you for letting me know.
I will start working on it then. If it is okay, can we talk over DM?
Hi, @rahulsust,
Are you on the ZX-calculus Discord? My user name is the same as on GitHub. You can send me a DM there.
