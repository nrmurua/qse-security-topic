Python version 3.6.8
Cirq Version = 0.6.0.dev (also in 0.5.0)
Attempting to unpickle any ops.ControlledOperation object, either by pickle or by dill, results in an error.
Code to reproduce:
Error message:
Extra info/commentary:
Though this issue doesn't reside exclusively in cirq, it does restrict the (full) use of cirq with some standard python modules. In my particular use case, it prevents use of the multiprocessing module to parallelize the simulation of circuits.
This is happening because ControlledOperation is doing custom object creation inside __new__.  In this case the logic in ControlledOperation.__new__ could be moved to __init__ to fix this issue.
