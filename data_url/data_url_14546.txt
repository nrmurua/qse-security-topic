Take the following circuit:
CSPLayout should not be able to find a solution with a layout 0- > 1 -> 2. However:
There are two options. If CSPLayout encounters a 3-or-more-qubit gate, either assumes that this needs complete connection among the involved qubits, or just fails with reason 3-or-more-qubit gate found.
@1ucian0 I tried to add 3-or-more-qubit gates as constraints, and the pass generates this layout:
I guess maybe it is reasonable? It does not involve swaps. It simply suggests that mapping qr[0] to physical qubit 1. Such mapping is allowed, right? It is kind of the point of using CSP in this pass.
In the original example, CCX does not have a possible layout in the coupling map 0 - > 1 -> 2. No solution should be found or raise.
Can I work on this?
Sure thing @Silrem. Assigning. let me know if I can help!
@1ucian0 Just created a PR (#7625). Not sure if I can/should add you as a reviewer. Anyway, my first draft is there =)
un-assigning so that this issue is open for others to have a go. If anyone would like to pick this work up make sure to take a look at #7625 and go from there ðŸ˜„
I want to work on the issue if it still exists.
sorry for the slow reply @lmpawan10, I'll assign to you ðŸ˜„ As this is an old issue the first step would be to check that the bug still exists
Hello @lmpawan10 ! Are you still working on this one?
Sorry that I got busier with other tasks. I am planning to work on this issue this month.
You can give it to others if they are interested, or I will deal with it.
Hi @lmpawan10 ! how is that going?
