Description of the issue
I realized that during flushing the v0.13 deprecation backlog that the SupportsChannel deprecation is incorrect - it points users to use cirq.SupportsKraus - however that does not exist.
How to reproduce the issue
However cirq.SupportsKraus does not exist.
Cirq version
v0.12.0
Note, this might be worthwhile to patch v0.12.0 with.
