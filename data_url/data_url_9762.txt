Description
Try to convert a BQM (either default or AdjDictBQM) to a networkx graph, then use bokeh to plot, and bokeh gives a TypeError: Object of type 'Vartype' is not JSON serializable error.
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
Graph output should be serializable
Environment
Additional Context
Workaround: convert without the vartype.
Below is the full error message:
Worth noting that networkx.Graph is not itself JSON-serializable, Bokeh has implemented a custom encoder BokehJSONEncoder.
So I think the request is really "Graph output should be serializable by Bokeh's custom encoder"
IMO this is not an easy fix. Simplest would be del G.vartype.
Error persists (TypeError: Object of type 'Vartype' is not JSON serializable) even after deleting it.
try plotting again:
Ah, got it, comes from 
Ok. I think your workaround it best for now.
