Warming the operator cache takes significant time when loading the QVM package. This is useful for packaged applications, like QVM-APP, where the operator cache gets warmed once at compile time and then loaded from disk thereafter. It's less useful when doing development on the QVM, since it adds drag to a restart.
It would be great if QVM package descendants could opt in to warming the cache at compile time, so that those of us who don't want it aren't obligated to do so.
