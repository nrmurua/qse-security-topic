Dear authors of the package, your work is fantasitc. If you have time: I don't understand very well how to use embed() and and BosonicNParticleBasis(), can you give a simple example?. Thanks in advance!
Yeah the documentation for the multi-particle systems is definitively lacking. I hope I come around to improve it in the next few days. The embed function is useful if you have a composite system, e.g. a system consisting of 3 spins. You can define the basis with:
Assume you want to define an operator in this basis b that only acts onto the second spin. You could do that by doing
or equivalently use the embed function
Does this make things clear?
Completely clear now, thank you very much!
Documentation has been updated.
