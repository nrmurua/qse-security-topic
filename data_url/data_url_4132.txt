In the Hong-Ou-Mandel simulation script, found here, there are two errors.
The first is the initialization of the AnnotatedBasicState has incorrect arguments, this can be fixed by transforming the keyword arguments into a list. I changed line 45 to:
However, then there still appears an error when I run the script:
The line that it fails on is:

In the definition of StateVector and its parent classes there is no definition of the apply_delta_t method.
Thanks @pvenderbosch - there is a mismatch in the version of this script and the stepper implementation. Fix on the stepper is planned in 0.5.0 that should be released end of next week. I will keep you updated.
Thank you for the information @jsenellart !
This is now fixed and handled in the last release - see https://github.com/Quandela/Perceval/releases/tag/v0.7.0
