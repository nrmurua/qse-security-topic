Running into this error in the CUDAQ container:
The image contains:

Using the dev image for nvvm but getting the following error:
This is not a cuda-quantum Issue. from ipie.qmc.calc import build_afqmc_driver is not something that cuda-quantum supports. These errors are due to the local dev environment. In this latest one, you just need to install cuFFT development libraries.

Hi @amccaskey @bettinaheim while this may not be something that cudaq needs to support out of box, I'd suggest to at least document how to utilize the docker like cuQuantum Appliance did:
This would be a nicer UX because there will be many Python users like Zohim who runs into weird issues like this that would not appear in other CUDA dockers. We spent some time sorting it out together and I advised Zohim to raise this discussion.
