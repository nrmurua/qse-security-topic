It should work since 1 is a positive odd int

This is a bug in retworkx (I reported it here a few months ago: Qiskit/rustworkx#452 ). It's been fixed on main (with: Qiskit/rustworkx#453 ) but there hasn't been a retworkx release in a few months. We're preparing to get one out hopefully in the next week (https://github.com/Qiskit/retworkx/milestone/7 is tracking it). Once retworkx 0.11 goes out this should be fixed (we settled on returning a single node graph for a d=1 heavy hex or heavy square graph, you can see the discussion in the issue and PR).
In the meantime though if you have a rust compiler installed you can run pip install git+https://github.com/Qiskit/retworkx to install retworkx from the dev branch which will fix this issue.
Ahh, ok it looks like this is fairly well known then.  Will close as it fixed.  Thanks for the quick reply.
Just a heads up retworkx 0.11.0 was released earlier today and included the fix for this. If you upgrade retworkx to this version it should fix this
