Reading the documentation (https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/docs/simulation.md):
'This is needed in order to define the order of state. In particular if the qubit list is [q0, q1, ..., q_{n-1}], and x_{n-1}...x_1x_0 is the binary expansion of the index x, then state[x] is the value of the state corresponding to qubit q_i being in computational basis state b_i (So we say that the ordering is little-endian.)'
For two qubits, this means
| x=0> = | x0=0, x1=0>, | x=1> = | x0=1, x1=0>, | x=2> = | x0=0, x1=1>, , | x=3> = | x0=1, x1=1>
Consider X_0, X-gate on q0, we should have
| x=0> = | x0=0, x1=0> -- X_0 --> |  x=1> = |x0=1, x1=0>
However, if I run
The output is
which seems to suggest that
| x=0> = | x0=0, x1=0> -- X_0 --> |  x=2> = |x0=0, x1=1>
Do I miss anything? Thanks!
Indeed, we switched the ordering convention but didn't update the docs. Now in the bitstring 01000, the second qubit is 1, rather than the fourth. I believe this is "big-endian".
Actually, I'm not sure your comments above were correct. The correct mappings are
Get it. Thanks!
Well, I do still think the documentation is wrong.
It's fixed now.
