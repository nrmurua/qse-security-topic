Take the following example:
The reset is still there:
I suggest to run Decompose(Initialize) before RemoveResetInZeroState() in levels 1, 2, and 3.
I'm interested in this issue, could I work on it?
assigned! thanks!
@wmurphy-collabstar @1ucian0  just fix it, because I am working on Decompose.
You mean this issues should be marked as solved by #8129 ?
@1ucian0 I make the suggested change on #8142 , but haven't merged yet. Just inform, because it is assigned to @wmurphy-collabstar 1 year ago.
This isn't actually a bug.  The transpile call given doesn't have any basis gates, so initialize is treated as a basis gate, which means it does not necessarily contain a reset (for example, a simulator will directly jump the state to the correct thing).  transpile doesn't fail to remove the reset because there's no reset to remove until the call to decompose.  If the basis_gates argument is passed, the reset will correctly not appear in the output from transpile.
closing as wontfix. Thanks!
