On Ubuntu, 64 bit, Artiq version 3.6, I am trying to compile the nist_qc2 gateware using the artiq-dev package following the instructions here:
https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-release-3/developing.html
When I try to build the target binaries using python3 -m artiq.gateware.targets.kc705_dds -H nist_qc2 I get the following compilation error:
The output of rustc --explain E0633 is:
If it helps, I am on the release-3 branch of the artiq source from github.  After creating the artiq-dev conda environment using:
I added the artiq source tree to the environment path using
The ultimate goal of this is to expand the output FIFO depth to 1024 which we need to avoid underflow errors when the FIFO fills up.
Wrong rustc version. Check that conda installs the one specified in the release-3 artiq-dev meta.yaml.
We were able to build the target binaries by manually installing the artiq-dev package and specifying the version using:  conda create -n artiq-dev artiq-dev=3.6.  It looks like using the conda/artiq-dev.yaml file from the release-3 branch installs the 4.0 version of the artiq-dev package by default.
I don't think it installs artiq-dev 4.0, but it does install the same rustc version as artiq-dev 4.0.dev. The latest release-3 branch is different from the 3.6 release; and you should use matching ARTIQ source code and artiq-dev/rustc version.
