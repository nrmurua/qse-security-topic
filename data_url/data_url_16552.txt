CZ gate is drawn with two bullets.
CZ gate should be drawn using a box and a bullet, similar to CNOT gate:
In the implementation here:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/9e8a3ff8d11f8677ff7e8f397bcc3c7108edaa1f/qiskit/visualization/text.py#L980
CZ should be treated as a normal controlled gate by using BoxOnQuWire: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/9e8a3ff8d11f8677ff7e8f397bcc3c7108edaa1f/qiskit/visualization/text.py#L141
And not Bullet
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/9e8a3ff8d11f8677ff7e8f397bcc3c7108edaa1f/qiskit/visualization/text.py#L392
This can be fixed by removing lines 987-989 and 1012-1013 of qiskit/visualization/text.py that both treat CZ as a special case (twice)! The fact that there is this duplication in the current implementation makes me think that something went wrong...
Happy to contribute a pull request if the behavior I describe above is desirable.
This is expected as CZ is symmetric.
I see. This does arguably makes the circuit harder to read, as many sources from the first page of search results for "control z gate" use the boxed version:
Some sources use both:
