As briefly described in #1910 there are some functions in Bloch class that are not fully tested. Besides, there are a few other changes that may benefit Bloch. I would like to list them here and provide more information on the change for discussion.
The main changes I propose to do in the Bloch class are:
These task are planned to be addressed each in a separate PR. I plan to finish these tasks myself but feel free to tackle any of these (or add a new one) if no PR is open and you mention it in this issue.
If you would like another item for the todo list, I'd really like to see the matplotlib aspects of the interface cleaned up. When we added the new lines and arcs features, we allowed passing arbitrary matplotlib plotting arguments as additional parameters. Perhaps we can do the same for the other functions and remove the old means of setting colours, etc?
Yes, definitely! I would like to tackle that when with the item list "Make the interface consistent ..."
