I am working with the Bell State programme (link).
I found that my local simulator's result was correct, like this:
But when I run it on your backends (the least busy one), which is 'ibmq_16_melbourne', I found the result was wrong:
However, both of them get the same correct quantum circuit.
My code is strictly same with the link, so I do not understand why there is a wrong result from your remote backend.
Please help me have a look on the problem. Thank you so much!
The answer is not wrong. It is what you would expect from running on a noisy quatum device.
OMG thank you for your quick answer! I finally realize how stupid this question is... It is so funny that I have been working on it for a whole night haha.
