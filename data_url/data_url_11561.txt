In #1295 filters have been added to the classical min eigensolver which can mean that a solution might not be returned. Since the MinEigOptimizer is already dependent on the mineigsolver returning a state

which not all do arguably it would be an improvement if some checks were in place. Already we can check up front, when being supplied a mineigsolver, if it returns state (if supports_aux_operators returns true it can evaluate these by virtue of having state so this method can be used to check although we can add another method that is clearer is needed about it supporting state).
Even if the state check is done up front, with the filter changes of #1295, arguably rather than potentially crashing with a Null pointer exception, it might be better to detect this and handle it however is appropriate which may by in this case returning an optimization result with Failure status perhaps and indicating the min eig solver failed to find a value.
