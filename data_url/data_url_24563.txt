We must define a transition period during which the old routines are deprecated but still available and, preferably, already prepare a branch where they are removed which is to be merged after the transition period expires.
We should be able to load all old pulses anytime.
We should however remove the old writing routines. Maybe by the end of the year?
The old writing routines will be dropped on the 1.0 release. They will be deprecated in the next release.
They are already deprecated.
