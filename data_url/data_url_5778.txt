Batched multi-shots optimization for GPU is slower than without batched optimization when using Pauli noises.
Especially it is slow when using multiple GPUs
This is example benchmarking without batched optimization.
This is example benchmarking with batched optimization.
Should be faster than without batched shot optimization as well as Kraus noises.
Using benchmark code above, batched optimization is very fast for Kraus noise.
Runtime noise sampling is not parallelized on the host in state_chunk.hpp.
The loop should be parallelized by using OpenMP, however speed is limited because noise sampling is time dominant.
Some optimization is needed to improve runtime noise sampling.
