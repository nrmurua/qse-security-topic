Issue comes from here: RedPitaya/RedPitaya#150
Copy-paste:
Forgive me if my format is terrible, I do not usually file issues.
Whenever I call/assign any member of redpitaya.scope, my code hangs forever and I have traced it back to the pyrpl/modules.py in the pyrpl function. I do not have a good enough understanding of the code to make a suggestion but could this be a bug?
I agree this is while-loop bit smelly, so i suggest we implement a maximum recursion depth of 100 or so here.
Nevertheless, I would like to understand how there can be an infinite loop here.
The depth of any parent/child chain is necessarily finite, unless something is its own parent or the parent of something that appeared already in the chain.
Could you please provide some extra context so we can try to debug this? I.e.:
Thanks in advance!
PS: If you have not played with the source code, I rather do not believe that the issue you describe is the reason for your problem, but of course we have to exclude this possibility first to be able to find the actual problem.
fixed in afa561d (currently only on branch develop-0.9.3)
