Calling
        schedule = pulse.Schedule(name='3Q_constant')
        schedule += Delay(total_samples)
raises an exception in Schedule.append() as Delay has no channels and this attribute is accessed.
Verify channels attribute exists.
I think this is a terra schedule issue not a simulator issue.
You haven't specified where the delay should go
