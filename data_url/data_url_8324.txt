In what version of python are qutip source code files written in? For example progressbar.py has this line after the license "from future import print_function" .
This line is generally written in python 2.7 scripts which wish to use the print function from python 3.x.
So, this particular file is in python 2 right?
Maybe, but the print statements are still written as functions there. Thank you for the PR, I will help you out and try to merge it asap. But I do not think you need to put the extensive description of the port to python 3 syntax. Just updating the syntax to python 3 with a comment linking to some discussion should be fine.
Btw, there is a cool progress bar called tqdm if you are not already aware, tqdm. I have seen it work out nice with some qutip functions.
Honestly speaking, I didn't submit any PR. I just was surprised as to how .py files with two different versions were present in the source code.
Thank you for pointing out  tqdm.
Maybe, but the print statements are still written as functions there.
this is because of the line ""from future import print_function"
Technically from __future__ import print_function should never be harmful, because __future__ import statements are permanent for backwards compatibility.  Still, they can be removed next time someone touches those files, because we don't support Python 2 any more.
