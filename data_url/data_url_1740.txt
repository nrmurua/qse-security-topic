Description of the issue
The implementation of multiplicative_group function in Shor.ipynb tutorial is wrong.
How to reproduce the issue
The code in the notebook is
Here group  initialized as [1, 2]. However, element 2 should not be included always. For example, when n = 6, the result should be [1,5]. It is easy to fix it by changing the function into
There is no propagation of error since this function is not used afterward. But it is not good to keep the wrong implementation.
Cirq version
Irrelevant.
Ah yeah, thanks for noting this. Pesky even primes
