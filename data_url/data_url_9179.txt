Hi, I am a grad student working through the GBS literature and I have started using thewalrus, I mainly want to make sure the library is working as expected.
Here,
you seem to calculate the "A matrix" as   where the * denotes the complex conjugate. However, in the literature, there is no complex conjugate there? Why is it in your code?
Something along the same lines: When I was going through the calculation for the probabilities in GBS, I actually always get that  
instead of 
as is written in the original papers? Can you confirm this, or am I messing up?
Hi @Marsll --- A possibility is that people use different orderings, so instead of (q,p) one can use (p,q).
But more importantly, note that either if A = B \sum B^* or A=B^* \sum B in both cases haf(A) = |haf(B)|^2 = |haf(B^*)|^2.
