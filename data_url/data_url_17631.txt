After #1629 lands we should discuss what is needed in the QobjExperimentalHeader and the QobjExperimentalConfig. I think we passing too much information there that is not needed and some is repeated.
From the API, we only need:
config.shots
config.memory
and the length of experiments, that we get from experiments attribute (using: experiments.length() in javascript)
ok great so that is covered in the qobj.config
Related to #1047. The result of this discussion should be reflected in the spec document too.
can we close this up for 0.8
Yes - actually I think this issue represent the "pruning" work to be done before going for #1448. Does the current issue description represent the "desired contents" of the Qobj structure, or is it a checklist for reminding to review each field?
closing with #4105 and circuits being the more default object now
