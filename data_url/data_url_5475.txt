The simulation_test.py script uses temporary files.

The documentation of mkstemp mentions that the user is responsible for removing the files. The handles are not removed with something like below
Is this intended behaviour?
Now that pybind can read from vector of strings, I don't need tempfiles anymore.
Yes, but this is unfortunate, because the last eight hours I designed everything around tmpfiles. Please keep the interface consistent for the moment, because it makes a merge very difficult by the deadline.
I understand, I just needed time to complete the interface. And again, I'm sorry you had to rewrite part of your code.
This is fixed in the patch I uploaded in #289.  mkstemp isn't optimal for this use case.
