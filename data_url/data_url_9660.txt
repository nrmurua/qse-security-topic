The syntax from pulser.devices import PasqalDevice is preferred to from .devices import PasqalDevice. In addition, it is best practice to segment imports into 3 sections: standard library, third-party, and local. It looks like the code currently groups standard library & third-party, and has a second section for local. See this article for more details.
Makes sense, I'll handle this.
