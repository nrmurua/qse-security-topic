Hello Strilanc,
it was mostly working well enough for me, but when trying to return to a url via my history I got a another error.

Thanks for the report. Looks like an escaping issue, where Quirk tried to read the escaped %22s and such directly instead of as the character they represent.
I've been relying on the browser to do the escaping and unescaping. I'll add code that unescapes before parsing if needed.
Updating your browser may work around this issue for you. When I go to the link it works, but I have the latest version of Firefox instead of the v38 mentioned in the report.
Hm, the code did call decodeURIComponent already. So I'm not exactly sure why it's failing.
df299a2 and 38c4e30 don't resolve this issue, but will improve the fallback.
The exception is now a 'recovered from' instead of a 'totally unexpected'. The drawing shouldn't break anymore when it happens. Also the generated details will include the value of document.location.hash, since the browser's exact interpretation of that is relevant.
Okay, I've confirmed this is a bug in firefox. It was fixed in version 41. From the release notes:
Since it's a browser issue, there's not a lot I can do to fix it. I think the correct fix is to ask you to update your browser. If it still doesn't work after updating your browser, re-open this issue.
