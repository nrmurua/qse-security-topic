How to find second order coherence function with zero time delay in qutip(g^2(0))? The qutip inbuilt function "correlation_3op_1t()" has "taus" argument which is zero in this case.
You can use the four-operator correlation function, correlation_4op_1t.  In this specific case you can take only the tau= 0 result. correlation.coherence_function_g2.
