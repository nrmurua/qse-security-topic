I asked @jakelishman why CircuitInstruction is named that way when it is not an Instruction, and why it has an attribute named operation which is actually an Instruction. He replied:
it’s because what’s currently called Instruction shouldn’t really be called that, but we can’t change it without breaking everything.  So instead, the new interface definition for “something that can be added to QuantumCircuit is called Operation, and the container is CircuitInstruction to avoid the naming clash
This should be publicly documented somewhere to mitigate user confusion.
