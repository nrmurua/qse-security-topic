I am trying to raise a pull request to add some features to the qcnn model class. However I am encountering an error in pytest specifically for build (windows-latest, 3.11) / build as shown below:
=========================== short test summary info ===========================

FAILED tests/test_models_qcnn.py::test_qcnn_training - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorflow'

Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
This error is returned when qibo.set_backend("tensorflow") is run, but as per the tutorial (https://qibo.science/qibo/stable/getting-started/installation.html#installing-tensorflow), this should work.
Just a quick check: did you install tensorflow in the same environment where are you running pytest?
No I did not. Do you mean that in the test script, I will need to first install tensorflow?
Yes, you have to install all test dependencies.
Ok thanks! Will keep that in mind for future pytests, for now I think it is not necessary to include it since we only use it through qibo.optimizer.
