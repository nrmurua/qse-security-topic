hi quick,
I am trying to generate shared libraries.
getting  following error during compilation of lapack libraries.
relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against symbol `dlamc1_' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
please help.
Hi @akashpg1996,
According to your error message, lapack wasn't compiled as position independent code. Both Make and CMake build systems are supposed to take care of this without the intervention of user. Can you provide more details? Specifically, 1) QUICK version (git commit ID if possible), 2) build system used, 3) configure commands used for Make/CMake build configuration, 4) compiler toolchains used.
Thanks for your reply@Madu86
the details are
@akashpg1996 Thanks for pointing this out. I have already placed a PR containing corresponding fix. If you dont want to wait until the patch is released, feel free to make these changes: a0aa319 in your local copy of the code.
@Madu86 Thanks for fix. I made changes according to a0aa319. still getting same error. Now we have -fPIC in our flags, Its little confusing.  No problem I will wait for next patch.
Thank you again .
yes. You are right. running ' make distclean'  and configuring again solved the problem.
Thanks
Akash
Ok. Great!
