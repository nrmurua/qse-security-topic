Alternative Solution to add to reference implementations
Would there be any interest in adding a recursive solution to the Superposition.ReferenceImplemention.qs file for the FourBitstringSuperposition task?  Personally, I struggled with the ancillae-based solution, but recursion made sense to me.  I wrote the following solution, which passes the unit test cases as well as offers extensibility to n-bit string superpositions.
Proposed additional solution:
The ControlledOnBitString method seems to do the rotation regardless on an empty control.  If that behavior is planned to be maintained, the code contracts nicely to the edit above because the first rotation has to happen.  Hopefully it is readable enough to get the strategy across...
Thanks!
This definitely looks interesting! I think that with a bit more generalization you can get from this solution all the way to the one we use in our library.
I think it would be a better fit for the Superposition workbook, so that you could include a step-by-step explanation of how to get to this solution along with the code itself. @jimcristofono and @ScottCarda-MS are working on the workbook for task 15 now - once they are done, you could add this solution to it. Would that work for you?
I'd be happy to do that if it helps.
I didn't know about the PrepareArbitraryState() method, so thanks for pointing that out.  It would definitely be more elegant to just use it than recursion
Would the recursive solution still be useful, or is it better to skip that and utilize the PrepareArbitraryState() approach to superposition problems?
It was my understanding that the PrepareArbitraryState method was not to be used in this Kata as it makes the tasks trivial. @tcNickolas Maybe I misunderstood?
Yea, exactly! We use these tasks as training material to build up skills on state manipulation, and describing a recursive solution would be very useful for this purpose - more useful than just referring to a library function that does all the magic for us but doesn't teach the learner any interesting way of thinking.
Ok.  Great!  That makes sense.
@cdberkstresser The workbook for task 15 of the Superposition kata is finally merged to master (sorry it took me so long to review it!)
If you're still interested in contributing a description of the recursive solution, you're most welcome to do so!
@tcNickolas Would be happy to!  Hoping to sit down with this on the upcoming weekend.
Submitted Pull Request #324 .  Thanks!
