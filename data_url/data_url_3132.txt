__pow__ is implemented by repeated multiplication. This is asymptotically inefficient. It is probably inefficient for low powers, as well. It would be more efficient to make use of sigma^2 = I, which holds for all Pauli operators.
Note, __pow__ was previously computed recursively, which resulted in stack overflow: #112
