I find myself typing "cirquit" when it should be "circuit". It feels like this is going to be a generic problem with using this library. I'm not sure whether there's anything we can do about it, but I thought I'd raise the issue.
It took me a few weeks to start typing "cirq" instead of "circ". Never had the circuit thing, though. I think our general policy should be "the q is in the name of the library, never in the names of things inside the library".
Also, @DanielSank says we should call our contributors "the cirqus".
That seems like a reasonable policy, but note that a statement like from cirq.circuits import Circuit is easy to mistype...
Closing this in favor of #161 , which is about logos/taglines.
