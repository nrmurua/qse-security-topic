Hello CP2K developers,
I was reading a paper (Phys Rev Let. 120, 246801 (2018)) in which a biased counter-electrode for an electrochemical cell was modeled using Ne pseudoatoms with fractional proton numbers. Is it possible to model such pseudoatoms in a CP2K AIMD run? Could not find something like this from a search; any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks Matt, I apologize, I did not realize there was a forum and will use it for new use-related issues from now on. Since we are on this thread - I just wanted to clarify what is meant by "You can add balanced charges to either side of your cell" - is this something possible in tandem with fractional proton charge to balance it out, and what keyword should be used?
Thank you; I will explore that method for now!
