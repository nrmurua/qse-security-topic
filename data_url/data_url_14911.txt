To announce the new documentation experience being released, we should add this announcement section on the documentation home page.
fyi @javabster
Because this homepage is generated with Sphinx we are somewhat limited in how we can style components that sit within the body of the page. We have 2 options, a Qiskit Card directive or a Qiskit CTA directive:
Qiskit Card Directive - provides the full width box with an image, the entire box is clickable:
Qiskit CTA directive - doesn't have a full width box but has text and a grey button that could include CTA text
@mackinziblank which do you think would be better?
@javabster I prefer the first option personally, as it is more visually prominent. Is there any way to include link text within the content in option 1?
in option 1 the whole box is a clickable link. I could add whatever text you want within the box, but i don't think i could put a link inside because the whole box is technically a link
We probably just need to include an arrow icon or something at the end of the text to make it feel more clickable. Does it have a hover state?
Yep!
