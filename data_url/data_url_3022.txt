Running the hello world with 10 repetitions is reported by @Strilanc to be veryslow.
Adhoc benchmarking shows that it is taking 100ms per simulation run:
Prints:
I tracked this down.  For <10 qubits there is no sharding, but the processor pool with one process is still used.  The cost of shutting this down is high (about 0.1 seconds).  To fix this we need to not use the processing pool in this case!  Also I will try to calibrate where using the pools should be done for, say, a minimum of 8 cores.
Fixed in #76
