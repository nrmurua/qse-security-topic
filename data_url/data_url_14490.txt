Passing a pass manager to transpile gives an error.
No error.
No response
Ok it's because initial_layout is not allowed to be a list. I think it should be allowed to be any type accepted by transpile itself. I've changed the title of this issue accordingly.
Yeah, this is definitely part of a large interface problem surrounding the (complete lack of) separation of responsibilities between PassManagerConfig and transpile.  Really, PassManagerConfig isn't a nice interface as things stand, so the solution to this issue will likely come as larger changes to the whole pipeline come through (see e.g. #6403 for some work, where a similar issue is in the review comments).
A rework of this is definitely on the cards, though when it'll actually materialise is slightly difficult to say.
