QSimSimulator.simulate_expectation_values returns wrong results for identity operators in observables.
As the following example shows, identity operators in observables seem to be regarded as zero matrices.
This is a straightforward example.
And the result is here.
Identity operators are ignored because cirq.PauliString does not include identities in its .items() representation. The reason for this is tied to some messy details of Cirq's concept of Paulis; thankfully, a workaround is possible (#566).
