It can be helpful if all schedules in an experiment have measurements that occur at the same physical time after the start of the schedule (particular for level 2 measurement). This would be a helper function that would offset schedules appropriately and add measurements/acquires automatically. Also this would enforce any constraints on minimum wait times for the measurement (e.g. to ensure enough time for the calibration schedules which are added by the hardware).
This method should:
Moving this to 0.9 milestone as it doesn't seem like it'll be done for 0.8.
