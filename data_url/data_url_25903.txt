Currently for any error that occurs while dispatching, a generic exception is thrown by the dispatcher server which may not make sense to the user and they might not be able to resolve that on their own. We need the server to reply with exact details and error messages to the user about why it failed to say start a dispatch, or cancel a job, etc.
For instance, if the server isn't running, and someone tries to dispatch a workflow then the following exception is thrown,
Which is not sufficient to explain that the server has not been started yet. Similar exception is thrown when a cancellation request is sent and the dispatch id doesn't exist. Hence, the need for more robust and informative responses.
No response
