The definition of the Gaussian in cell 7 does not coincide with the documentation of the Gaussian pulse (https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.pulse.library.Gaussian.html).
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/1814041ad9baafa6abd7d794b7bb43961f7b7cab/tutorials/circuits_advanced/06_building_pulse_schedules.ipynb#L248-L255
This discrepancy becomes visible by changing "sigma = 10" to "sigma = 100" in cell 5.

I would suggest replacing the code in cell 7 with:
'''
import numpy as np
times = np.arange(num_samples)
def g(t):
    return np.exp(-1/2 *((t - num_samples / 2) ** 2 / sigma**2))
gaussian_samples = (g(times) - g(-1))/(1 - g(-1))
gaus = library.Waveform(gaussian_samples, name="WF Gaus")
gaus.draw()
'''
Alternatively, one could add the code above as a new cell with a short paragraph mentioning the differences between Gaussian and LiftedGaussian.
What are your opinions on this?
