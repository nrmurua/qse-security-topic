As reported by IBM and Colm, occasionally the PLL chip on the APS seems to lose lock with the reference. Symptoms include SSB frequencies and pulse widths being incorrect.
Next time this happens, we should check the status bits on the PLL chip. Does it think it is still locked up? If not, we can expose these bits to the driver and check them in init().
Diagnostic methods to expose the status bits in 1690475 and 0f34b65.  We'll have to see if they show anything funny when we notice the problem.
Checking the status bits and reprogramming the FPGA if they show a loss of lock seems to be a robust solution.
