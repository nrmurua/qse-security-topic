Hello All,
I am trying to experiment with a code that requires 'XmonSimulator' but while trying to import this, I am getting the following error:

Can you please suggest what should I do?
Hey @shaksham95 , XmonSimulator was deleted from Cirq. Use the from cirq import Simulator that you have.
@shaksham95 I'll close this. Feel free to reopen if you have any more questions related to this issue.
