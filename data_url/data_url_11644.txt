pip install qiskit gives the following error:
Try installing a newer version of pip, setuptools, and wheel with pip install -U pip setuptools wheel, that error looks like you're just using an old version of it and you won't be able build the package if setuptools is too old (I recommend upgrading all of them in tandem because all 3 packages, and virtualenv, are tightly coupled).
Hmm I've definitely upgraded to the latest pip and setuptool, but never tried wheel.
Anyway I've worked around this problem by using a different distribution of python so I don't really have this problem anymore, but I suspect others will have it.
