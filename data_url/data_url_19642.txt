Characterization of leakage errors according to:
Christopher J. Wood, Jay M. Gambetta, Quantification and Characterization of Leakage Errors, https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03081
The RB sequences are generated using standard RB, so we need to add to the RB code:
 A new fitter class LeakageRBFitter to fitters.py
we fit the standard RB output to the decay model A+Bp^m
and compute the estimate of the average leakage and seepage rates of the gate set as
L1 = (1-A)(1-p)
L2 = A(1-p)
 Test for the fitter and a function to generate test data using the pulse simulator
