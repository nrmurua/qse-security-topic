I haven't done much of a preliminary analysis on this bug and thus it is hard to say if this is a compiler bug or a runtime bug.  The issue is that the following code won't simulate:
Because we get the following error:
Try to emulate the above program for the quantinuum target.
The program should execute correctly.
Not a regression
No response
Double check the multi-control decomposition. I'm seeing this in the output

The multi-control decomposition looks fine. The culprit seems to be the related to how quake.subvec is handled. The following is the analysis of the generated quake:
There is a separate issue to fix that we are not currently compiling away qspan when targeting quantum backends.
What do you mean by compiling away? The qspan maps to a quake.veq, isn't that what we want?

We need to JIT to the QIR's base profile. Right now we are compiling to our flavor of QIR (NVQIR) that, for example, uses things like __quantum__rt__array_slice which is not (or won't be?) supported by backends.
Oh ok, I see. So its not compiling away the qspan, but compiling away sub-views of the qspan / qreg.
