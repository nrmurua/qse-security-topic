os: windows
artiq:1.1
on restart of artiq_gui a second applet window gets positioned in left upper screen corner without window frame.
not reproducible on every restart of artiq_gui. ~2 out of 3 times.
possibly related to issue #491?
@Evil-Spirit Any update?
@sbourdeauducq, sorry, I feel sick because of  tonsillitis from friday. In wednesday i've finished rewriting history for https://github.com/Evil-Spirit/solvespace/commits/canvas-opengl2.
@Evil-Spirit what should we do here?
@jordens, probably, debug using qt debug builds. I have no idea what can happen here.
