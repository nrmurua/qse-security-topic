input_map and output_map seem to be important attributes of the DAGCircuit.  output_map is used in a few transpiler passes, including RemoveFinalResets and in the base class of the padding passes.  Its use was also suggested in a new pass I proposed at #11266 (comment).  It would be nice if it were documented at https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit

The attributes should be documented

I would like to work on this!
