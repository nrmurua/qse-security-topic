A schedule is a time-ordered collection of pulse channels, and commands, see #1713 for more information. The internal representation of the Schedule will go through two phases, no conditional and conditional. This issue targets the no-conditional phase and will have a temporary IR as just a tree of Schedules following the composite model.
This will be implemented in #1901.
