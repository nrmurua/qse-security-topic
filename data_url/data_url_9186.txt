In Appendix A.3. of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00462.pdf a formula is provided for fixing the mean number of clicks of a Gaussian state when measured with threshold detectors.
It would be good to add this feature into The Walrus.
We can also now do torontonian sampling specifying the mean of number of clicks. For this we have two options:
Option 1: Change the function torontonian_sample_graph(A, n_mean, samples=1, max_photons=30, pool=False) from quantum so that the argument n_mean becomes n_clicks specifying the mean number of clicks instead of the mean photon number.
Option 2: Write a new function that does torontonian sampling from a graph and takes as argument n_clicks.
I prefer option 1 but it would require some reworking in the sf apps. What do @trbromley and @josh146  think?
Addressed in #136
