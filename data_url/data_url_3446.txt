Overall, the resulting program looks like this:
..
Runtime Error:
QVMError: The index 3 of memory "theta" is supposed to be within the interval [0, 1).
The QVM returned the above error. This could be due to a bug in the server or a
bug in your code.
at statement 66: bitstrings = qc.run(binary, {'theta': [angle_min + offset * angle_step]})
Looks similar to bug #789
@claudefalbriard This was fixed in the QVM. Updating your quilc and QVM installations to the latest versions will fix this for you.

@notmgsk Dear Mark, just tested the fix on the lastest SDK, it worked perfectly. Thanks so much.
