I am attempting to install the ForestSDK on MacOS Catalina 10.15, but I am getting an error saying it is incompatible.
This package is incompatible with this version of macOS.
The package is trying to install content to the system volume. Contact the software manufacturer for assistance.
Operating System: macOS Catalina 10.15
Python Version (python -V): Python 3.6.5:: Anaconda, Inc.
@andrewyatesg thanks for opening an issue! we're working on a fix
Facing the same issue on macOS Catalina
I am facing this exact issue as well with macOS Catalina 10.15.
Facing the same issue , please advise
While we work on a fix for this (ETA undetermined), I would recommend using the docker-ized version of the Forest SDK. Get docker here https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
With that installed, run the following commands in your terminal:
Within pyquil, you should then be able to run get_qc("8q-qvm") etc. as normal.
The latest package (2.15.1) should work on Catalina: https://qcs.rigetti.com/sdk-downloads
Unfortunately I have not fixed the security issue that macOS will complain about.
To circumvent that, you will need to Right click > Open on the .pkg file.
Let me know if you need more help.
