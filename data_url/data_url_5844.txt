State vector results from the Extended Stabilizer simulator have a significant level of error compared to the true results from, e.g., the state vector simulator.
Note that this is not related to the norm issue (#1196), which I think has been fixed.
The option extended_stabilizer_approximation_error doesn't seem to help at all.
For example: for a H - U1(-2.48) - H circuit, with extended_stabilizer_approximation_error=0.001, the probability vector (square norm, see the code below) from the extended stabilizer is [0.15351169 0.84648831], which is quite different from the expected result of [0.10542975 0.89457025]
See the code snippet below. It sweeps the angle and runs an H - U1(theta) - H circuit with both the extended stabilizer and state-vector simulators.
Since the resulting state vector may have a different global phase, we look at the probability distribution (square norm) instead.
The results should match within reasonable tolerance controlled by the extended_stabilizer_approximation_error
None. Perhaps the U1Sample sampling method has some bias.
I'm not sure if this is the complete solution to this problem but part of the issue is the scalar_t::to_complex method in chlib/core.hpp is incorrect. It constructs a std::complex phase on line 122 but this phase is not necessarily normalised (e.g. in the case e = 1 it equals (1+i)). Fixing this (by normalizing the "phase" on the next line) seems to improve matters.
Closing this issue. Feel free to reopen if there are still other problems with this simulation method
