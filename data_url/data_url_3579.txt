Adding to this (echo from another user)
"job IIhJjjnXxFXznsQa is currently queued at position 9913. Estimated time until execution: 29739.0 seconds."
@ryankarle Are we all set with this? If yes, should we close this?
@nimaalidoust I don't think we should close this yet. Will DM you
@ryankarle is there any new data on this issue? Given that it hasn't been reported on again I will close this (can re-open if there's still things outstanding)
