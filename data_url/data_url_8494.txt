To generate a random ket and have it be in the tensor product space of 3 qubits I would use
so to have the dims form I would get by actually taking the tensor product of three 1-qubit kets.
However this will fail due to the check performed of L652 of random_objects.py:
Did I understood wrong how the dims parameter of rand_ket is supposed to work? or is there a simple typo in the above line and it was instead supposed to be something like:
?
This looks to be a bug.  It looks like the 'not' is missing.  However the other dims is also not correct as well.
This should be fixed in #632.
