Blocked by #77.
One thing we could do is only keep the thread pool open if inside a context. So
would be equivalent (from a cloud-client perspective) to
where as
would only open one thread pool.
However this would impact performance pretty significantly in the case of multiple calls outside of a context manager. Probably better to do the singleton threadpool mentioned by @randomir in #171 (comment).
@arcondello, I think we'll soon have singleton threadpools, as they are related to dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client#326.
