Passing a seed to the compiler should result in the same circuit being generated.  Currently this is not the case.  This is what happens in 0.5.4.  I am assuming it happens in 0.6 as well, however #680 blocks me from verifying that.
The output circuit should be the same if the seed is fixed.
Could it just be a misconception about what the seed parameter for the compile() method represents? In your example:
this seed, per the docstring (and the code), is actually
And if memory serves it has always been the case since introduced (~0.5?) - could you trace back the point in time where we had a configurable seed for the compilation? The closest seems to be #482, but it seems those changes did not really affect the callers of the  compile_circuit() method, which might have inadvertently rendered the generation non-deterministic. I think there is value indeed in making it deterministic again one way or another, although reusing the current compile(seed) parameter might be slightly problematic depending on how the discussion about the compile() arguments as a whole evolves.
It turns out that it was an issue in 0.5.4 where the seed was not passed to compile_circuit by compile.  Since 0.6 moves to the transpiler, this bug was removed in the process.
