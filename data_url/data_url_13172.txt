We have a nice Mitiq demo page at https://unitary.fund/mitiq.html (whose code can be found here), but it's gotten quite out of date. This scope of this ticket is to complete the following:
I propose to update the Docs with more information about the functions and classes that have been added. One way to include them is with autosummary, as done here for ZNE's Factories in the User Guide.
Example of the autosummary code:
It could be nice to also add more details about the Settings options and the log=True option.
I also propose to include a link to the tutorial, once it gets added.
@nathanshammah I revamped the mitiq demo page on unitary.fund in unitaryfund/unitary.fund#309. I'm not sure your comment landed on the right issue, but would you mind taking care of the requirements you added?
UF page is done. Remaining task to add Calibration paragraph in docs.
