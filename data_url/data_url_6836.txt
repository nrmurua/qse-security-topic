Can you have comments on how such an input gate (as used in the above link) to be implemented? Such as that in Qiskit?
Thanks!
The IBM chips only allow CNOTs in one direction right?
Start from the circuit:

Rewrite into controlled sqrt Ys:

Change basis so that the controlled operations are Z type:

Expand each CS into two CNOTs with various T gates:

Rearrange operations, changing basis of CNOTs if necessary, so that two of the CNOTs are next to each other:

When two adjacent two qubit operations have a common target type (or control type) on the same qubit, you can merge them:

Change basis so that all two qubit operations are CNOTs in the same direction:

Alternatively, you can just do this:
and get a decomposition using two CZs (easily changed into two CNOTs). The intermediate single qubit gates are not nice, though:
It's clear that a two-cnot decomposition has to exist because the initial circuit has only two controlled operations, but getting the exact parameters out involves some tedious linear algebra.
