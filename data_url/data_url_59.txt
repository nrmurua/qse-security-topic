The types of arguments to kernels are limited by the language specification. However, some of those limitations have been and will be relaxed. The bridge should be checking that the argument types conform, and it does to some degree. A more comprehensive method of checking along with more exhaustive tests is needed. The method should be amenable to, for example, allowing std::pair<T,U> where T and U are numeric types to be allowed instead of disallowed without extensive efforts.
Related to this is data types of local variables in kernels. Many STL containers make extensive use of heap memory (std::list<T>) and as such likely should not be expected in kernels to run on a QPU.
