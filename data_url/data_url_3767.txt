Hi, I'm seeing the following HTTP 500 error:
Here's a small repro:
@tarballs-are-good, the lexer appears not to like [Q] in the above, is this a server issue or not legal Quil?  (HTTP status code of 400 would more clearly signal that it's a client issue rather than a server issue in the latter case)
Position 14 presumably only refers to the offset within the offending line, suggest including the offending line (or its number) in the error message to make the problem much easier to isolate in bigger circuits.
Thanks!
Hello, thanks for the report. These kinds of reports are helpful, regardless of their resolution.
I agree the error message is poor, and should be improved. Also, it's a known issue that the semantically correct HTTP status code isn't being sent currently. (There is no distinction in the back end between server logic errors and user errors. For better or for worse, the code "blames the server" for this beta release. ðŸ˜„)
The problem indeed is with [Q], which is not a valid token. An integer-like such as 12 refers to a qubit token, and a bracketed integer-like such as [12] refers to an address token. From a technical perspective, DEFCIRCUIT operates on qubits and addresses, not integers. While I can see this as confusing, it's currently not considered a bug.
However, the error messages are definitely bugs, and I'll file them.
