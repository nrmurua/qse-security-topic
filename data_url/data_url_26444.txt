Hello all,
I am working on replicating a few calculations that were done in Gaussian using LANL2DZ for heavy elements and 6-31G* for lighter elements. I found the reference of LANL2DZ formulation for Zn from the https://www.basissetexchange.org/basis/lanl2dz/format/cp2k/?version=0&elements=30) but the simulation crashes from  CP2K version 7.1 to 2023.1 with the error same as - 
I came across some mentions of ECPs integrated into CP2K around the docs; however, this mostly is support around data input with no real validation/examples done.

#2315 â†’ here, it specifically says that you need to adjust things.
Me, not really being an expert in Fortran or the CP2K-codebase, if someone could help with understanding what exactly is nexp_ppl in textbook-terms, I would be very grateful. Additionally, if there can be a way to resolve the error -
"CPASSERT failed aobasis/ai_overlap_ppl.F:404"; any guidance would be highly appreciated.
P.S. I am attaching the example input and log files for more clarity.
Thanks a lot for your time!

ECPs are available as of #3147 (without gradients for now). Make sure you recompile the development version of CP2K with the libgrpp library.
