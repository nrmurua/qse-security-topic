As a point of reference for our upcoming benchmark paper submission, and since Qrack seems to be at a more stable and correct point of development than it ever might have previously been, it's time to tag a release.
I would like to spend some time, today, updating the documentation, in preparation. If Benn doesn't object, I'll likely tag the release tonight.
Yes, also, as the issue title indicates, the changes are very extensive, and I think this likely constitutes a "major" version update, as we have loosely classified releases in the past. We're calling this "vm6502q.v4.0," unless anyone would like to make an argument to the contrary.
It took 4 days, but the documentation, and everything else, is in good shape. Let's tag it!
