Users might be led naturally to believe that PauliTerm.from_list(..) takes as input a list of PauliTerms. However, if we tried something like PauliTerm.from_list([sX(0), sY(1)]), we'd just get an AssertionError with no clear reason why it's failing. The correction to this would be PauliTerm.from_list([("X", 0), ("Y", 1)]), and the error message should say something to this effect. (Aside: should we consider simply allowing .from_list(..) to work on lists of PauliTerms?)

I think PauliTerm.from_list() should not be modified to also take in a list of PauliTerm objects. It currently mimics the way any PauliTerm is created (a string name and qubit index). The error could certainly be better.
