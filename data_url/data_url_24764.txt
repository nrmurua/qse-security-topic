If the sequencing process was interrupted and afterwards, Sequencer.build() is invoked again, it returns the entire instruction sequence, including the part already returned in previous invocations. This might be faulty behavior, as this part is likely to already have been executed and only the remainder is desired to be constructed.
Depends on #116
Solved by ditching Sequencer in favor of the create_program method infrastructure.
