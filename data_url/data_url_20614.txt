In the NIST PQC round 3, and in the current https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs, Dilithium-4 has been dropped, and replaced with Dilithium-5.
This package now fails to compile, and will keep failing until it's brought in sync withi this Dilithium change.
ACK. Dil*-AES variants got added, too. Working on it.
Closed via #277
