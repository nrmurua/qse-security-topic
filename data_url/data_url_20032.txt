Hello,
I tried to compile the tests/example_sig.c by running $CC -Ibuild/include -Lbuild/lib tests/example_sig.c -o example_sig -loqs in the top level directory of liboqs. However, I ended up getting the following error message:
bash: -Ibuild/include: No such file or directory
Prior to running the command I made sure to install the dependencies and build the source code which both were successful. What could be wrong here?
Did you set $CC to a valid compiler, e.g., export CC=gcc? When I run the command quoted verbatim as written above (and setting CC=gcc) all builds just fine... (on Linux -- what is your environment?)
Thank you. This helped!
