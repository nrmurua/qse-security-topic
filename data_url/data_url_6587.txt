The docs refer to a file called qsim_test.py, which does not appear to exist. The link goes nowhere.
https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim/blob/master/docs/cirq_interface.md#use-qsim-from-python-without-cirq
That's an artifact of a discarded change from pre-release times...let me send out a patch.
Just for reference, this is meant to point to qsimcirq_tests/qsim_test.py. Because of how Python searches for modules, I'd recommend running it with make run-py-tests instead of the instructions in the doc, though.
