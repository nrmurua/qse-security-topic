The quantum_info.Operator constructor fails because of an unbound parameter while all the free parameters of the circuit seem to be properly bound.

TypeError: ParameterExpression with unbound parameters ({ParameterVectorElement(x[0])}) cannot be cast to a float.
The code above should work correctly. For other very similar parameterized quantum circuit (see the pqc instance defined below), it runs as expected without any problem.
I actually have no idea about why this is happening but it looks like a problem only related to controlled-gates with more than one parameter (e.g. CRGate, CUGate).
Thanks for this report.  I poked into the code a little bit, and it turns out that eventually this is reduces to the bug reported by #7326, because RGate gets controlled into something containing a CUGate.  That said, we could potentially have headed that off by having an __array__ method defined on ControlledGate, but I'm not fully convinced that that's a good idea, since we don't require that general Gate instances have an __array__ method, so it's not clear how it should work well.
Fixing CUGate's bad behaviour around parameters would be the cleanest way to cause this to work.  PR #9118 should do that, which I need to revisit.
