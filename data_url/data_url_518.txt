We are using the XACC "swap-shortest-path" IR Transformation, and we have seen an issue with it when used together with an OpenQASM qelib1.inc that has been modified.
Hi XACC devs, I just wondered whether this has been reproduced at your end?  Thanks!
Hi @simon-ty
I've looked over this briefly and couldn't reproduce it.
Here is the test case that I tried. I used a different name of the .inc file to make sure it loaded the right file and also checked that the placement was applied appropriately.
Ok...I have checked with the test C++ code you provided above.  Indeed it works correctly if in my current working directory I have a file named: test_qelib.inc
However, if this file is named qelib1.inc the error occurs again.
Note: I can confirm it does find the intended qelib1.inc file - the reason is that I removed the custom gate from this file, and XACC complained that:
:16:1: Gate "qrzz" undeclared
Putting the custom gate back into the qelib.inc gives me:
Hi @tnguyen-ornl,
I can confirm using a different name for .inc and applying the placement appropriately is a valid solution for our case. Many thanks, we'll try to implement this and contact you if more help was needed.
I have collected more details on the bug.  So there are 2 use cases with different bugs:
Case (1) is the case that the C++ test code shown earlier addresses. So long as the custom .inc file is not named qelib1.inc, then a workaround (to use some other name) works fine.
Case (2) however shows that when using qpu kernel format, the Staq parser cannot deal with any path/filename declared by include .  This code reproduces the problem (where the path to the include file is "/mnt/qb/share/qbqe/qelib.inc"):
The error message is:
