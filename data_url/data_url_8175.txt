After installing qutip, in order to test qutip installation, I type "python" in terminal and then type "import qutip.testing as qt", getteing to the following error.
import qutip.testing as qt
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qutip'
qt.run()
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in 
NameError: name 'qt' is not defined
If anyone can help to solve the problem?
Thanks
It's very likely that the Python you used to install QuTiP was not the one you used to import it. It can happen when several Python versions/environments are present (e.g. on a server).
Thanks for your replies.
I did not have any python on my computer. Firstly, I installed Anaconda, then build a qutip-env.  I typed "conda activate qutip-env" and then used the following command to install the requirements: "conda install numpy scipy cython matplotlib pytest pytest-cov jupyter notebook spyder" .
Then, I added "conda config --append channels conda-forge", getting the following warning: "conda-forge already in channels list, moving to the bottem".
Then, I run "conda install qutip" with no errors.
qutip was installed in "/root/anaconda3/env" and i opened a terminal in "/root", typed "python" and then "import qutip.testing as qt" getting the above error.
I really appreciate any help!
Also, my python version is : 3.8.5
Every time you open a new terminal, you will need to activate the conda environment by conda activate qutip-env. QuTiP is only installed in this environment. If you are interested, you could check https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html for details.
IndentationError: unexpected indent means that you have unnecessary spacing before import numpy as np. It's a common programming mistake in Python, an explanation should be easily found online. E.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1016814/what-to-do-with-unexpected-indent-in-python
