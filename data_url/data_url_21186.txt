Currently there is considerable fragmentation among flashing tools for Sinara hardware. artiq_flash supports kasli v1, kasli v2, Sayma while other tools support kasli-soc and the balance of sinara hardware is supported via kasli-i2c.  This Issue is a place to discuss merging kasli-i2c with artiq_flash. kasli-i2c provides access the Sinara I2C tree via Kasli, including Sinara EEPROM deployment, firmware flashing for Fastino, Banker. It would be convenient to provide users with a single point of contact for flashing ARTIQ Sinara hardware.
