while the FORCE_EVAL/SUBSYS/COORD allows to add an optional string after the coordinates to specify  the connectivity, additional columns in a XYZ file are ignored, since the XYZ file format is not standardized. Nevertheless, it would be nice to have an option to tell CP2K to use the N-th additional column in a XYZ for the connectivity (or possibly other things).
@KanySUI is that about right?
