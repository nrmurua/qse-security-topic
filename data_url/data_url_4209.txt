Hi. If I use th QFT on 5 qubits on ibmx4, the compilation fails with telling that
Circuit cannot be mapped without using Swaps. Mapping failed.
How to solve this issue? I understand the QFT can be executed on any supported engine.

Hi! The 5-qubit mapper only takes care of the placement of qubits and does not perform swaps. So if no placement can be found such that all two-qubit gates can be executed, you will get the error message above.
You could get rid of this message by adding your own mapper which performs swaps when necessary.
