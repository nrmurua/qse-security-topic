All three Tektronix AWG devices have their drivers implemented based one AWG70000A driver. AWG5208 is quite different from the other two AWGs as it has 4 markers per channel instead of 2, which is reflected on this line: _chan_resolutions = {'5208': [12, 13, 14, 15, 16],....
The issue is: the fact about 4 markers instead of 2 is not reflected in the docstring of the set_resolution method see here:
ToDo:
alternatively, perhaps, you'd propose just to generalize docstring in order not to include this dynamic information that is dependent on the number of channels?
