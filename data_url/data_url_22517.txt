We have artiq-kc705-nist_qc1 as package but the adapter is named qc1 and the files end up in artiq/binaries/kc705-qc1. It should be either nist_qc1 or qc1 everywhere. Maybe even the _/- stuff can be made less bumpy.
The defaults should be consistent as well - gateware.targets.kc705 has qc1, artiq_flash has qc2.
Now defaults to CLOCK everywhere since this is what we have for testing.
lower case probably
