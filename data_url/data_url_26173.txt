RTD now lets a user access previous versions of the documentation.

These versions are built by creating branches from the tags of these releases. It would be better to protect these branches from being deleted accidentally.

@vprusso I am assigning this to you because I don't have access to the settings for this.
I re-labelled the branches. The output might appear a bit different compared to what we discussed previously. RTD automatically prepends a v if you click on some older version. So, before the output was appearing as v: v-1.0.5.
Now:

Think we can close this one out based on our solution yesterday. Thanks again, @purva-thakre !
