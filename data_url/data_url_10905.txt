Hi
After reading some articles & understanding some basics ,got interest in quantum mechanics & its based computing. I  went through map coloring problem which has search space of 4^13 with 4 colors ,13 states (with 2413 physical quibits) . Is current quantum computer is feasible to solve problems which has a bigger search space of  let's say 100^100 by using may be   in hierarchical way (if such hierarchical methods exist ,  how accurate would the solutions w.r.to global minima) ?  Thanks in advance for your reply.
