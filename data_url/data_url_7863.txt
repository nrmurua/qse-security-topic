I have my process matrix which is produced by experiment. Since the environment has noise and imperfections, my process matrix is not hermitian. I am trying to find my kraus operators by to_kraus ,super_to_kraus choi_to_kraus. Each time I found the same kraus operators but I cannot find my process matrix from kraus operators.
Here is the explanation what I did exactly
So could someone explain what is the procedure to compute kraus operators correctly for non hermitian process matrix in qutip?
@apassenger Thank you for posting your question. Since this is a "am I using QuTiP correctly" question and not a bug report, I would suggest posting it to the mailing list https://groups.google.com/g/qutip instead where more people will see it.
Do you have a small code snippet you could share that illustrates the problem you're encountering?
Sure, I am explaning with code:
Here is the process matrix
I first convert it to a Qobj with this script:
I found my kraus operators. Now I want to check if the kraus operators are good or not. So I used this code:
And I got this irrelevant matrix:
I also cheked if the sum of kraus operator(I multiplied the kraus operators with their conj.T and then summed) is equal to identity or not with. And it is not identity too
Then I tried to conver my process matrix to choi matrix and then found the kraus operators with these formula:
I got the same kraus operaotors but again I cannot have my intiial process amtrix from these kraus operators.
It is probably because of hermicity problem. Because I do not have an hermitian operator since we have noise in the real system. So I wonder if qutip have a way to find kraus operator for non hermitian matrix. I will write google groups too
any answer/update?
Thanks
