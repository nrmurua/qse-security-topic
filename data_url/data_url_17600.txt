Currently backend validation requires that a backend have at least one gate in gates and one or more basis_gates.  These items are not needed for simulated backends intended to be run on the open pulse simulator.  In addition, the schema requires that open_pulse be False, which of course needs to be changed.
I should not need gates for a pulse simulation.
I am going to refactor around this
