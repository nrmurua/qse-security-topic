After #1484 Python and C++ simulators no longer live under the same Aer provider but they are split between Simulators and LegacySimulators providers respectively. Simulators make it clear they are the built-in simulators coming with the foundational Terra element but now, strings such as:
The 'qasm_simulator' backend is not installed in your system. Consider using a slower backend alternative: 'qasm_simulator_py'
Does not make sense. What should we do? Using LegacySimulators.get_backend() prints a deprecated warning. Should we simply remove these messages?
Did we change the backend names for the python simulators as well?
We should just remove.
