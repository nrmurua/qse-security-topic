Importing qiskit_aer raises the following import warnings:
The are multiple imports within qiskit_aer/__init__.py that work fine before these lines. However, running the line

changes the values of __spec__ (in particular, the name changes from "qiskit_aer" to "qiskit.providers.aer"). I couldn't find a specific import from within quantum_info that causes this change
Running the following command causes the above warnings
No warning should be raised. In particular, the value of __spec__ should probably not be changed during the run.
Hmm, yeah I'm not sure what would change the __spec__ name. There is a meta-importer in qiskit-terra which adds an import redirect from the legacy qiskit.providers.aer to qiskit_aer (for backwards compatibly). But I'm not sure why/where the change in __spec__  is coming from in just aer code (since it should only be triggered on legacy imports). The simple fix for this though is to just move to an absolute import instead of a relative import. But that might just shift the error to deeper in the stack when importing something else that has a relative import.
EDIT: On more thought there might be a side effect where something in aer is importing a package in qiskit that is importing qiskit.providers.aer instead of qiskit_aer which could be causing interesting side-effects with relative imports here
