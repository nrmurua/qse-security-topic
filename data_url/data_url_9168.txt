HI @yu289333 --- You are correct, P([l]) is the power set of the first l integers. Where it is not defined?
Then |S| is the number of elements in set S? Thank you so much for explaining.
Correct.
Sorry for asking all the questions. I'm on the physics side and  am overwhelmed by all the math. For N=2, and vector_n = {1, 0}, O{n} should be a 2x2 matrix, it's not possible to go over S∈P([ℓ]), right? Where do I get wrong?
For a Two Mode Squeezed State (TMSS), the probability of the |0>0> Fock state is 1-[tanh(r)]^2. I'm having trouble verifying with the torontorian result for vector_n={0,0}
And for vector_n={0,1} and {1,0}, the probability is (x-1)/x.(x+ln(1-x)) where x=[tanh(r)]^2. I hope to compare with the torontorian result.
Hi --- The easiest way to calculate these probabilities is to use threshold_detection_prob. For a two mode squeezed vacuum state you can do
to get
￼The probability of the event [0, 0] is (0.4999999999999999+0j)
The probability of the event [0, 1] is (1.1102230246251563e-16+0j)
The probability of the event [1, 0] is (1.1102230246251563e-16+0j)
The probability of the event [1, 1] is (0.5000000000000001+0j)
As for your question
Sorry for asking all the questions. I'm on the physics side and am overwhelmed by all the math. For N=2, and vector_n = {1, 0}, O{n} should be a 2x2 matrix, it's not possible to go over S∈P([ℓ]), right? Where do I get wrong?
in that case [ℓ] = [2] = [0,1] and the P[ℓ] = [[], [0], [1], [0,1]]
Thanks. I forgot to mention that my trouble is to calculate the results of TMSS photons going through a symmetric beam splitter to compare with the original Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment.
You can generate the relevant covariance matrices either using the symplectic module or Strawberry Fields. Once you have the covariance matrix you can pass them to threshold_detection_prob as above.
