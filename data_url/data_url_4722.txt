I made a fork of this project and tried to setup a new virtual environment.
However, I got the following error
If it helps, I am using Python 3.9.4 and pip 21.1.1.
A quick fix would be to downgrade the version of numpy in requirements.txt and solve the issue, but I am not sure it is the best way to go.
Hi @maxtremblay, thank you for catching this! One quick solution could be downgrading TF from 2.5 until we add a longer-term solution.
Hi @maxtremblay, as you suggested, we downgraded numpy in requirements.txt, so this should not be an issue.
Yes, this fix the issue.
