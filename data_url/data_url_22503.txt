PCA9548 works, TCA6424A needs testing. @dhslichter can you try it?
Will test as soon as possible.
PCA9548 works, can switch between HPC and LPC I2C buses.  TCA6424A does not appear to work currently.  Error is that "ack" bit is not received, but it appears necessary 9th clock pulse is not being sent from I2C master.  @raghavendrasrinivas will send further details.
Code in ARTIQ is OK but hardware was not. Tested fine by Raghu on a TCA devboard. Need to know whether 799c2c7 is necessary.
@r-srinivas Can you test again with the TCA devboard and ARTIQ 1.0rc2 (which does not have 799c2c7)?
I used 1.0 rc2 and it seems to work fine. I was running this script on the eval board,
And you can see the LEDs flashing sequentially. So I think we can close it for now. I'll bring it up again if we have new issues.
Thanks
