CI fails to install cryptography 3.4.1.
If we update pip, it works. But, the current CI config seems to force to use pip 9 as follows.

I don't think we need to rely on miniconda. Terra does not.
The reason for miniconda on chemistry python 3.7 unit test is to test psi4 that doesn’t have a proper pip install. It seems cryptography is being installed because of qiskit-ibmq-provider in requirements-dev.txt. IBMQ should not be in requirements-dev.txt as it is not used in any test. Probably just removing it will fix the failure. Also psi4 doesn’t get a new version in ages and that miniconda it comes with doesnt work properly with latest pip.  No other unit test besides chemistry python 3.7 uses miniconda as it would be an unnecessary extra layer,
