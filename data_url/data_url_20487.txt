Just a q, if you're going to upgrade main OpenSSH to latest (8.8p1)? - else i go with this one that you got, 8.4p1...
Best regards!
We don't have immediate plans to do such update. If you know of (and/or need) specific new 8.8 features, please let us know so we can re-prioritize.
Because there are security-fixes & omitting the rsa (sha1) completely etc.?
Or maybe you got it covered?
Just asking...
Started this, but ran into merge issues that prevented the project compilation. OpenSSH released yet another version, V_8_9_P1, which will be the new target.
