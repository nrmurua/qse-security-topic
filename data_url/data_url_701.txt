Here is a test case:
That will fail because of the name Aa.
According to the Open QASM spec, the regular expression of the <id> is [a-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*
The Aa is a match, isn't it?
@DevelopDaily Aa shouldn't match, right? Look at https://regexr.com/ with [a-z][A-Za-z0-9_]* as the regex. The regex starts with [a-z] which must match lowercase chars. Adding @meamy just to confirm, my regex skills are quite limited :)
Yes, according to the spec Aa isn't a valid gate identifier. My guess is it's to make code look more uniform, rather than for any technical reason.
You are correct.
Sorry. I punched the expression into https://regex101.com/ and misinterpreted its results.
Thanks.
No worries at all! We're very glad to have you checking these things!
