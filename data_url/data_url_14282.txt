Fake backends are just wrappers around the Aer simulator.  However they themselves do not return simulator=True.  This is problematic because there are cases where knowing if the execution is on a simulator, as opposed to a real device, can be used to select methods that are more efficient.  Example, using independent (single-qubit) calibrations in M3 vs. the balanced method used on real-hw.
yields False.  As a corollary, on V2 fake backends, there is no configuration, so it is not clear how to determine if a V2 backend is a simulator or not.
Being a simulator, the fake backends should indicate this in the configuration, or wherever the same info is found on V2 backends.
