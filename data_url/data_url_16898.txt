If there is a frame change (which has no duration) it's captured by time ranges ending and starting at the time of the framechange/
Is this a bug occurring somewhere? Could you please give a minimal example replicating?
I think the example would be if you want to plot the CR schedule without the framechanes at the beginning and just the pulse. There's no time you can pick which makes that possible.
Would turning off framechange only channels with the show_framechange_channels flag satisfy these requirements?
I would probably just change the filter so that if a framechange is at the edge of the filter criteria is isn't returned
eg. a frame change at t=0 is not include in a filter t=[0,10], but is in t=[-0.0001,10]
This would have implications for all types of instructions as the check is based on timeslot intersections. This is really the difference between inclusive and exclusive domains and the only edge-case is the frame-change. Is it really wrong of the behavior of filter to include it at the beginning as it is instantaneous and truly does happen there?
It's up to you, I'm only pointing out that if there's a framechange happening at the beginning of the pulse it's impossible to remove only the framechange using the time filter.
If there is a framechange at t=0, and the filter time_range is [(0, 10)], the resulting schedule should include the framechange. It sounds like that is the behavior that is seen. What is the bug?
I guess the minimal example @dcmckayibm showed was:
I think this is a good use case for exclude().
Am I missing something?
I think what @itoko proposes makes sense.
Thank you @itoko! I will close this as the exclude method is already implemented.
