The documentation for VQE (qiskit.algorithms.VQE) states that for the ansatz a parameterized quantumcircuit can be used. But when passed such a circuit, the class gives an error.
A minimal example:
The construction of the VQE should be possible with a user defined ansatz.
The documentation for VQE should be updated with information on what type of object can be used as the ansatz. Also an example notebook would be nice.
VQE in the past to have operator on the constructor but that is no longer the case so you are constructing it incorrectly see https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.algorithms.VQE.html
The ansatz can indeed be a parameterized circuit. However the usual circuits supplied are Blueprint circuits, templates of how to build them if you will, that do not yet have the num_qubits set. Often, while you can select a type of ansatz you may not know the number of qubits in which case VQE will set it later. In your example since you build out the operator and act with it directly, you can build an ansatz to match it number of qubits - which you have hard coded.
There are example notebooks on how to call/use VQE - see here https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials.html#algorithms where several show how to setup/use VQE in various ways including the very introductory one.
