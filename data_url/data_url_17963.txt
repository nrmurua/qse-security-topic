We currently define a number of allowed gates in the core schema that we should restrict and allow backends to define new gates that are allowed.
Fix once we've merged a few of the schema PRs
One idea would be to make the core schema allow every gate that is defined in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/qasm/libs/qelib1.inc
@dcmckayibm Yes let's do that ^. Assigned to you.
Yes, that sounds like a good compromise for the release - probably related to (and likely a very similar solution to the transitional_qobj_schema.json at #807). Looking forward to see the schemas for 0.6 finalized, as we need to update the other teams as well ðŸŽ‰
closed via #843
I think we should not close this bug. The list continues being too broad, now more than before and after #807 they will include all the simulator instructions which are extensions to Qobj but not part of Qobj itself. Does it make sense?
closing is fine, the title was probably not the best...it was more that the list in the core schema just needs to be consistent with some internal list and that list will be qelib1.inc. Simulators will add to the list via add-on schemas.
