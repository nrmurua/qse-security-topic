Right now, for instance, the allowed na bandwidths go up to 2.5 GHz...
this should remain so in Python. However, it tells us that we can reduce the minimum BW parameter in FPGA code by a factor of 20
Tried this in fpga and it would cost extra resources to remove this. If wanted we can set a max for filterregisters..
fixed, see #229
