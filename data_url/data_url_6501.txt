After upgrading cirq and qsimcirq, the following error traceback comes up when running the measurement sampling example from the website:
This issue seems to be related to the latest release of Cirq and has been resolved in the development version of qsim. Would a release of the qsim project to PyPi be coming up soon?
Thank you for highlighting this! I'll roll out a fresh PyPI release of qsimcirq today.
qsimcirq 0.10.3 has been released with the fix.
