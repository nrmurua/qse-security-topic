If tweedledum is included in requirements.txt, I don't think we have to include it again in requirements-dev.txt.
This issue was solved when I upgrade tox. Perhaps some version issue. I agree with @t-imamichi
Yeah this was a bug in #6588 it should have been deleted in the requirements-dev.txt in that pr. I actually caught this the other day and included the fix as part of #6652, so once that merges I'll close this.
