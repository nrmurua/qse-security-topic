In an Instruction, parameters of type Parameter may be substituted with another Parameter object using the params setter. This, however, changes only the member _params of the instruction, not the parameters of the gates inside the instruction.
If the instruction is appended to a circuit, this can cause the following two issues:
Both problems arise because on updating the parameters of an instruction, this update is not propagated to the gates (or sub-instructions) it contains.
For problem case 1:
yields the output
For problem case 2:
results in
The expected behaviour is that setting the parameters of an instruction via instr.params = [Parameter('new')] overwrites the old parameters.
More concretely, the expected output for problem 2 is:
On calling the setter of Instruction.params, propagate the updates to the gates/instructions in Instruction.definition.
This is probably the minimal example showing the problem
results in
