The example below is intended to play increasing "flux codewords" on different "edges".
The scheduling should make the flux gate on qubits 2, 0 be simultaneous to the ones on 3, 1. This is not the case.
Furthermore, the duration of these operations (40ns) is completely ignored.

@AdriaanRol operation on edge b/w 2-0 will also make the edge 3-1 busy because of edge constraints, however, operation on 2-0 will not make edge 4-6 busy. This is also specified in configuration file. To give an example:
will generate:
Regarding the duration, yes it was a bug and has been fixed in the last commit on develop.
