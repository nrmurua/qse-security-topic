I am trying to output a custom, periodic signal using the ASG. As a test, I want to output a ramp between -500 mV and 500 mV. Looping OUT1 to IN1 and running the attached test script, I get this unexpected waveform:

I have tried for 10 hours to understand asg.py, using the information from #335, but still I wasn't able to find a way to set up a custom waveform for the ASG.
Is there a bug or am I missing something?
Here is an example how to do this:

I know the waveform I generated is likely not what you want, but you have not really told me. The issue I a having comes from n being less than 2**14, i.e. not filling the entire buffer.
One way would be to stretch your waveform to fill the entire buffer (change n to 2**14 in above example). This is the best solution most of the time, as it gives you the largest interpolation grid (good phase resolution) for outputting the desired waveform.
Another option, if you really have to use 3125 or so points, is to modify the asg such that it only outputs the first 3125 points of its buffer, and then wraps back to the start. Internally, the asg has a counter of 30 bits, and at each clock cycle it adds _counter_step to this value. It then takes the highest 14 bits of this counter as the index of your waveform to output. You can specify
Thanks a lot @lneuhaus for the detailed answer!
I was able to output a custom, periodic signal of length n by setting the counter wrap accordingly:
asg._counter_wrap=n*2**16

I hope this helps other users setting up the ASG. Maybe a link to this issue in the API manual would also be useful!
