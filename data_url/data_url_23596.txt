It is possible to load a config from a specified file (returning the config in dictionary form)
cfg = Config()
cfg.load_config('some_path_here')
and it is possible to update the config (which looks in the cwd, the env and the home directory)
cfg.update()
but the combined version of these where you specify the location of the config file you want to use as current_config doesn't exist. Is there a strong reason for this?
I think this is sensible. Probably load_config should have been a private method all along. It seems somewhat problematic in that it updates the path to the config file in the class but not the actual config file.
I suggest extending update_config to take an optional file path that would be loaded as the last config file.
