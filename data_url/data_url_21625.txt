Add configuration option for Fastino interface for use in gateware.target
Reading the source code, it looks like Fastino is hard coded to use the narrow interface. This arragnement forces all Fastino boards in an installtion to use the same interface width.

The wide interface options like log2_width should be arguments to gateware.eem.Fastino.add_std()
@jordens Is it correct that log2_width=5 is the only change needed to use the wide interface with the current implementation?
No. You also need to use a different API in kernels. See the documentation and the relevant commit
Thanks, so log2_width=5 to build the correct kasli gateware and the "group" api for writing to Fastino. This should work for intial testing.
This setting was added for you to evaluate, test, and characterize the impact on RTIO fabric and performance of wide vs narrow RTIO channels. Before making it a stable API with documentation, integration, tests etc. could you share the results. Also depending on the results it might be much better to just choose one value.
@jordens my preference would be to keep the wide RTIO interface even if it doesn't work with DMA for now.
