The existing script for loading firmware.bin and top.bit onto kasli-soc over JTAG+ethernet works fine from a cold start. However, once the uP is running firmware.bin it no longer works with artiq_netboot. A natural solution would be to reset kasli-soc over USB-JTAG however it looks like that's not supported by openocd. The result is that reflashing requires cycling the power. This isn't great as some systems may be remote or difficult to physically access.
I tried several openocd scripts with variants on reset but they fail with the same error (above).
You need to pulse POR using the provided script.
Xilinx hardware bug without other solution that I know of.
What does "pulse POR" mean?
I've looked at all the scripts and see no reference to POR or any other openocd commands.

You need to run this before each time you use JTAG.
Thanks, but your script doesn't work on my system. Perhaps our ftdi URLs differ? I'll check... Yours is ftdi://ftdi:4232h/0. Here's what it looks like on my system.
None of these nor ftdi://ftdi:4232:1:54/0 permit flashing.
Is a jumper installed on your Kasli-SoC - near the FPGA there's 4 pins, 2 of them are marked "PS_POR_B"?
If it's missing the POR script will do nothing (and also report nothing) and you still won't be able to flash.
Confirmed that this works! Thanks @sbourdeauducq and @Spaqin.
So, what do the two jumpers do on the PCB?
I've updated the wiki.
