When performing ZNE with parameter noise scaling, one needs the base level of noise sigma_0 to perform noise scaling. We need to add a module for performing Poor Man's Tomography. This module will be designed as follows:
Input:
Backend
Output:
sigma_0 representing base level of noise.
Things to be worked out:
Hi @yhindy, thanks for working on this. Can you please make the title more descriptive and add a comment to flesh out what you may be thinking about, like we are doing in general?
I understand that PMT stands for poor man's tomography from the Extended Executor Design Document. Some details would help, especially as we extend the contributors base by going public with the repository in the near future.  Thanks.
