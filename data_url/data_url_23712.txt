@damazter  it'd be nice to see a MWE or a stack trace!
@giulioungaretti
The stacktrace I got did not contain any qcodes code. The problem is that the station.snapshot() returns non-serializable data if self.instrument contains something non-serializable (following the steps above).
The problem occurs because
returns False (self._instrument is None)
So we enter
with attr equal to instrument which will put the instrument attribute in the snapshot (and this was non-serializable)
I hope this is a little bit more clear
MWE is a parameter like AlazarParameter
I know this problem can be solved by changing to
But it feels a bit weird that qcodes requires that parameters don't have an self.instrument as attribute
shouldn't the comments from the slack-dev thread of yesterday be implemented still?
