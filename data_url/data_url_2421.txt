I think this shows how PauliString is broken.
I think instead you should make Pauli String know about identities.  I mean it already knows about qubits.  I think we are making the mistake of "implicit" identities being used (which is fine, as far as it goes), and then the current situation where "I" is somehow special.
It's pretty common for data structures to have a canonical form that they normalize to. In this case our canonical form is "identities are omitted, because otherwise it makes equality and hash codes slower".
Are you advocating for print(cirq.I(a) * cirq.X(b)) to print out I(a) * X(b) instead of X(b)?
@Strilanc Is this right?
That's an example of what should start working to fix this issue.
I just submitted #1765
Does #1765 actually address this, specifically during construction of the PauliString?
