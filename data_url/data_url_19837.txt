I'm taking the issues Jay opened in the internal repo:
 state tomography (linear with wizard)
See:
Maximum Likelihood, Minimum Effort
Fast state tomography with optimal error bounds
 state tomography (cvx)
 process tomography (linear inversion)
 process tomography (cvx)
We may open a separate issue for each when we come to it, depending on complexity and what exists already
A comment from @Travis-S : This recent paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11162) shows that linear tomography and then doing the projection onto the set of density matrices has provable error bounds (Theorem 1), and can satisfy certain optimality conditions (Theorem 2). Might be worth keeping in mind and referencing in addition to the reference Jay gave
