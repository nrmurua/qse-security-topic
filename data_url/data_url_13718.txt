With the current setting, mitiq is responsible for adding noise to the input circuit using scale_noise functions. However sometimes it could be easier if one can directly pass the scale_factor parameter to the executor which would be responsible for scaling the noise with an arbitrary method decided by the user.  With this approach the executor could scale the noise at a lower physical level, e.g. acting on the execution time, physical pulses, etc..
Do we have a use case for this @andreamari now that we've found an alternative for #288
This is a pretty old issue, is it still relevant/interesting @andreamari?
I think the same result can be indirectly achieved with the existing methods run_classical (or  extrapolate)  of a Factory. So I agree that we can close this.
