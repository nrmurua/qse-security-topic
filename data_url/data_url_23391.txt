We really need some simple functions for manipulating data. These include subtracting a background, differentiating, level columns, etc. We also need to be able to drop markers on data, look at line cuts. Lastly, appending a table of metadata (or annotated image) would be very useful for the lab notebook.
There is some work in qdev-dk-archive#57
