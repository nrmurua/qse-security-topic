I followed instruction on http://qutip.org/docs/4.1/installation.html and used pip to install qutip in my python3.5.2 virtualenv directory.  All required packages listed under "General Requirements" were also installed.  pip commands completed fine.
I then cd into a directory peer to "python3.5.2 virtualenv directory" and launched jupyter notebook.  Ran two import commands.  Both failed.
Any suggestions on how to debug these failures?  I restarted firefox and jupyter notebook several times.

The bug in 1) seems to refer to Issue #1008 due to #999, the incompatibility of current version releases with SciPy 1.3. Try to pinpoint in your virtual environment the version of SciPy to 1.2.1.
Something like pip install scipy==1.2.1 should work.
Also, this is a minor thing but please refer to the current documentation, http://qutip.org/docs/latest/installation.html (QuTiP 4.3, not 4.1).
In a conda environment everything should work properly with these specifications:
Also, consider upgrading to python 3.6 or 3.7.
Also, let me add that the development version of qutip is compatible with scipy 1.3 #1000.
Thanks Nathan.  Once I install your versions of the packages and Python 3.7, these errors are gone.
