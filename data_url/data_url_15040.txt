Fake V2 backends (e.g. FakeSherbrooke) that use ecr- or cz-based entangling construct opaque gates for those names when building their Target.  This causes failures such as #9935.
Should be ECRGate.

This is basically a duplicate of: #9983 although this issue covers the broader issue in the fake backends (it's more than just FakePrague).
Oh so it is - my bad, I'd completely misremembered that issue.  In my head, we were accidentally mapping cz to cx in that issue - I think I must have just dreamed that!!
