Describe the issue
Hello,
I'm studying the classical case of a driven qubit, and i want to know the steady state of the system.
To Reproduce
I declared the following Hamiltonian
but using rho_ss = steadystate(H, c_ops) returns the error
This implies that i can't see the spectrum through spectrum(H, w, c_ops, sigmap(), sigmam()) because it calculates the steady state first, and so returns the same error.
A way to do that is by calculating the propagator and then the FFT of the correlation function
Of course using steadystate(H, c_ops) function is much simpler and straightforward, and my question is if is it normal that steadystate(H, c_ops) returns error.
steadystate does not support time dependent Hamiltonian. It sees that H is a list, not a Qobj, then fails.
@nwlambert didn't we fix this by natively allowing time dependent Hamiltonians in our solver? Maybe we should mention the repo here since it's relevant.
