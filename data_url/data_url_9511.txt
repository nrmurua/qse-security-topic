Hello I was looking in the docs for some paragraph about the abstract representation of a sequence but couldn't find any mention of it; maybe I missed it. There is this section about serialization but it uses the "python representation".
I thought we wanted to encourage as much as possible using the abstract representation so it could be nice to have a small description in there!
Very good point, we should indeed change that tutorial!
