pip install of qiskit-aer fails to build wheel with a compile error
qiskit/qiskit-aer is installed sucessfully
N/A
Neither Terra nor Aer are currently supported on Python 3.10 quite yet, sorry - we'll have wheels out for them in their next releases, but we were waiting on our dependencies for this cycle.  You should be able to have everything working fine if you use Python 3.9.
Our tracking issue on Terra is Qiskit/qiskit#7102.
Thanks for the info. Guess I won't get around installing another copy of Python after all
