Transpiler cannot handle coupling map correctly.
perhaps we need to update unittest too
sorry I solved this by myself. I just pulled the master but actually needed to compile cython again.
Yeah, #5183 updated the cython code (it was necessary because the distance matrix is now returned directly from retworkx but is read only because it lives in the rust heap and not python's so the matrix parameter in cython is const now), if you have a local build from source whenever the cython source changes you'll have to rebuild it. Fortunately the cython code doesn't generally change to frequently so this shouldn't come up too often.
