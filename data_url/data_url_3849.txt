Router has built-in knowledge of gate names swap, move, tswap, tmove and perhaps more (prep_init, etc.).
Is this ok? Kind of reserved gate names?
Or should it be made configurable to the router what these are?
Or should it be annotated in the configuration file somehow?
The option assume_prep_only_initializes specifies that the prep gate indeed sets the qubit to |0>.
Similarly one could expect options that the other gates (swap, move, tswap, tmove) do what they are supposed to do.
So for prep this is the solution: using an option. But is this a good way to do this?
