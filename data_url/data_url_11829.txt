It seems that some quantum oracle implementations depend on classically obtained ground-truth information. For example, the Deutsch-Jozsa oracle's construct_circuit method relies on knowing in advance whether the function at hand is constant or balanced via classically checking the exhaustive bitmap dictionary.
Should the oracle implementation be made s.t. it completely ignores the classically checked ground-truth information?
I don't think there's a way for the DJ, BV or Simon quantum oracles to be created without knowing the ground truth first, but I'm happy to be proven wrong.
For DJ and BV, if the function f is specified as a complete truth table, shouldn't we just be able to get its corresponding DNF or CNF form, and then use terra's ccx or Aqua's cnx gates to implement it? The oracle that Aqua's Grover uses already generates the circuit given a CNF -- It is likely far from being optimal but seems doable at least?
Haven't looked too closely at Simon yet :)
@attp I created this [WIP] PR for constructing circuits from CNF and DNF logic expressions. Would you mind taking a look and see if it might help with implementing the oracle, say, for DJ without ground truth? thanks!
