measure operation returns incorrect value when using multi-chunk parallelization (cache blocking) and index qubit is out of chunk qubits.
This issue can be reproduced by using some noise model into a circuit and using cache blocking in statevector simulator.
norm() and trace() returns batched sum for all chunks so the measured value is always [1, 0].
Disable batched sum so that each chunk returns local sum correctly.
fixed with #1480.
