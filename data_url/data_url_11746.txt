QPE/IQPE modifies input operators when operator is a WeightedPauliOperator and possibly other cases. This was reported in issue #531 and fixed, but was subsequently reverted in commit 021048d.
The following code demonstrates the issue
which outputs
Expected behaviour is that the original operator is not modified.
The simplest solution seems to be pass a copy of the operator to the conversion function in the IQPE and QPE classes
Alternatively, the  op_converter.to_weighted_pauli_operator could be modified to return a copy.
thanks. fixed with using the copy of an operator in the QPE/IQPE and add tests. (#687)
