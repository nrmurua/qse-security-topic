When running a simulation with the unitary_simulator locally the result from Result.get_data()['unitary'] isn't the expected data format.
I have a script which running a GHZ test circuit through the unitary simulator I use for testing some visualizations and this started failing post #1360 when taking the dot product of an 8 entry array with the unitary from result.get_data()['unitary'] because of a size mismatch so I started investigating.
It looks like the to_dict method at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/result/result.py#L84 doesn't know how to handle the complex numbers properly and is splitting them up into a list with each component .
My test script is:
But it looks like anyone accessing the unitary from get_data()['unitary'] will hit this issue.
For one sample execution:
result.get_data('ghz')['unitary'] returns
and
unitary
I would expect result['unitary'] and unitary to have the same data.
Investigate the cause of what's transforming the complex numbers into a list and then adjust it to not do that.
After some offline discussion this was an intentional change for improvements being made to Results object so the fix here is to better document the different format which is done in #1375
