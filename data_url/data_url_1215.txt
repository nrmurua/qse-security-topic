Description of the issue
#6167 raises the minimum Python version to 3.9,
but the following Dockerfile-s derive from images with Python 3.7 or 3.8:
TODO
Check if all of these Dockerfile-s are in use then update their Python versions to 3.9.

cirq-sync: accepted to updating the python version for the docker images in use ... we also need to findout which docker images are not being used to drop them
TODO @pavoljuhas - verify if anyone uses or wants to archive Cirq/dev_tools/docs/Dockerfile
@NoureldinYosri Sorry did not see that you had accepted this because I had already updated the Python version to 3.9 but I don't know how to find out if they are in use or not though

@jackreeceejini - thank you for taking this on.  I have asked on our internal cirq chat with no response so I submitted  #6184 to delete it.  Please hold on with changing Cirq/dev_tools/docs/Dockerfile until that PR is resolved, but feel free to update the other Dockerfile-s.
The Cirq/dev_tools/docs/Dockerfile was deleted in #6184.
We need to update only the remaining two files.
