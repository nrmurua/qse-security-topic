In load-from-yaml branch, occasionally need to create QubitFactory objects again before an EdgeFactory can find the relevant edge. The edge is in the graph, but is not properly matched to source and target. In other words,
channelLib.connectivityG.edges contains the edge of interest, but both conditions

are false.
There seem to be multiple qc and qt with same name, but they are different objects...
