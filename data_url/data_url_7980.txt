Cython is getting close to release a new major release. It bring 2 changes that we must asses to be compatible with it.
ps. This could be solved in 2 PR, an easy one for the first bullet point and another one more involved for the 2 others.
Hi Eric, I would like to work on this issue. Can you give me a bit more details on this?
@Prashik123, sure you can work on it.
If you are not sure where to start, install qutip from source using the version 3 of cython in pre-release. You will get a lot of warnings related to the point 1 above. Fix those warnings and make a PR.
