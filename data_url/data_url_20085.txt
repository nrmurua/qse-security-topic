Re-create steps:
Due to the error #1095 commented out '--numprocesses=auto' in build.ninja file.
And ran the tests:
liboqs_run_tests.txt
Attached the full run log.
Thanks!!
Your run log contains this error message:
xargs: astyle: No such file or directory
-> astyle is missing. Is it possible you didn't read https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs#linuxmacos? This would also explain #1095 ... Please follow all statements in the README and close #1095 and #1096 if things improve then.
Closing assuming #1095 (comment) applies here too.
