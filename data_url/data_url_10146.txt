A clear documentation of the dimod API is needed.
Also, it would be good for dimod to expose a set of unittests that can be run for any response, sampler or composite that would verify that the API has been set up correctly. Right now there are GenericSamplerTests and GenericResponseTest classes, but they are not imported into dimod nor are they designed with only verifying the API in mind.
