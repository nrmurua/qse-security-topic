@AdriaanRol I had a discussion with @imranashraf  about some tests failing systematically if the user does not update manually the qisa opcode file of the assembler before executing the tests, this can be misleading because the failure reason is not explicitly mentioned in the output (only the "expected" assembler errors are displayed ).
The tests using the assembler are not using the qisa opcode file generated by the openql test code, to make these tests work properly:
These steps should be automated and included in the python test flow.
@Nader-Khammassi I agree on the points you raise, I've had similar discussions with @imranashraf .
I think the real problem here is not with OpenQL but with the the Assembler. I think that since this depends critically on the output of the compiler, it should be an input argument and not require rebuilding (so that we don't have to automate this). There is an issue to this effect in the CCL repository https://github.com/DiCarloLab-Delft/ElecPrj_CCLight/issues/63.
I propose that until the moment that that issue is solved, we do not automate the build steps from the python (as it is quite some work and should be temporary) but that we however focus on making the build work for a single configuration file. What do you think of this proposition?
P.S. if you create an issue, could you add some labels?
@Nader-Khammassi @imranashraf This has been resolved.
