We can hand-roll this using pytest-cov, or just hook ourselves up to coveralls. Code coverage is not a perfect metric, so enforcing it in PRs might be overkill, but it's definitely not a bad place to start.
can use /TOTAL.*\s(\d+)%/ as the regex if we want to grab the coverage for gitlab
make sure to skip external in the coverage calculation
