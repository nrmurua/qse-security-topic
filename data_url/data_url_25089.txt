Hello I am running Minetest on Mac Catalina, and everytime I point and click on a circuit in the game, but the game keeps crashing with the following error:
I was getting the following error in the console at the beginning of the game
ERROR[Main]: Secure setting secure.http_mods isnâ€™t allowed, so was ignored.
So I went to Minetest settings -> All settings -> Server/Singleplayer -> Security -> Trusted mods
And I added: q_command
Now the game works but I do not know if something can be added to the game files to make this work more naturally.
To be clear this is for Minetest 5.4.0. in Qiskit Blocks 2020-09-25 version.
I got the impression that QiskitBlocks is not allowed to change the security setting necessary for QiskitBlocks on its own. Hence it seems to be necessary to add q_command to the list of secure.http_mods by adding it to the minetest.conf file of the engine (not the minetest.conf file of the QiskitBlocks game). q_command then also appears in the list of HTTP-mods in the GUI. The list of trusted mods is still empty in my case, so adding it to this list might not be necessary.
Perhaps this should be explained in a readme or something.
I'm on it.
