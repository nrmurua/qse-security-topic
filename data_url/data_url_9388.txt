The adiabatic example for preparing Z2 initial state (codes in branch fangli/adiabatic), does not work any more by using the current ODE solver. Not sure it is a convergence issue.
Previously, setting dt=1e-3, the codes work for Z2 state. Now it does not give the correct results. I checked to set dt= 1e-4, 1e-5, still don't converge. The running time for dt=1e-5 takes around 2 mins on my laptop.
as suggested by Roger, this issue is due to the change of default C value, so it is fixed by setting the correct C value.
