Currently, the only way to set up parameterized gates is to calculate the matrices of such gates and then include them into the program, which is then broadcast to the computing hosts. Each time the parameters change, this process has to be repeated.
To improve this. parameters can be set up as "placeholders" in the quantum program, and then the parameters would be the only thing that's communicated between the controller host and the computing host. This should significantly reduce the networking overhead.
