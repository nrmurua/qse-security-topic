As discussed in #2032, but not documented or used anywhere, it is possible to generate a layout mapping that is neither one-to-one or onto using a list input.  This breaks the nlayout_from_layout routine as a valid bijective mapping is assumed there.
We are not supporting this list format any more so closing.
