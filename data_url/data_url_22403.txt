I'm running 1.0rc3.  When I uncomment the commented line in build() below, I get the following error:
Why do you want to set a dataset in build?
I had been creating empty dataset arrays in build that get populated during run.  This worked in 1.0rc2, but doesn't work in 1.0rc3.
This certainly isn't a necessary capability.  I can easily create the arrays in prepare or even in run, but I would suggest adding something to the documentation saying that datasets can only be set in xxx methods.
Modifying datasets in build is not a good idea because this function is executed when scanning the repository and recomputing arguments.
