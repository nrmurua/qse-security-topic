Hi all!
I'm new using qtt and while measuring with "scan1D" function I realized that the live plot does not work as expected.
I can see how the Y-axis updates, but the points are not shown. I took a look into the code but I didn't find the problem.
This is some dummy code that I wrote to show the problem:
Using "scan2D" the updating works without problem, then it is something really particular for the 1D plot.
Could someone help me to solve this issue?
Thanks!
Jaime
Hi Jaime,
First of all, sorry for the late reply.
I tried to run your code and with a few small adjustments (had to create a QApp first and I changed the path_save to an existing directory on my machine) I run on it on Linux VM. I got the following output (see image). What did you expect differently?

Regards,

Hi,
thanks for the reply. My problem is that it does not update the plot point by point (what I expected that the code would do), it just shows all the points when the measurements are finished. Was this also the case for you?
I ran the code in Windows 10, I don't know if that could be a problem.

Hi,
In my case it did update point for point. Do you run the example from a jupyter notebook, because I didn't. Maybe that matters. I run qtt 1.2.4 on python 3.7.5.

Hi, it seems that the problem was running it in a jupyter notebook. Thank you!
