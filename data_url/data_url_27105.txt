In several places of the code we performed numerical integration to estimate the RHS functions, e.g. InteractionsScalar, InteractionsRho, etc. Currently we do a very simple integration. Perhaps we could mode to a use a more precise integration technique. E.g.:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule
or
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nme.1620170210/abstract
so that we do not require even spacing.
