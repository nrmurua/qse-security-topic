You could register the name of the package on PyPI. pulser is currently available (https://pypi.org/search/?q=pulser), also checkable with pip search pulser.
Here are more details on packaging, I can provide support about. I'd register a pretty empty version (e.g., v. 0.1a1, according to semantic versioning) on PyPI, with a minimal setup.py file and a basic module, e.g., utils.py. It would be nice to mirror this also on github with a mirror release.
You could also register on TestPyPI. It requires setting up two different accounts.
Solved with release v.0.0.1a1
