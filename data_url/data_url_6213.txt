After PR #141 building with Clang and running the simulator on MacOS would result in a missing symbol error error for Symbol not found: ___kmpc_critical.
revert commit f13ac32
then run
which gives
I tested with GCC 8 and got the same error using
The usual.
My guess is this is due to the hacks we use in clang_omp_symbols.hpp and gcc_omp_symbols.hpp recognising the #pragma omp critical command added in 141, though it might also have something to do with flatname space PR #144 otherwise @hhorii probably would have seen this error.
Once this is fixed this commit that disabled the new omp function should be reverted: f13ac32
