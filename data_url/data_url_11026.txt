Hello, I saw the example of the binary search using Grover, however, I am interested in search decimal values from a database. Let's say. I want to search for '20' feet from a database which has data from 0-100 feet values. Could you please enlighten me about how to do that? Could you please let me know if converting the decimal to binary would be appropriate?
Another question is the time of Grover search computation, could you let me know how can I find the time for the search?
Thanks in advance and have a great day!

Try it out. Based on https://github.com/rigetticomputing/grove/blob/master/examples/GroversAlgorithm.ipynb
You can probably do
How can I find the time for the search?
Grover's algorithm is usually analyzed by query complexity. But if you want the time complexity, I guess you can time your quantum program and compare it to a classical implementation.
