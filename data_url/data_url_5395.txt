With the recent modifications to the repository, the wheel-builder for PowerPC (ppc64le) fails to compile the C++ modules.
Expected behavior: ppc64le wheels are successfully compiled.
Actual behavior: Wheel-builder fails to build ppc64le.
Reproduces how often: Always for PPC
Sample offending step:
Any additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary
to reproduce the issue.
The root cause of this seems to be the older version of GCC/G++ in the wheel-builder image for PPC, as discussed here. I will use the manylinux2014 image, which is modern enough for our needs.
Fixed in PR #120. Closing.
