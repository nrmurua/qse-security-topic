Thanks for opening an issue about this. Unfortunately the interactive drawers no longer work, they depended on JS code hosted at a URL that no longer exists. We weren't able to preserve the functionality so for this upcoming release we've deprecated it and have the functions just use the matplotlib based drawers: #4438 This change will be included in the next release. But, since the URL was hardcoded in the iplot drawers and that URL no longer works we weren't able to have a migration path for existing releases. I'm going to close this since there is nothing that can be done to address this, but please feel free to reopen if I'm missing something.
