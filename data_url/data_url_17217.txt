Dupe of #2645 .
Hmm, I thought the script was supposed to detect it already opened a master is failing bug and just add a comment to it instead of opening a new bug every time.
That was the plan but it checks so by looking for open issues with a particular label. The label isn't properly being set (unclear why, likely unrelated to the timeout), so it's opening a new issue. I'll add the label to the #2645 to lessen the noise.
Oh, it's probably because the bot user doesn't have the triage (which is a relatively new "beta" acl) permissions which is required to set labels on open issues. I can add the bot user to the the group I created on friday that has that permission set.
