I discussed this on Slack private message but felt it worthwhile to open a public issue about this.
I'm not a lawyer so obviously take all of this with a grain of NaCl, but my understanding of the license is that it requires any software that uses it as a dependency to also adopt the same license. This is relatively restrictive and may hinder broad adoption as-written. Given that Covalent is a workflow tool that may become the backbone of other (unrelated, non-competitive) software packages, the strong copyleft can pose a challenge.
There were some internal discussions about potentially having a more permissive license for academic/non-profit use, and I think this is something that would be highly beneficial. If such an alternate license is drafted, it would be worth mentioning either on the website or repo. I have been asked about this by others as well.
The Covalent team emphasized to me that they are very passionate about ensuring their software can be widely adopted, especially by the academic community. I don't anticipate there being issues long-term at all. This is simply to bring some of that conversation to the issue tracker in case others have similar questions and also to have some way of keeping tabs on it.
