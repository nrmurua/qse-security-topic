I am simulating two dynamics via two mesolves. I want to plot the dynamics of the trace distance between the underlying two density matrices. Can someone kindly suggest a way to do that?
QuTiP provides a function qutip.tracedist to calculate this, so if you have your density matrices, you just need to use that function.  You need to make sure you store the states during the evolution (QuTiP does this by default unless you specify any e_ops).  For example,
Thanks, Jakelishman for this. I will try it first then will get back to you. Kindly don't  close the issue yet.
Thanks.. for the help..and you can close the issue .
