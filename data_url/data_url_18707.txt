@ntezak  was trying to run a simple parallel 1Q program
on the disconnected ISA
which resulted in a QUILC error:
This is because the compiler will blanket-reject programs that it can't fit onto a single connected component of the device. This is unnecessary: it should only reject programs if there's no assignment to connected components that permits the requested two-qubit operations. This change would require being a little more delicate in the guts of the addresser loop, which is why we were using this simpler heuristic instead.
