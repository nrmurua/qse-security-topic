Currently, the text representation of a list of objectives only number the controls. For example, for an ensemble optimization:
It would be better if we also automatically numbered all the states and operators, e.g.
which would make it easy to verify that all objectives go from the same state Ψ₀ to the same state Ψ₁, and that the drift Hamiltonian H₀ is the same in all objectives.
There is also room for improvement in distinguishing density matrices from operators (ρ vs H (Herm)/A (NonHerm)), and making sure that target being an arbitrary object will never cause the printing to fail.
