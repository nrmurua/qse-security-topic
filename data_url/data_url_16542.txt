Parametric two qubit gates don't show the parameter when using matplotlib however the parameter is shown when using ASCII representation of the circuit.
Parametric single qubit gates show the parameter properly.
For instance
RXX gate


It is expected that the parameter is shown as it is in the single qubit gate
Include the parameter in the gate representation when using matplotlib
The capitalization also looks inconsistent with respect to the text drawer. See #3990
Is that expected?
I can take a look at this one
I'm not fully sure about the expected result. @ajavadia @nonhermitian ?
Except for the gates with matrices as parameters, all the gates that have parameters display them below the name of the gate in the mpl drawer. To be consistent with other gates, the name should be capital R with subscript xx. This goes for Ryy and Rzx as well.
Yes I agree. One short param like that definitely should be displayed
Hey @metacubestormerxii12 and @toural, This looks like a good first issue for me. Can I take a look? It's format is close to @aasfaw's Episode 7 https://tinyurl.com/y8yhvg5z.
I have already fixed this issue, it is just pending review from one of the code owners.
But yeah ur free to work on it if you would like.
I would like to work on this if it is still open for some changes
WEll the problem is solved
Closing as solved! Thanks
