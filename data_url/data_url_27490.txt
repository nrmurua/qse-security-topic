The reason for this is that it uses a certain time before and after the adiabatic pulse to ensure that during the envelope it starts/stops at the minimum/maximum. However, these times should be included in its duration, and furthermore should be much shorter than it currently is.
Closing as it really isn't a big deal, and there are issues with the alternative as well.
