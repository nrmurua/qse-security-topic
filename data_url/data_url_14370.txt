The code in visualization.bloch.py hard-codes a rotation in the x-y plane so that the visualization looks good with the default Axis3d orientation, but this breaks any further attempts to plot on the sphere, for example, adding annotations.

Note that the actual state vector points to what is labeled as the x axis, but this is actually the negative y axis in the underlying coordinate system.  This switch is hard-coded.
Instead, the camera angle should be set properly so that subsequent plotting works as expected.
Plot everything in the standard way, but reorient the view with in render():
This is the obvious thing to do if the code generates the axis.  A question arises as to what to do if the user provides their own axis object.  Should the axes view be reset?  I recommend:
Let me know if you want a patch.
