Hello,
I am currently running cp2k8.1 on the hybrid partition on daint.cscs.ch. When I try to do a geometry optimisation (GEO_OPT) of a metal-organic framework, the calculation gets stuck at OPTIMIZATION STEP: 1, i.e. no more output is produced until I run out of walltime. Running the calculation with exactly the same inputs using cp2k7.1 on the hybrid partition on daint.cscs.ch works fine. Here the details of the compiled codes:

Can somebody help me what went wrong? I have the same issue with different metal-organic frameworks
Try to add
in the &GLOBAL section

Thank you for your help

@mkrack. It is working now, but I am a bit confused as I am a quite new CP2K user. I don't use diagonalization but OT (running input script attached). How could specifying the diagonalization library make a difference?
The PRECONDITIONER FULL_ALL involves a diagonalization.
thank you
Thanks for the quick help @mkrack !
Do I understand correctly that the default diagonalization method changed?
Or do you suspect it is a problem with the ELPA version?
Miriam reported that, in her trial run, for 4 out of 5 metal-organic frameworks the geometry optimization failed to converge with cp2k 8.1 while they converged just fine with cp2k 7.1 (with identical input).
It seems that the redistribution scheme implemented in CP2K may run into a deadlock with recent ELPA versions (see #1599)
