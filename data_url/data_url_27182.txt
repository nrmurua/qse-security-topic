I'm trying to measure the execution speed of the reference implementation on ARMv8. Running speed_cpakem512, speed_cpakem1024, etc I receive the following message at the end of each execution:
This happens with the original code even with just replacing the cpucycles function with a dummy return 0:
It also happen with all gcc the optimization flags removed or O0.
running under gdb:
gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0
Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
CPU: ARM Cortex-A53 (BCM2835, Raspberry Pi 3)
Hey @kammoh, I think that you could try to increase stack size, but have you tryied to set #define NTESTS 10000 to something smaller? Say 100-1000?
This was a very stupid bug (reversing arguments in encaps). Should be fixed now.
