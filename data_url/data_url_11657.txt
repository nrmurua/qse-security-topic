Hi @avkhadiev! That seems right, that case is missed. Would you want to make the fix yourself? ðŸ™‚
I think the setter code would be better off checking if the conversion was needed or not - having a trivial method BaseOperator method (to convert to itself as a no-op), given the intent is to remove the legacy operators later, seems the least desirable in my mind.
The numpy_eigen_solver.py code looks like it needs correcting too for the same issue.
