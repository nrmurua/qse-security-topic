When dumping QASM3 from a Qiskit circuit the emitted QASM3 has variables with names that are reserved keywords.
Emits:
Note the bit[2] measure; declaration which is invalid.
The QASM3 exporter should mangle the names of reserved keywords for classical/qubit registers with names that collied.

Good point, thanks for the report.  I've pushed up a simple symbol table add-on to the exporter in #7744 that also handles generating new names when there are clashes.  There's still a lot of work to be done in the QASM 3 exporter before 0.20 (see also #7136 and #7335 for example), and when I'm back from writing up my thesis we'll get a bit more on top of getting these things done.
