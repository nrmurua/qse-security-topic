Trying to use qiskit pass managers with a user provided coupling map leads to transpiler errors when using Aer 0.13.
Raises an exception:
The above code runs without error and returns the correct transpiled circuit when using AerSimulator from qiskit-aer 0.12
I'm not sure what is going on with Aer, but it seems like it is overriding the user provided coupling map somewhere in the passing of kwargs from the transpiler, and this is only happening in Qiskit Aer 0.13.
This might be related to the target attribute being added to AerSimulator in 0.13? @mtreinish
I found coupling_map is not set if the target of AerBackend is passed to passmanager_config here

We can avoid this by using _skip_target option as following
But I think the issue in AerBackend is AerBackend.target.build_coupling_map() should return coupling_map when setting coupling_map to AerSimulator as following
