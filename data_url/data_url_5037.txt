It looks like Volta cards with CUDA 10 need to use
gencode=arch=compute_70,code=compute_70
rather than
-gencode=arch=compute_70,code=sm_70
Look into configuring this in the new build system and using gencode in general for better backwards compatibility.
I don't think we need to be using gencode here. I believe that is only necessary if we want to generate multiple versions for multiple architectures.
-arch=sm_70, which is equivalent to  -arch=compute_70 -code=sm_70, works on volta with cuda 10 (tested by external user) and with cuda 9 (tested by me on the new build system)
I have set the new cmake build system (commit 73c4a48) to use
-arch=compute_${GPU_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY} -code=sm_${GPU_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY}
until we decide we need more flexibility in target architecture.
