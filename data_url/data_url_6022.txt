When constructing a HamiltonianModel from a hamiltonian string, specifying subsystem_list is supposed to restrict the Hamiltonian in the string to only those subsystems. Currently, it is correctly restricting the terms in the list (i.e. a Hamiltonian term is only kept if the qubits it applies to is a subset of subsystem_list), but the excluded subsystems are not actually being removed from the system dimension description in subsystem_dims.
When the full Hamiltonian matrix is constructed, this results in every Hamiltonian term having a tensored identity on subsystems not specified in subsystem_list. This was discovered when a 20 qubit hamiltonian was restricted to 2 qubits, but enormous matrices were still being constructed due to the extra factor of 2**18 dimensions.
Hopefully it will be as simple as updating the construction of subsystem_dims to only include terms from subsystem_list - though it is possible the indices will produce problematic behaviour.
