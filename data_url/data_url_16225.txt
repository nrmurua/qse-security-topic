Consider the following circuit:
Upon transpiling it gives some parameters that are of type ParameterExpression, e.g.
However, taking this transpiled circuit, converting it to a QASM string, and then making a new circuit yields a standard float type:
Therefore the exact same circuit can have different types depending on whether it is directly output from the transpiler.  This seems wrong to me and when dealing with circuit data means that one must type check every parameter.
I was not able to observe this. Perhaps it's been resolved. Closing. Please feel free to reopen if you notice it again.
