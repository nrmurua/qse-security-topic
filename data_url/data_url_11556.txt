In the current initialiser of QAOAVarform, the preferred initial point for the optimization parameters is set to a zero vector:
self._preferred_init_points = [0] * p * 2.
This is problematic because the zero vector is actually a saddle point for any cost function based on measurements of the QAOA Variational Form. (Currently the optimization process still seems to work due to rounding errors). Furthermore, in the docstring for QAOA, the description for the parameter initial_point reads
initial_point: An optional initial point (i.e. initial parameter values) for the optimizer. If None then it will simply compute a random one.
So I think it would make sense for the initial point to be generated randomly. Since this is the default behaviour for subclasses of VQAlgorithm, one possible fix would be to remove the above initialisation to the zero vector and simply set self._preferred_init_points to None in the initialiser of QAOAVarform.
