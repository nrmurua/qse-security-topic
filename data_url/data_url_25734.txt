Schema should be the same between SQLite and RDS but cloud deployments should be configured to use RDS
We may use a different AWS DB offering, see this Slack post https://agnostiqworkspace.slack.com/archives/C03ALB4SQS2/p1651881847920839
Also need to update the schema per https://www.notion.so/Covalent-Microservices-Planning-e64b536bedd34fe1b020c2405b2355eb
As much as possible metadata should be managed via the DB rather than Pickle objects
