Qiskit transpiler doesn't handle negative physical qubit indices. This is relevant because some systems might want to use different numbering schemes than (0, num_qubits) due to their platform, like ions.

I don't think we actually want to do this. Namely it would also require having registers be negatively indexed and that is not supported anywhere in Qiskit or OpenQASM. If you do not make all these changes then you still need to map indicies when going to the device, which is equivalent to just not supporting it in the first place.
What's the specific thing about ions that needs this? Maybe it can be done at level of backend module.
Tagging as wontfix for now. Keeping it open, maybe @drewrisinger can make a case.
On certain ion platforms, it makes sense to index relative to the center ion, so that center ion = 0, and ions to the right are positive, and to the left are negative. This is useful for keeping a consistent qubit number addressing a single ion, instead of changing numbering as the number of ions increases.
E.g.
At the very least, if layouts don't support negative indices, then I would expect an error either on creating CouplingMap or Layout, not when running the passmanager.

From Qiskit perspective, adding qubits means a new backend. Is it useful to know the distance to the center ion? Is that info not capture by some other property of the backend?

Fair point. #5285
ping @drewrisinger ?
