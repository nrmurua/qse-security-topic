I would like to demonstrate lowering
If I run

Notice the quake.concat operations that remain. They are superfluous and could probably be optimized away. Is there any way to do that? Here we extract qubits 0 and 1, and concat them to a veq<2>, then we run concat again (looks like a no-op), and then just extract those qubits back out. Ideally, we could have just extracted from the original veq and been done.
I will leave this open for future work to investigate more general cases of concat op canonicalization. See comment thread on #574
