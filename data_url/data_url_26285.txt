Python 3.9 provides a couple of possibilities to enhance the toqito codebase. For instance, native types like list, tuple, dict, etc. can now be used as type-hints instead of importing the corresponding List, Tuple, and Dictcomponents from thetyping` module.
One such task would be to remove the usages of from typing import List, Tuple, Dict and simply use the native types. Updating the pyproject.toml file along with corresponding documentation would also need to be done to ensure proper compliance throughout the project.
Depending on the progress of the third-party packages like numpy, cvxpy, scipy, etc., the compatibility with this relatively newer version of Python might not be supported as of yet, so something to investigate as part of this task.
