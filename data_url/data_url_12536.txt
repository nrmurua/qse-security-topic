It is strange to realize that S[2] CX[1,2] S[2] is not equivalent to CY in TFQ simulation.
Also, S X S^dag != Y in TFQ simulation. Although their difference in TFQ is a phase, maybe that is the cause for the problem above?
Example:
Would you mind rerunning this snippet and changing get_unitary to be:
And see if any of the outputs change ? This would indicate that TFQ does indeed behave differently from Cirq (which would be a big issue). I also have this vague memory of some Cirq gates having some interesting values of "default global phase" when working on parts of TFQ, which could maybe be the root cause here too ?
Sorry, I realize this silly mistake in my script: the quantum gates execute in the reverse direction of matrix multiplication.
The correction script (below) clearly shows that Cirq/TFQ simulations are correction.
