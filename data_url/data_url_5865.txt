Building Aer natively for arm64 on OSX fails with the error (also see Qiskit/qiskit#1201):
Try to build
Aer builds
On top of the conan issue, which we might be able to workaround with disabling conan (set the environment variable DISABLE_CONAN=1) and installing the required libs manually, there is an issue with scikit-build that will block actually building aer when it gets to that part.
I've been planning to add a wheel job for this (similar to Qiskit/qiskit#6252) but am blocked because scikit-build doesn't work for cross-builds on macOS (if ignores the architecture flags set and hard codes x86_64 when it calls cmake) there is an issue and PR someone opened to fix scikit-build but until that PR merges and is included in a scikit-build release adding arm64 macOS builds will be blocked.
It seems Conan should correctly detect M1 Macs since version 1.34.0. Can you update conan to check if it works with M1 Macs (pip install -U conan)?
So I think that resolved the conan issue, but then one hits another:
I am using the default Xcode compiler:
scikit-build master now supports arm64 macs, but conan (I think) is trying to build a ton of dependencies from source and crashes on SciPy.  Why it is trying to build SciPy is beyond me.
That shouldn't be happening. Can you post the full logs (Doing from a fresh clone VERBOSE=1 python ./setup.py bdist_wheel  2>&1|tee build.log) ?
Closing this one. Check #1286
