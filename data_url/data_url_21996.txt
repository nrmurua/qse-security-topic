After a cold boot (power switch), the ethernet link stays down with the new bootloader/firmware (74a6d424).
Current gateware (artiq, misoc) boots fine with old bios and firmware (artiq-3.1).
My guess is that the reset pulse to the Ethernet PHY is missing. In the old BIOS it is emitted by https://github.com/m-labs/misoc/blob/master/misoc/software/libnet/microudp.c#L421
