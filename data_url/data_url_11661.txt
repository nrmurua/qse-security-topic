Hi,
I would use slack to ask this but the link provided is not working. After updating qiskit to the newest version, this line gives me an error.
from qiskit.aqua import get_aer_backend
I went around to find info on how is the alternative way of getting the backend but found nothing. What is the intended way to handle cases like this? Is the function still available or not?
I think the following code helps you.
Hi, there was function in Aqua before supporting a json declarative approach in which the backend could be simply named. Under the covers when it was executed that method was called. Now all this was deprecated some months ago and removed recently. You can simply get a backend directly from a provider and supply that to Aqua. The above response shows this for Aer - and you can look at the samples in the readme e.g the Aqua one here https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua#creating-your-first-quantum-program-in-qiskit-aqua to see others.
What Slack link is not working? You need first to join the Slack workspace - there is a link with an invitation that needs to be used to ask to join. Then when you have joined the workspace you would have access to the channels to see/review the content there and ask questions etc.
Closing since the question posed has been answered.
