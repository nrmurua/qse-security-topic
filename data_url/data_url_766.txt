Why cu3(0,0,a) doesn't match with cu1(a) ?
Even if I ignore the global phase, these matrices seem different.
I have attached a simple code to check it.
Enviroment: Google Colab.
Get a matrix expression of cu1(a)
It Returns,
Matrix([[exp(-I*pi/16), 0, 0, 0], [0, exp(-I*pi/16), 0, 0], [0, 0, exp(-I*pi/16), 0], [0, 0, 0, exp(3*I*pi/16)]])
Get a matrix expression of cu3(0,0,a)
It Returns,
Matrix([[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, exp(-I*pi/8), 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, exp(I*pi/8)]])
Even if I ignore the global phase, these matrices seem different.
Is it expected behavior?
On the other hand, non-controlled version of these, namely,  u3(0,0,a) and u1(a) , are same.
It is expected behavior.
Get a matrix expression of u1(a)
Matrix([[exp(-I*pi/8), 0], [0, exp(I*pi/8)]])
Get a matrix expression of u3(0,0,a)
Matrix([[exp(-I*pi/8), 0], [0, exp(I*pi/8)]])
Blueqat source code is,
According to qiskit implementation of cu3 [1], it should be fixed as follows,
Sorry if my suggestion is wrong....

Thank you for reporting. It had been actual behaviour of Qiskit but modified in 2019 Nov.
Qiskit/qiskit@5b89b4c
We will modify Blueqat as same as Qiskit behaviour.
Thank you for your reply,
Got it !
We removed cu3 and cu1 gates rather than modified to qiskit's behaviour. (#120)
New u/cu gates have additional parameter for the global phase of U(2) matrix, its specifications and behaviour is very clear.
