When using method="statevector" with AerSimulator, a circuit with an initialize of |00> (i.e. [1,0,0,0]) returns a different statevector than the same circuit without explicitly initializing the |00> state.
results in
Circuits "X" and "zero+X" should return the same statevector (i.e. [0, 1, 0, 0]) but "zero+X" returns [0,-1j,0,0].
I don't know the code well enough to determine where this bug is coming from. But it is new as of 0.13.0
