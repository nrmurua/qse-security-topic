Add a stabilizer_state.py to qiskit.quantum_info.states
It should be a new class StabilizerState which is a QuantumState subclass based on the Clifford object, with further abstract methods for reset, measure, probabilities etc. (similar to Aer stabilizer simulator).
I would like to be assigned on this issue - Thanks!
