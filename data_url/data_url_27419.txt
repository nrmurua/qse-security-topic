The default behaviour of adding a pulse to a pulse sequence without t_start is to append it to the last pulse in the sequence with the same connection_label.
This limits use cases where one might want to stage using different gates, e.g. in the NMRParameterComposite you might want to empty using one gate and then continue with ESR using the typical 'stage' connection label. Even worse, this can cause pulse overlaps if one of the labels is a CombinedConnection.
This can be simply fixed by modifying the add_pulses section to explicitly adjust t_start to follow the previous stage pulse using either t_connect or directly.
@nulinspiratie Has the usage of t_connect and signals in pulse_sequences fallen out of use or is this still the standard method for constructing dynamically linked pulse sequences?
I'm not exactly following your solution: This can be simply fixed by modifying the add_pulses section to explicitly adjust t_start to follow the previous stage pulse using either t_connect or directly.
Can you give an example?
And pulse sequences are always dynamically linked. Pulses within pulse sequences don't need to by dynamically linked, but if you want to link them you need to connect them with a Signal
