By using jacobian((a, b) -> loss(circ, a, b), 1, 2), I can get the gradient.
However, if I change the loss function to
It will throw an error, although they seem equivalent.
Thanks for your issue, I just ported the AD rules to ChainRulesCore, can you try the patch in lastest master of QuAlgorithmZoo?
Still get errors when trying
imag.(state(ψ) * im) should be equivalent to real.(state(ψ)).
Maybe it is a problem of Zygote rule, can you check your Zygote version?
You should not have this warning
My version is
I still have this warning after updating Zygote to v0.6.19.
I see, the problem is related to the gradient of the real function
I made a quick fix to the chainrules_patch.jl, it should work now.
