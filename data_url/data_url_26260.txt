While this does not appear to be a bug preventing the non-signaling value to be computed, the SCS solver does seem to present a number of warnings of the form:
If justified, finding a method to silence these warnings with appropriate commenting would be a satisfactory approach. Ideally, find out precisely why this warning is being shown and alleviating whatever is causing it would be the ideal approach.
To replicate:
Investigated this further. It seems as if this is an artifact of the SCS solver. This is expected behavior, and in fact, is also shown in some of the examples on the official cvxpy docs as well (see the Total variation in-painting example for instance).
While it's not ideal to illicit warnings, it's outside of scope for both toqito and to a lesser extent cvxpy.
