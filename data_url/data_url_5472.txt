When running the following example
I get the following error.
Blame this on PR #116 :P The solution is to insert 'x' into the final_state string where cuts are expected - for bristlecone_70, those should be positions {19, 28, 29, 38, 39, 48, 49, 56}:
How do I know where cuts are needed when I am sending three files to the interface? Do I need to do some processing?
Hmm...I didn't consider the Cirq use case when adding this restriction. It's possible to get the cut locations from the ordering and grid files, but it's awkward. For now, let's just remove the restriction - I'll send you a PR shortly.
I'll have a look at the PR, and continue to work on my cirq_if PR in a few hours. If this solution works, we have an untested cirq interface. The next step will be to test and debug in a separate PR.
