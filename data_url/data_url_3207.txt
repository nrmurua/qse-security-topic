Symmetrized readout inserts X gates prior to measurement and flips the measurement result for half of the shots. This requires binary-compiling two executables. We could instead add parametric RY gates and specify theta=0 or theta=pi to dis/en-able the bit flips

Just as a heads up: a single binary will always run the same number of X-90 pulses, whereas one in a pair of flipped binaries will have one fewer X-180 pulse.
I think the former (equal number of X-90) is preferable
Thanks for pointing that out @ecp-rigetti . That was my concern as well. @marcusps told me offline that he's ok with that. We'd obviously need to communicate this caveat to users
Is there a way to batch jobs? Batching would be helpful for this.
