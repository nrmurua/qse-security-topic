Create a new class for free fermion simulation with AD/JIT/VMAP/GPU support and a Circuit-like interface
Can deal with free fermion evolution/measurement/post selection/entanglement entropy etc. Support system size of order 1000 at least.
Maybe helpful in large scale demonstration such as MIPT studies.
To my knowledge, no such package (free fermion evo + mea simulation with AD) on the market.
An independent tc.FermionCircuit class, indepedent from AbstractCircuit and they are intrinsically different

for occupation measurement (post-selection): see Appendix in  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.16595.pdf
https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0108010.pdf
https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/18492 or even a simulator with unified protocol for fermion and boson Gaussian states?
Basically done, stay tuned
See implementation in https://github.com/tencent-quantum-lab/tensorcircuit/blob/master/tensorcircuit/fgs.py, and user case in tests: https://github.com/tencent-quantum-lab/tensorcircuit/blob/master/tests/test_fgs.py
