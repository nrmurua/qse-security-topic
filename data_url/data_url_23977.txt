Sometimes, when taking a screenshot of the Ansys interface via EPR, we get an error, as seen in this screenshot:

Create conda environment from the pull request #796 and run notebook 4.02
No error when running save_screenshot()
This may have something to do with EPR's save screenshot or COM port
From notebook 4.11 using python 3.10
