For example, relational and set operators will fail when applied to a property that a particular solver does not have:
Some operators should accept None as a LHS value (eq, available, in), but for some (relational, set) LHS None doesn't make too much sense.
Proposal: patch the affected operators/predicates to shortcircuit to False if LHS is None.
