Current Problem
Currently, penaltymodels are generated without considering the min_classical_gap. Instead the min_classical_gap is maintained indirectly; dwavebinarycsp.stitch checks to see if the found penaltymodel satisfies the min_classical_gap, if not, it asks for a new penaltymodel.
Proposed Solution
Pass the user's requested min_classical_gap to the penaltymodel. In this way, the penaltymodel can use min_classical_gap as a bound.
Note: user makes this min_classical_gap specification from dwavebinarycsp's stitch(..).
