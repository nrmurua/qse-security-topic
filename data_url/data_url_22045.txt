That's not an ARTIQ issue. Write an e-mail.
@jordens This is an ARTIQ Issue in so much as @sbourdeauducq insists that IRC logs are part of the ARTIQ documentation. Anyway, it's unclear to me who maintains the IRC log.
The domain is "whitequark.org", so @whitequark would be who maintains it...
Now fixed. Thanks @whitequark
I never said that and even less insisted on it.
