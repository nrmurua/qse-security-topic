#6396 does not set parameter bounds of QAOA ansatz. @ikkoham found this #6396 (comment).
FYI: #6396 also changes the order of parameters. #6424
Set parameter bounds.
We may need to revert the unit test of QAOA to catch similar issues.

I changed the unit test on purpose as I thought it's a little strange to check for the parameter value and not the optimal solution -- exactly because changes like parameter ordering or bounds don't necessarily affect the performance of the algorithm.
But you're right, we should add the parameter_bounds back in (also if I don't really understand why they are necessary, at least for backward compatibility we should keep them). ðŸ™‚
Thanks. Actually, I don't know why such boundaries are set for stable either. The situation where only the second part has boundaries does not make sense to me.
Checking the optimal parameter with mod 2Ï€ is enough when one removes the bounds in the future(?). (And checking the optimal solution is very nice I think.)
The bounds were introduced in qiskit-community/qiskit-aqua#1459.
And checking the optimal solution is very nice I think.
But the optimal solution is not unique and depends e.g. on the initial point (which can be volatile if we choose it to be random and only set the seed in the beginning of the test class). Testing the initial point is a "stronger test" in the sense that we realize immediately if something changes, but it is also kind of random IMO -- except if we would compute the point on convergence analytically and could check that.
We can also just have both, value and point.
