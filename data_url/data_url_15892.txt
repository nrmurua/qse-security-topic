While looking at the code for one qubit decomposition I found
a small difference between ZXZ decomposition and the other
ones ('ZYZ, XYX'):

The following diff show the difference between _circuit_zyz
and _circuit_zxz. Apart from the expected RYGate and RXGate,
we also see the function _mod_2pi is called without atol,
which might  be a bug.
If this is indeed a bug, then we could refactor the code of the three
functions:  _circuit_zxz,  _circuit_zyz and  _circuit_xyx. We
could merge these three functions into one that receive the appropriate
gates as parameters. (Like: _circuit_psx_gen)
Well spotted. I took a look at this and I think the right thing is to add the atol for the zxz case as you suggest. Refactoring this as you describe makes sense to me, but I think @ajavadia might have some opinions about this kind of thing.
Yes I agree. There's a good amount of duplication here and refactoring makes sense to me.
If we could have a generic Euler fn that would also support XZX etc then @ewinston would be able to use it in #6581
@boschmitt is there anything left here now that #6553 has merged?

I only had time to briefly look over the changes, but looks like there is nothing left. Since it appears that was not a big problem to begin with, only a warning flag, I will simply close the issue.
