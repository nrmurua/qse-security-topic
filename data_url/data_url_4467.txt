Every quantum channel action has a Liouville representation which maps (density) matrices -> (density) matrices, the representation is a matrix acting on the vectorized (density) matrices.
For the pauli error channel the Liouville representation calculation could look like this:
For this the explicit action of the quantum channel has to be written out. For more than one qubit channels the basis are pauli strings but the method stays the same.
A liouville representation property of quantum error channels would be great.
With this representation the effective depolarizing parameters can be calculated which can be directly used to verify randomized benchmarking simulations.
