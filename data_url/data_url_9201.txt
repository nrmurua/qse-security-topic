It would be useful to provide a seed global method, in order to force the sampling methods to become deterministic. Something like
This might simply be a wrapper around np.random.seed(), or it might be something more complicated.
Any progress on this request?
I wrote a wrapper for np.random.seed() in #29
It does not break the tests and it indeed allows to make deterministic samples.
... and also I wrote test for the new function.
