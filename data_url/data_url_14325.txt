When passing a None tuple field the set_options routine crashes (and/or no raise an error)
Run:
Get:
The corresponding set option should be just skipped like the None's in other instance types of update_options
No response
I would like to work on this issue, if possible?
Hi @ottoeretnaesehorn, you can take a look in the PR #9204
It's not clear to me that this code snippet should be allowed.  The backend you're using explicitly sets a validator on rep_delay that it must be a numeric type, but you're trying to set it to None.  That should be an error.
That said, you're right that the error is not helpful (hence your not knowing what's happening) - the validation code in Options should probably check that the field is a number first before trying to do arithmetic on it.
