Description
The node_list and edge_list parameters say "node_list ...Note that this list is used to remove nodes, so any nodes specified not in range(m * n * 2 * t) are not added."
But such nodes/edges are added for both functions.
To Reproduce
Expected behavior
I expected an intersection of nodes/edges in the m,n,t and node_list and edge_list parameters.
Environment:
Additional context
I wanted to use this to extract the working graph of a QPU within a Pegasus(2): p2_working_graph = dnx.pegasus_graph(2, node_list=qpu.nodelist, edge_list=qpu.edgelist)
