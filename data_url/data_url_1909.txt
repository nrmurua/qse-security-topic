This would be similar to run_async, in that it simply defers to run or run_sweep, and should be overridden by parent classes that can sample batches more efficiently. It would be overridden in QuantumEngineSampler.
If this should be done, I'm willing to work on it.
Great to see this issue opened, wanted to say that for samplers intended to be used with TFQ, run_batch would be a really helpful addition to the API.
Discussed on Cirq Cynq - this sounds like a good idea. Please go ahead!
