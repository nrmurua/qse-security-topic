Currently in the section about executors of the docs there are examples of Cirq and Qiskit executors which are based on a wavefunction simulation.
However, such executors correspond to noiseless simulations for which it doesn't make sense to use error mitigation.
Shall we remove the executors based on a wave-function simulation?
@willzeng
The cirq.Simulator will use quantum trajectories if there are non-unitary channels in the circuit, so the final wavefunction is not necessarily the same after every run.
@andreamari Does @rmlarose's example give enough reason to leave them in?
In my opinion we should keep them if we also add some noise as in the example of @rmlarose.
If they simulate a purely noiseless execution they may confuse the user since there would be no reasonable way of using them with mitiq.
Closing this as I believe it is resolved. Reopen if appropriate.
