The CQCHeader for the message sent back when cmd_measure is called in cqcProtocol.py seems to have length 0, since this is the default in _send_back_cqc. Should be length 20?
This is now solved. An additional argument called length is given to _send_back_cqc, which defaults to 0. The methods handle_time, cmd_measure and cmd_recv now calls send_back_cqc with the argument length=CQC_NOTIFY_LENGTH.
