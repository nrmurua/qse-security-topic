From @zlatko-minev
Users get confused when to rebuild. Should add a flag to the design that says need to rebuild, then have the gui update with a red bar at the top to indicate that a rebuild is needed.
Clearer indication to the user that a rebuild is needed
Issue resolved - Automatically rebuilds without need for user intervention
