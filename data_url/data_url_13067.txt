Currently as part of our GitHub releases (e.g. 0.25.0) we only include source code. Dan mentioned that it could be nice to include wheels as part of this release, and I tend to agree.
The main benefit of this would be to allow users an additional install option.
This came out of walking through the Mitiq release pipeline with @Misty-W and @WrathfulSpatula during today's release.
