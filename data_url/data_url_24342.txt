When you double click component in the Widget below or a selection of components zoom in on it/them.
I wrote this already but it seems to not work now.
There is also the buttom on the top right to do this too.

@coruscating , i tagged you here, because I think we worked on something related for the zoom, so you probably know this one well
Same as #37 So will close this one.
