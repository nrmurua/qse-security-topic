Given the results from https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2020-11-30-366/ it should be possible to implement natively in Fock space any Gaussian gate. Thus for example we should not need to decompose the MZgate, CXgate, CZgate and Pgate . This should be bring the speed of all the gates to be fairly fast and comparable to the Sgate and BSgate and S2gate for 1 and 2 modes respectively.
Two accomplish this two steps are needed:
