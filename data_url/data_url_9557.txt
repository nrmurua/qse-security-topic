#312 introduces output modulation into Pulser. The next logical step is to use the expected output to get more reliable results out of a simulation. Important notes:
Modulation is now handled at the sampler level with the merging of #345.
Issue #349 tracks the progress of using the sampler in simulations.
Something to take into account here: the behaviour of the SLM mask in the presence of modulation is still ill-defined, so it was decided that for now we will just not support the simulation of sequences with modulated output and an SLM mask.
Practically, this implies that in Simulation.__init__(), if the user chooses the option to use the modulated output, we check whether the SLM mask is configured and raise a NotImplementedError if so.
