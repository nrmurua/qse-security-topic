Add a custom numeric vector class like the matrix class that uses a C-style array internally and supports move semantics. The main motivation for this is to allow the use of move semantics with the QubitVector/Statevector simulators and the rest of the code, including the Numpy array of the output and Numpy array of initial states.
For example the UnitarySimulator can move its final state to results to be returned as a Numpy array without a copy, however the StatevectorSimulator requires a memory copy to a std::vector.
This sort of array is already used internally by the QubitVector class so would abstract out its internal container to a separate class, and could also be used in other parts of the code that need a numeric vector instead of std::vector.
