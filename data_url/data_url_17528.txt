For the record, this isn't a problem in Python 3.7.2. Wasn't able to reproduce it on my system.
@aasfaw are you using master code?
@1ucian0 yes, using master.
Got the same behavior as reported by @1ucian0 using terra master code. (terra 0.8.0) and python 3.7.
Also new behavior

compared to previous one
