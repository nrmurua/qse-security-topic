We have a comprehensive set of tests (in unittests/) for all backends, including the cutensornet backends (tensornet and tensornet-mps).
Currently, some of these tests are bypassed (via #define macro) for cutensornet backends simply due to long runtime, e.g., BuilderTester::checkMidCircuitMeasure.
Some VQE tests, while not being bypassed, also have long run time. These tests (small circuits with lots of iteration) are not suitable for cutensornet backends in general.
To minimize test time while keeping these runtime tests for coverage, we can make these tests configurable in terms of number of shots or VQE iterations.
