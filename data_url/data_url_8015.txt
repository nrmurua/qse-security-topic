The qutip documentation at https://qutip.org/docs/4.0.2/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html#unitary-evolution has the code
This does not work with recent versions of numpy. In particular np.linspace(0.0, 10.0, 20.0) generates the exception TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer

Hi @eendebakpt ,
the link you provided refers to an old version of the docs for QuTiP Version 4.0.2.
You can find the documentation for the unitary evolution of the current QuTiP version here: https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-master.html#unitary-evolution.
The code in the latest docs seems to be correct:
np.linspace(0.0, 10.0, 20)
I suggest to close this issue!
@eendebakpt, thank you for reporting this, and @christian512 thank you for looking into it. I'm closing it for now as @christian512 suggested.
