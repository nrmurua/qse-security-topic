Libkv is unfortunately proven to be a burden and resource hog when it compares to the pure etcd approach that was originally in place. The change should be reverted so that the complexity can be kept at a minimum.
This will mean sacrificing the capability to run with consul, however a pure consul approach would probably be as beneficial as the etcd approach will be. So that can be considered down the road.
