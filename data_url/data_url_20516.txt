On the execution of $ sudo ./run.sh there's an error:
configure:16615: error: *** Can't find LibOQS library (see config.log for details) ***
I am executing the script from an Ubuntu 16.04 with openssl-1.0.2g (1 Mar 2016) installed and these are the steps taken:
$ sudo apt install autoconf automake gcc libtool libssl-dev make unzip xsltproc
$ cd openssh-portable/oqs_test
$ sudo bash run.sh
I have tryed executing the scripts one by one but the same error occurs.
Â¿Any advice?
Thanks
The error is found in an undefined reference to CMP_LT_OS in the liboqs.so library /home/osm/QKD/openssh-portable/oqs_test/tmp/install/lib/liboqs.so: undefined reference to '_CMP_LT_OS'.
This is the code: configure:16615: error: *** Can't find LibOQS library (see config.log for details) ***.
Hi Jaime, we ran into this problem in another context.  Can you try running CIRCLECI=true ./run.sh and letting me know the result?
This would be a temporary solution. A more permanent solution involves improving how AVX2 and other instructions are detected/used in liboqs, which I'm working on but isn't done yet (open-quantum-safe/liboqs#509).
open-quantum-safe/liboqs#519 may be a more permanent solution to this issue; need to check here once it lands.
I think open-quantum-safe/liboqs#519 has fixed this problem, at least I can no longer reproduce.
Please try running again with a fresh checkout.
Closing this as there have been no further updates since the fix has been merged.
