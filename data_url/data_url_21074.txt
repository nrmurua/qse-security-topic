Segmentation fault
Can you please reboot your node and try installing after that?
Rebooted system segmentation fault exist as user but not as sudo or root. The client runs either way the same mines and fails to transfer coins to the accounts involved. If two different problems check into seg problem first it seems it would be a more global problem. I am using debian 9 which is still unsupported
Know getting the following while client is running

@galations522 I know about the KeyError issue #753
It would be fixed soon.
You can only fail to send txn, if your wallet is in stake validator list. A stake validator is not allowed to send txn. Check your wallet list at https://explorer.theqrl.org/stakers
Closing this issue as it was linked to the PoS version.
Obsolete
