Under the u3 gate definition, the 2nd row of the matrix is written (line 48 of u3.py):
e^{i\phi}\sin(\th) & e^{i(\phi+\lambda)\cos(\th)}
Notice the code(\th) is in the exponent.
The cos(\th) term should be taken out of the exponent.
It should be written
e^{i\phi}\sin(\th) & e^{i(\phi+\lambda)}\cos(\th)
