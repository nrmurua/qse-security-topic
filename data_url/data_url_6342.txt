It is highly desirable to use QHybrid directly under the QPager layer, if using QPager at all. In order to do so, QHybrid must fit the QEngine interface, so that QPager can user special engine-only methods.
QHybrid conceptually probably should already be a QEngine type itself, but this is not how it solves its "diamond problem" between its two constituent QEngine sub-classes. It might require a refactor of QEngine as well, but a QHybrid should qualify as a proper QEngine type, directly inheriting.

(I'm praying the resultant benchmarks on test_ccz_ccx_h aren't "bad-pointer-land" meaningless numbers for an incorrect circuit, but they look too good on my system to be true, heads-up. Happy New Year, either way!)
