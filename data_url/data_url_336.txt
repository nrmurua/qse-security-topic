The code snippet below is what we support now and is a little tedious:
Instead of
can we please support
Thanks
I don't think this will be possible - the latter is ambiguous for the CUDA Quantum programming model. Because we primarily consider single qubit operations that are then modified to synthesize controlled operations, your suggested syntax cannot be disambiguated from a single op x on qubits 0 and 1, or the operation x controlled on 0 targeting 1.
Is noisy simulation not yet supported with the cuStateVec backend? I noticed that the CuStateVecCircuitSimulator class in runtime/nvqir/custatevec/CuStateVecCircuitSimulator.cu does not have applyNoiseChannel implemented.

Not yet, but we are looking into options. I'll close this as that work will be tracked separately.
