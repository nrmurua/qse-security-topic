There is now an asyncserial on pip, https://github.com/xvzf/asyncserial-py, and it will get installed if m-labs/asyncserial isn't installed either manually via setuptools or conda. Once installed, eggs have priority over conda packages, so this leads to very obscure errors.
Nix sandboxing, which prevents setup.py from accessing the network, avoids this problem.
