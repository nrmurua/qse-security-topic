T1 experiment for example:
This program will cause an error:
np.int should be allowed for the duration of Delay instruction.
This is a bug introduced by #3750 and the accompanying support for backward compatibility.
@taalexander Is this as simple as casting duration in class Delay to an int, or are there deeper ramifications? If it's not too deep, I can take this on.
Other than adding a test to go along with your fix, I think its that simple ðŸ˜„ .
One thing is that this would convert 3.5 to 3. Don't know if that's acceptable or not. The test for isinstance takes place in Instruction. I noticed that in the module Command that it imports numpy and uses isinstance(duration, (int, np.integer)). Is it acceptable to import numpy into Instruction and use this form of isinstance? Seems cleaner and more consistent to me.
This seems fine to me.
Thanks. Then I'm on it.
