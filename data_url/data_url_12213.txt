I am working on the classical_optimization in aqua directory. It works well using qasm_simulator. However, when changing params['backend']['name'] = 'qasm_simulator' to params['backend']['name'] = 'ibmqx4' or params['backend']['name'] = 'ibmq_16_melbourne', the code runs endlessly and starts creating jobs on the quantum computer again and again. Then, when I check the histogram results of jobs, it seems that I cannot find the right solution according to the simulation because the probability of each output are similar. Did I make any mistake during the process?
Thanks a lot!

The left is the plot of real ibmqx4 result and the right one is the qasm_simulator result.
There are a couple of things:

Thanks. I will investigate more on how to mitigate the errors in real device.
But when I run this part using  'ibmq_16_melbourne' in jupyter,
It runs endlessly and I cannot get final results after running a whole night, do you know what happens here?
I think it is because your job is queued for a long time.
You can turn on the aqua logging to see the progress of optimization.
