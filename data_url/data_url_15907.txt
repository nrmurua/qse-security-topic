As described here the limit_amplitude keyword argument should be propagated to the constructor of existing parametric pulses.
For example,
class Pulse defaults limit_amplitude property to True.
Should that True value be propagated as the default to class ParametricPulse and its specializations, or should it be as in this Issue's header, a default of False?
The default value should be True. The example in the issue was intended to demonstrate how to disable amplitude checking.
Hi @taalexander, @jwoehr. May I work on this?
It's open source, go ahead, @dhruvbhq
Hi, I have raised a PR, but I have a query.
In the method validate_parameters of class Drag (derived from ParametricPulse), there is an assertion/check "Beta is too large: pulse amplitude norm exceeds 1". It is checking whether the value of 'Beta' causes the maximum amplitude to exceed 1. For now, I have bypassed this check in case 'limit_amplitude' is false, as in this case it doesn't make sense (to me) to enforce this check. However, I think this would leave 'Beta' completely unconstrained.
In case limit_amplitude is false, is there a need to put any additional check on the value of 'Beta'?
