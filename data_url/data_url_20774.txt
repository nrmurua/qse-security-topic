Since, for example, the name field is FrodoKEM-640-SHAKE in  frodokem640shake/META.yml  and is Classic McEliece 6688128 in mceliece6688128f/META.yml, shouldn't name in, say, ntruhps2048509/META.yml be NTRU-HPS-2048-509?
We've never really given that field much thought I think. It would probably be better to use the "pretty" names as used in the submissions, but that would also mean updating CRYPTO_ALGNAME as that is verified to match.
I see. I could put up a PR making the switch to the pretty names, but I'm guessing changing CRYPTO_ALGNAME here would necessitate also changing it upstream?
We can make changes downstream (here) just fine, we don't upstream a lot...
⚰️  RIP Frodo, you will be missed.
