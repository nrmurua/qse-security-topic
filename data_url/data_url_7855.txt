Hello! is this open for contributions?
We made good progress updating the documentation for v5, we are mostly missing pages for new features and porting from v4 to v5, which would be hard to write without being up to date with recent progress.
However if you want to take a look with fresh eyes, fix error, improve wording, fix broken links, etc. it would be greatly appreciated.
