A previous by-hand family of specialized pragma classes overrode the generic accessor methods so that they stayed in sync with any specialized data. The new define-pragma macro doesn't currently do this, which broke some old quilc code that wasn't ported over to the specialized classes and so still used generic accessors. It would be best to provide overrides for these accessors as well.
