When using the virtualAWG in video-mode, using virtual gates. Using a virtual gate space that uses (ch1,ch3) for x-axis and (ch2,ch4) for the y-axis. All the proper waveforms are generated, but for some reason, channel 4 does not get enabled. When turned on manually, everything works fine, but this is slightly annoying.
@NicoHendrickx Some questions:
@peendebak
Are you using the old or new virtual awg?
The new one.
After starting the videomode, can you post the contents of videomode.videomode_processor.waveform?
The waveform is fine.
Can you try [OP-82] Enable all output channels for virtual awg in videomode.Â #644
This does not work, however the fix is:
Change line 380 to:
keys = qtt.utilities.tools.flatten(gates)
(Although I'm surprised this flatten-function keeps the keys of the dict, not the values. Is this intended behaviour?)
@NicoHendrickx Can you check what the contents of gates is at that specific line of code? I would expect something like gates=[{'P1': 1, 'P2': 3.}, {'P3': 6, 'P1': -2}], and then keys = qtt.utilities.tools.flatten(gates) is equal to the code from the PR.
That's correct, I forgot to remove the [0] from the code in replicating the PR. My bad. PR works as well.
