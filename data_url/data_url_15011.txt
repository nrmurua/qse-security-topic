basic_swap.py has boolean parameter fake_run, when true should return the dag before adding in SWAP gates. However,
this should be self._fake_run(dag) to reference the class' function instead of the attribute.
Error indicated by TypeError: 'bool' object is not callable
Call the class function
Thanks for the report!  Would you like to make a PR fixing it?
Will do. I'll check the other passes as well for this typo.
