I create a QuantumCircuit from a qasm string that contains multiple R gates. E.g.:
Generating the qasm string from the previously generated QuantumCircuit does result in the R gates being defined multiple times:
This is in principle a duplicate of #5082, which requires a larger rework of our data model to handle (which we are working on, I promise! - it's just a very very big change), but the reason you only see this after a re-import from the OQ2 string is because Qiskit can't know for certain that it's safe for it to use its built-in RGate to represent the gate r statement.
We're currently reworking how we'll define header files for OpenQASM 2, which will make this easier, but in the meantime, a direct workaround is to replace the legacy QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str with qiskit.qasm2.loads, which is far more configurable.  If you do this:
I think you'll get what you expect.
edit: just modified the code block - I'd flipped the arguments in CustomInstruction by accident.
The gist of #10737 (linked above) is that we're going to start exposing new header files called things like qiskit/v1.qasm, and that will include definitions of all of Qiskit's standard gates, not just the legacy ones that kind of got mashed into Qiskit's not-very-accurate version of qelib1.inc (see #4312).  That will let us safely know when we're importing OQ2 that's targetted at our standard gates, without making assumptions about user-defined gates.
Thanks @jakelishman for the detailed response!
Using qasm2.loads() solved my issue. Looking forward to the new implementation.
I close this issue, since it is a duplicate of #5082.
