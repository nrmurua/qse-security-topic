Hi there I would like to request if I could contribute in some way to add this in. I have done Quantum Computing research in BEC modelling and would like to add this to the full-stack.
I want to be able to simulate mapping qubits in the BEC, decoherence and spin entanglement.

@hrahman12 This sounds very interesting. How much of the idea do you have fleshed out so far?
If the plan is a very complete package targeting a specific physical system or family of systems, it might be best to have a separate package that used QuTiP. Such a package could however be part of the QuTiP family of packages potentially (e.g. in the same way qutip-qip is a separate package now).
On the other hand, if you want specific support for a few key classes and functions that might be more widely applicable (e.g. constructors for new quantum states or operators, a new kind of solver, new visualisation) those might well belong in the main QuTiP package (i.e. this repository).
Keen to facilitate your work if you're keen to do it -- we just need to figure out what is the best plan.
I took inspiration from Coupled Spin Orbitals in BEC's from QuantumOptics.jl
