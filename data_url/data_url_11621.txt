Currently, __str__ of operators does not have indents.
Adding indents may help to debug developing operators.
This is a just requirement for nice-to-have.
@woodsp-ibm could I have some feedback / help on this one too please?
Very strongly in favor of this, great suggestion. Thanks for taking it on @romainfd!
