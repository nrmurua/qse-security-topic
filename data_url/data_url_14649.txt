Noticed the "coming soon" sections in this tutorial:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/circuits_advanced/08_gathering_system_information.ipynb
Is it still coming soon, or can it be linked somewhere already?
Looks like this is still a problem. Thanks for opening this!
@Eric-Arellano np. been a long while ðŸ˜„ Didn't know you could move issues between repos (github mobile gets confused though, it couldn't resolve the link, but on the desktop its ok).
Didn't know you could move issues between repos
Yep! That's what I did here because the tutorials are very soon moving to directly live in this Qiskit Terra repo.
