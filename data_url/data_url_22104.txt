Example below is a mockup of a spin-echo where the TTL is used to switch on/off an RF switch. There is an unexpected change in duty cycle from 50% high to 75% high for sawg1.
swag0 is yellow on scope
swag1 is green on scope
TTL is pink on scope -- trigger on pulse duration > 2.8 us

Duty cycle? You are running the DUC at 200 MHz frequency with a 300 MHz data rate, i.e. 100 MHz output as expected. The initial cycle is the AA filter trying its best to help you band-limit your signal.
By DUC I guess you mean digital up converter.
By AA I guess you mean anti-aliasing filter.
So this gives a time-average DC offset. If driving an AOM this won't be a problem. Looking at it on a spectrum analyzer.
I will double check the filter attenuation at 400 MHz.
The DAC_Filter_A filter in the Sinara repository is a single-pole Butterworth. Insertion loss is
Otherwise Issue as raised is a non-issue. Closing.
One of the Nyquist images is at 0 Hz.
Expect a sinc response.
