The present code is very slow, so single-thread version of ket::(mpi::)measure() is used in bra.
Wrong reference
Commit 0251fb3 might improves nompi version.
Need check if it is really improved or not.
Meanwhile, it is not easy to improve mpi version because the present version uses iterator of ket::mpi::state.
Need modifying by using such as for_each_local_range.
Commit 8ac4c9c doesn't change the problems about ket::(mpi::)measure().
Need reconsiderations.
#71 doesn't make simulation faster in the case of parallel ket::mpi::measure.
However, I close this issue because it is now uncovered that it's very difficult to make parallel measure faster.
