Testing fails on several platforms
In QuTiP 4.5.1, several skipifhave been introduced to avoid build fail on Mac. Similarly, there are other issues related to robust random objects testing.
Describe the solution you'd like
An option could be using xdist to allow specifics of certain tests, as it seems to have, beyond parallelization, some potentially interesting multi-platform coverage.
I think xdist is about self-managing a distributed cluster for testing?  The little line at the bottom about "it effectively rsyncs the code to the remote locations" certainly sounds like it, and those descriptions seem to match too.
I think the current pytest.mark.skipif(...) is fine - skipping based on the platform in use is actually one of the main examples in the documentation for that.
I'll close this for now, unless anyone wants to discuss it further.  I believe xdist is more if we were managing distributing testing runs manually on our own test runners.  The skipif would still be important even with xdist to decide which tests should run on which system.
