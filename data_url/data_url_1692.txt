Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Unitary CircuitOperations should be possible to wrap in ControlledOperations, just like any other Operation. It's not currently clear whether this is the case, or what behavior to expect when this is attempted.
Describe the solution you'd like
We should test the existing behavior and update as necessary to allow for controlled CircuitOperations. My initial, possibly naive expectations are that such an operation:
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters
@95-martin-orion does this require API changes to ControlledOperation? Marking as before-1.0 for now.

Unclear. It's possible this already works, but I don't know if we've verified. @daxfohl, have you tried this combination?
Basic functionality works. I haven't tried the decompose and such also mentioned in the issue. I'd leave it open.
Also consider adding a has_unitary(sub_op) in the ControlledGate and ControlledOp constructors. Xref #4476
Everything in @95-martin-orion list above works except it doesn't check qubit overlap. (It doesn't do that for other types of sub_operations either). It also works for mixtures. (Should it work for channels too?)
So just need to add the overlap check and some tests. Plausibly there should be a check that there's no measurement in sub_op, if it's not too slow.
Added the above PR to check overlapping. There are already tests for decomposition and such.
Leaving an open question as to whether we want to verify no measurements, or whether channels should work.
(Also, no it doesn't isinstance as a CircuitOperation; it's a ControlledOperation. Not sure I agree that it should isinstance as a circuitop or how to do so if we wanted to.)
IIUC @Strilanc showed that a controlled channel is not well defined. https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/a/12197/14638
So should we add the check for has_mixture(sub_operation) in the ControlledOp constructor? (This would apply to ControlledGate as well).

Yes, I think that's a necessary check. A related observation: cirq.measure(q0, key='m').controlled_by(q1) is currently permitted in circuits, but will crash the simulator. This check would resolve both issues.
