I have identified that the Twitter logo displayed in the footer section of website is outdated, and it is crucial to keep branding up to date with the latest elements provided by Twitter.


New Twitter logo will be used to replace the outdated one in the footer section of our website.
I would like to work on this. Can you assign it to me?
