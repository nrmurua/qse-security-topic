Our Molpro archives have mismatching sha256 hashes, even though they are exactly the same version. They seem to generate the archive , whenever you download it. This is a little bit annoying as it somehow breaks reproducability. Could we maybe make the Molpro sha256 an option in cfg.nix?
Is that case for all versions?
Good question. I cannot verify it for all. It seems at least to be the case since they switched their license model (2 years ago I think?).
I'll try to get to bottom of it.
False alarm, our admin has repacked all archives and this has changed time stamps ...
