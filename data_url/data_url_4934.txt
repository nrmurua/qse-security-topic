Hi,
I would like to build QuEST as a static library in Linux, but it seems like there is no option to choose whether to build a static library or a shared library.
https://github.com/QuEST-Kit/QuEST/blob/master/QuEST/CMakeLists.txt#L293 :
Hi @RIvance!
QuEST already respects the standard flag BUILD_SHARED_LIBS if the user sets it. It only defaults to shared/static (depending on the OS) if BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is not set. So if you want to build a shared lib, you can call
and the build system will create a shared library. Or set it to FALSE to get a static library in any case. If you're using QuEST as a subproject, set the variable in the parent before adding the QuEST directory.
Hope it helps,
Cheers!
