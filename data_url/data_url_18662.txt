Nice ðŸ˜Ž
@ecpeterson should we just clamp *program-name* to the last 40 chars?
That seems reasonable to me, or something like path |-> path[0:5] @ "..." @ path[-(n-32):]. I imagine the start of the path is generally less useful for debugging, but maybe you'd hit some frustrating situation where you wish it would have told you that an initial segment of the path was wildly off.
I like that idea :)
