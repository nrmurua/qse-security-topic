Based on the consensus in #3073, the text drawer should support controlled/conditional custom instructions
Considering the following custom instruction:
It would be possible to control on q_1 and have a classical condition c == 2 and the result should look like this:
Custom controlled instructions are not yet supported (waiting for #2862 ) On the conditional part, I think this is the code to test this situation (not fully sure, because I cannot visualize the result)
Also, it seems like text drawer also have problems with the following configuration:
âœ… Issue still reproducible! Instruction object currently doesn't have an explicit custom control method and conditions with overlapping c_if and q_if drawings are not implemented yet as discussed and voted in Issue #3073. Second comment seems to be fixed but original drawer layout as mentioned by OP not yet implemented.
Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
