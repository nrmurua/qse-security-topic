I inserted gates into my circuit according to InsertStrategy.EARLIEST but after running the ExpandComposite optimization pass it does not look compact anymore. Is this the way to go for this?
I certainly think it's reasonable to have a "shove gates to the left" optimization pass.
I'll open a separate issue for not having the optimization passes create this kind of cruft in the first place.
Presumably this applies to PointOptimization passes?
