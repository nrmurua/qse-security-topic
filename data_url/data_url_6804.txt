A custom gate that was created from a circuit shows that circuit in the mouseover tooltip in the toolbox, but that's really insufficient sometimes. Add a way to open it to explore what it actually is doing.
For bonus points, allow edits made to it to be reflected back to the custom gate's definition in the original circuit.
Especially with the edit feature, the UI/UX for this feature could be approached in many different ways, with varying implementation complexity.
Please don't let the complexity of the "edit" functionality stop you from at least adding the option to view custom gates though.
I keep pushing off doing custom gate editing because I know it will be a giant pain to get it right. But basically the plan I have is for the editing to happen inline within the circuit. Custom gates in the circuit would have an 'edit' button, which would expand them into a gray box containing their contents. You would add/remove contents by either dragging it into and out of the box or by dragging the edges of the box.

Some of the things that I think make this difficult are:
Just expanding so you can view the gates, but not change them, might be a good intermediate goal.

it is impossible to understand the structure of the gate. Low dpi and small picture
I landed on the page for this open issue while trying to learn about Grover's search algorithm. I thought double clicking or right clicking might open the custom Oracle gate in a new circuit. I see the tool tip as captured by @grayskripko
I agree that a larger image in the tool tip would solve the problem for all users.
A user-end workaround is to click the Clear Circuit button and drag in the custom gate, and then examine the URL.
