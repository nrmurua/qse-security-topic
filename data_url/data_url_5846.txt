aer_simulator with save_unitary() instruction gives a segmentation fault when using 16 qubits, while working as expected with 15 qubits. It does not indicate if this is a problem with resource availability (not enough RAM to simulate), or some other problem.
gives:
But:
gives:
If the segmentation fault comes from an error in the simulator, the expected result should be the identity matrix (for this particular circuit) for 16 qubits.
If the segmentation fault stems from missing memory, the expected result would be an error message similar to:

@mhinkie Thank you for your reporting this bug and I'm very sorry that my response is lazy. I'm now trying to reproduce your situation. I guess that we need check codes to verify that memory allocation is succeeded around here.
@hhorii same issue may be happening in #1288, #1289.
