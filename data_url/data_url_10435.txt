Current Problem
When I write code for DWaveSampler, I have to modify the code to use neal instead. For example, no matter which of these I write, the code that follows should never have to change.
Proposed Solution
Have the inputs and outputs of neal match those of DWaveSampler. For example, the argument "anneal_schedule=" should be silently ignored. The output in response.data() should be aggregated like it is in DWaveSampler.
Alternatives Considered
If I want the same code to work with both neal and DWaveSampler, then I would need to make my own wrapper around these. That is a layer of abstraction I would very much like to avoid.
Here is a sample that shows the difference in output:
