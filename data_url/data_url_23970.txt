The way the tests are structured right now makes it difficult to run all of them on an installed version of qiskit-metal.
The way the CI runs the tests is to run
from the top level of the repo. Since qiskit_metal is in the top level (rather than using a src directory), the repo version of qiskit-metal gets imported by Python rather than the one in site-packages.
The tests are actually packaged inside of qiskit_metal.tests, so you can actually run most of the tests against the installed version of qiskit-metal by changing the working directory to something other than the top level of the repo and then running
This will run the tests, but a few of them will fail because they to access qiskit_metal/tests/test_data which is not currently included in the package.
One can also try changing directory into qiskit_metal and running
to avoid importing the repo qiskit_metal but some of the test code has relative imports out of the tests package to other parts of qiskit-metal so this also fails.
The problem is not being able to do something so it is hard to give a reproducer but some possible cases are given above. For testing a solution, one could:
There is a way to run the tests against the installed version of qiskit_metal.
There are a couple options:
