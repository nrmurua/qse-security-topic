Proposal:
Include
qc-toolkit-pulses\matlab\charge_scan_pulse.m
qc-toolkit-pulses\matlab\charge_scan_scan.m
in automated testing to make sure they are not broken by updates.
-Pascal
Automated testing does not and cannot cover matlab scripts. At least as long as we dont want to setup a CI environment ourselves.
-Simon
I will however include the measurement window calculation/extraction in the backward compability tests.
