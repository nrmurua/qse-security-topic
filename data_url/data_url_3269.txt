In v3, a settings.toml file could be loaded that didn't necessarily have every configuration field defined. In this case, the client would get reasonable defaults for those fields. In v4, if the user has a config like this, some fields don't fallback on a default, which can lead to errors that otherwise wouldn't occur.
