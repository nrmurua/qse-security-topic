Two parts to this:
For the second part: hamiltonians.jl determines its list of possible transitions to loop over from the function subleveltransitions in ions.jl. Currently this does not return any pairs of energy sublevels within the same energy level. This portion may simply come down to including those pairs in the return result of subleveltransitions. However it's also possible that we want to avoid doing this unless we need to (e.g. only if a "Microwave" is present in the Hamiltonian).
To do on branch M1-transitions:
