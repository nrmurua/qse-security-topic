If I try to pass a list of circuits to the transpile function I get a pickle error.
It should run in parallel the transpilation

This is very odd, thanks for the report.  Could you check what versions of qiskit_aer and dill you have installed?  As a follow-up, can you try doing:
and see if that produces any output, or a similar error to before?
The dill version is 0.3.6 and qiskit_aer version is 0.13.1.
Ah nice, thanks - I think this might be a bug in the version of dill you have.  If you update dill to 0.3.7 at least, I think hopefully it'll work.
I updated dill and now everything works. Maybe the requirements.txt should be updated to reflect this.
Thank you very much for your help.
Updating the requirement is a shade tricky, because the component that's actually the part failing to serialise here is qiskit_aer starting from version 0.13 (its latest), which doesn't use dill itself and isn't a dependency of Qiskit.
I'm a little hesitant to jump Qiskit's version requirement to "only the exact latest" of dill, when none of our package internals need it; it could easily make us incompatible with other packages if there are unrelated issues in dill 0.3.7 that have caused others to exclude that version.  If this error turns out to be causing lots of people problems we can potentially revisit that, or if dill increase their release cadence, but right now I think it's a little safer for us to trade off in favour of being more open with our requirements.
I'll close the issue as "solved" now, but if there's more, please feel free to open a new issue (or if anybody else sees this with a similar problem, and wants to revisit the dill-dependency question).
