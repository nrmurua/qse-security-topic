There is code released 28 month ago that needs to be removed.
This includes:
Bit.register and Bit.index aren't really ready for removal yet - there's still code in Qiskit that uses them, and we know that there's code in backends and providers that uses them (despite them having issued warnings for years).
Good to know! I'm labelling this on hold. Do you know if there are issues open in those providers?
This is, at least, blocked on:
Any other issue that should be linked here? Either in Qiskit or not?
As I continue discovering instances of Bit.register and Bit.index, I think they can stay in ~=0.45 and be removed in ~=1.0. Setting that milestone for this one.
