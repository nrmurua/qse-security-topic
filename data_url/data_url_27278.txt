While testing some code for the unitary learning tutorial, I was playing around with QuTiP's rand_unitary function.
For a unitary matrix, U:
UU^{\dagger} = I or U^{\dagger}U = I
In QuTiP, if we write rand_unitary(2) * rand_unitary(2).dag() it does not return an Identity matrix. Is this a bug?

I should have fixed U = rand_unitary(2) first because rand_unitary(2) * rand_unitary(2).dag() creates two different unitaries. Closing this.
