When liboqs is built, autoconf outputs config.h, which contains preprocessor defines that state what algorithms are enabled at the variant level; for e.g.: if in the file we have
...
#define OQS_ENABLE_SIG_qTESLA_I 1
/* #define OQS_ENABLE_SIG_qTESLA_III_size*/
 ...
this means qTESLA_I is enabled and qTESLA_III_size is not.
OpenSSH should also be able to enable and disable the use of these algorithms according to the config.h output.
At present in OpenSSH, we disable "by family", i.e. if even one of symbol of the set {OQS_ENABLE_KEM_kyber_512, OQS_ENABLE_KEM_kyber_768, OQS_ENABLE_KEM_kyber_1024} is not defined, then all of Kyber is disabled in OpenSSH.
See open-quantum-safe/openssl#122 (comment).
Won't fix.
