Hello @rchilaka-amzn, thank you for raising this issue. I shall have a look at this and work on a fix.
Should be fixed as of v1.52.0
@krneta ro validate that this issue can be closed.
This is still an issue.
The work around is to not use "angle", but to instead use "float" in the OpenQASM string.
Supporting "angle" would require some work and would need to be added to our backlog. Adding Zia to determine the priority.
angle support fixed in the linked PR to the default simulator.
angle is supported as of v1.19.1 of the default simulator.
