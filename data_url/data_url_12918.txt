The Fredkin gate (CSWAP) can be decomposed into 7 CNOTs (Smolin, 1996). The following program produces 18 CNOTs. Am I misusing the library?
The code:
The output:
No, that is correct. The synthesis algorithm dbs is a generic heuristic, which does not know that the given permutation is a Fredkin gate in this case. It does not optimise for CNOT count. For the Fredkin gate one could try using algorithms such as SAT-based CNOT+Rz synthesis described in this paper. For this technique one needs to first break down the gate into a phase polynomial representation + H gates.
