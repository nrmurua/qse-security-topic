The following circuit + backend + transpiler (optim level =3) combo:
fails with the error:

TranspilerError: 'Maximum iteration reached. max_iteration=1000'
It only fails for level 3.
I'm not currently able to replicate this on master. (A similar issue was recently fixed in #5583 .)
Can you define a callback like:
re-run transpile(..., callback=callback) and post the log?
I should point out it is also stochastic in it failure.  More often than not though
callback.txt
If it is fixed in Master than feel free to close.  Can re-open if need be.
Thanks, this should fixed by #5583 and will be included in the next patch release. Feel free to re-open if this persists.
Hi! After updating qiskit-terra from 0.16.1 to 0.16.2 I started getting
TranspilerError: 'Maximum iteration reached. max_iteration=1000'
when transpiling my own circuit in optimization level 3. Level 2 passes through just fine. Also, hitting the max iteration seems to be device-dependent. E.g., transpiling onto ibmq_manhattan yields the error, but ibmq_16_melbourne does not.
@ishapoval can you open a new issue with a recreate scenario. 0.16.2 included a backport of the fix for this original issue (#5583 and it's backport #5585) so I suspect something else might be causing the failure for you, but I'll need to dig into it to be sure.
@mtreinish Thanks for the prompt reply! Unfortunately, I can't post my circuit at this point and I didn't manage to reproduce the problem with a simpler scenario. My circuit is parametrized, and while in 0.16.1 it could be transpiled for all my parameters, in 0.16.2 it doesn't transpile for some of them. I narrowed down the problem to the difference in RZZGate angle. Another observation is that if I dump that offending circuit to the QASM string and construct a new circuit back from that string then it can be successfully transpiled. I will open a new issue if I have enough details to reliably reproduce the case in a simple scenario.
