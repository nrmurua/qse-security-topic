Currently only .png is supported, while SVG output for example is very useful for web-based visualisation. This can be done in latex_config.py by adding a new setting for output type.
I have a quick implementation for this that works nicely. Add a new setting:
settings['document'] = ({'density' : 300, 'outext': '.png'})
And then modify header as:
@HassanNaseri would you like to take a stab at implementing this feature?
In your quick implementation above, the snippet settings['document'] = ({'density' : 300, 'outext': '.png'}) has PNG in it, did you intend to put SVG there?
