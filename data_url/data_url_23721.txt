@MerlinSmiles  right now  we are limiting the set to 8 digits (https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/instrument_drivers/tektronix/Keithley_2600.py#L23)
Afaik it can go to to 12 digits. Do you confirm ?
@giulioungaretti no hardware around in this train, try it out? stupid mistake if it can go to 12 digits.
@MerlinSmiles

Let me know if you agree with the way I read the manual ðŸ“„
@giulioungaretti looks very reasonable. Could you check if you can send 12 digits when in >1A range? And also how many digits do you get back when reading (in large and small range)?
