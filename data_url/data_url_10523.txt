Current Problem
It is not obvious how to find what is the exact architecture of the existing D-Wave machines and how to express it using chimera_graph method.
Proposed Solution
Chimera graphs of the existing machines could be added as separate methods. A dwave_machines.py file could be added with definitions of graphs of D-Wave 2X, D-Wave 2000Q and possibly also proposed Pegasus machines.
It could include the hardware impurities.
Alternatives Considered
Alternatively, there could be information in readme about architectures implemented in hardware.
This is a good idea, I think my preference would be to only encode this information in documentation, @JoelPasvolsky ?
For now
I made a PR: #77
