Spectrum analyser is not starting due to depreciation of fftpack in numpy >1.17:
"NumPyâ€™s FFT implementation was changed from fftpack to pocketfft, resulting in faster, more accurate transforms and better handling of datasets of prime length. See below under Improvements."

my settings
active environment : pyrpl-env
active env location : /opt/anaconda3/envs/pyrpl-env
conda version : 4.8.3
conda-build version : 3.18.11
python version : 3.7.6.final.0
numpy                     1.18.5           py38h1da2735_0
numpy-base                1.18.5           py38h3304bdc_0
Solution:
forcing numpy <1.17
moving to pocketfft: personally I'll try this and maybe submit a PR if it work
a proposition of fix but it's not backward compatible with old numpy...

Thanks so much! I implemented your fix, and will soon merge it into master!
