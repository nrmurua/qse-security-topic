The extra [] are from the tag, I think
xref #2719
This is when you add the noise to the circuit?  I think that should remove the tags.
Interestingly, this is more broken than I first thought. In the terminal it displays as
but the <virtual> tags are interpreted as badly formed html tags in e.g. Jupyter notebook and are not displayed. In the SVGCircuit implementation, the virtual tag hides the closing ]
For physical versus virtual Z gates, clearly seeing the tag is important.  But for noice, I'm not sure this is correct, and as I say in #2984 I don't think we should reuse virtual in this form for noise.  It is re-using a tag for no real reason.
Based on the above, the "virtual" specifier probably gets eaten in jupyter notebook for virtual Z gates then
The behavior has changed. It now does D(0.001)[cirq.VirtualTag()]
I'm contributing a hack in https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/3076/files#diff-d949b9f3211c62c5defeb9f7d1439416R16 which should be reverted after this is fixed

Is this still relevant @mpharrigan ?
The notebook isn't broken, but it's still pretty cluttery
