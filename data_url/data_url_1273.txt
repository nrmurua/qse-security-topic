Description of the issue
When generating a lockfile via pip-compile (https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) in my own Python package that lists Cirq as a dependency, I got this error
It looks like cirq and cirq-google have conflicting protobuf requirement.
How to reproduce the issue
As described above. Here is my command
Cirq version
1.0.0
pip install cirq works as expected; also pip install cirq-google and pip install cirq-core works.
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/search?l=Text&q=protobuf also shows that only cirq-google has a dependency on protobuf.
The above implies that cirq and cirq-google probably don't have a conflicting dependency. Maybe the project that you are compiling for has a conflicting requirement? Maybe you can print the installed packages in your virtual environment using pip freeze ?
Sorry for not providing a minimal reproducer earlier. Here it is:
requirements.txt
Hence the command is pip-compile -o requirements.lock requirements.txt, ran on a fresh empty virtualenv.
pip-compile version: pip-compile, version 6.9.0 (latest release).
pip freeze of my fresh virtualenv:
pip-compile may have a stricter constraint requirement than just pip install. It is one of the 4 most commonly used way to generate a lockfile (the other being pip freeze you mentioned, and then pipenv, poetry), and so people are likely to encounter this issue in the future.

It seems to be specific to cirq-google
