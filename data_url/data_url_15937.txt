The output of QuantumCircuit.draw('latex_source') not standalone, creating a full page. This creates an effect of a lot of spacing around it (like in here https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/17573/saving-vectorized-circuits-in-qiskit ). Additionally, many of the output code is not necessary and might look intimidating:
Currently, this is the output:
It would be great if could look more like this:
I'm aware that qcircuit and standalone do not play well together. However, I still thing would it be possible to hack the way around while waiting for a solution in that front. For example (I did not test this solution extensibly), this code produces this image (which is correctly cropped):

Hi! Can I work on this one?
Hi @1ucian0! Don't you think that #2015 should be fixed/discussed beforehand? Adding to the arguments discussed there, I never had any problem using standalone with quantikz.
@JoshDumo assigning you!
@tnemoz #2015 seems stalled to me and, even if the outcome of that discussion is to change to quantikz in the future, I don't see that happening any time soon. So, in that context and for the sake of avoiding blockers, I think moving forward here is easier.
@1ucian0 In that case, would you mind if I were to work in this direction (that is, switching from qcircuit to quantikz)? Or do you prefer to wait for this issue to be closed?
A discussion for #2015 ðŸ™ƒ
