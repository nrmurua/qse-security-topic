Sparse and Clifford both have a proper ActOnXXXStateArgs where they maintain simulator state, and those are explicitly checked throughout the cirq codebase with isinstance checks that alter behavior of different operations depending on the args. This was first added in #3019 with the act_on protocol.
DensityMatrix and MPS both have self-contained state (_StateAndBuffers and MPSState, respecively).
Should we change it to be consistent?

Sure, the TLDR of the discussion was:
