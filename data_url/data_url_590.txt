The current documentation at https://xacc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers.html#quick-start-for-ornl-developers doesn't cover the case where one needs to set up Theia manually.
It'd be nice to put together a simple step-by-step guide for this case, e.g. install node.js, which package.json file to use, install clangd and configure buildConfigurations, etc.
