The tutorial: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/noise/3_measurement_error_mitigation.ipynb
fails when using Terra master
I think this was already fixed on ignis master with: #400 (well really #401 but that's because I had to inline it to fix ci, the PR summary on 400 is better)
Oh yeah your correct, my install was picking up the old 0.3 rather than the master I just installed.
