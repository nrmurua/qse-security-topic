When initializing a state in Qiskit using e.g. qc.initialize(vector_list), where vector_list is a Python list, the function expects that the complex probability amplitudes in the list will be normalized. Therefore if the user wishes to initialize a state they need to do the normalization calculation for the probability amplitudes for the vector_list passed to the initialize function.
I propose a Qiskit feature that will create an N-qubit normalized state consisting of real probability amplitudes by taking a list of (unnormalized) real weights provided by the user. This can be used by the user to create real amplitude normalized superposition states and entangled states.
@taalexander / @lcapelluto  : you have helped me in the past to fix issues. Can you please guide us, How to go enhance this behaviour ? unless @daniel-fry  who created this issue knows ?
I have a good idea how to code a normalization function (for real probability amplitudes) but I need to know more about where this function would fit within Qiskit. Maybe it could be an inner function of the initialize function triggered by an argument normalize='True'. It could first check for real weights in the passed list.

I think this sounds reasonable @daniel-fry

@taalexander Thanks for getting back to me. Should I start implementing this?
Please do go ahead ðŸ™‚. When a draft PR is ready please notify me and I will review.
Hi @taalexander can you assign this to me please. Thanks!
