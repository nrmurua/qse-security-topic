Hi, as shown in the following full dependency graph of simulaqron, simulaqron requires twisted>=20.3.0,<21.0.0, simulaqron requires CQC-Python >=3.2.2 (CQC-Python 3.2.2 will be installed, i.e., the newest version satisfying the version constraint), and directed dependency CQC-Python 3.2.2 transitively introduces twisted >=20.3.0,<21.0.0.
Obviously, there are multiple version constraints set for twisted in this project. However, according to pip's “first found wins” installation strategy, twisted 20.3.0 (i.e., the newest version satisfying constraint >=20.3.0,<1.3.0) is the actually installed version.
Although the first found package version twisted 20.3.0 just satisfies the later dependency constraint （twisted>=20.3.0,<21.0.0), such installed version is very close to the upper bound of the version constraint of twisted specified by CQC-Python 3.2.2.
Once CQC-Python upgrades，its newest version will be installed, as simulaqron does not specify the upper bound of version constraint for CQC-Python. Therefore, it will easily cause a dependency conflict (build failure), if the upgraded CQC-Python version introduces a higher version of twisted, violating its another version constraint >=20.3.0,<1.3.0.
According to the release history of CQC-Python, it habitually upgrates Twisted in its recent releases. For instance, CQC-Python 3.1.0 upgrated Twisted’s constraint from >=18.7.0 to >=19.7.0,<20.0.0, and CQC-Python 3.2.2 upgrated Twisted’s constraint from >=19.7.0,<20.0.0 to >=20.3.0,<21.0.0.
As such, it is a warm warning of a potential dependency conflict issue for simulaqron.
Thanks for your help.
Best,
Neolith
@AckslD，Could you help me review this issue? Thx :p
Hello @NeolithEra, sorry for being so late in replying. Maybe the best would be to make an upper bound on the version of CQC-Python, i.e. less than 4.0.0.
@NeolithEra There is actually an upper bound for cqc. Would you still see an issue?
Closing this since there was no response
