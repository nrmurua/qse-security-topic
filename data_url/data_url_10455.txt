Description
Division by zero occurring during beta_range calculation for some edge-case BQMs.
To Reproduce
output:
Note inf in beta_range due to max_delta_energy = 0.
Additional context
Looks like the bug was introduced in the latest version, v0.4.3, with pull request #42, or more precisely in commit #12f176, in process of tightening the bound for max_delta_energy.
