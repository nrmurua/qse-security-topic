inside of simulator_sse and simlator_avx the worker functions we have are:
Which then gets called in a parallel manner. Do we have any idea how many CPU cycles or nanoseconds this function needs in order to finish executing once ?
What is end-start roughly equal to ?
If there are no cache misses and branch mispredictions then it typically takes from 46 to 52 CPU cycles to execute f once in ApplyGate2HH in simlator_avx and from 76 to 88 CPU cycles in ApplyGate2HH in simulator_sse. Those worker functions have to be inlined.
Thx!
