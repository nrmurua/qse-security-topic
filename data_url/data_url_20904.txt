We should write a tool that checks the META.yml files for a) the presence of the fields that we expect people to enter and b) the values to make sense. It's probably easiest to do this in Python.
This is a followup from #2 and I expect an initial 'specification' to follow from writing this tool. This is the kind of job I could do in an afternoon where I don't feel like doing actual research.
