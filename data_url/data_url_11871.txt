The random circuit generator has been floating around qiskit in the form of a script. I encountered it in the Qiskit developer challenge.
I'd suggest adding such a random circuit generator to Aqua. It can be used for testing and for benchmarking. I prefer the first variant, since the depth is somewhat guaranteed. The parameter depth in the latter variant is somewhat of a misnomer since the output circuit does not have the given depth.
Personally, I've been using it in my mapper project (related to the Developer Challenge) to see how well the mapper performs on "Random" circuits. As it turns out, random circuits as generated by this tool are quite different from the circuits for other quantum algorithms.
I would agree with this idea. Random circuits are an important class of circuits that will be used in the near term on quantum devices (think Quantum Volume and Quantum Supremacy experiments).
The "application" would be benchmarking. It will use Terra underneath to generate circuits, just like other circuits generated by Aqua.
Actually, at Jay's suggestion, this will be best in Ignis when it comes out. Random circuits for Quantum Volume, Randomized Benchmarking, etc. It fits better with the description of Ignis as opposed to Aqua.
For now I'll move the random generator we have under qiskit/test/benchmarking for qiskit-terra benchmarking purposes, but eventually it will just call to Ignis.
As this is better suited to Ignis I am closing this issue here.
