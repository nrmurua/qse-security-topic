This file can reproduce the error.
knn_n41_compiled.txt
It is a short circuit with many ccx gates, which might make it hard to partition.
Can you check if the 1.1.1 branch fixes this?
Yes, it fixes the problem with compiled knn_n41_compiled.txt where the gate set is {cx,sx,x,rz}
However, if a raw knn_n41.qasm is used as input, it still pops the frontier bug.
knn_n41.txt
This raw knn_n41.qasm contains CSWAP gates.
I noticed that the line to fix the problem is
Maybe a three-qubit gate could not be handled by this line.
As discussed, this has been fixed with the recent 1.1.1 branch. Thanks for the bug report
