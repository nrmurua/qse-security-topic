When build with 0.5.0 code on Ubuntu 18.04
BUT, the compilation works with main branch code.
This is actually not about OPENSSL_NO_EC2M---it's that your CMake doesn't have target_link_options. You should be able to compile the 0.5.0 branch with CMake 3.13.5 or later. The main branch is no longer using target_link_options and can be compiled with CMake 3.5 or later.
@jhfeng do you have a specific need for Ubuntu 18? CI moved to Ubuntu 20 and that also has a more current cmake. Nevertheless @jschanck's comment is right in that that dependency on a more current cmake is gone (for now) and that this has nothing to do with NO_EC2M. Suggest to close or rename the issue.
Thanks @jschanck @baentsch, I can close the issue. yes, I need run the bits on ubuntu 18 at this time. With change on target_link_options in next release. I'm fine with it.
