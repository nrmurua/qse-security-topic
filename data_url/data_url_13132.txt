I have a WIP PR (#1963). I know it is failing 'validate' because I have ignored to account for type checking.
Even then, all of the non-linux Windows tests are failing with a similar message across all of them. Is this unrelated to the PR and should be ignored for now?

Edit: Tried a bunch of different fetch depth options. All of them led to the Windows draft build failing. Why does the build for mac pass but fail for windows?
Edit2: If fetch_depth = 2, mac build passes but windows build fails. If fetch_depth = 0, windows build passes while mac build fails. I think this is unrelated to my current PR.
I followed this answer on StackOverflow to set fetch_depth = 0.

Easy option to fix this issue : split test-nonlinux-draft into test-non-linux-draft-mac with fetch_depth = 2 and test-non-linux-draft-windows with fetch_depth=0.
