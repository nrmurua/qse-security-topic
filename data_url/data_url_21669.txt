ARTIQ 5 packages are not available anywhere via Conda
Conda packages for ARTIQ 5, not just ARTIQ-6 (artiq-beta) should be available now that ARTIQ 5 has been released.
Presumably related to #1326 . #1326 never stated that stable packages for a specific release wouldn't be available.
Further, instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-labs/artiq/master/install-with-conda.py only point to the https://conda.m-labs.hk/artiq-beta channel, which means if it is not there then it's not available/unsupported/undocumented.
Also, the conda.m-labs.hk/artiq-beta implies that any conda packages installed from there are only BETA, if there is a stable channel it's not documented.
Further, instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-labs/artiq/master/install-with-conda.py only point to the https://conda.m-labs.hk/artiq-beta channel,
But commands from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-labs/artiq/release-5/install-with-conda.py, which is correctly linked in the release-5 docs contrary to what you imply, point to the other channel.
