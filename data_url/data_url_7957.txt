The documentation of the StochasticSolverOptions class states that the average_states option can be passed through the options keyword and that it will be used:
options:
Generic solver options. Only options.average_states and options.store_states are used.
However, it does not seem that this option is working when passed to ssesolve, i.e., the states are never averaged. I attach an example code to reproduce the behaviour.
I expect the states to be averaged over when the average_states option is passed.

Thank you for reporting.
Right now, the average states is only computed when both options.average_states and options.store_states are set.
ssesovle average states as ket, not dm...
The fix is in #2217.
Fixed in 4.7.3
