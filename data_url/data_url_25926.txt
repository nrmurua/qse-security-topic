in # Executing Circuit section
The qjobs are missing arguments ("shots"=50).
The problem is, when executing without specifying 'shots', the code result in an error:
which does not tell you that the real problem is missing shot counts.
@Z035 Thanks for opening this issue! I tried to recreate the error using the AWS SV1 device
but instead got the following:
Which quantum device were you targeting when this happened?
@Z035 Ahh, ok I was able to re-produce! The problem occurred when I tried submitting the task through the qBraid-SDK and through the Amazon Braket SDK directly. So it seems like this bug is caused by the order of error-handling in the qBraid Quantum Jobs API.
I will open the necessary issue in the private qBraid API repository and close this issue when it is resolved. Thanks!
