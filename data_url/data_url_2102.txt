Interestingly the failing test is the same as the one at #2468 .
Is this the same as #2617? The Travis link you reference above looks like it passed, so I couldn't tell.
This looks like a dupe of #2468 to me, so closing. I put up a PR to mark the offending test as xfail so this doesn't block other PRs: #2630.
