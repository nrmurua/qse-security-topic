Currently only positive edge weights are supported in matching graphs, owing to the Dijkstra subroutine (and switching to Bellman-Ford wouldn't help with negative cycles). But negative weights can be supported by flipping edges with negative weights first, before using the updated weights and syndrome to decode.
Note about negative weights also added to the PyMatching paper (will be in the next arxiv version)
