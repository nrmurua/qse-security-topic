Here is an error I receive while running the circuits_1_basis_change notebook tutorial.  Other tutorials produce the same error.
Thank you.
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

What versions of Python, Cirq and Openfermion are you running?
I performed the developer installation of OpenFermion several hours ago using:
git clone https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion
cd OpenFermion
python -m pip install -e .
Python version is 3.8.5, as chosen by the conda environment I created for this, I presume.
For Cirq, if I have this it is the version that would come upon the above installation.  I did not explicitly add or install cirq.  I did notice that some of the circuit mapping outputs in the tutorials worked ok, if that is an indication.  (The stated error in the initial post is the only error I have encountered.)
Perhaps there is a non-development version that would be better for me? For now, I am going to use OpenFermion in a course project. (I will eventually want to try using OF for proper academic studies of 'single molecule magnet'-type systems)
Thank you very much for your response.
Hi Henry,  could you post the exact code here if you are still having this issue?
Okay I got to the bottom of this.  The problem is that openfermion is pinned to Cirq.0.8. WaveFunctionTrialResult had an attribute final_state which in TrialSimulationResult is final_state_vector.  A bunch of stuff has moved under us so I am going to bump the version of cirq we are pinning.
#684 fixes this.
