When submitting jobs and querying for their status (in run_qobj() in qiskit/ustils/run_circuits.py), a call is made to job.error_message() whenever the job's status is an error:
               elif job_status == JobStatus.ERROR: logger.warning( "FAILURE: Job id: %s encounters the error. " "Error is : %s. Re-submit the Qobj.", job_id, job.error_message(), )
However this function is not part of the Job or JobV1 metaclasses, therefore not a requirement to any job-classes inheriting from JobV1, causing their execution to fail ungracefully.
Execute a job that returns the status JobStatus.ERROR.
The execution should fail gracefully, with the warning printed to the user.
Add the error_message function as an abstract method to the JobV1 class.
