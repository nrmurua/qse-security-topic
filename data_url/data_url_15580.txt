The unroller fails when decomposing a Hadamard gate to Rx and Ry rotations. The following exception is thrown
The code snippet above should run without exceptions and the resulting circuit qc_unrolled should look something like
Interestingly, if you try to achieve the same goal with the transpile function it will work fine:
No response
I think what you're looking for is the BasisTranslator, not the Unroller.
The Unroller only decomposes the gates in a circuit until only gates in your specified set remain. That means it can replace a gate with its definition (specified by the Gate.definition attribute). But the Unroller it does not translate any gate to another set of gates. For example, HGate is decomposed to U2(0, Ï€) which is further decomposed into U3(Ï€/2,0,Ï€). But it cannot transform HGate into RXGate and RYGate, thats what the BasisTranslator does. See also https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/C7SS31917/p1643281091040600 for a thread on this topic.
That being said, the error being raised here doesn't seem very helpful and we should update that ðŸ™‚
I see, thanks! Will give the BasisTranslator a try.
So if it just the error message that needs to be updated then I guess this issue becomes the same as #7182.
Yes, I agree ðŸ™‚
