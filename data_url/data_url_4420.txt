Describe the bug
Running pip install qibo on an M1 Mac raises the following error:
Additional context
This problem arises due to the dependency with the nlopt package (see link).
I realised that this package is only used in one place: 
It would be nice to consider making nlopt an optional dependency.
Thanks @AlbertMitjans, we have already discussed about the possibility to drop nlopt in #814.
@AlejandroSopena suggestions?
Just half an hour ago I tried to install qibo on an M1 Mac and encountered the same issue. I was planning to mention it tomorrow at the meeting. As a temporary solution, I removed nlopt from the requirements to install it. I use nlopt because it has the DIRECT optimization method that works well for the problem of learning noise. I just found out that this method is already included in the latest stable version of scipy, so we can use it from there. As soon as I can (I'll try to do it today), I'll make the change.
Thanks for the quick response! ðŸ™Œ
