I have noticed the following issue affecting the GetObject gRPC API.
Immediately after sending a transaction into the network, and receiving confirmation it's now in a block, I am able to run GetObject by sending the transaction hash and receive a response.
Shortly after (maybe 30 seconds), I start to see the following error on the node for about 30 seconds if I continually try and request the transaction hash.
Shortly after this again (maybe another 30 seconds), it responds as normal.
This issue is no longer present. Closing.
