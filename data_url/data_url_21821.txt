On Windows, 64 bit, ARTIQ 3.6, the following experiment fails to compile stating that 'seconds_to_mu' is not bound to anything
The exact error given by ARTIQ is:
seconds_to_mu also appears to not work in a host method.  The experiment below throws the exception
This is now self.core.seconds_to_mu.
@klickverbot thank you.
