This makes more sense than LineQubit.range in contexts where connectivity is not linear.
NamedQubit.range("a", 5) would return [NamedQubit("a0"), NamedQubit("a1"), NamedQubit("a2"), NamedQubit("a3"), NamedQubit("a4")]
What about making the prefix optional, so that NamedQubit.range(5) returns [NamedQubit("0"), NamedQubit("1"), NamedQubit("2"), NamedQubit("3"), NamedQubit("4")]?
What use case did you have in mind where that would be useful?
A case I'm worried about is that NamedQubit.range(n) returns qubits that are impossible to tell apart from LineQubit.range(n) in circuit diagrams. Not necessarily bad, probably not common, but perhaps something to avoid making easy to do.
I think that if we're using "range" then it's more intuitive to match the syntax of the built-in. Maybe we could have a default prefix, perhaps "q". I don't feel strongly about this.
Why not use string.ascii_lowercase instead?
That's an interesting idea; just go a, b, c, ..., z, aa, ab, ... instead of numbering. Does feel more natural to the use case.
