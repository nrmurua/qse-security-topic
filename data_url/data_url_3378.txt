Hello,
I can't find a way to do adaptive measurements. More precisely, I'd like to be able to measure partially my quantum state, and depending on the output of the measurement I would like to apply different subsequent circuits. Did I miss something? If not, would it be possible to implement it?
Thanks!
If you only want to simulate programs on a QVM, then take a look at the classical control flow section of the docs. If you want to run on a real QPU, then I think you need to handle the classical control flow parts yourself in Python, but I am not certain about that.
Also, if you don't need to run a completely different circuit, but just want to vary some parameters, check out the parametric compilation docs.
Closing for now. Feel free to reopen if the above docs links didn't resolve your issue @tobiasBora.
