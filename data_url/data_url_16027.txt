Error shows upon importing qiskit
Just re-pip install Terra ðŸ™‚ If you initially installed from source using the editable setting (pip install -e .) then you usually just have to pull to have the latest changes. However, if there are changes in the Cython files, you have to re-compile Terra by explicitly calling pip install (-e .) again.
That's exactly what I was facing. re-pip install did solve the problem. Thanks for the prompt reply!
