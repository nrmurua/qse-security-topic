A protocol because we want to be able to provide efficient decomposition without doing all the hard numerical math?
Related to #1071.
This would be to speed up KAK decomposition in known cases. Instead of relying on the generic KAK decomposition algorithm which is slow, this would provide predefined shortcuts for the decomposition algorithm.
closing, will track on #1071
