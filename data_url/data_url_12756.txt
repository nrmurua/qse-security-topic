In #478 we migrated to the new way of marking Q# unit tests using @Test attribute (compared to the old way that involved a C# wrapper calling certain Q# operations). This means that we're no longer restricted by the inconvenience of directing different tests in one kata to run on different simulators. In multiple cases there are only one or two tasks in a kata which require CounterSimulator, the rest can be executed on QuantumSimulator.
We can use this to check which tasks actually require counting operations or allocated qubits and which tasks don't, and migrate the ones that don't require either from @Test("Microsoft.Quantum.Katas.CounterSimulator") to @Test("QuantumSimulator").
Here is an approximate list of the katas and tutorials with tasks that can be migrated:
@tcNickolas, I would like to work on this issue.
Hi @Manvi-Agrawal,
Great to hear, go ahead! If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask.
