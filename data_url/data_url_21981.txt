Independent Issue for tracking this feature of MMC. in followup to sinara-hw/sinara#358 (comment).

It seems I have to add Exar chip status reporting over UART. In this way we would know what was reason of the failure - undervoltage, overvoltage, overcurrent, etc.
I already added a feature that dumps Ethernet PHY content via UART, so will add Exar support as well.
Register dump is initiated by front panel button.

It would be better if this can be triggered by some computer-controlled event, e.g. something being received on the UART.

It dumps interesting  Exar  registers and Ethernet registers on request
Ethernet PHY dump is initiated by 'E' character, Exar register redout can be done by 'P' character.
Here is example dump

Sorry. I put this in artiq by accident. Moved here sinara-hw/sinara#485.
