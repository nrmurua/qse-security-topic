In PR #4444, an automatic unroll of open controlled gates was added. This change was inserted into Unroller and UnrollCustomDefinitions classes. It was meant to solve issue #4437, reporting a bug about simulating open CX gates.
I wondered, do we still need this special case conditional? I checked what happens if the conditional is removed. Seems like the simulations work just fine:
This removal can enable more specific circuit transpilations. I.e. if the user doesn't want to unroll open controlled gates.
For example, the following code ends up with an error message:
Off a cursory glance, this looks like a suggestion we should implement - the original issue in #4437 was that at the time, we gave all cx gates the same name, even if they had different controls.  That meant that we were lying to Aer about what the gate was meant to be.  However, since #5688 the gates have different names, so should naturally undergo the correct basis translation.
There is a problem, though, that these sorts of non-|11...1> controlled gates end up needing an exponential number of names to be added to the basis, if a backend supports arbitrary control states.  That's not really ideal at all, and with the ctrl and negctrl modifiers coming to OpenQASM 3, we might need a better way of representing this type of gate in the fairly near future.
