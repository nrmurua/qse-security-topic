Consider the following example code that runs QPE repeatedly (choice of circuit is of no consequence, the same is observable for other circuits, including QAOA):
The code crashes with the following output:
Occasionally, I get a different error message for the same crash:
You can confirm that the reason OMP fails to create threads at (roughly) 200th iteration is memory leak by running memory_profiler:

Run the above code.
No memory is leaked.
N/A
Note: this issue is observed with 36 threads on Intel Xeon E5-2695v4 on Bebop cluster
Thanks for the information @rsln-s, we will look into it.
I cannot reproduce this behavior on OSX or a Raspberry Pi.
Hi, I confirm this memory increase. We need to set max_workers for ThreadPoolExecution function to solve this issue. I will create this PR soon.
For the record, here is my OSX results where the number of threads was constant at 321, and the memory was limited to ~160mb:

And here is my PI result:
