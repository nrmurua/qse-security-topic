The circuit shown below can be translated into OpenQASM successfully,but there exists two rzx gates.The one and only difference between two rzx gates is the parameter of rz gate,one is -pi/4,and another is pi/4.
Here is the error message.
An expected OpenQASM code about QuantumCircuit.ecr is something like this.
No response
Thanks for the report.  Sorry this is a bit bugged out - we have some problems with the OQ 2 exporter when dealing with gates that can take arbitrary parameters but are only used with exact angles, as you've seen.
I unfortunately can't promise that this will be a top priority for the internal team because we're busy with a lot of new features for OpenQASM 3.0 support, but we'd be happy to accept PRs from other people about this issue.
I have a fix for this which is just to include RZX as an atomic gate in qelib1.inc. Is this a suitable approach?
For linking purposes, I gave the reason we can't add rzx to qelib1.inc here #8534 (review).
