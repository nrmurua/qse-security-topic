For whatever reason, I've started to get
stim-src/src/stim/dem/detector_error_model.cc:340:35: error: ‘numeric_limits’ is not a member of ‘std’
If others have had this problem, would it be worth just importing limits to detector_error_model.cc?
We've also been experiencing this failure. +1 for importing <limits> directly.
