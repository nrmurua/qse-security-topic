Combine the benefits of both (openfermion-cirq's allows raising to a power; cirq's has a decomposition that avoids adjacency issues).
Indeed, OpenFermion-Cirq uses a naive decomposition that should be improved. Perhaps @YZNIU can help with this!
The current CCZ doesn't have powering.  Do we really want that?  It just does a default decompse into CNOT and T.
