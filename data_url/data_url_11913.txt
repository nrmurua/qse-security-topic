Following the qiskit tutorial exactly Tutorial , I'm getting the error
AttributeError: 'Estimator' object has no attribute 'draw'
Just follow the tutorial as it is, no change in any code blocks
The code should run without any output.
The vqe.py file asks for
if self.ansatz is not None: --> ret += "{}".format(self.ansatz.draw(output="text"))
this draw is somehow not attributed in the Estimator class.

The tutorial has this below to import VQE (this is the new Estimator based VQE)
from qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers import VQE
your code above is
from qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigen_solvers import VQE
which is importing an older VQE from minimum_eigen_solvers (which is being deprecated in the upcoming release) where there is an _ in eigen_solvers which the newly located VQE does not have. If you correct the import, so it matches the tutorial, then it will work.
If you look at the old VQE signature its,
class VQE(ansatz=None, optimizer=None, initial_point=None, gradient=None, expectation=None, include_custom=False, max_evals_grouped=1, callback=None, quantum_instance=None)
where you end up passing an estimator instance, where its expecting an ansatz circuit, and it seems the result is the issue you see.
I will go ahead and close this in the absence of any feedback. The above should have solved your issue, in that you need to use the same VQE as the tutorial uses - there is the older legacy one, which I imagine you accidentally used, and the newer primitive based one that uses an Estimator.
