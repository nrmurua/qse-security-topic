I encounter an error running $ make.py -X ~/artiq-dev/artiq/soc -t artiq all following the instructions  here
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/doc/manual/installing.rst
The layout of artiq-dev on my machine is the following.
I suspect that you didn't check out the libcompiler-rt.
Do so by typing:
svn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk compiler-rt
in ~/artiq-dev/misoc/
Compiler-rt is installed. I put it into ~/artiq-dev and set the environment variable as in the README for MISOC.
$ export CRTDIR=~/artiq-dev/compiler-rt
You were right. It was a simple libcompiler-rt problem. I was using sudo to run make.py but setting the environment variable as user rabi. To fix this I've added the following to /etc/bash.bashrc
CRTDIR=/home/rabi/artiq-dev/compiler-rt
MSCDIR=/home/rabi/artiq-dev/misoc
