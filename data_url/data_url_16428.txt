The return from the latex_to_text call when the text comes from params that went through pi_check and contain pi is odd. Here are the ascii/unicode values from the return from the call with text = $-$$\pi$/2, $-$$\pi$/2, $-$$\pi$/2
45 10 32 32 32 32 960 47 50 44 45 10 960 47 50 44 32 45 10 32 32 32 32 960 47 50
Note the 10s (linefeed) and 32s (spaces). These seem to be arbitrarily thrown into the string and are somewhat random. No idea why. This affects the text width calc since this adds width. Note the 3rd gate below.
In addition the math mode minus sign is about twice the width of the hyphen that is used in pi_check, and is about the same width as the + sign. So replacing the hyphen with a + for the width calc will help as well.
Finally, the character that replaces non-ascii chars such as pi is a bit too small. Hence the tight spacing on the 2nd and 4th gates below.

The obvious thing to do is to remove the 10s and 32s, replace the hyphen with a +, and make the default char larger. Note that the 32s always follow a 10, so if we remove 10 32 32 32 32 first and then any additional 10s, it should not affect other text. Of course, since we don't know why this stuff is there, this could change in a future release of latex_to_text, but this shouldn't do any serious harm in that case. Doing this produces,
