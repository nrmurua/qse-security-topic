Description of the issue
In file docs/tutorials/educators/intro.ipynb, section Exercise: Custom Controlled Rx gate, the exercise requires you to customize a controlled Rx gate. The solution code provided for the exercise is
If you run this solution code, it will return
which is not a unitary matrix.
This is because of the use of function np.around without specifying number of decimals:
so it will round the decimal to one digit.
Cirq version
0.10.0
Thank you for catching this.
I've renamed the title as the solution of the exercise is correct (i.e. the custom CRx gate defined is correct) but printing the unitary matrix of this custom gate has a rounding error.
