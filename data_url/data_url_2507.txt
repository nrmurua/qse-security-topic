But note that this field doesn't exist on windows, so we need to do a check in a way that won't fail when np.complex256 doesn't exist (e.g. by using getattr)
@95-martin-orion Can you mark this as pre/post 1.0?
Actually just going to close this - experiments since this was posted indicate that increasing float precision (beyond single precision) does not significantly improve simulation fidelity.
