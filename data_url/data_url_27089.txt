nuSQUIDSpy CrossSectionLibrary is not found and ModuleError is thrown, handling it falls to search for the file /xsec/nusigma_ which is not present in the specified directory, the files present are nusigma_proton.h5 and nusigma_neutron.h5. This requires the CrossSectionLibrary and the addTarget feature to work. The boost python bindings in nuSQUIDSpy.cpp shows a suspicious TODO comment saying "Map constructor?". Please help on this.




Hi @MondalSagnik, I'm sorry we lost track of this for so long!
Are you still seeing this problem? Without using charon, I'm not able to reproduce this issue:
It looks like there might be (have been) something wrong with your or charon's imports, as the CrossSectionLibrary is exposed as expected in the nuSQuIDS module. You can ignore the comments about the map constructor, as the code you're using is trying default-construct an empty library, not construct one from an existing or literal map/dictionary.
