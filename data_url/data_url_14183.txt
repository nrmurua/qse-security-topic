My understanding is that a "nonlocal" gate typically refers to a gate that involves qubits that are not connected on the hardware graph. The method QuantumCircuit.num_nonlocal_gates actually computes the number of multi-qubit gates, so it should be called num_multiqubit_gates. The source code for the function even uses multi_qubit_gates for the variable name.

I agree multiqubit would be more precise. However, looking at this function, do we actually need it? We could also maybe enhance count_ops to accept a filter function (similar to depth) to do this. Already in it's current state, count_ops probably covers almost all use cases where you'd use num_nonlocal_gates.
