Transpiling a circuit with a for_loop (with statically known amount of loops) as described here leads to a an error: qiskit.transpiler.exceptions.TranspilerError: "The control-flow construct 'for_loop' is not supported by the backend." error.
Run this python script:
Produces this output and error:
The variant where I manually unroll the loop works fine.
Output:
Wheras, assigning a backend does not remove the error:
Changing the optimization level to 2 or 3, gives another similar but different message, so here the limitation seems to be the optimizer rather than the backend:
Not a bug: please read the error messages here.
We aren't doing arbitrary classical optimisations within Terra - a backend needs to support for loops in general for transpilation to them to succeed.  They then may choose to unroll the loops, but that's not our responsibility.  O2 and O3 don't support control-flow ops in Terra 0.24 but will in 0.25.
