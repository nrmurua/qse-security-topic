Distributing a wheel package with an executable/library statically linked makes things easier for our users as they don't need to install external dependencies. It has it's drawbacks as well but in general, and for our specific use case the balance tilts towards static linking.
On Windows platforms, we are not building statically yet, so this is issue is to track this progress.
If I found any stopper to not building statically, I'd document it here.
We finally compile with a static version of OpenBLAS built by us. The rest of the extension needs to be in the form of a .dll because of how Python extensions work.
