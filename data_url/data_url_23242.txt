Since there is a gui for everything now, people will not be aware that there is an IIR module. If anyone has some spare time, one could migrate bodefit into another gui module to set up and diagnose the iir filter.
Quote samuel in #84 :
Gui for the iir is still minimalist (basically, an interface to define zeros and poles), it would be really nice to include the graph with the transfer function in the widget, with some nice keyboard shortcuts to move zeros/poles values as you (Leo) did it in bodeplot. However, I am not sure if I will be very efficient at doing that, and I will probably wait for you before doing it since I am not sure if we want to just keep everything from your bodefit or to adapt it slightly (for instance, using pyqtgraph and QShortCuts instead of matplotlib?).
Matplotlib was the slowest part in the IIR gui, so we can replace it by pyqtgraph. And we should add a shortcut "h" that shows all keyboard shortcuts.
