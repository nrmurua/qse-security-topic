We should think about formalizing ATIQ gateware additions. The present need (#146) to organize the codebase in support of Pipistrello plus two KC705 configurations is the tip of an iceberg.  In the future I hope we see a variety of application-specific gateware add-ins including 10's ps time-stamping and several GHz DACs.
In some sense this is a solved problem as MISOC is all about plugging together MIGEN components. So what ARTIQ could really use is a set of protocols for ensuring that MIGEN/VHDL components play well with the ARTIQ ecosystem. And that they're possible to debug. It could also be a natural way of compartmentalizing the existing RTIO peripherals.
A full specification of what's needed is way beyond my ken but here's a go.

ARTIQ Master

I propose discussing this sort of speculative feature on the list, and use the issue tracker for more pragmatic tasks (fixing bugs and implementing better specified features).
