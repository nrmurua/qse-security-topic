Description
Currently CQM.to_file() encodes constraint labels with json.dumps, allowing characters that are illegal in file names, like /. That becomes a problem only when trying to extract the CQM zip file.
However, CQM.from_file() assumes forward slashes are not allowed in file names and that / is used only as (POSIX) path separator:

Consequently, decoding CQMs with slashes in constraint labels will fail.
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
Serializing CQMs with forward slashes (and some other unicode characters, like NULL) should be forbidden. Or at least such labels should be renamed, either on constraint creation, or cqm serialization.
