When using ListOp methods, like reduce(), they can return a new ListOp containing an new updated operator. However the grad_combo_fn, newly introduced with the gradient capability, is not being set into the new ListOp in places where it should be - reduce() being one example.
Action is to ensure the ListOps grad_combo_fn is carried over into the new ListOp everywhere its appropriate.
This should have been closed by #1407.
