Hi, I am looking at building the DQVM, but the Readme.md (https://github.com/rigetti/qvm/blob/master/dqvm/README.md) seems to reference a Makefile that was deleted sometime in the past.
I am wondering if there are some updated instructions to build this?
Thank you in advance!
@mlxd I haven't verified this, but it might be the case that the Makefile was replaced by the script in dqvm/scripts/build-dqvm2-sbcl. Give that a shot.
Yeah that looks to be the case: https://github.com/rigetti/qvm/blob/bump-version-1.17.1/dqvm/Makefile
@notmgsk Thanks for the info. My Common Lisp isn't really up to scratch, but I needed to make two edits to that script to get things building:
The above script succeeded, but it failed to load the DQVM when attempting to use the provided run script with a sample quil file (I assume I will need to make some edits here, but will need to revisit in a day or two).
I wonder if there is any help needed to generalise this script similar as the builds of qvm and qvm-ng? Would a Makefile be a better fit, as variables can be overridden by the user without editing the file, and any generated objects can also be tracked and recompiled as necessary?
If none of this would be helpful, no problem, and I can keep plugging away to find a structure that works for me. Thanks again for any feedback.
Just a quick update, I have made a few changes to put the appropriate paths into the run script:
./dqvm2-sbcl --load $QUICKLISP_HOME/setup.lisp --eval "(push \"$PWD/\" ql:*local-project-directories*)" --eval '(asdf:load-system :dqvm2)' --eval '(quit)' and am now reaching the following error: The variable MPI::+MPI-DOUBLE-COMPLEX+ is unbound.
This seems to be also found here, which is either the same or at least similar: http://report.quicklisp.org/2020-04-28/failure-report/qvm.html#dqvm2
Again, I appreciate any feedback that can be given.
Ah! Congrats on getting that far üòÉ
A colleague was working on improving the CL MPI bindings. Though that particular PR seems to have stalled.
Are you familiar with how to install your own CL libraries?
Thanks! üëç
Not familiar, but I can take another look at this in a few days (and at that PR) and see if I can work through it.
Here's a few steps to follow:
If 3. doesn't work out, make sure that quicklisp is finding your cl-mpi with
4. (asdf:locate-system :cl-mpi) -- hopefully this should show the correct path /home/you/code/lisp/cl-mpi.asd.
5. If not, you might need to go nuclear and blow any caches away. In your qvm folder, try make cleanall. Then go back to 3.
I was able to get dqvm2 loading after doing the above. Let me know how you get along.
