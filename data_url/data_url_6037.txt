A C++ function to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a postive-semidefinite (PSD) complex matrix. Something like
where evels stores the eigenvalues, and evecs stores the eigenvectors as rows or columns (depending on underlying array storage layout).
From what I can gather the best way to do this would be to use the LAPACK routines (depending on template float/double):
