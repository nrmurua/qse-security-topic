When you try to serialize a circuit with an MCXGrayCode gate using qpy, you get TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'num_ctrl_qubits'. As far as I have seen, other mcx gates do not run into this issue.
I discovered this while trying to run iterative amplitude estimation using the runtime Sampler, which relies on qpy for serialization.
This snippet will fail with a similar traceback to:
It should not have failed.
I would modify the following line of qpy.binary_io.circuits.py to add "MCXGrayCode". There seem to be other gates that have been already accounted for this same issue, and adding "MCXGrayCode" to the list fixes it:
I'm happy to open a bugfix PR, but because I'm not that familiar with qpy, I wanted to document the problem in this issue first.
