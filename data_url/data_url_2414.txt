How about if TrialResult "has a" dataframe rather than "is a" dataframe? Then we have a place to tack on extra metadata if needed or add some helper methods to do things like translate sympy queries into the data frame. Can also easily just get the data frame itself and discard the rest of the trial result if that's all you need.
I think we should not add any of our own filtering or aggregation methods, because they will behave differently than the pandas ones and this will create opportunities for mode errors.
I would prefer to just return the dataframe because it's one less thing to teach ("oh, you forget to put .data"), but I agree that we may have to return a compound object that has a dataframe in addition to metadata. In that case we would be keeping TrialResult but modifying which properties it has.
FWIW, complex numbers are supported in pandas:
