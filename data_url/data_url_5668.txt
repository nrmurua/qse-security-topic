Errors out under multiple scenarios
My circuit is

The runner is
And the run is
This returns an error AttributeError: 'AerJob' object has no attribute 'name' at AerJobSet._get_worker_result
When I don't use i = [[j] for j in i] the error is TypeError: object of type 'float' has no len() at AerBackend._convert_circuit_binds which is also different from what other functions like qiskit.execute take in. Related to [#1551]
When I convert the params into a dict of lists (i.e {rx: [1,2,3]}) rather than a list of dicts (i.e [{rx: 1}, {rx: 2}, {rx: 3}]) the error is AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'values' at AerBackend._convert_circuit_binds
The simulation should run ideally and .result().get_counts() should return the counts for each run
I may be using this wrong in which case I apologize for the confusion
Hey sorry i really don't know how to fix this, very new to Qiskit
Thanks for reporting the issue.
I think this is the specification of Aer and the difference from others. (Base class does not restrict the type of parameter_binds)
Please check the documentation: Additional Information: in AerSimulator.run

Hey thanks yeah I did try the AerSim variant also for some reason I just can't get it to run. I tried List of Dicts with each value singular array and also [dict of lists], its just debugging hell both ways and I end up reaching a point where its some internal issue
Could you help me with some examples of where Aer is used to execute multiple parameter values for a (or multiple) circuit(s) in a single call. Additionally if there's somewhere where batching has been shown
Thanks a lot for the prompt response üôèüèª
Hey, Why was this closed? If a new PR was merged in can you please link it? Or maybe let me know if I can help with additional information
If this is purely a debugging issue I would really appreciate it if I could pick someone's brain on it
