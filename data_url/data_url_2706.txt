You can pass in an operation that acts on a qubit that doesn't exist on the device.
Clearly we should return float("inf") in this case.
@Strilanc This appears to have been resolved by throwing an error if an unrecognized operation gets passed in.
This has been fixed a while ago by raising a ValueError with ''Unsupported gate type'
