Current EigenGate requires the child class to implement a _canonical_exponent_period method saying what the period of the operation is. But this information can be derived from other information given to EigenGate; specifically the _global_shift_in_half_turns argument to __init__ and the differences between the eigenvalue exponents coming out of the _eigen_components method.
This issue requires a) figuring out how exactly to compute the period (e.g. the least common multiple of the reciprocals of the relative phases and the global phase) and b) deleting _canonical_exponent_period and all usage of it with said computation.
