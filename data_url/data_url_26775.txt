We now got CPUs with 64 cores per socket. Hence, running serial binaries will become very rare. On the other hand supporting non-OpenMP binaries has a real maintenance cost to it, in particular for the toolchain.
Users who still want to run with a single thread, e.g. the high throughput folks,  can use OMP_NUM_THREADS=1. We know from our scaling tests that the performance overhead for OpenMP is negligible.
I like this idea, we are an HPC code anyway and all compiles we support have OpenMP...
This makes sense and therefore I have close down two regression tester (#732)
