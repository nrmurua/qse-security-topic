When trying to perform a trivial partial trace (of a ket) when no subsystem is traced over (all subsystems are kept), the result is a ket.
A density operator should be returned for consistency. The documentation (https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-tensor.html) also mentions that:
Note that the partial trace always results in a density matrix (mixed state), regardless of whether the composite system is a pure state (described by a state vector) or a mixed state (described by a density matrix)
The issue seems to originate in _ptrace_dense (see https://qutip.org/docs/latest/modules/qutip/qobj.html), where the following code appears:
A projector onto the state should be returned here instead of the copy of the state.
Thanks for letting us know! Fortunately, this is already fix in 5.0.0 but it would good to also change this for qutip 4.7.
The problem seems pretty simple, I think I could take care of it. However, I don't have much experience in collaborative programming, in particular I don't know what the local customs are. (I know how to use git, but I'm not familiar with the layout of the library, what tests should I perform [or even add my own, since this issue wasn't noticed before 5.0.0] etc.)
Sorry, didn't mean to close the issue, just a missclick.
A possible workaround for this issue is to manually convert the resulting ket state to a density operator by taking the outer product of the state with itself.
For example:
This should give you the expected density operator as the result of the partial trace.
Please Let me know, if I am going correct, please do assist me further on this issue
I would check if the result is indeed a ket first. That's the code I'm using at the moment as a workaround:
Thank you for the acknowledgement! Should I work further upon this issue, Please let me know and Provide me further assistance.
