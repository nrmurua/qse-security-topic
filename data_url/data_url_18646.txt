I'm trying to build quilc and run the benchmark, however, after I build the compiler and run with
I got
I'm not very familiar with lisp, anyone could help me fix it? I'm currently building v1.8.2 with sbcl 1.5.3 on MacOS.
@Roger-luo what is the output of the command ./quilc --check-libraries?
Does this mean it is not correctly linked to lapack? but I didn't see any instruction for linking against lapack... Is there any manual option for this? I think I've put mkl in my PATH.
It looks like it is finding an unsupported version of LAPACK. Do you know what version of LAPACK you have? Mine, for example, 3.8.0.
I'm not sure which version it is, but I think it should link to the mkl, which is 2018.3.039 on my laptop. I also got 3.8.0 by openblas in conda, but I guess that's not the lapack it is trying to link to, how can I change the lapack vendor/path for quilc?
Some versions of LAPACK don't have ZUNCSD unfortunately. This includes MKL and Accelerate I believe. Could you try using a different version of LAPACK?
sure, is there a compile option for specific the lapack path then?
Could you try changing your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the path with the library of interest? A possible problem is that we statically determine the path to these libraries at build time. Are you building the binaries from scratch?
Hi, any update on this one?
Thank you for reaching out, @rongpenl. Our linear algebra package, magicl was tested a few months ago on several platforms. The CS decomposition routines work with OpenBLAS on Linux and with the Accelerate framework in macOS. Could you please give us some details about your system settings (platform, operating system, available BLAS, versions)?
