This relates to #61 .
Whenever I run an experiment my terminal is spammed with the following lines :

Only the first and last line are not from OpenQL.
Everything is running with the option verbose=False i.e. (p.compile(verbose=False)
Added the following verbosity levels:
This level can be given as last argument to compile. Also updated the doc string for compile and tests.
Hi @imranashraf, Thanks for updating this. I do however have a question related to how this is wrapped.
As I understand it the "verbose" argument is deprecated and will raise an error if I try to use it. Is there an example snippet on how to use this new feature? Is LOG_NOTHING a string? what is they keyword argument of the function?
If you provide me with a little example feel free to close this again.
