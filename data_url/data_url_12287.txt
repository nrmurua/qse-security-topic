When running the getting started notebook :
I get the following error: 'BinaryOp' object has no attribute 'sym'
Thanks for reporting, @ionuttamas ! As Qiskit/qiskit#171 has just been merged, can you check if the current master version of the SDK solves the issue you described on your environment?
Yup works great now. Thanks!
