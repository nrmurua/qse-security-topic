Circuit simplifications might not affect unitary interpretation of a circuit, but do affect its noisy interpretation. For this reason, cirq's NISQy philosophy calls for circuit simplifications to only be done when explicitly requested by the user. This places a constraint on possible solutions to this issue. Namely, we don't wish to do any algebra in serde, qasm conversion and other similar code. See this comment for a concrete example how doing otherwise may harm our users.
Discussed this at Cirq Cync.
The main issue is that is that in Cirq we have tended to interpret the exponent as different gate, i.e. CNOT and CNOT**-1 are actually different physical transforms.   QASM does not have an CNOT_INV or a parameterized CNOT gate, so it doesn't make sense to serial to this.  Note that this is different that CZ where the QASM version of the gate has a parameter.
If you want to handle this case the recommended way is the write a transformer that transforms inverse cnots to cnots in your circuit.
