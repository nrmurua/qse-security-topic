This is a feature request.
In vqe.cpp, the vqe algorithm sets several fields in a shared AcceleratorBuffer when the execute() method is called. This includes the 'opt-val' and 'opt-params', which correspond with the optimized estimate of the energy. However, the constituent estimates of each Hamiltonian term, ie, Pauli string, and the corresponding coefficient are not included. These 'coefficients' are included in buffer, but they are not accessible using the getInformation() method from buffer.
The request is for the AcceleratorBuffer used by the vqe algorithm to include the coefficients information that corresponds with the 'opt-val' and 'opt-params' information.
I plan to commit something like this. This should get you the coefficients and exp-vals for each term at the optimal params.
Now you should be able to get the data like this
The request is to make this feature work for simulators with shots enabled. Currently, when tested with the 'aer' simulator with shot noise, the buffer['coefficients'] returns multiple sets of values instead of the one set associated with the optimal parameter.
The coefficients key contains the coefficient for each term in the provided Hamiltonian. Each element of that list corresponds to the same element in the kernel-names list. I just ran this for QPP and Aer with shots enabled and am seeing similar results as posted above.
Example code where it does not work
