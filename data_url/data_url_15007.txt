The following code raises an error. I don't think it should. I think it should return the zero operator. @ikkoham
To fix your code, you can do this:
According to the documentation, the SparsePauliOp.from_sparse_list needs to receive a list with, at most, n tuples, which n is the num_qubits. So if the number of tuples is greater than num_qubits and/or <=0 it raises a QiskitError.
Reference
However, it could be really awesome if it had a default return as 0. Maybe, The function could return thee default value even if no array was provided.
Fixed in #10765
