If one attempts to use crx, in the same way as cry or crz, one finds that it does not exist.
I'm putting this as a bug rather than a feature request, because it definitely feels like it should be there, and was perhaps overlooked.
See this notebook.
The standard library defines crz. cry is defined in aqua, but I agree it's confusing that crx is missing.
This issue can be closed, #3600 implemented the CrxGate.
