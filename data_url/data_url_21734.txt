Upon reset of board with idle_kernel defined the idle_kernel doesn't run until after first user-specified kernel runs (eg with artiq_run).
Program flash storage with idle_kernel but no startup_kernel. Reset board. Observe that idle_kernel does not run. Call artiq_run to run another program and terminate it. Now idle_kernel runs automatically.
idle_kernel runs whenever kernel is idle including following boot.
Board log?
