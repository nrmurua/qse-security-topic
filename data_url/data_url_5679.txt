QuantumCircuit.save_* are not in Aer's documentation.
Previously, these APIs are accidentally introduced in qiskit-terra documentation since sphinx generates docs after installing Terra and Aer and save_* methods are mixed intoQuantumCircuit.
I think Aer's documentation should cover extended APIs of QuantumCircuit.
Probably, we need to manually add some pages and be keeping consistency or find a way to automatically generate the methods.
