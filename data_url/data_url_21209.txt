When using a try-except block on the Kasli-SoC, if none of the type guards match, the last exception handler will be incorrectly run.
Set up a Kasli-SoC and run the following experiment:
The experiment fails with Terminating with exception (RTIOOverflow: Overflow)
The exception succeeds and prints out "Underflow", indicating that the except block was hit.
The fallthrough block in the try/except block emits an LLVM resume instruction:
Changing this to emit a call to __artiq_resume (either by changing the code generator, or adding a except: raise block to the above experiment) fixes this bug. However, I'm not familiar enough with either LLVM or ARTIQ's unwinding code to know if this is a sensible fix.
