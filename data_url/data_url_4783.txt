@smite @josh146 Some other points that came up when revising docs, to make structure of library more consistent:

Modes into state_options: good, the check in LocalEngine.run() whether to create a state object at all can be replaced with if state_options:
CircuitSpecs is ok too
Renaming state_options: note that currently also the generic **kwargs are treated as "run options", we should first make a list of all the keyword arguments we use when running Programs, and which classes need them.
Done in #121
