Stack trace:
The pyzx package is installed on the C drive, but the program is being run from the D drive, so there is no relative path.
Would it be possible to use an absolute path instead?
Hmm, I wasn't even aware relpath could throw an exception. I pushed a hopeful fix, but before I close it, can you see if it doesn't trow any other exception?
Thanks John. I have just tested with this fix and it works fine.
