CI is failing frequently with the following error:
This appears to be related to #9735.
Flaky CI failures.
No flakiness.
@TsafrirA and @nkanazawa1989, please can you look at this urgently - it's effectively blocking all CI on Terra.
@jakelishman
Do you want to revert #9735 while I sort this out? Nothing really depends on it at the moment.
Thanks for the quick response! Yeah, if you think it might take a little while to get to the bottom of (it appears to be Windows only, which is usually a recipe for an annoying debugging experience), I can revert it and you'll not need to rush.
Thanks!
So, the issue seems to be the caching of format_parameter_value. There are two tests (in this testing unit alone, there are possibly others in other units) which format the value 0.1j, and so if the two tests are ran sufficiently close to one another, the second one will get the cached value, and not reach the warning in format_parameter_value.
I guess different operating systems run the tests in different order, failing the test or passing it according to the number of caches between the different 0.1j values?
I will replace the PR shortly.
(I don't know how the cache is handled across different threads, maybe some operating systems have both calls to format_parameter_value executed "on the same time" thus avoiding the cache?)
In general the execution order of the tests is not fixed and it will change between runs and they also execute in parallel. We're probably seeing it on windows only primarily as a function of the number of vCPUs in the windows VM that ci jobs run in (which effects the split of tests), but that's not the only possible reason. When adding tests it's best to ensure there is no data dependency between tests to avoid issues like this. There are some tools builtin to stestr to try and work with and debug this such as:
you can pass any of these options to stestr via tox with something like: tox -epy -- --random
