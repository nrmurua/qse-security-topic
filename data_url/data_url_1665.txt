Description of the issue
I did pip install --upgrade cirq to upgrade to version 0.11.0
I noticed that cirq no longer has a version attribute
Cirq version
This is the terminal command suggested by this issue template
It returns
Note, this is not reproduced if you make a "clean install" of cirq. To get this issue it seems I have to do
I think this is working as expected, but we should document somewhere that when upgrading from cirq 0.10 to 0.11+ you should first pip uninstall cirq or start over in a fresh virtualenv.
Sorry for the confusion. Yes, I can add this to the release notes of v0.11.
Added this to the release notes + sent an email to cirq-announce. Thank you @dkafri for opening the issue!
