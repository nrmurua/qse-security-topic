In version 8.2 the following worked:
with SIRIUS 7.2.7 and CP2K 4ef9989 I get now:
and have to correct to
... and the manual doesn't list allowed values anymore.
The second issue might already be fixed with one of the commits of @mtaillefumier in SIRIUS already.
Would be good to have a new SIRIUS release before the next CP2K release.
We are cleaning up the api and these problems will be solved at the same time. hopefully before the next release of CP2K. I have the patch ready for the api modifications in my pipeline.
Note that SIRIUS options are case sensitive normally while cp2k options are not. The problem comes from this not SIRIUS specifically. SIRIUS converts the section and options name to lower case internally but does not do anything to the option value.
also, MPI_GRID_DIMS seems to be misdocumented: afaik that should be an int[2], not an int[3]?
The main issue with the capitalization of string parameters has been solved in #1784.
The MPI_GRID_DIMS is still listed as <N_VAR>-1</N_VAR> rather than <N_VAR>2</N_VAR>
