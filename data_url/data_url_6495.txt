I'm trying to build qsim for use with cuQuantum but am having difficulty getting the build to complete.
I get the following logs when running make in the qsim directory
Prior to running this I have:
Could you try export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CUQUANTUM_ROOT}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} please? (lib64->lib)
I've given that a go and I seem to be getting the same result...
Here are the steps I'm taking...
Conda environment:
Download packages:
Build packages:
I was having the same issue. My libcustatevec.so is in $CUQUANTUM_DIR/lib not lib64 as specified in the CMakeLists link_directories
Changing that directory path fixes the build issue.
Thanks, @1tnguyen, good catch. Yes we also found this issue internally. The cause here is that cuQuantum is provided in two paths: devzone (with path lib) and NVIDIA HPC SDK (with path lib64). We were unaware of this difference at the time of releasing beta 2.
@95-martin-orion @sergeisakov I'd suggest to fix in this way:
The doc/sample fixes are already in our pipeline but might take a while to finish.
@ochapman-phd, -L${CUQUANTUM_DIR}/lib should be added to line 15 in Makefile.
The reason is that it was lib64 in the first beta version and lib in the second beta version.
#507 should fix this issue.
Renaming lib to lib64 fixed issue. Cheers!
@ochapman-dphil, sorry to drag up an old issue, however, why did you not install cuQuantum via conda too?
