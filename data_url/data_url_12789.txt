Whenever, I have been running the first cell in the tutorials, I have been getting this error.
Error parsing boolean value. Path '', line 1, position 1.
I can still check by algorithms with the reference implementation, but I can't run any exercises due to the syntax errror.
I think the problem is that I have an updated version of IQSharp, but even when I change the cell, I get the same error.
That's a new and interesting error. Can you provide your environment details? OS, .NET Core version, IQ# version installed, which tutorial you're running, a screenshot of the error?
Nevermind, it was a small mistake. Thank you though!
My favorite kind of issues :-)
