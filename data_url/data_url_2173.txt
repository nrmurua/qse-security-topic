Should be DensityMatrixTrialResult. Due to inheritance, it is SimulationTrialResult leading to problems if you actually try to use it

Shouldn't there be some consistency? E.g. all simulate() methods should return SimulationTrialResult which then can be cast to the corresponding type. (Though it seems odd too)
