Pulse schedule names are currently being drawn by default. Most names are useless as they are automatically generated. Names should be drawn as an optional flag.
any hints guide me through?
This is the code you should modify https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/9f2d61a9a8baf2bb773095576c96afa4a7048361/qiskit/visualization/pulse/matplotlib.py#L865. It will also require adding a new argument to the functions https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/9f2d61a9a8baf2bb773095576c96afa4a7048361/qiskit/pulse/schedule.py#L441 and https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/9f2d61a9a8baf2bb773095576c96afa4a7048361/qiskit/pulse/pulse_lib/pulse.py#L54
Thanks for hints, am working on, max delivery weekend.
The PR #4427 was an attempt to address this issue, but got stalled. If you want to work on this, consider updating  #4427 (respecting the authorship) instead of starting from zero.
@1ucian0 I can take care of updating #4427 to make it ready for being merged, if you'd like.
What's the best way to proceed, in full respect of the work already done?
I could maybe pull the old branch, but start a new PR?
We can also wait for the weekend to see if @SeifMostafa has time to pick it up, what do you think?
Sure. Let's wait. OP in #4427 is back! thanks for the suggestion @mlarocca !
I could maybe pull the old branch, but start a new PR?
Yes. Fetch the old branch and create a new PR.
Hello,
Thanks to feedback me after review please
