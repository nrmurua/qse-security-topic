This was fixed in #748 but has regressed. Electrical paths are matched.

Na. That's not a solution. I'll revert it.
The underlying issue is still the same. You will always find something that does not match when trying to compare the DDS with the parallelized DUC. They are just different. I could correct it for phase but then it will fail for amplitude. Or you'll compare the offset channel to phase1 or amplitude1. Let's state that equal things are well synchronized but unequal things may have a deterministic latency difference of strictly less than one coarse RTIO cycle.

That's a fine compromise. Please update the docs as to which oscillators are expected to be synchronizable by phaseN.set().

@jordens Thanks for documenting this.
