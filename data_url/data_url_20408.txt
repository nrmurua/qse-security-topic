Tancr√®de, I would like to have "algorithm datasheets" providing a bit more information about each algorithm in liboqs (e.g., https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/docs/Algorithm%20data%20sheets/kex_lwe_frodo.md). Can I ask you to make up something similar for Kyber? It doesn't have to match exactly, use your judgement on what information is appropriate to include.
Will do.
Closing, removing Kyber temporarily, cf. #211.
