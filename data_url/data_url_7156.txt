Quantum teleportation and algorithms that rely on it (e.g. quantum error correction) currently don't work because of incorrect behaviour of MeasureBit, which was reported in an email to miss Laura Culp.
I tried to find the bug, but sadly the relevant shader code is way over my head :(
Example of quantum teleportation - http://qcplayground.withgoogle.com/#/playground/5125474921480192
Example that shows MeasureBit collapsing a |1> state to |0> - http://qcplayground.withgoogle.com/#/playground/5662197925543936
P.S. Thank you for the amazing work, QC Playground is what hooked me on quantum computers :)
My bad, I was using Measure after MeasureBit (didn't know MeasureBit directly puts the result in measured_value). Quantum teleportation works.
