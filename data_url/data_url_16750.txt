Add a feature to change the number of qubits after the circuit construction. If the number of qubits increases, add more qubits -- as already possible by adding registers. If the number of qubits decreases remove the bottom qubits and all operations associated with it. This could be generalized to a filter method removing specific qubits from the circuit and operations they are part of.
Note that a filter feature can be arbitrarily generalized if we feel the need for it. E.g. we could filter certain gates, certain parameters, etc. Or a filter could also be used to search for certain operations. However the filter functionality is not required to move along with changes in Aqua, just reducing the number of qubits is. The filter is merely a suggestion of how to embed the reduction in a nice framework.
Use cases
Or using the filter functionality
Hello, I have wanted to implement some functionality similar to this myself, as well. I would love to be able to contribute to this if no one is opposed. Feel free to let me know if any development has already been done on this @Cryoris @kdk. Thanks!
This issue may be fixed by PR #5033 which is pending review.
This was resolved by #4185 for the use cases that we're prepared to support.
