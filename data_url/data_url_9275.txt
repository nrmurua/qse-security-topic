I just find currently the construction of 7x7 and beyond using Yao's own matrix construction is too slow to finish. I think we need to bring back the old mechanism for that and ideally the CUDA kernel as well.
Ideally, this should be implemented on Yao side for general expressions. But a start is probably to just replace the current mat implementation with it for now.
@Roger-luo can you put links to the previous code here?
