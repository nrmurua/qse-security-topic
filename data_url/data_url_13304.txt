Currently we have several functions that crate benchmark circuits, i.e., circuits that can be used to test error mitigation techniques.
The existing functions are:
All current benchmarks are based on Clifford circuits. It would be nice to have a new function called e.g.:
generate_random_circuit or generate_volume_circuit .
The output should be a random non-Clifford circuit, possibly a 2-design. A good example is given by the circuits that are typically used in quantum volume experiments.
Note: The first thing to do, before reinventing the wheel, is checking if Cirq already has a similar function that can be adapted for the tasks of this issue. As far as I know, this is not the case at the moment.
I would like to work on this issue.
