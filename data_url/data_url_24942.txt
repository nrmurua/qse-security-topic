At least in the parameter regimes that I've looked at (EJ/EC>>1, EJ/EC ~80), no matter the value of flux, I find twofold degenerate eigenvalues everywhere, which is not correct. There must be a bug hiding in the implementation of the Hamiltonian.
This issue is fixed by commit aac893d
Merged Danny's patches into master.
