Writing tests with the unittest is a bit unwieldy. I'm not sure it's worth the effort to change all the tests to get rid of unittest, but we could do a gradual phase-out in which we rewrite AND improve tests. I think a lot of tests can be considerably simplified, for instance, by using EqualsTester and the random object generation utilities.
that's fine. I think we actually have (or had) an issue open about this somewhere?
I think we can just start using pytest without changing the code: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/unittest.html
this is redundant with #420
