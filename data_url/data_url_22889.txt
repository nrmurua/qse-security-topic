I was opening a GUI with an existed yml file,and have no idea what was going on
I ran into the same issue and notice someone else has the same problem: #467
My workaround is to excute pip install qtpy==1.9.0 and it worked.
Also ran into this issue. My workaround was using the python3-only branch of pyrpl instead of master.
