When running our hardware examples for C++ only (error does not occur on python examples), I am getting the following errors on both IonQ and Quantinuum.
We have no issues with the python examples, however.
See bug description for commands to run. This is off of a cuda quantum build done with the cuda-quantum/scripts/build_cudaq.sh script.
Note: This also fails when passing a url to nvq++ for quantinuum
To execute the programs the same as the python examples.
Not a regression
No response
