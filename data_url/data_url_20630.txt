Hi,
first, thank you all for the amazing work. While building up a freeradiusd with the 1.1.1 branch of this fork, i encountered a problem when using rather long curves_list. It turns out the maximum amount of curves in a list is defined in ssl/t1_lib.c as:
# define MAX_CURVELIST   OSSL_NELEM(nid_list)
nid_list only includes ecdc curves, while the pq algos and hybrid implementations are defined in oqs_nid_list and oqs_hybrid_nid_list. When using more curves than member in nid_list, the curve list evaluation function fails silently.
This small fix works for me:
# define MAX_CURVELIST   (OSSL_NELEM(nid_list)+OSSL_NELEM(oqs_nid_list)+OSSL_NELEM(oqs_hybrid_nid_list))
If you have no objections against this change, i can send a PR.
Regards,
Robin
Yes, please send a PR, it will trigger our tests and make it easier to review the fix. Thanks!
