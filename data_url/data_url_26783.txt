Since #661 the generated sdbg arch file doen't work anymore with the default toolchain. Probably the best way to fix this is to simply not generate the debug arch files when reflapack is not present.
Reproducer:
... or use the selected BLAS/LAPACK also in the sdbg files
the reason for using reflapack in sdbg is that some tools (like valgrind) might not be able to deal with whatever techniques (new instructions, out-of-bound read-access etc) being used in optimized math libraries....
@juerghutter fyi
Fixed via #827.
