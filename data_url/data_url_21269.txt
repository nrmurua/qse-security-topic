Sometimes a run remains stuck in the "pending" stage and becomes invisible to other runs and is un-deletable.
No idea how to reproduce reliably.
In opticlock we have a couple tweak-up scripts hooked up to the F-keys. These scripts only exercise software functions (via controllers) and don't touch the coredevice. They also run in their own pipeline. (There are other runs running in other pipelines, among them runs that do interact with the coredevice). But activity or state changes in other pipelines are not needed.
Depending on conditions they might be submitted at reasonably high rates (~Hz) and will back up somewhat (maybe ~10 runs deep). But they should always be executed in sequence and removed when done.
The runs execute according to the pipeline rules and be removed then.
Graceful or force deletion have no effect.
There are no corresponding artiq worker processes (anymore).
The run did not fail but also didn't leave a h5 file around. It looks like it never got out of pending.
Nothing in the logs (at INFO level).
Interestingly, other runs (same pipeline, same priority) have no problem bypassing and skipping the zombies. This should not be the case AFAIK.
There does not seem to be any effect (side or not) of the zombies.
This is rare. I've seen it maybe four times over a year and 50k rids including the two runs above.
I have no idea what to make of the exact 6000 rid difference between these two occurrences. Would be a weird coincidence even given confirmation bias (any multiple of a reasonable power of ten or two would be surprising).
An artiq_master restart obviously clears them.
I haven't looked into debugging the running artiq_master process and I don't know whether it's easy to do (with pdb) and what to look for.
This has evolved a bit.
Full schedule:
Immediately logging termination of asyncio tasks due to exceptions might perhaps help.
Help for fixing or help for debugging?
