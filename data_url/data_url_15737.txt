the following fails
but it works on commits prior to #6124
The error is:
You probably need to reinstall qiskit-terra - the plugin can't get registered as an entry point til you've rerun pip install -e . or whatever. If it's tox, you can rebuild the environment with tox -r.
This shouldn't happen on a clean install, only on a git checkout where you've pulled the new main without rerunning setup.py in some form or another.
