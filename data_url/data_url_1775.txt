#3702 was fixed by pinning codeowners to 0.1.2.
In the new version we have windows support (so we can add to requirements.txt) but maybe there is a bug as we have test failures. We'll need to investigate.
This is blocked by a bug in the tool: sbdchd/codeowners#13
@balopat It seems sbdchd/codeowners#13 was fixed. Maybe we can upgrade codeowners to 0.2.0, 0.2.1 or even 0.3.0 (it was released 8 days ago), and add it to requirements.txt. What do you think?
I think this was done in #4131.  This dependency is no longer pinned.
