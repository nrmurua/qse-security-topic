Prerequisite
Please ensure that this bug has not been answered on the Perceval forum Done
Describe the bug
drawsvg (previously drawSvg) has changed its naming scheme from CamelCase to underscore based, in the 2.0 major release.
Installing drawsvg with version greater than 2.0 causes import perceval to fail, because of import drawSvg statements in several places.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Expected behavior
Import should occur with no errors.

Additional context
The temporary fix is to add drawsvg<2.0 in the requirements.txt. Long term, perceval should start using the latest version of drawsvg. As many of drawsvg function names have changed, this will require some work.
Hello,
Thank you for your detailed message.
You're right, drawsvg released a major update last Sunday, breaking its own API.
Perceval will support drawsvg 2.0+ starting from the upcoming 0.8.0 version.
For now, as you proposed, users willing to install new environments with Perceval 0.7.x will have to manually downgrade drawsvg.
This can be done, in command line, as easily as:
(venv) $ pip install drawsvg<2.0
Best regards,
Eric
Thank you. Small correction: one needs quotes to prevent the < be interpreted as a shell redirect operator.
Hi,
Perceval 0.8.0 was released last Friday and uses drawsvg 2, fixing this issue for good.
Thanks again for your workaround.
Best regards,
Eric
