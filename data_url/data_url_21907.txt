Under Windows, the artiq-board binaries don't end up where artiq_flash expects them.
I tested this on the win7-experimental VM

They end up in c:\miniconda64\envs\artiq-test\lib\python3.5\site-packages\artiq\binaries. That's a python3.5 too much.
Manually moving them makes artiq_flash work.
Does it even make special sense to put them into python/site-packages? Why not $PREFIX/share/artiq in analogy to bscan-spi-bitstreams?
This is still the case as of 9715f77.
@jordens I'm not sure if bugs that are frustrating but have a simple workaround should be labeled as "critical".
@whitequark Since fixing this on the conda side is causing another avalanche of time-consuming problems, maybe artiq_flash can simply work around whatever conda is doing, by looking at both possible locations?
@sbourdeauducq I believe I fixed it.
I am following the procedures I know from other projects. Critical refers to the impact and the urgency, not the complexity of the fix or the workaround. A single character typo may well be critical because it breaks everything. Even if every user is trivially able to hack that into the files as installed.
