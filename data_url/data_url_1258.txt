Description of the issue
The phase_flip factory method documents its Kraus operators differently (and incorrectly) compared to how they are documented in the PhaseFlip class. In PhaseFlip, M1 = sqrt(p) Z, where p is documented as the "phase-flip probability", which is correct, but phase_flip documents M1 = sqrt(1 - p) Z, even though it still claims p is the "phase-flip probability".
