Confirmed that I can flash using artiq_flash -t sayma. #847 However, I don't see anything on flterm when I remove power from Sayma_AMC, wait 3 seconds then reapply power. I've checked all four serial interfaces.
Is the done led on? Did you set up the M switches?
Which LED?
Top layer, green, near the FMC connector and the top edge. And maybe "3 seconds" is not enough.
I set "M switches" on PCB "HS1" to 1234 -> 0111. I can now flash the board using artiq_flash -t sayma and see on ttyUSB2 MiSoC BIOS messages. Thanks!
