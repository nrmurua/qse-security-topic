It would be clearer and leave fewer chances for errors to call them both archive since the functionality is the same. Or am I missing something?
Agreed. If no one objects, I'll add archive to set_dataset while keeping save (for backward compatibility and with a warning; we can e.g. do that in 4.0 and remove it completely in 5.0).
The slightly confusing wrinkle (and probably the reason it was not like this before) is the following behavior:
Something that has been set with set(..., archive=True) does not appear in the archive group (but in the datasets group) in the HDF5 but something from get(..., archive=True) does appear in the archive group.
Since we treat the datasets (and the "archive" stuff) as a single namespace anyway we might also merge the two groups.
