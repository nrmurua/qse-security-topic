Today, the Jupyter Version Table includes the following information:
There are several items I wanted to open for discussion:
Our enablement (tutorials / courses), can call get_version_info() directly:
While this is fine in general, I think the table magic allows us to be consistent easier

This was updated in #10242 as part of 0.25.0. In the current release it will show any package currently imported that starts with qiskit that is imported along with the qiskit package version. TBH, I was personally not a fan of keeping the jupyter magic in qiskit, as I think it's utility is very small and it's only because of it's current use in qiskit-tutorials that I think we kept it. What you're doing in "Next Best Alternative" is what I normally recommend people do (or just call qiskit.__version__ and qiskit_ibm_runtime.__version__) if they want to get the versions of the packages of interest. You can easily build a local magic for custom and consistent formatting, all it's basically doing is just building an html table based on the __version__ attributes anyway.
Sounds good! I agree with your thoughts on the Jupyter Magic's place in qiskit
Will close this issue today, and have the NBA as the promoted route instead
