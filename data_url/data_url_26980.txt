Hello QUICK!
There is no documentation of the MP2 method, even though it seems to be a working functionality judging from the test suit and several PRs (e.g.  this and this).
Is MP2 on GPUs still work in progress? Do you need some help?
Hi @q-posev,
Thanks for reaching out. We had someone in our group working on the MP2 implementation but haven't picked it up since he left. I dont think PR #186 has been tested. We are currently understaffed, so any contribution to the repo would be appreciated.
