The text in examples/relaxation_and_decoherence.ipynb talks about amplitude damping and phase damping errors, however the experiments use thermal relaxation errors. We can either change the text, or leave it as it is with a comment about the usage of another error in the code.
#58
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ignis/blob/master/examples/relaxation_and_decoherence.ipynb (aka "new notebook") is based on https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/ignis/relaxation_and_decoherence.ipynb ("old notebook"). So far, we have copied the non-code text of T1 and T2* from the old notebook, as is, without any rephrasing. We have not copied the text of echo and CPMG.
Need to decide what the new notebook contains; and what, if at all, is taken from the old one.
I'm on the fence, but I think we keep the relaxation noise in the example we use for documentation (which should be more terse). The tutorial we might want to change back for teaching reasons.
What is the answer for #81 (comment) ?
Mostly just copy the tutorial text that exists...it looks like a good amount of work went into it. Just makes sure the text is consistent with the code.
Ok, it looks like that's what you did
