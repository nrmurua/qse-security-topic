The latest Numpy release (1.25.0) broke some our CI tests in Python >= 3.9.
I didn't check why exactly, but we should fix these issues if possible or avoid this release otherwise.
If you can't fix quickly could you push a new version just for constraining the version <1.25?
we also had some internal things fail too, not sure if it's just because of Pulser output yet or also what we do internally
Yes, I'll have a patch released today
Fixed in version 0.13.1
