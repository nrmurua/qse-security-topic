Any call to Instruction.c_if is linear in the number of Clbit references in classical registers in the circuit.  This is because of some lines in InstructionSet that unroll all registers on every call: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/49110f9c596fc509f189f38cfbdbb3100407bff2/qiskit/circuit/instructionset.py#L61-L64
This should be a constant-time operation.
This can easily be fixed by the same methods as #7246.
