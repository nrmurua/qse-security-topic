led0 does not flash .
The build script automatically adds two LEDs: led0 and led1.
Add them to the device_db.py.
Observe that  led1 causes the LED marked "L1" on the kasli-soc faceplate to flash.
Observe that  led0 causes no LED to flash.

It looks like the kasli-soc ERR led is controlled by the firmware. I can't yet trace out under what circumstances it is illuminated. It would be helpful if this new feature were documented.
Error LEDs are turned on after Rust panic on all boards.
led0 is also on the Kasli-SoC board, below the power LEDs next to the SFP cage, not on the front panel.
Confirmed that led0 works fine. :)
