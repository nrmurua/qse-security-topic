Is there a specific format when trying to saving data using the measure.Measure.get() command using an oscilloscope? I have tried using a numpy array, a list and an object but they all give me the same error:
"ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence."
I know this was an issue you came across in #435 . How did you resolve this error in the TPS driver?
Cheers!

Hi Arvind
You will need to use a subclass of an arrayparameter for this to work as discussed in #674
Did you ever run into the following error when making the TPS2012 driver? If so, how did you go about fixing it?
import qcodes as qc
lcr.ch1_curvedata.prepare_curvedata()
#data = qc.Measure(lcr.ch1_curvedata).run()
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

1 import qcodes as qc
----> 2 lcr.ch1_curvedata.prepare_curvedata()
3 #data = qc.Measure(lcr.ch1_curvedata).run()
~\Anaconda3\envs\QCODES\lib\site-packages\qcodes\utils\helpers.py in getattr(self, key)
356         raise AttributeError(
357             "'{}' object and its delegates have no attribute '{}'".format(

360     def dir(self):
AttributeError: 'LCR' object and its delegates have no attribute 'ch1_curvedata'
I have also attached my in-progress driver for the LeCroy oscilliscope, could you have a look and see where I've made an error with the curvedata function?
Thanks!!
Your LCR class has no attribute called ch1_curvedata anymore when you use the channels.
It will be
lcr.channels[0].curvedata
Unfortunately the example notebook uses the old pre channels interface and should be updated
Oh sure, that seems to work now. Cheers for the help Jens.
On a slightly different note, how do I go about submitting drivers for a few new instruments?
If you create a github pull request with the driver that you have created we can review it and give feedback
Hey @ArvindK12345!
I was wondering about the status of your oscilloscope driver. It would be great to share it with other QCoDeS users. Could you make a pull request?
If you need help with anything just let me know.
Hey Dominik,
Apologies for the delay but I have now created pull requests for the oscilloscope driver (ArvindK12345#2) and a microwave source driver (ArvindK12345#1). Could you merge them with the main QCoDeS branch when you get some time?
Cheers!
Hi Arvind,
It looks like you have made those pull requests against your own fork of qcodes. Can you open them against the qcodes/qcodes main repository. I am happy to explain more if you need it
You were right, I should have sorted that out now. Could you check if they're merged?
Hi @ArvindK12345, it looks like you could use a helping hand in making this pull request. I have sent you an invitation to join the QCoDeS slack channel; there you can get more comprehensive step-by-step support.
