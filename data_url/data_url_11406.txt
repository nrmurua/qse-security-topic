In the main.py and the qeoader.py files there are TODO items. There is also a commented out deprecated loader for hdf5 files.
Thanks for your comments. I put the TODO item in main.py when I first developed the code and it is a potential performance improvement. In the actual use of the code, I found that that part of the code costs a negligible amount of computational time compared to other parts so it is not an important issue to address. I have removed that TODO item in commit 3083324. In that commit, I also removed the deprecated code in QEHDF5WavefunctionLoader.
I am happy with those changes to address the issues
