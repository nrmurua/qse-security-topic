The following fails:
It is useful to be able to broadcast datasets this large e.g. for displaying images.
At minimum, it would be useful to have an error message that cleanly identifies the error.
The full error message is:
This is coming from python asyncio. How large is too large?
I investigated this a bit, the default limit in asyncio is 64k (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/asyncio/streams.py#L22); calling open_connection(limit=...) will fix the issue.
Yes, we're already doing that, but the current value is apparently too small - hence my question.
I don't know how large is too large, but several colleagues of mine have hit the ~400k double limit doing things that do not seem like an abuse of the broadcasting system. For example broadcasting a long scope trace or a vector of photon time-stamps.
If there has to be an arbitrary limit, it would be good for it to be at least an order of magnitude or two higher that at the moment - it seems like the uses cases for broadcasting ~100 MB datasets are far fewer than ~1 MB.
