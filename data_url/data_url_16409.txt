We should not allow pi_check to replace (eg) gate parameters close to pi with pi if they are explicitly not the correct approximation to the given number of decimal places.
For example,
circ = QuantumCircuit(1)
circ.u1(3.141591,0)
circ.draw()
engages pi_check even though 3.121591 is not the correct 6dp approximation to pi. I have encountered this as an issue when doing simulations that vary angles on rotation gates very slightly.
Happy to work on this if it is considered helpful.
The pi_check call happens when drawing, not when executing. This is controlled by pi_check(..., ndigits=...). It seems to me that a bit overkill to add yet another draw parameter to control ndigits. But feel free to open a new issue if you would like to discuss it.
