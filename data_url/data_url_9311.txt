When a user creates a Hamiltonian with the intent of having it transformed to something schema compatible, all waveform values need to be explicitly provided by the user. This is a restriction from the current API where the absence/presence of the value can change the Hamiltonian expression and the subsequent matrix for simulations.
In the case where a user may want to invoke hardware_transform on a hamiltonian constructed by rydberg_h without explicitly passing a value for \phi (or potentially another waveform the Hamiltonian could use), the emitted error message doesn't make this requirement very clear (it tells the user that \phi must be a waveform or a BloqadeWaveform.constant but this is not the true reason the transform failed).
