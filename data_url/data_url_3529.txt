QPU requires users to compile to a binary executable- should be mirrored in a QVM setting.
Cavat: I personally think this should be a QVM feature, not a rule for running programs. For example, a user specifies a lattice of our Aspen family, and would add a hyphen to denote they want realistic QPU constraints (noise + binary executable). (maybe 16Q-A-2-realistic-qvm?)
@mpharrigan making issue per user feedback. Happy to clean up if useful.
it's hard to come up with a scheme that doesn't result in a bagillion thousand configuration options. My current thinking
I think only Aspen-xxx-qvm should care as those are in our product family.
Need to understand point 3 a bit more to make sure it's sufficiently user-friendly, but that sounds fine
thanks to @hsim13372 for pointing this out
