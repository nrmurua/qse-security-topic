See minimal code example below
Now If I provide an empty list to trace out then it throws up an error which is expected
After the error, if I now recall a previous instruction that successfully ran then the error reappears.
It seems as if the qi.partial_trace operation is in some state that once it is broken, it cant function again?
If I use .get_statevector().data the above issue disappears.
Operation should not be state-bound and work regardless?
I've transferred this to Terra, because the issue isn't related to Aer, it's just about qiskit.quantum_info, which is in Terra:
gives
I'm guessing that somewhere along the line, Statevector._op_shape gets mutated in place, and never fixed because of the exception.
Also, I'm not super convinced that passing an empty list should be an error - I'd have thought we should just return the density matrix of the state.
