It seems that there is a small typo on the first line of the Deutsch Algorithm.
In the first line we have:
\\Implementation of Deutsch algorithm with two qubits for f(x)=x
shouldn't it be:
//Implementation of Deutsch algorithm with two qubits for f(x)=x
i.e. instead of the backslash, a normal slash!?
Yes, thanks! Resolved by 707877f from Eric Sabo
