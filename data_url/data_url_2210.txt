Eventually we will add a wait gate to cirq. When we do, we will want to parameterize the amount of waiting and sweep over it (e.g. to do a decay experiment). The natural way to do that is by parameterizing cirq.Duration.
Basically:
It's okay to return NotImplemented from the comparison operators when a symbolic value is involved.
