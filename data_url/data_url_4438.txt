Describe the bug
When passing bounds to the cma optimizer, they are silently ignored.
To Reproduce
Simply call optimize with the bounds keyword and the cma method. The bounds are not passed down:

Expected behavior
Since the documentation specifies that the bounds are for scipy optimizers, I believe it should either return an error:
The keyword "bounds" cannot be used with the cma optimizer. Please use options = {"bounds": <bound definition>} instead as defined by the cma documentation (or something on that line, the cma documentation is not very prolific so not sure about how to reference it...).
Or manually put the bounds inside the options passed to the cma. However this might be tricky as the format I think is not the same as scipy.
