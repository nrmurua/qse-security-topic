Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Now that we have a StatePreparationChannel in Cirq (#4482), we should add efficient two qubit state preparation methods as optimizers for sqrt iswap and CZs (these are already being used internally by the physics team).
These methods would also be useful as a reference for folks interested in adding more gateset specific efficient state preparation algorithms to Cirq (eg: #4482 (comment))
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters
