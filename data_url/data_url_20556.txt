Prerequisite for open-quantum-safe/profiling#83
After some digging my conclusion is that hybrid KEM testing in this code base isn't exactly straightforward: Hybrid KEMs were added straight into the TLS logic without a point where to only call that logic for speed testing: b05b1b7 . Thus, this should be re-factored to allow the oqs-openssl KEM speed logic to directly call it. Anything else would arguably be artificial (as is the current code if we're honest). Side note: Implementing this in openssl3 would be much simpler as all KEMs (hybrid, PQ, or anything else) are standalone entities (that could be speed tested).
The OpenSSL project has indicated that OpenSSL 1.1.1 will reach end-of-life in September 2023.  As such, we are discontinuing development on OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1, and recommend all users switch to OpenSSL 3 and the OQS Provider for OpenSSL 3, which provides all the same functionality that OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1 does.  Hence we are closing open pull requests and issues in OQS-OpenSSL 1.1.1 as won't-fix.
