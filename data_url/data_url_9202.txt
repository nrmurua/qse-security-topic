The user may sometimes only be interested in having samples with a minimum number of photons or clicks. During the calculation of a sample, it may be clear that the number of clicks in the sample may not reach the minimum specified by the user. For example, suppose the user wants samples with 4 or more clicks from a 6 mode device - if in a given sample three modes have returned no clicks, then this sample will never reach the 4 click minimum. Would it be possible to add functionality to stop sampling early if a minimum number of clicks will not be met?
Likewise, the user may be interested in/only care about having samples with a maximum number of photons or clicks. Would it be possible to add functionality to stop sampling early if a maximum number of clicks has already been recorded?
I was thinking about this and a drwaback of this method is that an actual `physical' GBS machine does not allow you to do this, i.e., a GBS machine produces samples, that are uniquely determined by the Gaussian state, the postselection of number of clicks is done afterwards.

True, I guess the samples one would take using the above functionality would not be possible to replicate with GBS, however, once you go all the way and postselect on e.g. a minimum number of clicks (which is really what we'd want the above functionality for), we then recover GBS+postselection. This could be via an optional argument or even a less user facing function - but one thing I'm not sure about is how this information would anyway be passed on from Strawberry Fields.
