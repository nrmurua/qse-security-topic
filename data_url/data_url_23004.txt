Never used the full complexity of the module (main reason is that we lack efficient design algorithms to place 24 poles and 24 zeros in a meaningful way)
-> allows to combine two inputs or outputs in a highly frequency-dependent fashion, seems more useful, allows to turn off one IIR easier
-> costs a few FPGA resources
