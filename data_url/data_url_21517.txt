When trying to set an output in float via Frastino.set_dacï¼Œan error occur.
Set the output at 5.5 Volt
I believe the artiq compiler is infering the argument to be an integer as you call self.dac.set_dac(0,0) before self.dac.set_dac(0, 5.5). The artiq type inference can be quite picky. Your first usage of set_dac passes an integer as the voltage. This makes the compiler infer set_dac() as having 2 interger arguments leading to the error when called with a float.
Thank you for your advice. That just solved my problem.
