In "Basic OpenFermion example" in the tutorial there is an issue with
from openfermion.ops import hermitian_conjugated
I think it should be
from openfermion.utils import hermitian_conjugated
Thanks for pointing this out Michael! Indeed, I don't think we've checked the code in the "examples" in a while. We do keep the "demo" up to date. I wonder if we shouldn't just remove the "tutorial" part of the docs and instead refer users to the jupyter notebook demo, which is both more comprehensive and more up-to-date. What do others think?
I agree that having a single place for people to go to as a reference is a good idea.
That can also be the push to create better demos.
I agree that instead of the out-of-date examples section we should have a page with links to the demo notebooks on GitHub, at least for now.
I just wrote an execute-documentation-snippets-and-expect-it-to-pass test for another project. It should do a good job of catching these kinds of mistakes, though it comes with its own downsides. Does that sound interesting?
Sounds interesting to me! What are the downsides?
As nice as this would be, I think that our demos are much more pedagogical and complete anyways. I think we should just refer people there as a rule and remove the text tutorial.
The downside is that if you put expensive code into the documentation, your tests take forever. Also the doc code may touch the network, and other unfortunate things.
