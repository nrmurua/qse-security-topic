It's great to see the loop number in the diagram!
However, repetition allows for negative numbers - it gets a bit weird to interpret that - what should we do there?
Maybe print the circuit in reverse + reverted operations? As that's what is happening under the hood.
Or we can explicitly say â€  , inverse or ^-1 somewhere in the header?

See #3605 for discussion on out-of-line subcircuit diagrams, which may be able to share the format we decide on here.

This looks like a diagram-formatting issue, which I'm inclined to punt to after 1.0. @dabacon, do you see part of this that needs resolved before then?
