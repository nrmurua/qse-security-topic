Hi,
I am trying to lock a cavity with low intrinsic stability. To analyse the behaviour of the PID I would like to activate the PID on resonance using a level trigger on one of the input signals. Did anyone ever try that or is there some functionality in a branch that would allow a level trigger to activate a PID?
