Here are some issues with the units and quantities of things:
The usage of MHz and ns is awkward because it requires an adjustment factor of 1e3 every time something like an area is computed. We've seen this error occur in the development of the Simulation module (Simulation is using MHz and ns #26) and it seems prone to confuse the users too.
There is currently some ambiguity in the definition of the Amplitude quantity. Is it the Rabi frequency directly? If so, perhaps we should call it that instead.
It is common to see Rabi frequency (and, to a lesser extent, detuning) values defined up to a factor of 2π. We should clearly establish if we're doing this or not.
@sebgrijalva @lhenriet  We still need to clear this up. As far as I could tell, the discussion with the HW team was not conclusive, right?
Personally, I think changing the name to Rabi Frequency, apart from being a lot of work, might also be misleading. Changing to \Omega is still an option, though I'm not so sure it's necessary.
I think this could be solved with a page in the docs clarifying things.
