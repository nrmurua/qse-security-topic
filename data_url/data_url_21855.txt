Using a Kasli master and satellite, I see the following exception most of the time artiq_coreanalyser is run while a kernel is running:
That's with SPI, I suppose?
yes - there are SPI cores on both master and satellite (https://github.com/cjbe/artiq/blob/master/artiq/gateware/targets/kasli_hoa2.py)
And this is a problem with DRTIO and not just with SPI?
I have no evidence that this is to do with DRTIO, but I have not managed to quickly reproduce this problem on a setup without DRTIO.
@cjbe This should fix it. Could you try again?
@jordens that seems to fix it
