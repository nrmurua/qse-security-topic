Hi @tcNickolas
I spent already several days and nights and had a hard time but I cannot understand the MagicSquareGame kata 100%.
I managed to understand the kata, and also the articles up to a certain point, but then the articles end with "as it can be easily verified ...."  and I cannot follow this.
I wanted to ask you Mariia, may I ask you some questions about this kata?
And should I do this via this issue or would you orefer some other communication channel?
And please, if I bother you too much just tell me.
Thanks in advance
Markus
You're most welcome to ask questions! However, if the question is more about the algorithm itself than about some Q# issue (which might be the case here?), I would recommend Quantum Computing SE, for several reasons:
@mbuchberger1967 So do you have a specific question about this kata? I'm not sure what's my next action for this issue is, since there is no clear question here...
@tcNickolas Sorry, I was busy the last week. It is more about the algorithm itself, so I will close thi sissue here and will post my questions to Quantum Computing SE, as you proposed it.
Thanks a lot,
Markus
Sounds good - I'll keep an eye on SE :-)
