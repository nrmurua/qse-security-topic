There is a Bloch_Decay.mp4 link at the bottom of the Plotting on the Bloch Sphere webpage.
When I click on it I get a 404 error from linked Google Code page:
http://qutip.googlecode.com/svn/doc/figures/bloch_decay.mp4
This sounds like more of a documentation issue caused during migration from google code, not really an issue with the framework.
The movie can be found here https://github.com/qutip/qutip-doc/raw/master/figures/bloch_decay.mp4
Thanks Alexander!
What is the right channel to report documentation issues?
Thank you @wuisawesome for the fix and @tilek for spotting the bug. The correct place to open such issue would have been in qutip/qutip-doc.
Now clicking on the link from Chrome downloads the video. In order to view it online something like this might be needed but PR 77 fixes the bug.
