Description of the issue
The docstrings for type aliases defined in cirq.circuits.circuit.py are not helpful and should be improved / fixed.
For example:
See https://quantumai.google/reference/python/cirq/circuits/circuit#CIRCUIT_TYPE
Where does the line "INT_TYPE: The central part of internal API." comes from?
The reference pages docstring also looks unrelated to the actual type.
https://quantumai.google/reference/python/cirq/circuits/circuit/INT_TYPE
Cirq version
0.15dev
Looks like tensorflow docs have the same issue: https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/types
LOL at the docstring showing TYPE_CHECKING in the "Other Members" section of the module docs. That should never be shown. How do we file issues like this about the docsite? Would the docsite respect __all__ if we were to define it?

Reopening as we should verify after the nightly release that the problem is actually fixed on the docsite.
Looks good in staging:
