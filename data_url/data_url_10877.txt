Hi,
I installed qasm but it does not work, it seems the dwave_sapi2 python module is required. Is it available somewhere ? Is it part of the qOp package from d-wave ? (I have qOp installed already)
Thanks,
Guillaume

It's part of SAPI, not qOp.  If you have access to the Qubist interface, go to Solver API then Resource Downloads then download the appropriate Python Developer Pack for your OS (e.g., sapi-python-client-2.4-linux64.tar.gz for Linux).

ok, I do not have access to Qubist right now, hopefully soon. I will tell you then if I have more questions,
Thanks for your help,
Guillaume
