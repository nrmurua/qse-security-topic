When inheriting from the AnalysisPass class as metaclass I get the error
When running the following code on Python 3.5 or 3.6
I get the specified error.
I need this kind of inheritance structure because of python/typing#449 which is only fixed in python 3.7+
I'm not quite sure why the _hash attribute is set to None in the superclass of AnalysisPass. Perhaps this should be revisited?
Looked into this a bit with @eddieschoute . The issue was in using AnalysisPass as a metaclass, instead of its metaclass, MetaPass.
