In OpenQL version 0.3, a Program was instantiated using keyword arguments: p = openql.openql.Program(pname='myprogram', nqubits=platf.get_qubit_number(), p=platf). In version 0.5 it is no possible to refer to this variables by name, only by order of the arguments. This is a clear step backwards in usability.
On a positive note, the order of arguments can be found in the docstring.
This relates to #146
While compiling the program with Swig 3.0, I get a bunch of warnings, for example:
This might be the reason for this bug. That warning wasn't emited under Swig 2.0, but most modern distributions dropped support of it.
closing because of lack of activity
