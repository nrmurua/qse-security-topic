When scheduling for s7 on cclight:
{ cz q0,q2 | x q3 }
i.e. a cz on qubits q0 and q2 that requires downtuning q3 to get out of the way,
resource constrained scheduling schedules these in parallel while they should exclude each other,
e.g. be scheduled as:
cz q0,q2
qwait 1
x q3
or as:
x q3
cz q0,q2
I.e. when a cz is scheduled first that requires downtuning some set of qubits, gates on those qubits should wait for the cz to be ready.
Also when scheduling a rotation gate on a qubit and then scheduling a cz that would require that first qubit to be downtuned, the cz should wait for the first gate to be ready.
@jvansomeren , There are two important notes to make here.
I think this is something that should be handled in a discussion rather than over mail/git issue.
solved with issue #166
