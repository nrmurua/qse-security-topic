Hi
i'm seraching for an method to close pyrpl quiet and nicely.
So im trying to close pyrpl by calling the _clear() method but then i'm ending up getting an OSError: Socket is closed. from paramiko. The Gui freezes but is still up.
Any ideas or solutions how to close pyrpl correctly via python?
My Code:
Debugger Console:
hi. which version are you using?
hi. which version are you using?
version_info = (0, 9, 3, 6)
