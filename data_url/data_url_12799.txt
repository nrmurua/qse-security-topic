Most likely, it is a problem of VS Code implementation of Jupyter but math expression with \\ line breaks will render with $$ and ruin the at block unless closing && moved to the new line.
here is an example from Complex Arithmetic:

I'll admit I've never tried using the Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code, so it will take me a while to reproduce the issue. Thank you for reporting it!
If you have found a simple fix that renders the notebooks better in VS Code (without breaking them in regular Jupyter!), would you be willing to send a pull request with the fix?
I'll admit that after digging deeper into it I can recommend not to use  Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code :).
Experience is not good, notebook does not look good, fonts, line length, local links not working, an overall jerkiness. I would recommend people to run the notebooks locally in the browser at this point.
That said, workaround is to regex replace all ([^"\\n])\$\$ with \1\\n\$\$: all $$ with leading character except if character is " or new line, replace with leading char (group \1) and $$.
But I do not thing that anyone should do that. Fix should come from VS Code Python plugin team.
Thank you for the investigation! This is very helpful - now I know not to spend too much time on this :-)
