With the new mechanism for retargeting local channels, the "rydberg_local2" channel is no longer necessary for CZ gate implementations and I would guess it won't be added to Chadoq2, unless I'm missing something. As such, I was thinking I should remove it. Any objections @lhenriet @sebgrijalva ?
If it's not going to be added to Chadoq2, I'm inclined to have it removed.
I'm not sure it won't, but that would be my guess. And anyway, if it ends up being added, it's always easy and non-conflicting to add it then.
