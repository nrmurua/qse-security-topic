Your Rust bindings currently ship a static copy of liboqs.  For shipping Rust binaries based on liboqs with unbundled libraries in package managers, we need the Rust bindings to be able to unbundle liboqs.  The maintainers of the Rust bindings told me that this is made difficult as liboqs does not ship a pkg-config file: open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust#190
Perhaps you could ship such a file?
I don't think any of us have experience working with pkg-config so we wouldn't know what to create nor how to test it. Are you able to prepare something?
Unfortunately I don't know cmake well enough to have an immediate answer to your question.
Just created a draft pkgconfig PR, should provide something to start off with, but I'll gladly accept any feedback as a first-time contributor to this project.
