Implement an AWG class that tranforms programs into a simple time voltage relation and feeds it into a callable (e.g. a simulation).
Required features:
Optional features:
This is a first step towards #2 and #10
First draft in issues/421_virtual_awg
Variable sample rate and maximum chunk length are not implemented to cut down development time. They seem to be premature optimization and can still be added when a performance problem arises.
