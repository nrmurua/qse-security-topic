Searching the docs shows there's no listing of what the possible memory types are (other than 'BIT') when doing Program.declare(..., ..., memory_type='???')
It seems the docs are more generally lacking on the classical memory system and DECLARE. There seems to be a small reference to it in the Meyer-Penny game.
@notmgsk @tarballs-are-good, there's some information on possible memory types and other DECLARE goodies in the "Details of Updates to Quil" section of the docs, but I agree this could be easier to find.
@amyfbrown Thanks! I didn't spot that because the python version is named "memory_type" and searching for that brings up nothing helpful. I would've expected the memory types to be listed in the python docstring... but then I don't think pyquil does any checking on what memory_type is and so doesn't really need to have any notion of what the memory types are.
docs, docstrings, input validation, ... all good and necessary things!
@notmgsk,
I would've expected the memory types to be listed in the python docstring...
I agree especially considering there are so few options that we could list them on a single line.
I don't think pyquil does any checking on what memory_type is and so doesn't really need to have any notion of what the memory types are
On that note, we should add type annotations for memory_type or otherwise change the documentation in the "Details of Updates to Quil" section to read
to emphasize that these memory_type options have to be strings or else you get a traceback:
