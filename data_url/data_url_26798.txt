I do agree that our benchmarks could use some curating. I suggest we start by moving them into a separate root directory /benchmarks and add a welcoming top-level README.md. Most of the individual benchmarks actually have already a README file. So, these would only need to be converted to Markdown and touched up. For further inspiration we can draw on our wiki page and PRACE incl. this doc starting page 27.

@oschuett does this make sense? Anything you'd do differently?
