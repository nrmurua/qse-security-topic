#1496 updated the Bloch sphere to prevent distortion in matplotlib 3.3+.  This appears to have inadvertantly pinned the effective matplotlib dependency to matplotlib>=3.3, because it uses Axes3D.set_box_aspect which didn't exist before then.  We might need to add a small version-dependent switch beacuse matplotlib 3.3 is under a year old, so it's a very recent version to be depending on.
I would like to keep the optional matplotlib dependency to at least matplotlib>=3 if at all possible, since I don't think we're using much cutting-edge stuff.
Note we now have packaging as a run-time dependency, which will make any version comparisons much easier (e.g.
@BoxiLi: do you have thoughts?
Sounds good! @jakelishman  Thanks for pointing this out.
Minor comment: It should be parse_version(matplotlib.__version__) >= parse_version('3.3'): to also include 3.3.0?
Ok cool, I'll leave it for other contributors for the time being. You're probably right about the version comparison - I hadn't really intended it to be accurate, just illustrative of what's possible.
Hi, just to clarify: the intention here is to have the two behaviours mediated by  a settings flag  or just an in-place version check?
I think an in-place version check should be sufficient? But I remember you guys had a deeper discussion over the Scipy version check so you might have a different optinion.
