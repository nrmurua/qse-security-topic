When the artiq.remoting module utility is used to upload files to the /tmp directory at a remote server through paramiko.sftp's library, if there is another user who is using the /tmp folder, an PermissionError (Permission denied) will be thrown.
This typically only occurs if that other user used artiq_flash to write to /tmp; because artiq.remoting.SSHClient always attempts to use the same /tmp/artiq folder for all users, and does not delete it afterwards.
I suggest using /tmp/artiq-$USER (or similar), plus deleting it at the end.

That would still cause problems if the user runs several artiq_flash commands simultaneously. A better solution is to run mktemp -d on the remote machine and get the output.
This would break the current caching mechanism. artiq-$USER is probably the best option then, with USER determined using getpass like paramiko does.
