There is no way to use toBeCloseTo for objects.
I try to add new tests, but I fail.
I tried to follow the example from the official documentation, https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect.html#expectextendmatchers, but it does not work.
Similarly, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43667085/extending-third-party-module-that-is-globally-exposed looks close, but I after expect('str').myMatcher('str') I get an error: Expected 2 arguments, but got 1. An argument for 'expected' was not provided..
This is a longer example that might work, jestjs/jest#8295 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45743548/custom-matcher-in-jest, but didn't test + understand it even less than the previous example.
There were some changes in the interfaces - maybe it is about that styled-components/jest-styled-components#270 ?
