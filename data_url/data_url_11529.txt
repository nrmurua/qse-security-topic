Function evaluation takes inadequate time in recent versions of Qiskit.
I checked Qiskit performance for VQE-UCCSD simulation of LiH molecule. Full simulation with 12 qubits can not be performed starting from version 0.19.4 (at least first function evaluation takes more than half an hour!). The same calculation with 0.19.3 version takes 5.20 sec for the first evaluation.
I also checked 6 qubit simulation with reduced active space for LiH molecule. Full optimization took 2 sec (user time) using qiskit 0.19.3 and 1 min 20 sec using qiskit 0.23.0.
This makes simulation of large molecules impossible with the latest versions.
Run the gist.
I made a small change to your script and ran it using qiskit 0.23.0, python 3.6.12 and Ubuntu 20.10
It is much faster if you use Aer and qasm_simulator with include_custom=True in VQE which gives the same result as statevector simulator (less than 7 minutes):
The results were:
The VQE setting, include_custom=True, as shown above should be more performant. This initially was the default but we had feedback that qasm_simulator was normally chosen, over statevector, as behavior with shot noise was wanted to be investigated and that it was not the default was problematic as the custom expectation using Aer, as enabled by the above, while its fastest has the same ideal outcome as statevector and people did not expect that.
Since the above should have addressed the original issue I am closing this.
