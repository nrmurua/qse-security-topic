I had to rebuild the Rust components to include the recent rust-based Sabre mapper.  After doing so the Python kernel immediately crashes upon import zsh: killed     ipython.
I am assuming it is a Rust issue and/or the fact that there was a major update to the OS and compiling toolchain today.
Kernel crash
Try to run master on an M1 mac
It works
I am not sure
It is likely not the toolchain update as an Intel mac works fine.
As a brief check, does it work with a non-beta rustc?  If you installed from rustup, I think you can run rustup override set stable in the Terra repo root, and it should pull 1.63-stable instead.
(Given our Rust code is pretty simple and works on other platforms, it seems odd that it'd be our code, but who knows.  There's surface area for it to sneak it in the Python/Rust binding layer as well.)
Many thanks for the pointer. That does indeed solve it. I guess I was on a beta channel from early M1 days. Funny that 1.62 beta failed, 1.64 failed, but 1.63 is good. The Goldilocks effect I guess.
