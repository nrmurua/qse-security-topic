All contributors is nice but hard to keep updated. Unless there is strong opposition, let's remove this in favor of the automated GH tool.
It has been decided at the Mitiq meeting to opt for an automation of the all-contributors tool. This could be done with a Github Action.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
I'm in strong favor of removing allcontributors as well. IMO it's a larger burden than benefit. Reopening.

Are there repos you know of that do this?
After searching around some more, I've found the allcontributors CLI but unfortunately it does not provide any ongoing automation. As far as I can tell, it's the same amount of work as using the bot through comments. (which we are not very good at)
I have not found any projects using GH actions to automate this. Any objections to remove the bot? @nathanshammah @Misty-W
