These should be named a little bit better.
parse-quil makes sense. Not obvious what parse-quil-string should be named... parse-quil-and-transform maybe? @stylewarning thoughts?
I’d rather make PARSE-QUIL be something more complex, like PARSE-QUIL-INTO-RAW-PROGRAM or so. Maybe the parse+transform can be the simple one PARSE-QUIL.
Justification: the transforms also do some semantic analysis, like resolving gate names and checking arity. It’s also the DWIM function, whereas the raw parsing just gives you a barebones AST representation back that’s hardly immediately useful.
The only questionable thing this “parsing” function does is expand INCLUDEs+circuits.
Counter thoughts? More name ideas?
That makes sense actually. How would you feel about having the applied transforms be an optional argument to the function, so I don't have to go out of my way to customize the transform pipeline?
@notmgsk I like that idea a lot
