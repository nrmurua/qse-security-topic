MWE:
Should be solved by traits in 0.4.
Since we decided not to have matrix traits, but to make all the blocks to have matrix, this bug is back. It probably can be solved by adding a check to each routines that generates the matrix.
adding a check to each routines
you mean add a check for every mat function?
Routines like unmat etc.
I think, we should probably fix it in the PermMatrix level? Is this behavior same for dense arrays?
No it's just because some routines didn't check the proposed size. And the location integer just overflow then you get an empty matrix. You can't solve this from LuxurySparse. The constrictor knows nothing about the potential overflow.
I would suggest not considering it as a bug
Program should not be blamed for stupid errors made by human beings.
It's OK for << to overflow, that's its definition and it's explicit enough. We don't have any explicit expression here, which make it not intuitive. It's apparently hard to guess this is because integer overflow.
Trying to get a matrix of size 1<<100 is already very strange. Any using case?
The point is unless you input 1<<100, or we should throw an error.
It's not about anything else but correctness.
Agree if it does not increase a lot of codes.
