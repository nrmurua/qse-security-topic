This borks people who don't have a newer matplotlib installation.
Is it possible to not have this dependency?
Which version of matplotlib should i use to try to reproduce?
@dabacon Ping. Would love an example program that does this too.
I cannot reproduce this with matplotlib down to 2.2.2 (March 2018).  Before that, matplotlib won't install for me due to too many conflicts.
I think this may have been a python2 bug.  Closing this.  We can always re-open if it reoccurs.
