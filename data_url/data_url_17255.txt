Could you provide the image files you generate when running this test? It is passing for me using master and osx at the moment.

Looking at this, it looks that maybe it is calling my installed version instead of the dev directory where the tests are located. I say that because those missing elements are part of a visualization refactoring
Actually that is not the issue. Here is what is being drawn, and looks to be basically the same as the reference.

This could be a whitespace issue - with different matplotlib backends on OSX sometimes there is more/less whitespace around the circuit than there is in the reference image. This test is being modified with the removal of temp files in #2514, so it might be worth waiting until that is merged and seeing if that fixes this issue.
This now appears to be resolved.
