This kind of QC: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_quantum_computer
I am curious if I can run this type of graph based QC.
Thanks,
Jon
Hey Jon,
I'm actually looking into making some examples of one-way computing using this library. It's possible in principle by reusing qubits as they are measured, but it's not ergonomic. If you have any suggestions for an API that's better suited to this let me know, otherwise I'll brainstorm and add some stuff over the next month or two.
TLDR: yes it's possible but could be better.
