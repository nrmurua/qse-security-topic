Right now when a user tries to make a new component via the QLibrary in GUI (by clicking the .py file and filling out the QCPE), they will have a tough time entering in nested dictionaries as params (for example options, which can often be a dict of dicts of dicts).
This is tough because the nested scroll areas can be too tiny and the QLineEdits too short.
See if it's possible to have QCPE autoresize sub scroll areas (example: options param entry) and QLineEdits to maximize real estate for whichever parameter the user is currently entering
Try creating a TransmonPocket with lots of nested options
