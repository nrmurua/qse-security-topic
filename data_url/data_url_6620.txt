Nothing is installed if the CMake flag -DTWEEDLEDUM_PYBINDS=OFF. (i.e. make install does nothing after configuring & building).
I'm not the most well-versed in CMake/C++ library building, but it seems to me that at least the *.so should be installed if the python bindings are not installed.
Relevant code:

This is due to the fact that, originally, tweedledum was a header-only C++ library. Now, this is not the case anymore; Mainly because to do python bindings I needed a shared library.
I will have a look into this and find the best way to make it available as a C++ library.
Closing b/c after the update to v1.1.0 the *.h files and libtweedledum.a are installed to the output.
