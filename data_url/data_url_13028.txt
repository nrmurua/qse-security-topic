When partitioning the 5 qudit QFT circuit (code below), the resulting unitaries are all permutation matrices. Examining the CircuitGates formed during partitioning, it appears that the location of the gates is correct but parameters are all 0.0.
I created a minimal example:
This happens because the CircuitGate is a Gate, and all gates don't store any parameters. Operations, which contain gates, store parameters. In the above example, if we store the parameters before the fold and then use those to retrieve the unitary, the assert passes:
Found the issue. During folding, the CircuitGate operation was not being created with the circuit's parameters. Will be fixed momentarily.
