Here, the output should be the same as gate_cal.
The changes should be made in qiskit/scheduler/lowering.py. The above currently fails on schedule = gate_cals[(tuple(inst_qubits), tuple(float(p) for p in inst.params))] because float(p) doesn't work if the parameter hasn't been bound. It may be as simple as only calling float(p) when p.parameters is empty (aka, all values have been bound to a numeric value).
can I try this one?
@lcapelluto : I'd like to take a stab at this, if that's okay?
Fixed here
