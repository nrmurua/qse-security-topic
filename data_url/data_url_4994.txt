More a question than an issue.
Looks like you're building the develop branch for GPU, which is missing a function added to CPU just yesterday in be4d18f
I'm afraid you'll have to stick to master or a release while we work on develop.
Oops. Forgot I checked out develop and didn't return to master. My bad. Thanks!
No problem, I can give you a shout when we restore GPU on develop - it's just a bit down my TODO!
I should have mentioned earlier (though was on my phone), adding stub
to QuEST/src/GPU/QuEST_gpu.cu will allow develop to compile in the meantime.
Works for me in develop branch, thanks again.
