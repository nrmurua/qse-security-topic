The following code snippet generates a compilation error on quilc 1.25.0 and 1.25.1 (as pulled from DockerHub) and pyquil 3.0.0:
The error is:
This compilation works correctly on quilc 1.23.0 and maps to available qubit indices of the Aspen-9 architecture as expected.
I have observed other similar examples failing, though sometimes re-running them works. This case appears to fail reliably. The root cause may include a stateful behavior in the server.
Note: While I'm not Lisp fluent, I did a Git diff between 1.23.0 and 1.25.0. The error emits from initial-rewiring.lisp which was not modified between 1.23.0 and 1.25.0. However, some fixes for initial rewiring pragmas were made, including something that looks like a "slot bound" check in rpc-server.lisp and calls prog-initial-rewiring. The root cause may be lurking in here?
@mhodson-rigetti I'm not at a computer at the moment, but does adding this at the top of your Quil program change anything?
This is the commit but @notmgsk that @mhodson-rigetti is likely referring to: acf9b16

@stylewarning - No, adding the pragma doesn't avoid the problem.
Thanks for the report, @mhodson-rigetti. I'll take a look today... the obvious/easy solution is to "compress" the logical qubits prior to compilation so that only physical qubits are used. But there might be cases where that breaks / isn't wanted. Also interesting that 1.23.0 doesn't fail so I'll have to diagnose that. Again thanks for the info!
If you come across some more pathological examples, could you attach them here? Cheers
