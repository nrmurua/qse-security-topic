Hi all,
I ran a simple calculation using the attached input file (see cp2k_input.txt) with a prebuilt CP2K 2023 ssmp version provided by Github's release. A molecule contains C, H, Cl, and F atoms. CP2K crashes at the very beginning associated with the input subroutine with the following error message:
I figured out that if I specify the potential for all atomic kinds using the KIND DEFAULT keyword, like this:
it will cause the error. However, if I additionally specify explicit potential for Cl atom kind, like this:
the error will disappear.
So I was wondering if there is something wrong in the input section regarding reading the potential of the corresponding atomic kind from the user-defined potential file or it was just a mistake in my input file.
Thank you in advance for your time.
