Transpiling even a "small" Shor circuit takes a long time:
Small of course is quite large in this case, 14Q to depth ~7k, but it also highlights that a large amount of time is spent doing simple things like init Operators.  Indeed, init, append, set_dims, and compose Operator methods take 15 out of 19 seconds of the transpilation time
Which version of terra are you using and which backend? If you're using the released version (0.16.x) and an ibmq backend (or any backend where the basis is not u1, u2, u3, cx) the 1q optimization pass is inefficient and slow because of it's use of operators and other bottlenecks in the 1q synthesis module. The version of that pass on master is significantly faster (see #5682, #5909, #5915, and #5928) and should eliminate the bottleneck.
If you're using master I'll dig into it some more because there are probably other places we've missed.
Yes, this is the latest Qiskit 0.16.4 (on the IQX) and transpiling against a new basis system.  Ok, it seems like this might be addressed already.
Ok, then I'll close this as fixed for the upcoming 0.17.0 release. Feel free to reopen it if needed or there is more to do here.
