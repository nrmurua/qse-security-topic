In #1816 we redefined the instruction class so it didn't carry the qargs and cargs internally. However, this change broke how we were doing dag->circuit and circuit->dag in qiskit.converters.dag_to_circuit() and qiskit.converters.circuit_to_dag() respectively. In that PR the previous method which just created a duplicate object for the input instruction was removed and replaced by a call to copy.deepcopy(). This ends up significantly hurting performance in certain cases and continuous benchmarking is showing a 3x performance regression on simulator transpiler benchmarks in: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/master/test/benchmarks
Remove the deep copy usage
