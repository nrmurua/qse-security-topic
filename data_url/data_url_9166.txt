Description of the issue -
Try to install the library with the developer mode. However, it gives me lots of errors related to the compiler.
Expected behavior: Installation.
Actual behavior: Erros.
I tried to replace the setup.py with the old version setup.py and it works.
Then I tracked to the PR "Refactor setup.py". Maybe there is something wrong with macOS Big Sur 11.4?
Thanks @sylviemonet! Could you post the errors you were getting with compilation?
My gut feeling is that this is due to a change in compilation flags that occurred in #229
Thanks @sylviemonet!

Hey Maria, the fix is ready to merge, I just need an approval from a dev with write access!
Looks like the fix has been merged now. @sylviemonet if you can test with the latest version and let us know if the bug is solved, that would be great, thanks ðŸ™‚
