Expectation is that SAWG and TTL behave the same for events with duration.
The SAWG behavior is not a bug. Replacing events on those channels is supported.
For TTL.pulse() it is also not a bug. Those events do not collide. The rising edge event is replaced as above.
For TTL.pulse() it is also not a bug.
Agreed. I'm not reporting a TTL bug. I'm contrasting the behavior of TTL and SAWG in a similar situation. I expect that same-time event replacement is flagged as an error.
@jordens This issue is about sequence errors (non-increasing timestamps on the same channel), not collisions/replacements.
@jbqubit ttl.pulse() are two events. sawg.smooth() is one event. With one event you can only ever get a replacement or a collision. With two events you can also get sequence errors. you can not compare those two cases.
