While going through the view system configuration here, in the 'View System Configuration in Qiskit' using the graphical method, "backend" is not defined.
import qiskit.providers.ibmq.jupyter
IBMQ.load_account()
provider = IBMQ.get_provider(group='open', project='main')
system = provider.get_backend('ibmq_vigo')
backend
a graphic as shown in the website should appear.
No response
The name backend isn't defined in that code example, it's called system instead.  If you display system instead (i.e. put it alone as the last line of the cell), you should get the printout you expect.
The documentation is hosted on internal IBM repos, and I've filed the bug with them, so it should be updated shortly.  Thanks!
