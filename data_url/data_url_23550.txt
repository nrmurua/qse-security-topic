I tried running qcodes on the jupyter notebook for the 15 minutes intro and it ran into a problem where it couldn't even import the code:
`Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py", line 3326, in run_code
exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)
File "", line 7, in 
import qcodes as qc
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/qcodes/init.py", line 12
config: qcconfig.Config = qcconfig.Config()
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
`
Since my OS is ubuntu 16.04 I had to downgrade panda to 0.24 so it worked along python 3.5.2
qcodes branch
Last stable version
@Danielgb23 We do not support python 3.5. Earliest supported python version is 3.6, If you want to run on an old ubuntu installation I suggest that you install a newer version of python using either anaconda or pyenv
I installed python 3.6 and it worked. I just had to reinstall some thing for it though.
