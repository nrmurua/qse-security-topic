I don't see any way to append a CircuitInstruction directly to a Circuit (working in the Python interface)
Use case: I want to separate out the code for the noiseless QEC circuit from the noise.  So I write the noiseless version.  Then I want to be able to iterate over the circuit and create a new circuit by appending the previous instructions plus new ones for noise (and dealing appropriately with repeat blocks).
I'll definitely add this next version.
A workaround in the meantime is to know the index k of operation as you're iterating (e.g. use for k, op in enumerate(circuit) and do target += circuit[k:k+1] to append the operation. You can also do circuit.append_operation(op.name, op.targets_copy(), op.args_copy()).
This will be in the next python release (no date atm).
