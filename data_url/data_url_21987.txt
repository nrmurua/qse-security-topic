On Windows 10, Artiq 3.2:
The directory 'C:\Users\monroe\Miniconda3\envs\artiq-dev\lib\site-packages\artiq\binaries' does not exist at all.  Instead the files are in 'C:\Users\monroe\Miniconda3\envs\artiq-dev\Lib\python3.5\site-packages\artiq\binaries\kc705-nist_clock' and the command runs successfully as:
@TheCakeIsAPi What happened is conda installed artiq in ...\artiq-dev\lib\site-packages\artiq and artiq-kc705-nist_clock in a different directory,  ...\artiq-dev\Lib\python3.5\site-packages\artiq.
Any idea why?
@sbourdeauducq probably because artiq is noarch: python and artiq-$BOARD is noarch: generic in meta.yaml.
Not sure why.  I would say the bug is in the artiq-kc705-nist_clock package, because it is the only thing at all in Lib\python3.5  Everything else is in Lib\site-packages


@TheCakeIsAPi I move the binary file into the conda searching location, but it is get a new error, see in the picture in attachment.
The command and error is listed in the attachment picture.  The mainly error I suppose is no device found. I use Vivado driver for KC705 board( But the Vivado can flash binary file into KC705 correctly), The operation system is Win10 x64.  The anaconda version is 64x, and degrade to python 3.5.4
Or I can use Vivado to flash the binary file into KC705?
it is get a new error,
So, please open a new issue for it.
I have figure out this problem. After replacing the USB driver with Zadig, that's work correctly.
This is explained in the ARTIQ manual:
