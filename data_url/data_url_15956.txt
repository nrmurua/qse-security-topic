The docstring for OperatorBase.tensor, which is repeated for e.g. PauliOp.tensor, has this explanation of ordering:
But when I try to verify this behavior, the printed circuit is labeled with q_0 at the top, which seems to indicate that actually a Y has been applied to qubit 0, and an X to qubit 1, contradicting the docstring:

I expect the docstring should be changed or clarified to match the actual behavior. It's critical that the ordering convention is clear and consistent for users to be able to use opflow, since the wrong convention can lead to severe but hard-to-find bugs.
I think for the docstring "qubit 0" means the first qubit in the tensor product. But that's not q_0, which is what the docstring is trying to clarify. Probably it would be better to just remove explicit numbers from the phrase, like
I don't think it's worth updating the docs, since this code is obsolete.
