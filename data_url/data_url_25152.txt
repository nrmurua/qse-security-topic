Firstly, thank you for the lovely code. The UI interface is particularly nice and easy to get started with.
One roadblock I've run into is support for recursive functions. For example, the following code snippet doesn't work:
The error message I see on the UI is:
Is this something you would consider supporting in the future?

Thanks for highlighting this! Would love to see this one fixed too! üëçü§û
Hi
I would like to take a stab at this issue. Can you please assign it to me? Thanks
Hi. So I assume to work on this issue, I have to build the Covalent source code locally; however, I can't seem to find instructions on how to do so. Please let me know where to look to do so or if I am approaching this issue wrong.

Hello, can I work on this :)
Thanks @aazam-gh  ! Please feel free to submit a PR whenever you get a chance.
@santoshkumarradha How do i run the job in VS Code? Do i need to create a separate file?  I was able to run some other snippets directly from the python console and see the results in the UI. However this snippet gives me indentation errors.
Hey @aazam-gh, the snippet seems to be working fine when directly clicking the copy icon on the issue code. Maybe you accidentally copied some extra characters?
