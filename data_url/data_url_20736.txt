Hello everyone,
for pqm4 and also the brand new pqm3, we would like to allow implementations to choose from a constant-time AES (e.g., bitsliced) and a potentially variable time AES (e.g., t-table) because t-table implementations are faster for our platforms.
Schemes can then make use of the faster implementation for public inputs (e.g. expanding the matrix A in Kyber), and the constant-time implementation for secret inputs (e.g., Expand in NTRULPRime).
Should this extension of the AES API also go to PQClean? Any opinions on this?
