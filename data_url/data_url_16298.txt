Looking at the test code there are 2 random_circuit calls. I'm thinking we should set a seed on those. I feel like we're triggering a weird edge case in the random circuits that's causing it to fail. That being said I ran the test locally in a loop with: tox -epy -- -n test.python.circuit.library.test_nlocal.TestNLocal.test_add_nlocal_1__5__3_ --until-failure and after 144 executions there were no failures so whatever is going wrong isn't likely to occur.
