libmuparserx.a is for x86 file and not for POWER.
Aer can not be compiled in ppc64le because x86 binary is included in the repository.
Just build on ppc64le
Remove binary or prepare binary for ppc64le and supported architecture.
Yep, we need to build a version of libmuparserx.a for PowePc. Should be easy. I got this.
I've added a ppc64le case to the compile and test Travis stages in PR #554
Looking at the log in #554, the build script for Power is failing to install Terra (because of scipy dependency). Scipy is also a dependence in Aer now due to the pulse simulator so this will be another issue.
