The CVaR measurement is only defined for diagonal observables and the code checks that. It tries to do that efficiently (meaning w/o a conversion to a matrix) but that didn't cover the case for PauliSumOps. Luckily, there's a check in place that raises an error if a large operator is converted to a matrix so this expensive calculation doesn't happen silently.
This issue was seen with the Qiskit QAOA Runtime since there CVaR expectation makes sense to use and we have large qubit numbers.
PauliSumOps should be checked efficiently.
