Sometimes I get a Already executing a measurement error after aborting a loop. But there are no loops running!?

Another situation where I constantly have to restart the notebook.
What to do?
I have the same problem (in Spyder). I have this issue after having started a Loop which failed (in my case due to a AttributeError: Can't pickle local object. Then starting a new loop results in RuntimeRrror('Already executing a measurement', but qc.halt_bg() returns "No loop running".
Now I got this again, right in a measurement. I aborted it with the abort button and now I cant run a new measurement. After realizing what happens in #140 this doesnt surprise me so much anymore, if the measurement is just killed that 'Already exceuting a loop' thing probably doesnt clear that flag...
Until we fix this you can do data_set.close() I think.
How?
I havent restarted the notebook yet, so where would I do this?
I ran the measurement with:
but
gives me
AttributeError: 'DataSet' object and its delegates have no attribute 'close'
Oh sorry, I'm at lunch :)
I changed its name to finalize since the other places I use close it is destructive.
Thought so, but that one didnt work
RuntimeError: ('This mode does not allow finalizing', <DataMode.PULL_FROM_SERVER: 3>)
I have to restart the notebook anyways...
Ah right... I suppose I could allow finalize in that mode, for exactly this situation, but that seems dangerous. The underlying command data_set.data_manager.ask('end_data') should work if you need to do this again before we fix the issue.
Closing for now, but since I didn't manage to reproduce it while writing #151 feel free to reopen if you see the problem again.
