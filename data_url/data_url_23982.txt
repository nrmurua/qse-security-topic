Currently import qiskit_metal does load a lot of things, including PySide2. however PySide2 is not needed for the future plans to make this tool cloud-ready. Thus we should move PySide2 references only within the gui vertical, and only load the gui if needed (no part of the code should depend on them). Is this possible?
