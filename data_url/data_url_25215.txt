Currently, the setup.py file pulls the packages from requirements.txt in the install_requires. To increase the compatibility of Covalent with other packages and to abide by standard Python recommendations, setup.py should only have pins in the install_requires where necessary. requirements.txt is where the pinned versions should exist to reproduce the testing environment.
Source:
It is not considered best practice to use install_requires to pin dependencies to specific versions, or to specify sub-dependencies (i.e. dependencies of your dependencies). This is overly-restrictive, and prevents the user from gaining the benefit of dependency upgrades.
This was alluded to in #1654, but I've now opened a proper issue for it.
Alternatively, the requirements.txt could be removed entirely, the install_requires in setup.py could have versions mostly unpinned, and a new [strict] extras could be added with pinned versions for testing. This approach is less common, however.
