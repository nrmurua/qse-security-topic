Hello,
The default units of scqubits are in Hz (frequencies). However, when doing a Composite Hilbert Space, it seems to me that the unit of the interaction strength is considered to be in rad/s (angular frequencies). Indeed, this is is consistent with the equation written here and with the gap of an avoided crossing, or the frequency of Vacuum Rabi oscillations.
For me, this is very confusing. I think all the parameters we give to scqubits should be all frequencies.
