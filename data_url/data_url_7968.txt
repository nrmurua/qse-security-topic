A new warning is raised when using qutip with numpy 1.25:
photonic-quantum-circuit-simulator-8sWQjw5Q-py3.9\lib\site-packages\qutip\superop_reps.py:241: DeprecationWarning: product is deprecated as of NumPy 1.25.0, and will be removed in NumPy 2.0. Please use prod instead. nq = _nq(q_oper.dims)
Should be a simple fix of renaming np.product by np.prod.
No response
No response
No warnings should be raised
The whole codebase should be searched for np.product
The fix is already merged in the qutip-4.7.X branch (#2178).
I can't say when the patch will be officially released, but I am expecting it to come sooner than later.
Thank you!
