Do end to end of Reaflow package for graph and see if it can be an alternative for reactflow
https://reaflow.dev/

Comments from R&D so far
1.Customization of nodes and edges with appropriate icons being added inside the node is not feasible. Reaflow uses a foreignObject SVG model which may have problems while rendering in safari browser.
2.With the recent npmtrends survey, react-flow-renderer seems to be an overwhelming favorite with better community support than reaflow.

3.Layouting becomes really hard and large node graphs will spread over the view poorly.
