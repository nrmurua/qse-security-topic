We recently repurposed an older Kasli that has been unused for a while. Disclaimer: it's possible that this panic is because of a hardware issue -- I thought we had fixed any hardware issues this board had, but I can't remember for sure.
UART output on boot:
I tried completely erasing and re-flashing the board, to no avail. I'm unable to ping the board or connect with any network-based utilities (like artiq_coremgmt), so I'm not sure what else to try. Any ideas?
Try artiq 7: newer smoltcp.
Also try clearing the config flash parameters.
And decode the backtrace.

That's what I get for using a randomly generated mac address without checking it
