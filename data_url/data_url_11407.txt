There needs to be instructions for how to ask for help, how to report issues and how to contribute.
An example of this is https://github.com/pdebuyl-lab/tidynamics. Other recently accepted JOSS papers are also good examples.
Thanks. I have added a section on README.md for Contact, support, and contribution information following your example.
