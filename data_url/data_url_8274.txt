It might be helpful to say somewhere visible in the documentation what is the value of hbar in the canonical commutation relation [x,p] = i hbar that is used by qutip.
I understand that this is implicit in the value taken for g in the wigner module, but it would be nice making it easier for the user.
Also, note that in the function wigner_covariance_matrix you assume hbar = 1. It would be good to either make this explicit or allow an optional g argument to be passed.
Thanks for your work in this great library!
Thank you for spotting this. Could you help fix it? This would be a https://github.com/qutip/qutip-doc pull request.
Cool. I am more than happy to fix it, but would like to know where should I add this...
You can make two pull requests:
@nquesada just pinging you as it would be great to have your contribution in the upcoming version release in a week or so.
