#1076 is introducing in qibo a way for simulating clifford circuits efficiently, several improvements can still be introduced on top of that though:
EXTRA:
@renatomello did I forget anything?
@renatomello did I forget anything?
The Clifford.to_circuit method, but there is already a #TODO annotation in the code for it
One thing I forgot to mention is that we need a way to enumerate the Cliffords for a given number of qubits. Maybe a conversion from one integer to a symplectic matrix. This is important for quantum_info.random_clifford because it is necessary for randomized benchmarking protocols in qibocal.
@BrunoLiegiBastonLiegi we should also add a few extra methods to the Clifford class, e.g. a compose that composes two Clifford objects, an unitary method like the one in the Circuit class, etc. And I insist we should still have a similar method to the add method of the Circuit class.
@BrunoLiegiBastonLiegi For possible improvements related to the CuQuantum backend you might want to check their documentation to see if there some primitives that you can exploit in your implementation of the clifford backend.
