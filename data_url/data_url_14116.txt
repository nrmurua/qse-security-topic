The implementation makes me wonder if in the future we should have some sort of VF2Scorer class that builds these and holds them as instance data among any other data that is reused between scorings. The reason being to encapsulate the internals of scoring without forcing client code to be aware of them (i.e. rather than threading a bunch of parameters around, we might call a VF2Scorer::score method and pass just the layout).
