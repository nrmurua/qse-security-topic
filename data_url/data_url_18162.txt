When running a qobj in qiskit there is a side effect of adding the results class to the input qobj. If run is called multiple times this happens recursively.
The input qobj to the QuantumProgram.run function should not be modified.
The qobj is modified by inserting a 'result' field containing a circular reference to the original qobj with qobj['result']._qobj.
I traced this problem to the _jobprocessor.JobProcessor._job_done_callback function: Line 106 self.futures[future]['result'] = result should be removed. All current tests pass after removing this line.
Here is an example
Executing this example circuit we have
To see recursion:
