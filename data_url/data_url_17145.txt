Enhance the Gate class with a method for controlling it.
This should return a new ControlledGate (which derives from Gate).
After this implementation, the following should work:
Follow ups:
notes:
1- control currently clashes with a property of the instruction. So let's use the q_if method for now, with the goal of eventually moving to control.
2- The decomposition should be shallow, in the sense that the controlled gate provides a definition only in terms of controlling its subcomponents. It will be the job of the unroller to take this definition recursively until the end and implement a circuit over U3 and CX.
Moving visualization to separate issue, #3223.
