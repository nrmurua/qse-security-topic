These two pages are missing icons:
missing icon for vehicle routing https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/optimization/index.html

Hey @beckykd I want to work on this issue. Do you have the image icons or should I add them according to my own choice?
Hi! I don't have icons.  I just noticed that they are missing.  Thanks!
Hey @bopardikarsoham! Are you still working on this?
Yup @shil-m actually I had performed a PR but had to delete it due to system issues. Now, my system is ok so I will work on it. Do you want to say something @shil-m ?
@bopardikarsoham Not really, I was thinking I could give it a shot if it is still unresolved. Pl go ahead.
Any tutorials without dedicated icons now use the Qiskit logo as the default:
