In this code snippet I set the readout fidelity to 50% and run identities on one qubit. I would expect random bit outcomes, but instead get 0 consistently.
Results in 0
I'm running on this version of the downloaded QVM 0.16.0 (qvm: 0.20.0) [7a368f8]
It's entirely possible that the noise information is getting stripped from pq somewhere in the bowels of run. I think we've only tested it with full NoiseModels set as attributes on the QVM object
it's also possible that your noisy program is named noisy but you run pq
Solved!
