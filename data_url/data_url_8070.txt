Installing qutip with pip install qutip fails on a MacBook Pro with M1 Pro running macOS 12.0.1, due to the build dependency numpy<1.20 failing to build. This happens both with miniconda python 3.9.6 and miniforge python 3.9.7.
Same happens if I clone the master branch and build.
If I edit pyproject.toml and setup.cfg to remove the <1.20  in Numpy, then qutip builds correctly (then I get same problem as Issue #1606 when importing, but that's another story).
Qutip should build against a newer version of Numpy.
Can't get output of Qutip.about(). MacBook Pro 2021 with M1 Pro. Python 3.9.* (miniconda and Miniforge).

Thanks @matteoacrossi. I'm busy addressing this in #1735.
I managed to install it on my M1, using Miniforge.
@j1ver what steps did you follow?
@matteoacrossi I use miniforge but for me the numpy installation just worked. I dont think I changed anything prior to installing numpy etc.
Interesting. Which computer are you using? Which Miniforge version? I'm on the homebrew one.
I use a M1 Pro, miniforge 4.10.3-9 via Homebrew
I have the same issue. M1 + Python 3.9.9
same issue, any solutions so far?
I am back from holiday, so will try sort this out this week.
I've merged #1747. Could those who were experiencing issues building on M1 confirm whether the master branch now builds successfully for them?
I confirm that the master branch builds in a clean Conda python 3.9.9 environment.
I'm still not able to import qutip because of #1606.
@matteoacrossi Thank you for reporting back. Progress at least. I've flagged #1606 as a requirement for the 4.6.3 release.
Thank you for your work @hodgestar! If I work around #1606 (with a try block and putting an arbitrary cpu_freq number) qutip seems to work fine. I think it will be a quick fix. I could even open the pull request myself but I don't know the implications of tweaking the cpu_freq parameter.
I've merged #1747. Could those who were experiencing issues building on M1 confirm whether the master branch now builds successfully for them?
I managed to build 4.6.2 on my M1 Mac!
macOS ver: 12.1
python ver: 3.10.0
build from clean Conda env
Followed the instruction in #1747 and commented out the lines for cpu freq checking in hardware_info.py.
@R0ckySu That's great! #1754 has been merged now so hopefully you no longer need to comment out the CPU frequency checking lines.
And for those who are not using Conda?
Thanks
