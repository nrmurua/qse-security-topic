In single player, if a player takes the blocks from a chest in an escape room, disconnects and then reconnects they end up with an empty inventory and the chest is not reset so the player cannot solve the room (at least not in the way it was originally intended).
I noticed another case where a player could end up in a similar situation: The player goes to the first escape room of a level (this resets their inventory only once per session: the first time they enter that room)
I got the impression that chests are reset when a player solves a puzzle. Perhaps chests (and inventories?) should be reset also in cases where a player leaves a room through various means (portals, walking through previous escape rooms, logout). I assume that backtracing is encouraged to get inspiration from previous puzzle. Resetting the player's inventory and the chest in the escape room each time the player leaves through the door leading to the previous escape room could be seen as an annoyance by players.
