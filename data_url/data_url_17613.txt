I noticed that the result retrieved from backend sometimes do not get padded with zeros correctly (the raw result is in result.data(), and result.get_counts() is supposed to convert from hex to binary and pad any needed zeros.)
All result keys should be 3 bits:
Look in qiskit/result/postprocess.py. The _pad_zeros function is called when format_counts is is called, but not working for some reason.
Hello @ajavadia would you be able to provide some more information on this issue? I am unable to recreate the problem, all the jobs I retrieve have their counts correctly formatted.
@maddy-tod Oh I see what is going on here. This particular job ID that I put in the issue description was a job submitted using qiskit 0.6. Therefore it does not have the same header as jobs submitted via qiskit 0.7, and the header is used for formatting the counts. You are right that jobs submitted using v0.7 are formatted correctly. I'll close this issue as it's just a matter of an old stored job. Thanks for looking into it.
