The python tests seems to be failing every now and then. The following are examples of workflows that failed once and passed on a rerun without any code change:
Note that those filed with different, but both llvm, toolchains. Also, the tests they are failing are different.
Just diagnosed this for the test_sample_n error. It is a poorly designed test on my part. The random angle range is too broad, and can lead to angles close to zero, so the state does not rotate much leading to a high probability that the sample result is close to 00 or 11.

Could not reproduce the bug in https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/actions/runs/5069653639/jobs/9103651939.
Let's wait and see if it pops up again.
