Check if .compile is really needed with the latest tensorflow release. If not, we can remove it.
@andrea-pasquale could you please give a try and let us know if there is some advantage?
Of course, @scarrazza.
Do you want me to check this directly within the PRs that implement the refactor (for example in the abstrtnp branch), or in the master branch?
Here are some results on CPU up to 20 qubits (I slightly modified the code from the qibojit-benchmark repository):
Dry run time:

Simulation time:

From this results I think that we should keep .compile.
Thanks @andrea-pasquale it is clear, however it looks strange to me that a qft with 30 qubits takes only 1e-3s to execute, could you please check if results are correct?
The maximum number of qubits that I've tested is 20 not 30, so I think that they should be correct.
If you want I can increase the number of qubits, I went up to 20 because I was testing this on my laptop.
Thanks @andrea-pasquale, indeed, and I need a high dpi screen.
