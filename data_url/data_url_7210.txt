It can be unwieldy to work in files that have several hundreds or thousands of lines of code.
Often, as projects get larger, files split into folders. Some teams split every class into a separate file, but that has its own issues.
I think folders are better for being able to make small adjustments without having several hundred lines' context in your head.
@jbroz11 it looks like there are decent ways to do this
