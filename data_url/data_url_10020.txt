The Reponse object included an attribute Response.data_vectors that was deprecated and then removed. However, it seems that this was a very useful feature that a lot of users used.
Additional Context
It was originally removed because we changed the way we stored data vectors from a dict-of-lists to a numpy structured array and this format was less performant.
One approach would be
This creates a new dict each time but I am fairly certain that record[field] is a view, not a copy so the performance is not too bad.
We could document other preferred methods in the docstring.
Property solution looks good, just double check the record slice returns a view.
