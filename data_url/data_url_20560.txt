The OpenSSL project team would like to announce the forthcoming release of OpenSSL versions 3.0.6 and 1.1.1r.
These releases will be made available on Tuesday 11th October 2022 between 1300-1700 UTC.
OpenSSL 1.1.1 is a bug-fix release. There are no security issues fixed in this release.
We have received a report of a significant regression in the latest 3.0.6 and 1.1.1r versions. The regression is not thought to have
security consequences. While the regression is further investigated we have taken the decision to withdraw the 3.0.6 and 1.1.1r versions and
instead recommend that users remain on the previous 3.0.5 and 1.1.1q versions for now.
We will issue a new plan for the release of 3.0.7 and 1.1.1s soon.
