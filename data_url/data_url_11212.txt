Hello,
As I am trying to build openfermion for openSUSE Linux, when the test is running it tries to connect to pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov to fetch some packages?
Since building on openSUSE Linux is headless and no internet connection, the test thus fail?
Package in openSUSE must build with no connection because it must be self contain with provided dependencies.
What package is it trying to download? I could make it as another dependency instead.

There are many other connection request, I give one example below.
It looks like you have pubchem installed so the test attempts to use the pubchem package to download the geometry of water.
Here's the culprit.
There is currently a pytest skip if the package is not detected.  Skipping logic should be expanded to include when a connection to the NIH server can't be made.
I pass the --ignore flag to pytest to src/openfermion/utils/_pubchem_test.py and the failure is gone now, but there are other failures that look for internet connection I am not sure about. What is the culprit test file for this one?

Thanks.
Looks like it is running the examples/_examples_test.py. which runs the _openfermion_tutorial.ipynb.  Cell 14 calls pubchem to import the geometry for methane.  The correct fix for this would be to separate pubchem functionality from the main tutorial.

If I make pytest ignore examples/_examples_test.py the test would all fail. But it seems that there are no good way to get around this at the moment? So if I want to package this on a headless server with no internet connection is to just not test?
Not sure what you mean the test would all fail. But I mentioned the correct fix in the previous comment.  Another option could be to set up a mock for the test.  Are you interested in taking this fix?
I think it is related to this issue. #481
