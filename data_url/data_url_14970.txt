On Aprils 20th, 2023 @mtreinish demoded transpiler support for disjoint/multi-chip devices. When that demo is ran with optimization_level=0, this exception raises:
Take the cells 5 to 9 from https://github.com/Qiskit/feedback/blob/main/demo-day-notebooks/2023-04-20/1_terra_0.24.ipynb.
Add optimization_level=0 to the transpile call
it should work as in other optimization levels.
It seems like a problem in the level 0 workflow, which sets a layout prematurely, without considering the disjoint scenario.
This is working as intended, level 0 does not set a layout it always uses a trivial layout. If you want to use level 0 with a disjoint coupling map you either need to hand lay it out so no connectivity is required across connected components, or set the layout_method argument. This behavior was discussed at the time and this was was the consensus on the desired/expected behavior when running with level 0.
