in random_density_matrix the code
does not produce a Haar measure, as the np.random.rand() function provide a uniform distribution over [0,1).
np.random.rand(dim, k_param) should be remplaced by  np.rand.randn(dim, k_param)
Hello @BCasale . Thank you for your comment and for opening up an issue on toqito!
Indeed, this is a nice catch, @BCasale ! I've gone ahead and put in a fix here:
#138
On another note, the UnitaryFund will be putting on UnitaryHack in the early spring of this year. If you're not familiar, this is a yearly hackathon that focuses on adding new features and fixing bugs for open-source quantum-themed software projects. For the past two years, the toqito project has been a participating project, and I hope to include it this year as well.
As is usual with these types of hackathons, certain projects offer cash bounties for their completion. I've had a great time participating in these events as a maintainer, and I hope you consider participating and contributing to toqito when the hackathon occurs!
For context, I'll put the link to last year's UnitaryHack here:
https://unitaryhack.dev/
In the meantime, happy to chat with you about nonlocal games and interesting problems that might lend themselves nicely to toqito :)
Closing the issue. Thank you again for your contribution!
