Now Liquid uses “.NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1“  which is higher for portability, such as Ubuntu.

You need to upgrade your runtime library. The simplest thing to do would be:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
The changes were actually tested on Ubuntu, so this should work fine. Please re-open this if it continues to be a problem after you update your system. Thanks!
