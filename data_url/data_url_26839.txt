DBCSR's build system is slightly changed with the introduction of cp2k/dbcsr#184.
When upgrading DBCSR to the newest release, the variable CXXOMPFLAGS should be removed from the arch files and from tools/toolchain/scripts/generate_arch_files.sh (essentially reversing PR #345).
Instead, the variable CXXFLAGS should contain the OpenMP compilation flags.
