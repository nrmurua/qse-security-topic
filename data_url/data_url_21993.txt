Drivers that are useful without ARTIQ (and where you can expect someone doesn't want to pull in all the ARTIQ dependencies) or drivers that pull in other dependencies (hidapi for lda or libusb/pyusb for newfocus8742) should be separate.
where you can expect someone doesn't want to pull in all the ARTIQ dependencies
Those drivers currently require ARTIQ as a dependency, in particular for the aqctl_ part.
IMO the sanest way to deal with that, with buggy conda in mind, is simply not to list ARTIQ as a dependency and then people have to install it manually to have the corresponding features working.
