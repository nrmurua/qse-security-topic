Description of the issue
The test test_state_preparation_via_coherent_alias_sampling in state_preparation_test.py is sensitive to qubit counts. the circuit it builds has ~25 qubits, more than this and the test fails due to OOM.
The test doesn't use the hight level circuit it builds but rather its decomposition. so every time we add a new decomposition that uses ancilla we increase the qubit count of the circuit in the test which the test fail.
How to reproduce the issue
multiple ways.
Either remove any of the workarounds we are using to reduce the qubit count or reduce the epsilon parameter of the test
