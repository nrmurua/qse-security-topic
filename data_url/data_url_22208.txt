I am attempting to speed up some of the code I use for submitting pulses to the RTIO by converting to machine units in prepare (using artiq 2.0).  When I try to call artiq.coredevice.dds.frequency_to_ftw in prepare, I get an error TypeError: 'width' is an invalid keyword argument for this function.  A test experiment is below:
Would it be possible to make this work (analogous with issue #529)?
