The pulse figures should support the ability for an ax to be provided on which the figure will be drawn. See Seaborn for an example.
Is this issue still open? Can I work on it if it is?
@godspeed5 Hi! If you can take over this issue, that would be great. I don't quite have the bandwidth now, plus I think all the changes I made originally are now in conflict with the updated version of Qiskit :/ I'm so sorry!
@nkanazawa1989 will this still be required in light of #5101?
If I'm not wrong @nkanazawa1989 has resolved this already?
Looking at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/e784e743018676a7d497ec7ab9b8b1265b65fa5a/qiskit/pulse/schedule.py#L641 it does not yet seem possible.
I think the ax are being set differently here (Here's where the main stuff seems to be happening for the function you mentioned)
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/b9c60d95a39a07b789454a634c5a45931bd25fc0/qiskit/visualization/pulse/matplotlib.py#L303
I see here the Figure is being created https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/b9c60d95a39a07b789454a634c5a45931bd25fc0/qiskit/visualization/pulse/matplotlib.py#L796, if an ax could be supplied would it be possible to use this instead? Looking at this the problem may be that the _draw_table adds it's own subplots so maybe this is not possible and this issue should be closed?
Could you give an example code snippet that would utilize the ax input?
This is now supported.
