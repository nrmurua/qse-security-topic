In https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/pulse/configuration.py, there is an LORange and LOConfig which exist only to verify that the received freqs are between a min and a max. This comes from the backend and is used only by assemble, not anywhere in the pulse module.
These two classes should be deleted (deprecated if necessary, although I don't think it would be considered user facing) and wherever it is used, it should be replaced with something to the effect of if not (min_freq < freq < max_freq): raise <custom error>.
The user API should not change, and the behavior should not change for any input.
Can I work on the issue?
sure thing @saktar-unr I've assigned to you. Let us know if you have any questions, and make sure to refer to the contributing guidelines too ðŸ˜„
@lcapelluto, Can you explain me what should be the expected behavior? LORange and LOConfig class are used in some test code. If I remove LORange and LOConfig class, should I make changes to all the files that used the classes?
Hi @saktar-unr I believe Lauren explained in the description that:
wherever it is used, it should be replaced with something to the effect of if not (min_freq < freq <  max_freq): raise <custom error>,
so if there are tests that use LORange and LOConfig you can probably replace with that. Also if you remove the classes then you can also remove the tests for those classes ðŸ˜„
can i take this issue? i would like to start my first Contribution from here. @javabster
Hi @jade-emperror welcome! Tt looks like the last contributor is no longer working on this so yes I will assign you. As this is your first contribution please make sure to read the contributing guidelines, and let us know if you have any questions!
@javabster i have finished the set up of qiskit-terra and i executed tox to  know about the existing test percentage. it throwed me the following error.
RuntimeError: This version of jaxlib was built using AVX instructions, which your CPU and/or operating system do not support. You may be able work around this issue by building jaxlib from source. 
do i have to build jaxlib from source or am i missing something?
