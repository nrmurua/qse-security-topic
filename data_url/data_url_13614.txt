We are giving some talks about Mitiq as well as participating to workshop and conferences. It would be nice to add this information to the Wiki, just as it has been done for the Mitiq pre-alpha workshop. In addition to keeping track of things for the future, this could be useful for prospective attendees.
That would be helpful, can't find right now

Nice, thanks
