Hello! I am working on packaging in nixpkgs, and we have updated to pybind11 2.11.1. I am sorry I know nothing about pybind11. Is it a dependency whose version can be relaxed to support this?
Are you referring to the version declared in WORKSPACE (for the Bazel build) or in pyproject.toml (for the setup.py build)?
The Bazel one is quite hard to loosen because e.g. it declares a sha256 hash. The setup.py one can probably be changed from ==2.9.2 to ~=2.11. If the tests pass, it should be correct.
Thank you for the fast reply! I'm referring to the pyproject.toml one. If you don't mind, I can create a PR and we can see.
Go for it.
