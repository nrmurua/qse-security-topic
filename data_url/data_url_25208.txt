This issue is largely a mirror of AgnostiqHQ/covalent-slurm-plugin#74, but I feel like the cause may be independent of the plugin so am posting here too.
Basically, when passing in the executor keyword argument to the @ct.lattice decorator, there are situations where the configuration parameters of the executor object are being ignored in place of those found in the covalent configuration file.
Start from a clean Covalent configuration. Then run the following, with the slurm-covalent-plugin installed.
The username should be registered as "user". However, the error message received is "username is a required parameter in the Slurm plugin" because it is being interpreted as the default value and because I am starting from a clean Covalent configuration where username has not been set in the configuration file.
This does not happen when the executor kwarg is passed to the @ct.electron decorator --- only the @ct.lattice decorator.
No response
Closed in #1736! Yay!
