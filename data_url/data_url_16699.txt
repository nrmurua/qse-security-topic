When executing a quantum circuit with an initialize gate, if the gate is given a complex numpy array, python crashes upon calling result().
Outputs:
Replacing Aer with BasicAer fixes this.
Does not crash.
I don't know if this is a problem with Terra or Aer. A workaround could be converting the numpy array to a normal list when creating the initialize gate.
