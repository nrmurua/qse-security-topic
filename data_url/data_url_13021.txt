In order to support topology-aware synthesis via search, the layer generator needs to be able to take a topology as input.  This could be done in the SimpleLayerGenerator.
Topology information should either be generated at the beginning of pass execution or by a LayoutPass (soon-to-come). This information can be passed directly to all the other passes via the data dict. The LayerGenerator, I believe, also has access to this dict. The passes should assume all-to-all connectivity if no topology information is found in the data dict.
