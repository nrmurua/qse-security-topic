What features should be in place before we consider a 1.0 release?
There definitely need to be a number of Quality of Life improvements. Many of the APIs are bulky and not idiomatic rust.
A lot of the oddities come from the UnitaryBuilder trait not allowing generics (because many of the functions take &mut dyn UnitaryBuilder, undoing all the dyns could be quite an undertaking since it would make it harder to make ops which hold Boxed functions (or those boxed functions wouldn't be able to in turn call the unitary builder for certain tasks). There's likely a more elegant way to rewrite this worth thinking about.
