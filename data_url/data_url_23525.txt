Sorry for multiple questions again...
After uninstalling and reinstalling qcodes(#2824),
now I think I have a link to the cloned source code.
However, now I cannot register parameter:
measurement.register_parameter(qdac.ch02.v)
gives
ValueError: Can not register object of type <class 'qcodes.instrument.parameter.Parameter'>. Can only register a QCoDeS Parameter.
Somehow, after restarting computers, qcodes and all the other things, this error disappeared.
I do not know what was the problem but sorry for this inconsiderate post.
Hi @erikawa-e that does indeed look odd. Since the issue seems to have fixed it self I will close this. Please let us know if you see the issue again and we can have a look
OK, thank you for your help!
