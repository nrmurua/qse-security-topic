Dear developers,
I'm failing to install qutip on Ubuntu 18.04 via pip. The error output says:
How can I solve this issue?
Regards
PS: The relevant software versions are
python3 3.6.8
python3-venv 3.6.7
qutip 4.4.1 (The version I tried to install.)
Thank you for reporting it. Hope we can assess this. It is not a solution, but just in case it can help you, maybe with conda things work more smoothly, if that is a suitable option for you.
I filed the bug report even though there is no bug. My apologies.
