_get_node_name is an internal getter in Result that connects to the DB to return the node name. This needs to be removed from Result as client side objects can't be aware of the DB.
_get_node_name is called once in execution.py. That call should be changed so that execution.py has its own logic to get the value from the DB.
Acceptance Criteria
Functionality to get the node name from the in memory Result was added in 3292926
