Describe the Feature Request
Renderer of processor produces non aesthetic circuits, where components are not nicely aligned as a human would do. See the attached pictures. The reason is coming from automatic placement of the components that do not take into account global symmetry/semantic of the circuit
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
In a notebook, or editor with support of matplotlib renderer:
Expected behavior
In such interferemoter, we expect some alignement of the beamsplitters that cannot naturally be achieved because of the intermediate phaseshifters
When defining a circuit, we should have a way to give horizontal grid position (x_grid in the code below)
Additional context
In notebook, a svg renderer is used (perceval/rendering/canvas/svg_canvas.py), in editor, matplotlib renderer is used (perceval/rendering/canvas/mplot_canvas.py)
Hello, I would like to work on this issue. Any tips/suggestions to get started?
