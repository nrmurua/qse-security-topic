There seems to be an issue when deploying the documentation website for Qiskit Metal. See screenshots below or e.g. the example on resonator meandering. As a quick fix, checking out the notebooks directly on github is fine but it would be nice to view them normally on the website too.
Cheers!


This problem has been solved after this PR merged.
Thanks!
