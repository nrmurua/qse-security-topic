Hello, I want to solve  problems in optomechanics with QuTip  but I don't know which packages(mathmp, sympy,sympsi,..) must be used. please guide me about writing QuTip programs for optomechanical systems. also, I want to know in steady state, how I can plot a quantity(like variance) versus variables other than time.
The correct place to ask this type of question is the help group:
https://groups.google.com/d/forum/qutip
However, see the example here:
https://github.com/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/examples/example-optomechanical-steadystate.ipynb
