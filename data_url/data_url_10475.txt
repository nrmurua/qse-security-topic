Description
I expected that chimera_graph(m) or chimera_graph(m,m) would have be a m-by-m lattice but instead am getting a row of length mxm.
To Reproduce
This gives:

Additional context
Add any other context about the problem here.
I think this is a problem with the inspector and not the chimera graph generator.

@boothby, the output of dnx.chimera_graph(4) includes node 40, 44, 45, 46, 47, 41, 42, 43. I had expected C4 nodes to be [0, 1 .. 8x4, 8x16, 8x16+1, ... 8x20, 8x20+1, ...]
But I guess that assumes C4 as a subgraph of C16.
Thanks!
You can get that subgraph as follows:
Thanks, @boothby, I just changed the first line to g = dnx.chimera_graph(16, node_list=qpu.nodelist, edge_list=qpu.edgelist) to account for available qubits & couplers, and that works perfectly:
