The how-to for creating and assigning a custom executor currently does not work as expected because of the recent changes made in order to minimize the usage of pickling/unpickling on covalent server. This actually requires that the custom executor be importable by the executor_manager in order for it to be reconstructed and used by covalent.
Furthermore, we want to remove the hardcoded Timing Executor from covalent/executor/executor_plugins/timing_plugin.py such that the tutorial and functional test for the how to work by leveraging the updated functionality of custom executors.
