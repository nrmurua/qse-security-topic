I'm opening this issue to clarify which is the least significant qubit in Qibo.
In other words, if we want to map the qubit indices from a binary string to a decimal number, e.g. for indexing the state vector or measuring samples in decimal form, there are two options:
In config.py it is stated that the least significant qubit is 0:

But I believe that, at least with measurements, 0 is the most significant qubit. Is this consistent in the whole code?
