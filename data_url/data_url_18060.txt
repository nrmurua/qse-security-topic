Can you edit the issue and elaborate a bit? I believe you actually want to refer mostly to the tearDown() method, which was introduced due to the implications of import qiskit bringing the wrappers' _DEFAULT_PROVIDER as it is a module variable, and ends up being initialized only once per test suite.
You're right but I don't know for sure. That's part of the issue, I think. When I gain more insight, I will elaborate on the description.
I did not realize this is not product-code but part of the testing infrastructure. My bad, sorry.
