When using FakeBackends there are multiple calls to noise_model.from_backend that lead to hug performance hits. E.g from profiling one VQE run, 40 out of 58 seconds is just building noise models repeatedly:
However, doing the building direct in Aer removes all of this overhead.  Namely:
is dramatically faster.
I am guessing this is because FakeBackend was created before Aer had this capability.
This should be fixed by: #7912 I've tagged it for backport to 0.20.1 (which will hopefully go out next week).
