I try to run the bell state circuit on the quantum simulator and the rigetti device. Both of them give me the error "'Braket' object has no attribute 'get_device'"
To reproduce
I tried the code below with both pip version and the github version. The errors were the same for both.
Expected behavior
This should run the code on the respective simulators or devices.
