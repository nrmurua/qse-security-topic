Currently we emit DeprecationWarning for qiskit.get_backend(), asking the user to use individual providers.
But we silently fix it when the user does qiskit.compile(circuit, "backend_name") and qiskit.execute(circuit, "backend_name"). We should probably guide the user here as well.
Iâ€™m going this in examples
