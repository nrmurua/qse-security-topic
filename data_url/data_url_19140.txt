Add an example notebook that optimizes the transfer from state 1 to state 3 in a Lambda-sytem, with a Pump and a Stokes laser, without dissipation, and in the rotating wave approximation.
At a technical level, this is mainly to illustrate (and test) the use of complex control fields.
Prerequisite for #13
@karl-horn So this example will now mainly illustrate how to rewrite complex control fields into two real control fields, see How to optimize complex control fields  in the documentation.
@karl-horn Any progress on this?
@karl-horn Any progress on this?
I have been a bit occupied by other stuff until now, so I haven't gotten started yet.
I will try to work on in the next few days.
