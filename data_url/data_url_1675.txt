See PR #4080  The Notebook Tests against PR test fails for a PR with no real change in the PR.
I suspect this is coming from IPython 7.23 see the release notes here
https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/whatsnew/version7.html
Testing adding matplotlib-inline as a dependency in the requirement file for the test.

Did not fix.
I opened ipython/ipython#12941 - downgrade to ipython==7.22 fixes it, they released 7.23 yesterday, hence the breakage.  #4082 will fix it temporarily by pinning to 7.22
Some more color: from this discussion https://www.reddit.com/r/voidlinux/comments/n2nxyd/matplotlib_inline_broken_after_most_recent_update/gwky6c9/ and this PR (void-linux/void-packages#30616) it seems it's a bug...but we'll see, for now I think we can safely pin to 7.22. If ipython takes https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/12940/files then we'll be fine probably with 7.24.
This is now fixed in #4077.
