Multiply Paulis is supposed to be supported in pauli.py
when testing it throws a TypeError.
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'list' and 'int'
from qiskit.tools.qi.pauli import Pauli
pauli_1 = Pauli([1,0,0],[0,0,0])
pauli_2 = Pauli([0,1,0],[0,0,0])
mult_pauli = pauli_1*pauli_2
Paulis are supposed to be constructed using numpy arrays, e.g.
pauli_1 = Pauli(np.array([1,0,0]),np.array([0,0,0]))
Then the multiplication works.
