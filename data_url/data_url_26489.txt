Hi CP2K group,
I was testing the consistence in total energies with different version of CP2K with a 5-atom metalic system.
I kept the input the same and grep the total energy from the output, as listed below:
test-2022.out: ENERGY| Total FORCE_EVAL ( QS ) energy [a.u.]:             -590.007000597674619
test-9.1.out: ENERGY| Total FORCE_EVAL ( QS ) energy [a.u.]:             -590.007000597715887
test-8.2.out: ENERGY| Total FORCE_EVAL ( QS ) energy [a.u.]:             -590.007000597679507
test-7.1.out: ENERGY| Total FORCE_EVAL ( QS ) energy (a.u.):             -590.137753139325127
test-6.1.out: ENERGY| Total FORCE_EVAL ( QS ) energy (a.u.):             -590.137753139571487
As you can see there's a huge energy difference between verion 7.1 and later versions as it's just a 5 atom system.
The cp2k binaries were downloaded from github directly.

Hi Fayette,
Without any further information, your observation may be caused by changes in basis sets or pseudo potentials or bugs in libraries. It is easier to pin it down if you provide your input files and the geometry and maybe the two relevant output files.
Best,

Hi Frederick,
Thank you for your reply!
I calculate the same input with different binaries, so it shouldn't be related with the basis sets or pseudo potentials.
Here I list the difference between the output of 7.1 and 8.2:


Thank you!

Okay, the geometry did not change. But without knowing the actual method, noone can help you. Can you also provide the input file and the geometry?
Dear both,
Sorry for my late reply!
Here attach my output.
I am studying Iron oxide with GGA+U, using OT.
As it's just a test, I was using a 1x1x1 unit cell.
8.2.txt
7.1.txt

I'm going to close this as it seems to be a stale usage issue. If you're still having this problem please post you question in our user forum.
