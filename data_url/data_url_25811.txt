The workflow for building read-the-docs (RTD) fails when pull requests are opened on the development branch.
A pull request on the development branch would attempt to build RTD and fail.
The workflow for building RTD should succeed on every pull request action.
RTD fails when trying to generate the documentation using Sphinx, possibly due to missing modules or missing attributes in the html content. This needs to be investigated. The build fails at the execution step below
/home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/covalent/envs/197/bin/python -m sphinx -T -E -b html -d _build/doctrees -D language=en . _build/html
Closing this issue because RTD build succeeds consistently
