Goal: Test amplitude-dependence of up-conversion.
Expectation: Up-conversion is all digital. Spectral content should not vary with amplitude. That is,
digital mixer should have no amplitude-dependent non-linearity.
Observation: for a>0.5 spurious output exceeds 0 dBc.
What do you mean by "spurious output"?
Your initial expectation is incorrect. Spectral content will vary with amplitude. There is truncation and there is limiting.
Obviously, once you add two oscillators with amplitudes of 0.5 each you get more than the DUC (and the DAC) can handle. The limiter will clip and produce harmonics. That can't be surprising.
Then finally, you are exacerbating the effect by reproducing #743
Good point. With the range in this example the combined amplitude exceeds 1 and I shouldn't have an expectation of this working. My bad.
See below for an example that better demonstrates the amplitude-dependence I see.
Case 1: a <0.4 I observe that for all combinations of f1 and f2 spurrs are < -50 dBc. Great!
Case 2: a = 0.49 I observe that for some combinations of f1 and f2 spurrs are > -20 dBc. Is there a reason why the gateware can't include enough headroom to prevent this from happening?
Hopefully Case 2 is remedied by fixing #743. Please reopen #743.
The gateware has headroom to prevent this from happening.
Please don't try to dictate our issue workflow. We have explained the procedure to you multiple times.
There are no unusual spurs that appear when running the following test code. OK. Confirmed fixed.
