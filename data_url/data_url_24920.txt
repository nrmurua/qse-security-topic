Hey everyone,
I was trying the new features of the Scqubits library, specifically explorer, which I happen to stuck with an error occurring while the function tries to calculate dispersive shifts. The error I get is "Key Error: chi_osc1_qbt0" and python traces it back to "sweep.sweep_data[data_key]" function. Please tell me if I'm simply missing something. Here is how I get to the error (in here I basically follow the example 1 the fluxonium coupled to resonator):
`
%matplotlib inline
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import scqubits.utils.sweep_plotting as splot
import scqubits as qubit
from scqubits import HilbertSpace, InteractionTerm, ParameterSweep, Explorer
qbt = qubit.Fluxonium(
EJ=35,
EC=0.14,
EL=35,
flux=0.0,
cutoff=110,
truncated_dim=9
)
osc = qubit.Oscillator(
E_osc=9.05,
truncated_dim=5
)
hilbertspace = qubit.HilbertSpace([qbt, osc])
interaction = InteractionTerm(
g_strength=0.2,
hilbertspace = hilbertspace,
op1=qbt.n_operator(),
subsys1=qbt,
op2=osc.creation_operator() + osc.annihilation_operator(),
subsys2=osc
)
interaction_list = [interaction]
hilbertspace.interaction_list = interaction_list
param_name = '$\Phi_{ext}/\Phi_0$'
param_vals = np.linspace(-0.5, 1.5, 500)
subsys_update_list = [qbt]
def update_hilbertspace(param_val):
qbt.flux = param_val
sweep = ParameterSweep(
param_name=param_name,
param_vals=param_vals,
evals_count=10,
hilbertspace=hilbertspace,
subsys_update_list=subsys_update_list,
update_hilbertspace=update_hilbertspace
)
#explorer fail to calculate the "chi". The error is "KeyError: 'chi_osc1_qbt0'".
explorer = Explorer(
sweep=sweep,
evals_count=10
)
explorer.interact()`
@petergthatsme I checked: this is fixed in the current master already. We could consider pushing another release, though I can wait if you'd like to include the noise code as well.
@faridhassani You can try to check out either master or jk-devel from github, if you need a solution very quickly.
@jkochNU i would probably say let's just release your latest changes, and maybe do another release once the noise stuff is there. There has been lots of under-the-hood stuff that's recently changed, so maybe even better this way.
This should be fixed with the new release of v1.2 that we just pushed to PyPi and conda-forge. @faridhassani Please confirm, so I know whether I can close this issue.
Its fixed (^_^). Thanks.
Excellent, closing this as resolved.
