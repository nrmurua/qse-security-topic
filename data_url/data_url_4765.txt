I am trying to run the following circuit where two modes are prepared in a two-mode Fock state and are sent into an interferometer:
when I try to run it I get the following sequence of errors:

This is the output of sf.version():
A (possibly) related issue is that when I remove the line with the interferometer and do state.ket() I get nothing back.
@nquesada What is the shape of in_state in your code?
It is [15, 15], I believe, which should be fine (unless I am forgetting a detail about the Ket operation!)
From a quick glance at the code example above, it seems to have a shape of (15,)
Just trying to understand here: the text says the goal is to create a two-mode Fock state, but it seems that only a one-mode Fock state is created in code.
Is the code given above exactly the code that gives the error?
I think you are right @co9olguy in_state should be equal to ketn not ketn1
Sorry for all the confusion. It was my fault. The shape of the input numpy array was wrong.
@nquesada Does computation execute successfully when corrected code is run?
Yes it does.
