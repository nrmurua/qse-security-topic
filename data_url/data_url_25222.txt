Assuming this is in the UI, it would be nice to have a toggle to hide any electrons not explicitly specified by the user, eg as shown here #1589 with things like __getitem__.
We are starting out with just the post processing electron for now @arosen93 . We will look into the other non user specified electrons as well as a separate issue.

Tested and observed to be working fine.
