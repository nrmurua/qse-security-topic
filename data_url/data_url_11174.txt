Hi!
I have one_body_tensor and a two_body_tensor corresponding to an InteractionOperator from a Hamiltonian.
How can they be converted to MolecularData.one_body_integrals or MolecularData.two_body_integrals format?
I think the opposite can be done using
according to 
for one body tensor you can take the even or odd indices which will be exactly the one_body_integrals.  The two_body you are correct in scaling by 2.
