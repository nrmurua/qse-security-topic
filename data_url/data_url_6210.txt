I can't seem to load initial states in Aer. It always defaults to all qubits in the zero state
backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator') qr = QuantumRegister(2) circ = QuantumCircuit(qr) circ.iden(qr) config = {'initial_state': np.array([0, 0, 1, 1j])} result = execute(circ, backend, shots=1, config=config).result() print(result.get_statevector(circ)) circ.draw(output='mpl')
I would expect the result to be
[0.+0.j 0.+0.j 0.+0.j 1.+0.j]
Whereas I'm getting [1.+0.j 0.+0.j 0.+0.j 0.+0.j]
I have copied the previous example from this post but I can't get it to work now.
@mvcerezo It looks like you are using an invalid config from an old pre-Aer version of qiskit.
You need to follow the this tutorial and use "initial_statevector" for the backend_options: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/aer/aer_provider.ipynb
In the master branch (and version 0.2 when it is released soon) you should use the intialize circuit instruction directly to set an initial state (see here #82)
@chriseclectic Thank you very much!
