Right now if you do
it gets implicitly sorted so the id() method returns Z1Z2Z3.
However, if you're using exponential_map or something like it, you might encode an ordering that exploits the device topology better. For example: to do exp(Z12*Z13*Z18) on acorn, you would want exponential map to turn that into a ladder of CNOTS that goes 12->18->13 to respect the device topology. At present, it will necessarily give you 12->13->18 which will introduces SWAPs.
There's an actual test for the current (sorting) behavior
so this would be a breaking change cc @ncrubin @willzeng
Another motivation here is that QubitPlaceholders aren't sortable
