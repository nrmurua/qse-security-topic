Installing the requirement tensorflow==2.1.0 sometimes fails with the error THESE PACKAGES DO NOT MATCH THE HASHES FROM THE REQUIREMENTS FILE, for example see the actions here and here
tensorflow/tensorflow#27794 (comment)
As explained above, it seems not TF issue...
Hmmm seems like this could be a networking issue ?
Let's keep an eye on things and if it gets unbearable perhaps as a quick fix, we can drop the hash check on the downloads.
See this. It seems it's an underlying issue of Github Actions.
The issue seems to be resolved.
