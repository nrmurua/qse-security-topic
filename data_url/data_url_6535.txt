Cirq v0.10.0 is due to release by the end of the week (Mar 5, 2021). Once it releases, we should go back through the qsimcirq code and update dependencies and tests to use newly-available Cirq features.
This is mainly directed at the new expectation value functionality in qsimcirq and Cirq's SimulatesExpectationValues.
