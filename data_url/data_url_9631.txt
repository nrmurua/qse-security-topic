The restriction of a pulse duration to multiples of 4 ns might have unwanted effects on the results of two tutorials in particular: "Preparing an antiferromagnetic state in the Ising model" and "Tutorial MIS & QAOA".
I kindly ask the main authors, @sebgrijalva and @cdalyac, to verify whether the automatic rounding that is now occurring affects the expected outcomes and, if so, to adapt the notebooks accordingly.
"Preparing state with antiferromagnetic order in the Ising model.ipynb" is running fine. I also ran "Tutorial MIS & QAOA.ipynb" and it doesn't seem to produce any unexpected output. Can you confirm @cdalyac ?
"Tutorial MIS & QAOA" is working fine, warning still appears and results displayed are expected.
