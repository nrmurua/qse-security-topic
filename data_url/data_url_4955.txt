I have the following unitary(!) matrix
that I want to apply via twoQubitUnitary(qureg, targetQubit1, targetQubit2, u);, but I get the runtime error "QuEST Error in function twoQubitUnitary: Matrix is not unitary.".
Replicating the code in macro_isMatrixUnitary I find that absReal(elemRe_ - 1),
absReal(elemRe_ ) and absReal(elemIm_ - 1) are sometimes of the order 1e-8 while REAL_EPS  == 1e-15.
What is the best solution here? Change the values in QuEST_prevision.h? Change macr_isMatrixUnitary?
For now I am using applyMatrix4(qureg, targetQubit1, targetQubit2, u) instead, but this doesn't feel like the intended solution.
Sorry, I passed a float for t instead of double...
