Split from #823
Most exceptions in the core workflow are dumped to null with no logging messages. We need to make sure that we are logging every exception that is raised by the core code.
For example, if you create an error in get_node_status, like adding an integer to the return, the dispatch will hang but the logs will show no errors. Exceptions like this need to be logged.
