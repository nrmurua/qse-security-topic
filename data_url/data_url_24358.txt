Breakup of #175.
Further in future, not needed soon.
Want a  local minima, example of capacitance value or alpha.Â  Will need further details from Metal users.
For Metal users for analysis.
We can probably get a decent amount just by leveraging scipy's optimization code; https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/optimize.html (I definitely suggest we don't write up our own numerical methods from scratch)
