Issue Description:
On solving some linear combinational problems using qiskit terra operators, I faced an issue while working on the inverse of a matrix.
Even though we can achieve an inverse using a mathematical inverse formula, it will be a multistep process. I also tried the NumPy linear algebra function “pinv” & "inv", but the end result was in shape instead of dimensions.
Expected behavior:-
Inverse/pseudo-inverse of an Operator using function and return operator with dimension.
Suggested solution:-
I have come up with a solution, where we can add inverse function in an operator class. I did some modifications in the operator code and the solution matches with the classical solution.
If you find this issue relevant, then I will be happy to help and be a part of qiskit community.
Do you mind adding some code on the current behaviour and your expected output?
