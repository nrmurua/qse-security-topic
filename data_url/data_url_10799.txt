Description
I bumped into an error when I tried to call minorminer.find_embedding() with fixed_chain option. I have uploaded my code as a text file.
To Reproduce
Download the reprod.txt. (actually its a python file), put in your developer token (I removed mine on purpose) and just run the file.
Expected behavior
I don't expect it to crash. It runs fine if I provide other fixed_chains.
Environment:
Additional context
reprod.txt
Thanks for your report!  I've further isolated the issue down to a very short minimal working example, which will be tested for all future versions of minorminer.  The issue is fixed on my local machine repo and we'll have a new version out this week.
