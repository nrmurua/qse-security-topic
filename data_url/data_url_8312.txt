The dimension check here should be
if np.prod(dims[0]) != N1 or np.prod(dims[1]) != 1
(alternately the whole function could just call _check_dims(dims, N1, 1) )
In particular this makes rand_ket_haar fail if dims is specified, presumably other ket creators as well.
Actually looking at it again I think all of _check_ket_dims should be revised, and should look like a specialized copy of _check_dims with N2 replaced by 1, something like this:
Hi yarrriv,
Your new version of the check seems better.
Do you want to make a pull request?
We could also make improve rand_ket_haar further so that when dims is given, N is determined from it.
