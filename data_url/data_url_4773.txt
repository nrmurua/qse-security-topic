Strawberry Fields allows creating programs using Python literals, NumPy arrays, and TensorFlow tensors as gate parameters.
However, if using TensorFlow tensors, this breaks the ability to save the program to a Blackbird script. For example, using io.save, results in the following output:
There are two ways to fix this:
If using TensorFlow 1.3, the conversion of the program to a Blackbird script must be done within an active TensorFlow session, in order to convert the tensors to arrays/numeric values.
If using a newer version of TensorFlow that supports eager execution, the tensor can be converted to a NumPy array via the tensor.numpy() method.
As the tensorflow backend currently only support TF v1.3, we should implement solution (1), and change it to solution (2) once the backend is updated to support TF 2.0.
