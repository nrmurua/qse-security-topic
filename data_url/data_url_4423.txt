If a parametric circuit is initialized where some of the parameters are frozen with trainable=False and then you compute circuit.invert(), the new gates are all trainable.
This happens because in the invert function the new circuit is built with a sequence of dagged new gates (without setting trainable=False again).
An example follows:
