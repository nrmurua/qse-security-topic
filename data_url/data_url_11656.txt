Prior to 0.7 the VQE construct_circuit, like the same method in other algorithms, would supply back the circuit the algorithm would running - now parameters or other information might be needed for a variational or iterative algo, but it was a circuit. People are interested in viewing and understanding the circuits the algos are using. None more so than VQE.
In 0.7 construct_circuit is returning an opflow construction. Now while its fine to have that available as well (via a more appropriately name method) it would be nice to have the actual circuit from the construct_circuit method available as was available in the past.
Hello @woodsp-ibm ,
I am working on it.
I renamed it 'construct_observable_measurement' and created new implementation of 'construct_circuit' that returns a circuit and is called inside 'construct_observable_measurement'.
