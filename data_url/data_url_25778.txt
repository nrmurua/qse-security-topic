Since covalent core stuff like Result, Lattice, etc. is required by the services and is not being installed in docker containers, ModuleNotFound error is thrown. Installation of that is required. For now its happening in Queuer service container, but it is suspected that others are also affected.
the cause of this is known... the refactor dockerfiles need to be re-written (#340 )
