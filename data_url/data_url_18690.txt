Not exactly a bug
I'd start chasing this either in src/compilation-methods.lisp (and compiler-hook specifically) or in src/cfg.lisp. My memory is that these lines get inserted only after block compilation is actually doneâ€”so either directly after resolving the compilation in a block, or when the CFG is serialized back into a parsed-program.
Closed as of #159 .
