After a system powercycle (un- and re-plugging 12 V on Kasli), the first set of Sampler samples are invalid.
Using the artiq_sinara_tester script right after a powercycle leads to +10 V on all input channels with nothing connected to Sampler and the test therefore fails. The second set of samples is valid (0 V on all channels if nothing is connected or 1.5 V on one channel if this is wired up to Sampler).
Restarting the tester script without powercycling yields valid samples on the first set.
0 V reported on all channels.
10 V reported on all channels.
Should we work around this in gateware by just triggering one acquisition on reset?
We should first figure out the cause for this.
