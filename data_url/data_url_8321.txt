gives the error in a Jupyter notebook:
The error from a python script seems to shed more light into what is happening:
The same snippet works properly in Matplotlib 3.0.3, so it's something in Matplotlib 3.1.0.
Can also confirm I encounter this issue with matplotlib 3.1.0
I have the same problem in Bloch() and show() functions in Mac OS 10.14. I cannot plot the Bloch sphere. It seems the problem of Matplotlib. But I am not sure.
b.add_points([1/np.sqrt(3),1/np.sqrt(3),1/np.sqrt(3)],meth="l")
Gives no error, but produces no output. The other methods fail.
The above code is working fine with Matplotlib 3.1.3. But when downgrading it to 3.1.0 and running the code is causing error.
The above code works in Qutip 4.5.0 together with Matplotlib 3.2.1.
I have the same question
This was fixed by @nathanshammah in #1097 and we just forgot to close the issue.
