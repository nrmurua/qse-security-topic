When calling PassManager.run directly, it flattens a list of 1 circuit to a quantum circuit rather than returning a list. This makes it difficult to write code that uses the pass manager directly where you want to assume the input and output is always a list of circuits, since currently you have to check the type of the output and convert back to a list for length 1 inputs.
a QuantumCircuit is returned instead of a list containing the single transpiled circuit.
If the input to PassManager.run is a list, the return type should also be a list, regardless of how many entries in the list.
This is probably a simple fix in PassManager.run
