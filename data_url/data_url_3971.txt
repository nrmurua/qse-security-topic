There is no good documentation on the use of classical operations.
To give some examples
Operation docstring only shows it is used to "represent classical operations".
The docstring of Operation.init says it accepts *args* and (only) interprets arg1 as "immediate value".
It is not clear which classical operations are supported and how to call them.
