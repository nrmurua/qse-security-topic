tensorflow-quantum install on Mac M1?
can anyone help me ?

Hi @Yueh-H TensorFlow doesn't officially support anaconda builds. See #407 .
I would recommend that you try following the standard pip install steps found on the tensorflow and tensorflow quantum website. https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/install
the ways from the website shows this error in a M1 mac, miniforge3, apple metal configurations.

I do not have a m1 mac so I cannot do much testing (I have heard many horror stories of installing tf and pytorch on m1 tho), but some have had success with the method outlined in #655 so I encourage you to check that out and see if it works for you
