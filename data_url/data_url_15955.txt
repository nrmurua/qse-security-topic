from qiskit.providers.ibmq import least_busy raises an ImportError with the main branch.
Terra's released version does not have this issue.
CI tutorial step may stop by this issue.
Terra 0.17.3 has QuasiDistribution as follows, but main does not.
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/ab1539c8179b40b05ff6c921cec84815540c0e06/qiskit/result/__init__.py#L45
I think we need #6388 in main as well as stable.
No error.
This will be fixed by #6377 we had to rush in a version of this on 0.17.x  for the ntc/runtime announcement earlier today, but the version on master will be expanded with the normal api stability guarantees with that pr. Honestly, though this feels like a provider bug, the distribution classes shouldn't need to be in the default import path unless you're using the runtime module.
Thank you for your information. I wait for #6377 to close this issue. I agree that we may need to refactor ibmq-provider design not to import runtime related stuff if runtime is not used.
This issues is making the tutorials fail and it is blocking CI https://dev.azure.com/qiskit-ci/qiskit-terra/_build/results?buildId=27670&view=logs&j=2ddc7371-73a9-55a0-f542-1649e12d7390&t=e9462619-3037-5a53-8c49-fc6707b39ed2&l=102

This is because the tutorial is incorrectly importing the ibmq provider despite not using it. This will be fixed by Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#1181
Closing as  Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#1181 just got merged.
@1ucian0 I don't think this issue is closed until #6377. If users call from qiskit.providers.ibmq import least_busy, it still raises an ImportError.
you are right.
