This class ended up being nothing more than a variation on passing atol arguments, so it's not pulling enough weight to justify being in the API.
Hi @Strilanc
This looks like a simple enough issue to start my contributions with. Just to make sure I understand, you only want it removed from the API, i.e. basically removing the import from the init.py in the root directory?
@andbe91 I've started working on this but i haven't officially claimed it so it's up to @Strilanc to decide; but yes, remove every reference to Tolerance (removing tolerance.py. e.t.c).
@vtomole since you have already started, it might be better if I work on another issue. Please let me know if you want me to take over for some reason.
@vtomole is correct; this would involve completely deleting the class
That being said, I think the main important arguments to propagate are atol and rtol, no need for the nan ones.
This is done. Please close.
We might want to take a pass through code to insure that we are using atol and rtol as parameters when it makes sense (probably most of the time)
