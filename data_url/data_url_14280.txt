NewType is used in multiple places as an "umbrella" type, e.g.,

However, in fact, a value of type Original cannot be used in places where a value of type NewType is expected, i.e., passing BoxType to a function accepting DataTypes is a type error. For this purpose, type alias should be used instead, such as:
For mypy, aliases should be used. If the NewType has its own uses beyond type checking, the usage should be separated.
