After I execute this code against the IBM backend : ibmqx4 or ibmq_16_melbourne
job = execute(self.qc, self.backend, shots=args.shots, max_credits=3)  while not job.done: time.sleep(20) jobState=job.status 
It crashes (randomly) after 2-4 minutes with the error below if I'm  connecting from the NERSC computing center , this is domain IP 2620:83:8000:108:0:0:1:244.  But sometimes I it runs through.
When I run from home (using Comcast) I never have this problem - same laptop, even the same token.

The loop querying if job is done should continue until job.done=True.
I have observed this pattern (works from home but not from NERSC) for many days, so it is not just one bad day. I also spoke to NERCS expert and they see not reason on our end for blocking connection.  I tried old token, new token - all combinations - it does not matter.
do you use a proxy there?
@diego-plan9 could you have a look at this.
Hi @balewski,
It crashes (randomly) after 2-4 minutes with the error below if I'm connecting from the NERSC computing center , this is domain IP 2620:83:8000:108:0:0:1:244. But sometimes I it runs through.
When I run from home (using Comcast) I never have this problem - same laptop, even the same token.
I'll try to get more information from the API team, but from your comments and specifically this paragraph, it does seem to be related to your network environment at NERSC (as in, it seems to be the only variable that changes compared to your home environment).
Can you let me know if you are executing more than one job in your program, just for double checking? It does not seem to be the case, but I'm explicitly mentioning it as several concurrent jobs generally result in a higher network load (ie. more network queries that might get them close to some hard to catch limits on your network).
Try running:
If it returns True then you can reach our servers, if False, then it is a connection problem at your institution.
Hi @balewski we are having some error that may be related in our update to code behind the api.
Are you still seeing this error
closing. If you are still seeing the error with the update please let us know.
