The current way of defining parameters in the time domain for TablePulseTemplates is cumbersome at best: First, a TimeParameterDeclaration instance has to be created and then, in a separate call, a table entry which refers to this parameter declaration can be added to the table.
This has the disadvantage that a caller could refer to the same time parameter declaration from several table entries he creates.
Furthermore, there is currently no way for TimeParameterDeclarations to refer to each other as mininmum or maximum values which, in theory, allows for entries to swap positions in an instantiation.
For the table (only time values given)  [0, t1, t2, 3] it would be convenient, if t2 could refer to t1 as its minimal value (and for t1 to refer to t2 as its maximum value).
As a user of the TablePulseTemplate, I desire that:
