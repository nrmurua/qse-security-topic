Running the current Hamiltonian Simulation with >20Q gives:
Possible Fix:
in precalculated_data.ipynb increase hardcoded limits:
or make the limits dynamic based on max_qubit_number, however, this will require a recalculation with every initialization
We only do initialization at the beginning of a run of the whole benchmark, so I don't think dynamically initializing will be a problem.
How large do you need the num_qubits to go?
