This issue will be used to keep track of error mitigation techniques that could be added to Mitiq or could build on-top of techniques already in Mitiq.

The technique uses Classical Shadows (especially Robust Shadows) to exploit the global symmetries inherent to a quantum system. It does not work if gate-dependent errors are considered at each circuit layer as the errors in the full quantum circuit are accounted for at once in post-processing.
Testing this new module with other mitigation techniques would be interesting as combining Classical Shadows with PEC led to better results. https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04956
The technique uses PEC and relies on Pauli Twirling the measurement output or Pauli Twirling the inverse of the noise channel.

@purva-thakre From the description it is not quite clear what exactly this issue is about. Did you mean to add all these techniques mentioned in the description? Or maybe it is more about having a technique catalog (with dependencies)?
Is there a RFC draft for the issue?
@kozhukalov I think all of these could be added as new techniques in Mitiq. I created the issue to have all the arxiv links for potential new techniques in one place. I don't think I will be able to add all of these on my own! Otherwise, I would have assigned the issue to myself.
If you would like to work on these and attempt an RFC, go ahead! In the past, I know we discussed a proposed RFC in Community Calls.
Hopefully this helps!
Edit: Forgot to add, there is a RFC template in the documentation along with links to accepted RFCs.

Thanks for the detailed explanation. I would definitely like to help with this.
Also there is yet another feature-request for the new technique #1955 that is not directly related but still it sounds interesting.
Great! Feel free to message me on discord if you want to work on a RFC together. My username is purvathakre.
Another technique not mentioned in this issue's description does have an issue (#1971). I haven't started on this RFC yet because I have been working on other things.
