Looking at the definition for CZBody...it looks like a duplicate of CNBody at L108.
Hi @simon-ty
GateFactory.hpp/.cpp are legacy and unused. Gate matrices are defined in the file: https://github.com/ORNL-QCI/tnqvm/blob/master/tnqvm/base/Gates.hpp
Upon auditing the file, I figured out that some gates were not defined (should be asserting in debug build) and have added them accordingly.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Ok thanks for this!  I will test out the fixes shortly.
