When a covalent service is run in dev mode, the openapi yaml for that service should be updated if the API is returning or accepting something different than the spec.
After an openapi yaml has changed, it should automatically update Swaggerhub.
Swaggerhub is and will remain the single source of truth for spec. Until this automation is built, devs are resposible for updating Swaggerhub manually. Changes to APIs should not be merged unless the spec is changed first.
Potentially leverage swaggerhub CLI

maybe use swaggerhub automock
the idea is probably to lock down definitions in github, and only make changes in swaggerhub. use github connection to push assets to github. somehow run tests against automock in swaggerhub for any change.
look at the example github action at 30:00 in the video
