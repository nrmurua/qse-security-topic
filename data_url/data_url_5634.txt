Attempt to compute unitary of circuit containing C5X gate fails with the following message:
The run() command should succeed.
In terra,  QuantumCircuit.mcx with less than five control-qubits generates CXGate, CCXGate, C3XGate, and C4XGate and with more control-qubits generates MCXGrayGate.

UnitarySimulator does not support mcx_gray. So you need to call transpile before run.
OK, thanks!
