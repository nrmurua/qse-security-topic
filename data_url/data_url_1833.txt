Currently we only support OpenQASM 2.0, we should start to look into what is required for exporting and importing to and from the new version of OpenQASM 3.0
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
I will close this issue as a duplicate of #4509 even though this was the first one because the linked issue has more comments.
