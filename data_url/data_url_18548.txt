The Github CI for this repo invokes tests such that dependencies, including magicl and qvm, are loaded via quicklisp. Recently, cl-quil's .asd file was changed such that it depends on magicl version 0.10.0. However, the version that gets loaded is determined by Quicklisp, which currently gets version 0.7.0.  Since qvm and magicl are very closely related and highly depended-upon systems, we should run the CI tests with a later, if not the latest, version of those systems, not the latest one that happens to be released by Quicklisp.
Here's a recent CI failure for a recent PR: https://github.com/quil-lang/quilc/runs/4112125272?check_suite_focus=true
Attaching a screen shot of the failure.

PR #773, which has been merged, resolved this issue. Therefore, I'm closing this issue.
