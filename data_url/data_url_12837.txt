To get Teleportation.ipynb to work, change ‘%kata T14_StandardTeleport_Test’ to ‘%kata T14_Teleport_Test’
Good catch! I missed that one when I tested this Notebook.
A better fix would probably be renaming the test to T14_StandardTeleport_Test in Tests.qs - it will fit the usual test naming scheme of "test number - task name - Test suffix" better. Do you want to do this fix? If not, I'll get to it at some point.
This has been fixed in #133.
