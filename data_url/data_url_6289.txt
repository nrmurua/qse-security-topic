Learning from QBdt, we see that QEngineShard could attach two QInterface instances "under" each of its two probability amplitudes, as by multiplication of each QEngineShard probability amplitude on their respective QInterface branch. Further, even with different QEngineShard probability amplitudes, the QInterface instances could be represented by the same pointer value, to one QInterface instance.
The issue is to implement a QEngineShard as a QBdtNode to at least a single level of depth. This might be accomplished with inheritance of QEngineShard from QBdtNode, in part.
Long-term, QEngineShard might implement a multi-level QBdtNode hierarchy between other QEngineShards, but I haven't fully developed the requisite theory, and perhaps that won't turn out to be the best approach.
These two simulation approaches aren't really as natural or perfect of a match as I supposed in the first issue comment. It's worth keeping the idea in mind, though. Moving to backlog.
I don't see a viable approach to doing this, for now. Closing.
