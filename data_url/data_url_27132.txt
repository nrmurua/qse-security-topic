Some packages seem to be missing (?) or no longer present in the binary cache at nix-qchem.cachix.org. Some examples:
On the other hand, some others work just fine:
(I think the errors at the end can be safely ignored and are just because the path is not present on my machine…)
Entering a nix shell causes builds/downloads according to these reports. Is this because the packages have been garbage collected in the binary cache, or is this a user error on my side? If it is due to the cache, cachix recently added the ability to pin certain store paths, saving them from the clutches of the GC.
Thank you for your time!
This sounds very much like the effect of the cachix garbage collection. The cache is running under a legacy, free account with a maximum capacity of 10 GB (big thanks to cachix). That means that older builds will fall victim to garbage collection. If you do not update your flake.lock file for a while, it becomes more and more likely to run into a cache miss.
The cachix pinning is a good idea, but that would only make sense for stable release branches (e.g. such as 23.05). For the rolling unstable/master branch, it would not be clear to me what paths should be pinned, without breaking the 10 GB limit.
Should we close this issue? In principle everything works as documented and we simply cannot put everything in Cachix. Unless we have a much more large scale cache I don't see another good solution except accepting cache misses.
A 100GB cache costs about 90 EUR/month, which would require external funding to sustain over a longer period of time.
We have optimized the cache use a little bit:
I hope this increases the life time of existing builds in the cache.
