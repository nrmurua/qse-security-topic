I am training a Iris classifier using quantum machine learning. The framework being used is Pennylane. I am facing an error in the optimization step while training the classifier.
TypeError: 'NesterovMomentumOptimizer' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
But the values which I passed to optimizer are of type Electron. When I try to add print statements inside the training loop nothing gets printed in the notebook or in the dashboard.
My training code:
The complete error message:
Node training(6) failed: Traceback (most recent call last): File "/home/ram/Anaconda/anaconda3/envs/covalent/lib/python3.8/site-packages/covalent_dispatcher/_core/execution.py", line 222, in _run_task output, stdout, stderr = executor.execute( File "/home/ram/Anaconda/anaconda3/envs/covalent/lib/python3.8/site-packages/covalent/executor/executor_plugins/local.py", line 106, in execute result = fn(*args, **kwargs) File "/tmp/ipykernel_142039/1085168990.py", line 9, in training TypeError: 'NesterovMomentumOptimizer' object cannot be interpreted as an integer 
I have added my notebook in the below pull request. The notebook is covalent/doc/source/tutorials/machine_learning/Covalent_pennylane_Iris_classification.ipynb

The print statements should print the corresponding strings in the notebook or in the dashboard. The Optimizer is being used as an integer somewhere it shouldn't be used as.
No response
Hi @RamAIbot , bit different than the current issue, I see that your return statement is inside for loop? Is it intended ?
Hi @santoshkumarradha ,
That was an indent error. But even after I changed it I am getting the same error.
It works now. I solved it by applying the fix mentioned in

Thanks!
