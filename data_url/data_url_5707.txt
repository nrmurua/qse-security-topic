To understand quantum channels, I think it is a good idea to provide a function for visualization of a general one-qubit quantum channel, as is done in Nielsen, Chuang, ch. 8. The visualization could then look like the one above, for example. Here the transformation of the Bloch sphere, the state vectors $|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$, $|+\rangle$, $|-\rangle$ and the stable state (red) under the transformation is illustrated.
This requires the calculation of the affine transformation of the Bloch vector $\vec{r}$ tby an arbitrary quantum channel $\vec{r} \xrightarrow{\mathcal{E}} \vec{r} \ ' = M \vec{r} + \vec{d}$. For this I can suggest a few lines of code. If you are interested, I can also provide the code for the above figure. But you can probably create it on your own, adapted to your needs.
I would like to work on this problem. Could I be assigned?
Thank you for your proposal (and I'm sorry that our response is lazy).
Visualization is out of scope of Qiskit-Aer at this moment. I think it is better to discuss in qiskit-terra.
