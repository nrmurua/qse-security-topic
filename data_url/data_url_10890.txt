Many D-Wave users view the decomposition and subproblem-execution tasks that qbsolv undertakes as critical to gaining benefit from a D-Wave system.  Given the intense interest in when and how D-Wave systems will deliver differentiated performance, the details of decomposition and QMI execution are important to engaged users who want to understand the steps being taken on their behalf.  Some users have said they will not use tools whose operation (and sometimes code) they cannot see and understand.  Thus debuggability (of the user's problem) and transparency of qbsolv execution are important.
In addition to the current info emitted by use of the 'verbosity' option, the ability to save to files (in the qbsolv input format) the subQUBOs that are executed would also be valuable.
