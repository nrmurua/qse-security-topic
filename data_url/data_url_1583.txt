As a relatively new user to Cirq, accessing individual qubits from a LineQubit object feels cumbersome. From what I understand, you can either put them all in a list method (as in the range() method) and access them from the list. Or you can explicitly set variables q0,...,qN = LineQubit(N+1). I think it would be a nice feature to be able to access individual qubits from a LineQubit object q with an indexing operator like q[idx]. As an example,
Instead of
It seems this sort of functionality exists for the doubly indexed GridQubit object, see this example. Could something similar to the implementation of the GridQubit accessor method be used for a LineQubit accessor method?
A LineQubit is a single qubit. When you say LineQubit(n) it creates one qubit id object which refers to the nth qubit in some line, and if you try to unpack this into separate variables it will fail:
The range method is actually a static method defined on the LineQubit class, so while python makes it possible to call it on an instance it is intended to be called directly on the class instead:
Ahh, thanks. Dumb mistake.
