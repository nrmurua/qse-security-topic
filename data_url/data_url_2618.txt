figure out how to incorporate different kinds of noise channels into circuit constructions in a nice way. right now we have common_channels.py containing the depolarizing channel. The best idea so far (from @Strilanc ) is "We should add something like a with_probability(p) method to cirq.Operation and cirq.Gate to make these easy to make, so you could say cirq.Z(q).with_probability(p)". But in the future other channels might not always fit into this nice construction of with_probability if they have multiple parameters for example.
