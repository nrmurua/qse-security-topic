I think we should admit to the existence of device names underlying lattices because that affects reservation timing. I'm very much fine with omitting device-devices themselves.
I propose keeping list_devices but returning only the keys of that dictionary, writing list_lattices that can be optionally filtered by device name (and qubit count, if only because that's also easy), and patching up list_quantum_computers to make use of unrestricted list_lattices.
We can also append those default QVM options to the list if you like, though my opinion is that a list of (nn)Q entries will mostly look noisy and not something you need to see in a generated list.
I agree with all of the above
