Due to current TensorFlow compatibility issues with Python 3.7, users may experience issues attempting to install Strawberry Fields on Python 3.7.
Once TensorFlow fully supports Python 3.7 (and binary wheels are available), Strawberry Fields wheels will also be made available for Python 3.7.
In the meantime, please refer to the corresponding TensorFlow issue tensorflow/tensorflow#20517.
As TF is no longer building wheels for version 1.3 for Python > 3.6, this issue is no longer relevant. Instead, we have made TF v1.3 an optional dependency for Strawberry Fields with v0.11.
