What exactly do you have in mind ? Integrating the noise spectrum from 0Hz to Nyquist frequency to make sure it's equal to the variance of the noise ?
OK, I have been looking into more details in the calculations and I am now more or less convince the rbw is correct.
However, I think we have some subtle effects with the white noise:
-> I haven't tried yet to model the second effect quantitatively, but intriguingly, it seems that one recovers a flat spectrum by undoing the transfer_function correction...
To confirm this, I made the following observations:
I setup a narrow bandpass filter with an IQ to make sure only a small frequency band contributes to the spectrum, and monitor with in1 the spectrum directly from the noise generator, and with in2, the spectrum after the iq filter.
--> I should get reed of aliasing problems, but still have the improper frequency correction for the maximum span.
--> This is exactly what I observe: I get a flat response when scanning the filter frequency whenever span<65 MHz, but still get the increased spectrum close to 65 MHz for the largest span (in this case, both curves are superimposed at the peak value).
I will probably make a unittest based on this technique.
When working with the maximum span, there should be no transfer-function correction since the scope is not doing any decimation, however, we do have a non-unity transfer-function correction in this case (that would make sense anyway to take into account some level of filtering by the analog inputs themselves...)
@SamuelDeleglise do you want to try to configure the iir filter to use it for the specan? not sure if this is straightforward, but it will validate the iir (gui not tested since its development, filter itself is unit-tested), improve the specan, and give you a headstart to using the iir.
