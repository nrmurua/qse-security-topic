We need a way to test image comparison in CI, because with the current approach it is very easy to introduce regressions.
We used to have this, but I cannot remember why we dropped it.
It should be able to run the test in a CI (in an env that we can call the standard one, with a single source of truth for reference images).
Feel free to assign this to me @1ucian0
