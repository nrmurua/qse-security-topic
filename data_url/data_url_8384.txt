The version requirements need increasing.
This was posted on the help group.
Please update the requirements, for the new features (PIQS and photon scattering) to work Numpy = 1.12.0+ is required as numpy.flip() and numpy.geomspace are used.
I think a micro release would be the right thing to do.
We could wait a week and see if anything else get reported though
Is this issue still open? If open can I work on it? @ajgpitch
@piyushchauhan This is still open.
However, any PR for this would conflict with #961. @agarwal1998 has not answered the questions on there though, so if you create a PR that solves #892 and this issue, then we will close #961
