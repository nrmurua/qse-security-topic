I tried to calculate the inverse of an operator as following:
I don't know why this doesn't work.
Although I can convert it to be dense, and use scipy.linalg.inv to do the same job,
the super operaters to be inverted in my actual problems are extremely large and sparse, and the inverses are also expected to be sparse.
So I want to find a way without converting them to dense.
But I didn't find any function in QuTiP to do that. Or maybe I missed it?
BTW, the version I use is:
Hi @HAyAsIiI ,
would you consider doing the following?
Since a few version back, we've added a __ array __ method to Qobj. So now you can have sMat be your sparse matrix.
