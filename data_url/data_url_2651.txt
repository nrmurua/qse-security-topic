The following assert should pass:
But actually it fails:
The issue is that assert_circuits_with_terminal_measurements_are_equivalent only canonicalizes the circuits' unitary matrices up to a Z**t_k gate on each measured qubit. But actually it needs to consider arbitrary diagonal gates involving all measured qubits. This requires updating the linear constraints created by the method.
