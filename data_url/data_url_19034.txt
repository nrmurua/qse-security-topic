A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
qiskit.Resut created by C3 qiskit adapter can't be serialized to JSON because of counts represented as numpy.int32.
probably happens  here
shots_data = (np.round(pop_t.T[-1] * shots)).astype("int32")
workaround: Use custom json.JSONEncoder to serilialize numpy types
Qiskit objects should serializable
