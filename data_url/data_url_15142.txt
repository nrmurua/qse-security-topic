Suppose I am given an arbitrary quantum circuit and I want to transpile it by using only the gate $U(\theta, \phi, \lambda)$ (single-qubit rotation) and the gate $CX$ (creating entanglement), knowing that they form a universal set of gates for quantum computation.
In Qiskit this should be possible calling the transpile function and passing the argument basis_gates=['u', 'cx']. This works fine in almost any case but fails for every circuit with an identity id gate (or more than one).
QiskitError: "Cannot unroll the circuit to the given basis, ['u', 'cx']. Instruction id not found in equivalence library and no rule found to expand."
I would expect the transpiler not to raise any error and to complete the circuit transpilation correctly.
To solve this problem, it should be enough to add $I = U(0,0,0)$ to the Qiskit equivalence library, so that the transpiler runs successfully and returns the circuit

This is currently deliberate not-a-bug behaviour.  The documentation of IGate (which is what id creates) says:
Identity gate corresponds to a single-qubit gate wait cycle, and should not be optimized or unrolled (it is an opaque gate).
That said, the choice was made because older IBM hardware backends use this, and you're not the only person who doesn't like the choice.  We're currently working out the logistics of disentangling the current behaviour in a backwards-compatible way (see #7403 and #7146).
