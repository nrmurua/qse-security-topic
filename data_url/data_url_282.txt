Even if the python pip build fails,  it still has access to the python package that we built from source in the container. So we have this error on the pip build, for example
But then the entire pytest suite runs and passes
Break the pybind code to force a failure in the python build, then run it through the CI.
We should switch the order of those steps and uninstall the pip source build before building cudaq from source.
Not a regression
No response
