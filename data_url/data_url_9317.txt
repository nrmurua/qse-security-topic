Describe the bug
Attempting to run .ci/run test relative_path_to_supbackage_here on a subpackage that does not have a Manifest.toml file causes a LoadError: Invalid Path: message to appear followed by a file path that has the following structure: /absolute/path/to/repo/../../../absolute/path/to/subpackage
To Reproduce
You can try it against BloqadeWaveforms. Ensure there is no Manifest.toml already present in the sub package folder.
Expected behavior
The unit tests for BloqadeWaveforms or any other subpackage should run without an issue.
Version Info
Additional context
The issue seems to be caused by this line in .ci/src/main.jl.
test() invokes dev() if no existing Manifest file is found, and dev() attempts to generate a relative path using relpath(path, root_dir()). Ideally the result of this would be a relative path that is prefixed by "examples" or "lib" (see the subsequent if...elseif chain) but the actual result ends up being the path shown in the beginning of the issue.
It is possible to get tests to run through the CLI utility by removing the line altogether and feeding in the relative path on the command line but this means any absolute file paths fail to work.
An easier way of seeing the improper file path generation is by activating the .ci environment in Julia and then running in the REPL:
After further testing, bug was unable to be reproduced. What resolved the bug is unknown and its existence could be due to system-specific factors.
