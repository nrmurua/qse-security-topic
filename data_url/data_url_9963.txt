Right now the ScaleComposite relies on BQM.info which has been deprecated as of 0.9.0.
See https://github.com/dwavesystems/dimod/pull/627/files#diff-650a9a798c6df570212e820d8acc920bR122 in #627
so you don't want the scale information to be returned?
It can be in the sample set
I think 
yeah thats how I changed it - and puts in to the sampleSet object info field at the end.
