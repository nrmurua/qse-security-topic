There is a section in the documentation that I think that might lead to a confusion (as it happened to me). In particular, from components/optimizers, one could think that to access the options of the cma optimizer it suffices to type
which is not the case. Maybe the code to access the options,
could be stated more explicitly so as to avoid misunderstandings.
Also (although I found it clear enough) perhaps a sentence specifying that the user is not supposed to use the qibo.optimizers.cma, qibo.optimizers.newtonian and qibo.optimizers.sgd directly is worth including.
Thanks for spotting this issue. I think we can consider renaming the cma function to something different from the package name, e.g. cmaes.
