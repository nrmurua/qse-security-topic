Description
Hi. I find the library installation is very slow and never end, so far the installation on my side did not reach any completion. I am quite sure it is not due to my network.
Can someone help validate about this issue? Thanks.
To Reproduce
Expected behavior
Installation will stuck for longer time. As per my observation, the installation never complete even after more than 8 hours.
Environment:
Additional context
I am using "cmder" as an alternative to plain windows command line (cmd.exe) GUI.
Would it be possible to get the output of everything after the pip install command until it hangs?
Hi. Following is the console output since pip install command. Take note that I did halt the installation a few times before, with the assumption to run again after sometime. Output below is after 7 hours of installation run.

Hi @arcondello. Any update on this issue?
Hi @thevenmuthu , this looks like something is going wrong with you pip, can you try pip install dwave-ocean-sdk --no-cache-dir? Also, for the sake of completeness, updating your pip?
Hi @arcondello. Thanks for your suggestion. It seems things worked well once I upgrade my Python from 3.7 to 3.9. I believe Pip has been upgraded in parallel with Python. Thanks again.
