The following copyright needs to replace the old one in all the files:
where XXXX is the year of the file in question.
The (C) doesn't actually mean anything, and I'm not sure we need the GPL style "this code is part of Qiskit". But, I'm definitely in favor of using the normal Apache header instead of what we currently do.
Also if we really want things to be consistent we should have this machine enforced by the style rule checker. Otherwise we'll eventually slip on this. I've written rules like this before (see: https://opendev.org/openstack/hacking/src/branch/master/hacking/checks/comments.py#L49-L93 and https://opendev.org/openstack/hacking/src/branch/master/hacking/checks/comments.py#L112-L170 ) the same rule shouldn't  be that much harder to write in pylint.
https://www.ibm.com/legal/copytrade refers to Copyright IBM Corporation instead of Copyright IBM. I have no idea about the difference. Probably is a good moment to involve a lawyer?
It seems some of the files still contain the old header, most likely because they were caught under friendly fire during the busy release period - I'll make a round of PRs aiming to adjust them according to the header posted in the issue description.
