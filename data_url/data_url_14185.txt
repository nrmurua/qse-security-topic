When comparing BackendEstimator with the aer primitive on the same fake backend, I expect more or less the same results, but BackendEstimator gives really inconsistent results.
The code to reproduce and visualize the issue :
I expect the results to be similar to the aer one and consistent from one run to the other.
No response
I tried to look into this
It seem that the BackendEstimator is working fine for fake_tokyo, fake_tenerife, fake_rueschlikon and fake_yorktown. So maybe the bug is specific to other fake_providers




It also seems like the AerEstimator also gives inconsitent results for fake_rochester.

I would like to investigate this issue further. Would be great if someone could assign me this
Thanks!
@priyansh-1902 Hi. Did you find anything else on that problem?
