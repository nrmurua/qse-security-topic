When compiling an empty block in a __qpu__ function, the nvq++ compiler crashes.
Execute the example in the docs/sphinx/examples/cpp/providers/ionq.cpp file, except comment out the x<cudaq::ctrl>(q[i], q[i + 1]); line. An alternate method is to add an empty {} prior to the for loop.
When compiled with --target ionq or --target quantinuum, the compiler will crash with the following error:
The compiler does not crash when compiling with --target nvidia or with no target specified.
The compiler should not crash.
