Minimal code example:
(whereas correlation_2op_2t(H,psi0,[0],[0,1],[],a,a.dag(),solver='es') works fine)
From what I can tell, in _correlation_es_2t, solES_tau becomes a 0-term ESERIES object, and then fails to calculate expectation values at various times.
It appeared there was a floating point error in ode2es that would result in an empty amplitude string for small enough amplitudes. In PR #509 is fixed by forcing the amplitude to zero when the numerical error occurs.
I am assuming that this was closed in Pull #509, so closing.
