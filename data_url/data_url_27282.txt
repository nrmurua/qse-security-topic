Unitary learning tutorial without qgrad has a behemoth der_cost function that needs a painstakingly long list of conditions. This would be done with qgrad in one line. While autodiff saves a lot of effort in writing the code, it would be interesting to see how much more faster it is.
Autodiff takes a bit more time compared to the custom gradient, so this is not worth adding
