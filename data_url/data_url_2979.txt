UnconstrainedDevice is too unconstraining.
What would SpecificQubitsDevice look like? How would it be different from UnconstrainedDevice?
SpecificQubitsDevice would require operations to only apply to a given set of qubits specified at initialization time of the device class instance. It wouldn't apply any locality constraints.
I think this isn't really that useful.  Going to close unless someone comes up with a good use case.
