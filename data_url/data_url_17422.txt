Pulse Schedules and Commands are currently mutable. The consequence of this is that when composing Schedules all underlying Schedules and Commands must be copied into the new Schedule. If both Schedules and Commands were immutable, references to the underlying Schedules and Commands could be kept, thus removing this requirement. This will also allow tracking of reused Schedules possibly opening up the door to priority aware optimizations.
