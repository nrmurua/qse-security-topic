It can be useful, when calculating statistical properties from the qubits (e.g. Correlation functions), to store the interatomic distance(s) that defined the register, specially if it is some regular array. This could be something like Register.atom_spacing, or some better name.
This might be a bit messy, as it will involve adding some distinction between regular and irregular arrays.
