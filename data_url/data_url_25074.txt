It says "play up to two" so, does it means you can decide wether you play one or two? Or you must play 2 out of 3 as an obligation? It also says "Discard the unplayed engine card." Which makes me think you must play 2 out of 3 as an obligation. Help us out!
Hi Frank, thanks for your question! The language "play up to two" is supposed to suggest that you can play zero, one, or two engine cards, and discard the rest.
