The VQE will require methods to decompose gates into other gates that are comprehensible by a quantum device. Qiskit begins this process using their equivalence library class. The class is a collection of dictionaries that provide the decomposition for each gate.
We believe that we could use our circuit layer to implement a similar decomposition that will be used for Cirq and AWS (we don't want to mess up the procedure for the Qiskit circuits since the VQE is already written in Qiskit).
The circuit layer will require the ability to transpile which has yet to be implemented.
This issue will need to be further fleshed out since the optimization is run in qiskit.
Is VQE project still underway? If it is, is this functionality still needed? If yes and yes, then now that we have the ability to convert any circuit to OpenQASM via the transpiler, we can leverage pytket for this
