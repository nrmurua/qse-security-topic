The qiskit interface for pulse gates currently only supports parametrized pulses from the library and not arbitrary piece-wise constant ones. Following the merge of #202 this should be added into the qiskit interface
It should be possible to use the param argument of gates to store the arbitrary pulse as pairs of I+Q values.
How have you tried to resolve it in the current version of the code? Have you considered non c3-toolset alternative solutions? Please elaborate.
