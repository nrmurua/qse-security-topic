Hi,
In the AltOutput.fs script, the parser for BitCon gates of Liquid is incorrect. For example, in the Teleport circuit, it outputs  (c-x q1) instead of (c-x q1,q2).
I guess the problem is because the arity of the BitCon gate is still equal to that of the uncontrolled one.
Simply add the int value of pfx to the arity can fix this.
Thanks!
Just posted your fix. Thanks!!
