In #10291 we added a hack to serialize the execution of transpile() with multiple circuits if a custom InstructionDurations or dt was specified as arguments to transpile(). This was to workaround the behavior that the InstructionDurations object constructed by transpile() was a function of the input circuit to factor in the durations of custom calibrations in the circuit to that custom InstructionDurations object. A better long term fix is to revise the passes using InstructionDurations to do the custom circuit calibrations handling inline as needed instead of doing it in transpile().
I do wonder if an implementation of #9256 would alleviate some of those concerns. Because then the passes will only get a target and we're not using InstructionDurations anywhere (except for the plugin interface). But I'll convert this comment into an issue for 0.26 and we can track it there.
