Snapshotting the AMI430 driver without a heater will show you (with debug logging)
This should be fixed so there are no errors on snapshoting
added a failing test in https://github.com/jenshnielsen/Qcodes/tree/driver/ami430_fix_warning but need to look at the manual to figure out what can be done to detect if the heater is installed or not
The command PSwitch:INSTalled?, returning 0 or 1, should do the job I guess. See page 137 of the manual here: http://www.americanmagnetics.com/support/manuals/mn-430.pdf
Then adding an if-statement on line 260 in https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/instrument_drivers/american_magnetics/AMI430.py would allow to add a switch_heater submodule based on the configuration of the controller.
