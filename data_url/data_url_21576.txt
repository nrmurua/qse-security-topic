For assertions, the compiler currently synthesizes a function, _artiq_raise_assert, to build the exception object with the given message/â€¦ and raise it. This is a remnant from an earlier design, where more parameters were baked into the emitted code rather than passed to _artiq_raise_assert. Now, however, the function is the same for each module, and should be moved into the runtime library instead.
Adding to ARTIQ-7 milestone as we want to keep runtime compatibility with NAC3.
Seems NAC3 would not use such a function.
