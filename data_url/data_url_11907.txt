Three tutorials 02_..., 03_... and 04_... all still use a PauliSumOp. Since the H2_op started out as a SparsePauliOp I am not sure why its later converted to a PauliSumOp. In the case of 03 that may be as it still is using the deprecated NumPyMinimumEigensolver. These uses lead to deprecated messages in the tutorials so they need to be updated accordingly.
Im trying to get some contributions for the Qiskit advocate application. I found the issues you're discussing let me know if I should go ahead and fix them.
All three tutorials use NumPyMinimumEigensolver and make the swap to PauliSumOp.

The 04_.... VQD tutorial I don't believe is being addressed so if you'd like to do that one it would be good.
Yes, I looked over the 4th tutorial and that just needs this paulisumop fix so I didn't made a separate PR for this much small Change. I was planning to cover it up in other PRs. But as you (@TannerTorrey3) wanted to contribute for Qiskit Advocate application then go ahead ðŸ™‚ as application just opened.
BTW I am doing a QAMP project improving all of the tutorials (If needed) of this Qiskit tutorial repo.
@woodsp-ibm @divshacker Ok thank you I'll get on those fixes. Let me know if I can be of assistance with QAMP. I definitely have some knowledge gaps with QC,  but should be able to be some assistance.
This is being handled as part of qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms#44.
