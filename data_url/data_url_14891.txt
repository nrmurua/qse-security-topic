I'm following the titled video!
from qiskit.ml.datasets import ad_hoc_data
I'm trying to run this but getting an error:  No module named 'qiskit.ml'
Then I followed some other person who said that we should try the updated version and thus I used,
from qiskit_machine_learning.datasets import ad_hoc_data
but now still I'm getting an error
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit_machine_learning'
I'm using Google Collab to run the code! Does anybody, have any idea?
qiskit-aqua was depreceated in 2021 hence qiskit.ml isn't working, check migration guide.
Required file is here  in qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning
Edit:
In  short run the following code block on colab:
I tried it as well I'm getting this error

Edit: In short run the following code block on colab:
The application packages were all removed as optional dependents from the qiskit metapackage so installing it via qiskit thus pip install qiskit[machine-learning] no longer works - instead install it directly using
https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning#installation
after the installation process, I was getting some error related to QSVM and other issues which is now changed to qsvc and qsvr and other issues, this below link helped in case anyone needs it,
