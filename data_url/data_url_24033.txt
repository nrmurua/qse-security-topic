Related to #252. As you can see in the Full Chip Design Notebook, the fillet has been set to 99.99um. Indeed, setting it to 100um it will trigger the rendering issue with Ansys, which shows as a com_error.
Should just handle it, without requiring User action
Since this is an Ansys-only problem (unless proven otherwise), we might need to look into adding an "input validation" stage in the renderer to Ansys, that will adjust the fillet to a number that Ansys can work with (apply a -0.1% to the fillet given certain conditions). Also, the fillet would have to be updated in Metal as well to keep consistency between tools. The best "condition" would be when Ansys give error as it renders the element, if that information can be propagated back to metal somehow.
NOTE: Propagating Ansys errors back to the renderer and thus back to Metal is actually critical in general, as a rendering error might not be noticed otherwise. This is only relevant for fully automated analysis steps. Will create a separate issue for that.
