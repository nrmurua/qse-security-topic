@rmlarose Following the example of above referenced issue, would you prefer Cirq executors are added to utils.py ?
It seems PyQuil's executor is already in pyquil_utils.py as referenced in the note here. Although it would seem more executor functions need to be defined for PyQuil - with sampling, density matrix with noise and density matrix with noise + sampling.
It seems like a good idea to me because (i) these docs will soon be for explaining serial/batched & raw/not raw executors and (ii) it's more useful to people to have them in the codebase so they can be used, rather than copying and pasting from the docs.
I would propose they go into a new mitiq_cirq.utils instead of utils.py so that (i) there is parallelism between mitiq_qiskit.utils and mitiq_pyquil.utils and (ii) so that we don't further clutter utils.py. Thoughts on this point @andreamari @willzeng?
I think having a mitiq_cirq folder similar to  mitiq_qiskit and mitiq_pyquil is a good idea.
We could put there some Cirq executors but also any other functions which are supposed to be used only by Cirq users.
Agreed!
@rmlarose I created #591 for the mitiq_cirq/ changes so this issue can stay focused on updating docs for different executor types.
And @purva-thakre is that something you wanted to pick up? Otherwise I'm happy to take it on.
@Aaron-Robertson I started to work on cirq executors.... I was thinking of tackling pyquil executors later. You could work on latter if you want to.
