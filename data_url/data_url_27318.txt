Currently, we assume that the encrypted message somehow materializes on Bob's side but maybe we should be more specific about what is actually sent back to Bob. This may lead to providing getEncoded() method (or a similar one) on the EncryptedMessage class.
Good point, yes, I think we should provided methods to serialize and deserialize the data for user convenience.
