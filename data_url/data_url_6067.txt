I pulled Aer and Terra newest master branches today and have a real trouble running Aer on Linux. It compiles but when I try to run something it spends a lot of time creating a directory named .pyxbld in my home directory (??), then it complains about some "compilation error" in that new uninvited directory.
Note that this is Python 3.6
@nonhermitian comments in Slack: It looks like the Cython files are not being build at install time, and are trying at runtime.  That is what it is telling you.  It however cannot find the sparse matvec header
I cannot reproduce this on Ubuntu 18.04.
It stopped happening at some point.
