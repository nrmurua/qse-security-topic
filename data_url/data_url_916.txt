Description of the issue
the default value of MeasurementGate.invert_mask is (), which should be equivalent to invert_mask=(False, ...). However, specifying the latter results in a gate which evaluates as unequal to the default
it seems like this would be fixed by using self.full_invert_mask() instead of self.invert_mask in  MeasurementGate._value_equality_values_

Hi @tanujkhattar, I can take this up!
Hi @TarunSinghania ,
Are you working on this or is this fixed already? If not, can I take it up? I'm new to OpenSource and this seems like a good place to start.
