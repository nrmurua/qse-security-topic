cu3(pi, 0, pi) gate should work as controlled X gate, but it is not.
cx: (1, 0) ---> (0, 1)
cu3(pi, 0, pi) : (1, 0) ---> (0, 1)
cx: (1, 0) ---> (0, 1)
cu3(pi, 0, pi) : (1, 0) ---> (0, -i)
Above code prints out
Hi,
But, essentially the state
[ 0.+0.j  0.+0.j  0.+0.j  1.+0.j] and the state
[  0.00e+00+0.j   0.00e+00+0.j   0.00e+00+0.j   6.12e-17-1.j]
are the same up to global phase -j. I have confirmed that the cu3 with target 1 results in essentially the same state with cx up to the global phase -j.
Please refer to:

... A unit vector is usually picked, but its phase factor can be chosen freely anyway. Nevertheless, such factors are important when state vectors are added together to form a superposition.
@yoonbo and @rraymondhp this is correct. It is not a bug it is just a global phase that quantum computers can't be see. I suggest if you look at |<psi_expected|psi_made>|^2 and if this is one then the states are the same.
Thanks. I also wrote about the global phase equivalence of u3 gate in the tutorial below:
