For pretty much all 2 qubit state tomography and all process tomography problems solved with SCS seems to either terminate with :UnknownError or a warning that the computation did not converge.  Changing the maximum number of iterations or the tolerance of the solver has little effect.
Mosek does not seem to have this problem, but it is not free, so not a viable alternative.
I think this is an issue with how SCS specifies the conic problem.  There maybe a way around this...
