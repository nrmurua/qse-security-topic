The context-sensitive area of the compressor might be able to get mileage out of suppressing phase-adjustments between qubits that are going to get washed out by MEASURE instructions. For instance, ISWAP and SWAP look identical from this perspective, but SWAP costs three ISWAPs to implement.
As a more elaborate example, UCRZ gates do not affect probability amplitudes in our measurement basis, and hence they can be safely omitted by an optimizing compiler. This has negligible effect when suppressing RZ gates, but the suppressed entanglers in UCRZ gates may give a noticeable speedup, even in ProtoQuil programs.
