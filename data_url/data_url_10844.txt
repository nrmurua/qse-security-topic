Current Problem
Currently, MIP only considers 0 as a ground state. If a user provides other feasible energy states that are nonzero, MIP will not preserve these other energy levels.
Proposed Solution
Change the inequalities in MIP so that other feasible energy levels are maintained.
This gets closed by #82
