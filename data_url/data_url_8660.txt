While I know that there is no -1-st particle, it should throw an exception rather than kill the kernel.
It crushes for negative indices in general.
I know I am not expected to put it, but it is hardly an unexpected possibility (it is easy to make a "by one omission" in some loop to get this problem).
Another approach to is to use negative indices to denote things counted from end (like in lists).
Thanks. It should definitely be fixed.
