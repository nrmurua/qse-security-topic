The r1, rx, ry and rz methods allow to apply a parameterized gate to the current kernel.
There is an overload for this functions that accept a double parameter and a single qubit:

and there is an overload that accept a QuakeValue for the parameter, a vector of qubits for control operation and a single qubit for the target:

I was wondering if it's possible to add an overload that accept a double parameter, a vector of qubits for control and a single qubit of target. It seems like convert a double to a QuakeValue requires access to the opBuilder member but it is private so I can't do that externally.
