Currently, functions' parameters and return types are precised in the docstrings. It is redundant, because they are already given as typehints.
It would be great to remove these repetitions, by automatically inferring the types in the docs from the typehints. We might for example try to use the library https://github.com/tox-dev/sphinx-autodoc-typehints for that purpose.
That would be very cool! Does it work with how we specify the arguments or does it requires the :param clause?
@lvignoli In our function signature, we have to define the types for the arguments and the sphinx extension will pick it up from there.
@HGSilveri I would like to work on this issue. Could you assign it to me?
For sure @WingCode , sorry for the delay!
