The code from ReleaseNotes causes an error

Run a cell in the Jupyter Notebook
See the error (full log is in the attachment)

I'm not sure it the issue relates to Terra (where XGate is located) or Aqua (which is mentioned in the error).
A gate should be added to the circuit without an error.
If you update Aqua to the latest version your error should be resolved.
As you mentioned already, this error comes from Aqua
but this file does not exist anymore, since the multi-controlled X/Toffoli was moved to Terra. If you have a previous version of Aqua installed where this file still exists, the "new" version will be overwritten with the "old" since Aqua is loaded after Terra.
Could you update Aqua (should be version 0.6.6 if you install from PyPi or 0.7.0 if you install from source) and see if the problem persists?
Hi @Cryoris ,
qiskit update doesn't allow to update qiskit.aqua
When I call pip install -U qiskit it drop qiskit.aqua from 0.6.6 to 0.6.5

If I update till Aqua 0.6.6 the original code still throws an error (see log attached)
Log_aqua_066.log
.
I could try to install aqua/terra/qiskit/whatever versions manually, if someone shares a list with "expected" versions.
I see, the gates still exist in the current stable version. Then you need to install it from source, this is explained here: https://qiskit.org/documentation/contributing_to_qiskit.html#installing-aqua-from-source. If you follow the steps there you should install version 0.7.0 ðŸ™‚
@Cryoris : Aqua 0.7.0 has been installed, everything is awesome now. Ty for your help!
Should I create a bug like "Incorrect versions binding", or it will be fixed during the next release anyway?
This will be fixed in the next release of Qiskit Aqua, since it is already in the master branch. Feel free to open an issue in Qiskit Aqua, then we can discuss if we should fix this before the release.
