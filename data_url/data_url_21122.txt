To reproduce condition:
This will probably change a lot in the next week so it makes sense to delay fixing. It is likely that the new implmentation will fix this.
Telnet interface will be soon deprecated. In the next few weeks the recommend approach is to use the webwallet. A new CLI based on grpc will be available soon.
Telnet client has been replaced by command line client.
