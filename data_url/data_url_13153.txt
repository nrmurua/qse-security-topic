The following warning occurs at every notebook execution in the docs build:
0.00s - Debugger warning: It seems that frozen modules are being used, which may
0.00s - make the debugger miss breakpoints. Please pass -Xfrozen_modules=off
0.00s - to python to disable frozen modules.
0.00s - Note: Debugging will proceed. Set PYDEVD_DISABLE_FILE_VALIDATION=1 to disable this validation.

Best practice to link to the line in the build where the warning is occurring so future us don't have to go looking for it: https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/actions/runs/4921156704/jobs/8790708057?pr=1745#step:6:43
