During the performance comparisons with Qulacs in #289, we realized that some controlled Qibo gates could be improved when single thread execution is used. This is true for the CZ and CNOT gates for which Qulacs provides efficient implementations.
Here are some examples using a notebook CPU (i7-9750H 2.60GHz 6 cores / 12 threads). A circuit of 22 qubits and depth 20 is used in all cases, created as:
for Qibo and
for Qulacs.
Note that
is used to get the controlled-RX gate in Qulacs which typically deteriorates performance.
