In Jupyter Lab, if I instance the job watcher tool it appears in the cell output instead of on the top left of the notebook.
Open a JupyterLab.
Install qiskit (pip install qiskit).
In a cell write:
jQuery is not supported by Jupyter Lab, so it raises an error when instancing a job watcher.
The qiskit job watcher tool should be positioned on the top left, as in Jupyter Notebook.
Use vanilla JS instead of using jQuery to position the widget.
