Hi,
I saw back in issue #205 that @1ucian0 mentioned how fuzzing was something Terra would be interested in. I am wondering if you would be interested in running your current property-based hypothesis fuzz tests with the addition of atheris? And if so, I'd be happy to put effort into making this happen.
Atheris is a coverage-guided fuzzer, and unlike hypothesis, each input is not random but a mutation of the previous best input. This allows atheris to constantly evolve to find the best input to cover the most amount of code. Note that, the addition of atheris will not change your tests and or parameters, only how the input is generated. This can be visualised as follows;
Hypothesis open-loop fuzzing:
Atheris + Hypothesis closed-loop fuzzing:
Adding atheris to hypothesis will also allow for integration into oss-fuzz. This is a handy way to run your fuzz tests automatically every day and you can set up CI so that your fuzz tests are run on every pull request.
