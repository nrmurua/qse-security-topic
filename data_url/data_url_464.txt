We may want to add a new interface (possibly at xacc/xacc/utils) for pulse generation (common waveforms such as gaussian square, Slepian, etc.)
Specific parameters for each pulse type may be provided in a HeterogeneousMap and returns a vector<complex<double>>
This is then exposed to Python via Pybind11 binding.
Worth noting, for Python bindings, we could also provide strong functions for each pulse shape with specific arguments (similar to the ones provided by QuaC) by using the service registry underneath the hood.
i.e.
@amccaskey: for interface guidance
@anthony-santana
I would just say put it at xacc/quantum/utils
