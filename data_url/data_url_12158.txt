@aasfaw what is the goal for the community/exercise folder
remove or make this folder clearer
Hi @jaygambetta
I added this folder for notebooks that contain exercises corresponding to each tutorial we have.
ok work with @aasfaw, @attp, and @quantumjim to make it feel like more than one random tutorial.
