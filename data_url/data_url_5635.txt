Using the snapshot instruction on the statevector simulator causes an error.
The error is the following:
AerError: 'unknown instruction: snapshot'
The function should return a snapshot of the qubit state
I am facing the same issue here. I can provide my error output if required. However, the steps to reproduce the problem is the simplest way that @ManuelGuatto shared.
That was deprecated since version 0.9.0. However, I am not sure if it is as intended that it is no longer available at this time.
snapshot instructions were removed after over 3 months of deprecation warnings. please use save instructions instead.
