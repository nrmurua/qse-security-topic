Does not happen on CI e.g. https://nixbld.m-labs.hk/build/8066/log
Maybe that happens with some combination of conda-build and conda versions?
This is a fresh and clean miniconda installation from today.
I've updated Anaconda/conda-build (note how easy this is with the new system), does the issue still exist?
Did not see this issue while testing #1335 (comment)
Ok. I didn't get the chance to check again. Will close and reopen if it occurs.
I installed ARTIQ-6 (version  6.7480.a97b4633.beta) today with the artiq-board-kasli-ptb3 firmware (build 100211 from https://nixbld.m-labs.hk/job/artiq/full-beta/conda-artiq-board-kasli-ptb3). When I execute conda list I get the same error as in this issue:
I don't know if it is connected, but I also always get the warning, that the old gateware is still installed, when executing the idle experiment:
The flash seems to execute successfully:
artiq_flash -t kasli -V ptb3 -f flash_storage.img storage start
This command is not supposed to flash the firmware. Please read the manual for the correct command.
As for the warning, it again does not occur on CI:
https://nixbld.m-labs.hk/build/100428/log
We have Anaconda 2020.02 on our system:
https://git.m-labs.hk/M-Labs/wfvm/src/branch/master/wfvm/layers/default.nix#L11
What version do you have?
Though CI doesn't install board packages on windows and it seems this is where the warning is from...
artiq_flash -t kasli -V ptb3 -f flash_storage.img storage start
This command is not supposed to flash the firmware. Please read the manual for the correct command.
I am a bit confused, because in https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-beta/installing.html#installing-openocd there are the following commands as an example:
Additionally these already worked on another ARTIQ system we have. Are the arguments wrong?

My output of conda info is:
See https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-beta/installing.html#writing-the-flash
My output of conda info is:
I don't know how this corresponds to versions of the anaconda distribution. Anyway you probably can ignore the warning.
See https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-beta/installing.html#writing-the-flash
Ah I see thank you, the command without the flash storage worked correctly.
