If an instruction is placed after final measurement the MPS simulator sometimes gives incorrect results. This final result shouldn't change the outcome of measurements that have already happened.
The following circuit:
Returns counts {'10': 508, '11': 516}.
It should return counts {'11': 1024}.
There was a mistake in the initialization of the MPS data structure when it is called during multiple shots - the data structure was not cleared. Fixed in PR 390.
Great! I think fixing this will fix a lot of the tests that were failing.
Fixed in #393
