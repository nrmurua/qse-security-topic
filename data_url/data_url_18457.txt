"8q-qvm" etc
Seems reasonable to me!
@notmgsk Is this still relevant? Not seeing references to isa outside tests where they are just parsed with yason.
Are you looking to make use of the lattice names or just prevent them from breaking a parser?
Just allow them in lookup-isa-descriptor-for-name app entrypoint? Just some basic  matching for the \d+Q? I'd assume the lattice name or -qvm suffix isn't relevant there?
@erichulburd Yeah that's my thought. Mimic the behaviour (where appropriate) of pyQuil's get_qc.
One issue is that the forest server endpoints require HTTPS, and so if we were to pull data from forest server (e.g. for "Aspen-*" lattices) then we would introduce an SSL dependency. That's not a terrible thing, but it would likely mean that we have to distribute an SSL library with the SDK. We should decide whether the cost of that extra dependency is worth the utility of this feature.
