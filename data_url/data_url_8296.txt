Does qutip use multiprocessor packages? (like MPI etc.)
I have large, non linear, stiffly oscillated Hamiltonian system that needs to be accelerated. I am really curious about the difference between dif. eqn. solvers of qutip and ordinary numpy odeint ('LSODA') solver.
Qutip use Scipy's Ode solvers. The interface of scipy solvers chaged in recent version, but we are still using ode. We are using zvode integrator and adams method per default. Most of qutip's solver accept an options arguments which can change the method to 'bdf' but cannot be changed to Isoda or dopri.
Mpi is not supported but multiprocessing is used by mcsolve and the stochastic solvers. If you compile qutip yourself, we have a openmp parallelized matrix-vector product which can be used to speed up problem with large Hamiltonian.
What a nice and comprehensive answer, Eric. I get this kind of questions asked a lot. I know there are some details on the website, I wonder whether it would be interesting to have a notebook showcase these features, or somewhere on the website where this is mentioned. Also, I would like to add a slide about it in the QuTiP presentations (one so comprehensive).
Just to mention, another issue with references to parallel computing, mainly showing how it can work in practice #438

Thank you for your detailed answers.
