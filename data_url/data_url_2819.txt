Kind of confusing to violate the "it's a list of moments" pattern in this way.
Yeah I agree it would be nice to take in Moments.  This essentially means that we broaden the definition of an OP_TREE?
I'm not sure. There's a lot of code that expects op trees to just be operations. I think we should just broaden this specific method to allow its argument to be a moment.
Does that expectation ever take a form other than assuming it's slicable and iterable? Why not add __getitem__ and __iter__ methods to Moment like Circuit has?
@bryano Those are the main ones. But I think we should push that further, because people know how to work with lists and we can bootstrap off of that knowledge when getting them to work with circuit.
Yes, we could consider making a moment act more like a list of operations.
