Is it possible to add multiplayer support?
I'm new to minetest. I'm trying setup a server to have a gathering inside qiskit blocks.
For some reason it is always crashing, even when joining a localhost server.
Thx
Hi James :)
I've been able to figure out setting up vanilla minetest servers.
But for some reason when I try to host a qiskitblock server I get this crash:

All the best,

btw, the techspot link is nice to have direct access to the compiled minetest mac app. But unfortunately it seems to only be hosting the lastest version: 5.4.
Luckily it seems to be able to launch qiskitblocks in single player mode. It's just the multiplayer mode that is tricky rn.
To work around the error I wrote this little patch for q_command/init.lua:
This makes the game playable in multiplayer. However, I assume it has unintended side effects even though I don't have any further knowledge of the QiskitBlocks code.
Nevertheless, we tried to play in multiplayer. We were two players and played through escape rooms 1-14 (level 1).
In the 15th room we somehow managed to loose the necessary blocks. I don't remember exactly how it happened. I think one player took the blocks from the chest, placed them on the circuit and later jumped through the portal while the other player was in room 14.
Even though the game is not optimized for multiplayer, we enjoyed tackling the puzzles together. Situations like the one described above can be remedied with the help of the /give command or creative mode.
