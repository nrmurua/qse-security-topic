There have been a series of pr #1509 and #1515 and one for matplotlib (im not going to find it here) where we have removed some dependencies from requirements.txt and put them in requirements-dev.txt.
It looks like we are making our philosophy be that qiskit should have a minimum that works and all the cool plotting, visualization, and jypter features are addons. So, we have a try to check if the user has it and if they do, we use it.
My questions are
what we expect if a user goes pip install qiskit my view is they should get all the features.
The try imports do not check version so there is a case where the user has them and our check will pass but the code could fail as the version is not correct.
If we go with one being full-featured how do, we have pip install qiskit[light] or do we stay with pip being the minimum we need something like pip install qiskit[extras] to add the things from dev that are used in try imports. We have this for visualizations.
Can we add a description of what we are doing to the install?
We cannot give everything due to the dependency on the graphviz binary. However, ideally users should be able to do everything by default
Visualizations team: perhaps pillow can also be considered a visualization-only dependency?
Yes pillow is only used in the latex and mpl drawers.
closing as not part of #12
