Description of the issue
flynt is a tool for converting %-format and "{}".format() strings to Python f-strings.
It is used in the check/format-incremental script and also as an example for package metadata reading in a unit tests here.
The same functionality can be provided by the consider-using-f-string pylint rule.
I propose to use pylint rule instead of pylint and also replace flynt usage in the unit test with a more common package.
Cirq version
1.2.0.dev at 3f8d83a
cirq-sync: accepted lets remove flynt and use the new dependency instead
dev_tools/pr_monitor.py disables consider-using-f-string at file level. We probably want to re-enable.
