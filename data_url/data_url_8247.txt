Expected behavior: add_1q_gate applies the specified gate to the whole register.
Actual behavior: add_1q_gate sets end to N-1, and iterates with range(start, end) to apply the single qubit rotations. Since range() does not include the stop, the last qubit is not affected.
You are correct, also this does not comply with user behavior in the sense that it does not apply the qubit on the end gate specified by the "end" argument.
