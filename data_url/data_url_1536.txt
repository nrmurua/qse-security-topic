Description of the issue
README.rst has a continuous integration badge based on Github actions.  For reasons I don't quite understand it is red, even though the CI is passing.  I'm not sure if there was some change to the github actions or if this is a github bug
How to reproduce the issue
Goto https://github.com/quantumlib/cirq and see the sad red status.
The CI Badge is now green, so the issue is fixed.

How was it fixed?
I didn't investigate further into it. We can maybe reopen and investigate if it happens again.
