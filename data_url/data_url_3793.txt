Current Problem
A Julia API. Julia is much easier to use than Python. Also, its much more fast. DWave's Ocean SDK is kinda the only resource out there for Adiabatic Quantum Computing.
Proposed Solution
Develop a Julia API.
Alternatives Considered
. If its not possible, does a C API exist? If so, kindly point me to it.
While we do have Julia on our radar, we haven't set a timeline for "Julia Ocean".
Have you tried using it via libraries like PyCall.jl?
OTOH, we are actively working on standardizing and publishing a C API for some parts of Ocean, like dimod.
I want to remark that there is a package under development called Anneal.jl https://github.com/psrenergy/Anneal.jl that hopes to interface most of Ocean to Julia with some other features such as integration with JuMP.jl
