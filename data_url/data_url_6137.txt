When running a circuit with measure sampling the stabilizer simulation method sets number of shot threads to the available threads.
This leads to different behaviour for this backend when using a snapshot since it will return one snapshot for each parallel thread rather than a single snapshot as with the statevector simulator.
returns (on my system)
It should return
where N is either 1 (since stabilizer doesn't support OpenMP for state update atm), or the available threads if we add OpenMP support to the method.
