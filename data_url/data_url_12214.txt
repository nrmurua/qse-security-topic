Following #337 I updated "wigner_functions.ipynb" to run on Qiskit 0.6.1 and I faced the following issues:
As a temporary solution, I added plot_wigner_plaquette() and plot_wigner_curve() methods from terra (_state_visualization.py) to the notebook to perform these plots.
Let me know if this is a possible/temporary solution to update the notebook.
moving to Qiskit/qiskit#1106 in terra.
closing with #532
