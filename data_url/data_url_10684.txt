Due to recent problem check added in sample_ising(), the following script fails:
Since h is a list of values for all qubits including 0 for the faulty ones, the check in line 278, not (all(v in nodes for v in h) , fails as nodes only include the indices of the working qubits.
This causes all previous codes passing linear terms as a list to break.
Thanks for the bug report! We have made a fix in #201 , let us know if this doesn't resolve the issue.
