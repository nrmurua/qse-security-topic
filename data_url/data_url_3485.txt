I tried to compile a single-qubit rotation gate as an example of a parametric gate:
and I received the following error message:
I posted this on Slack. Mark Skilbeck suggested that it may be a parsing bug and that I should open an issue here.
Using pyquil_protect, I extracted the program returned by the compiler:
It should be DEFGATE R(%theta): at minimum. (The compiler's parser will detect this OK and give you a good error message.) Otherwise, the compiler parser is correct. As the backtrace says, looks like something is awry with the PyQuil parser. (Edit: There is also something awry with how the compiler is printing the info back.)
Oh, no, I meant that this is what was being returned by the compiler. The program sent by pyQuil was:
I'll bet there's a faulty format string in print-parsed-program.
@ecp-rigetti confirmed there is a bug in the print routine, which is being fixed, and will be deployed in the next release.
Closing this issue because the commit was released internally.
The compiler is case-insensitive when it comes to function names (cis == cIS == CIS etc). The pyquil parser however only matches lower-case names. Need to decide whether the compiler should output lower case names (easy) or whether the parser should be case-insensitive (hard?).
Good:
Bad (returned by quil compiler)
Thoughts @ecp-rigetti @stylewarning @mpharrigan
Something here about case-insensitive parsing. Not sure about performance penalty.
