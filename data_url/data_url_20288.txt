Can we confirm that ALL public-key/secret-key sizes and ciphertext sizes are fixed for a given scheme? (unlike signature sizes, which can vary when signing twice with the same scheme)
Now that I think about it, the actual keypair/encaps/decaps functions don't dynamically allocate memory, don't take lengths as inputs, and the don't return lengths as output; they assume that they are passed at least as much memory as the length_* members indicate.  They may or may not use all of that memory, but we always treat that memory as opaque.  So I would say that yes, we can assume these sizes are fixed for a given KEM.
Closing issue, reopen if you want to discuss more, @vsoftco .
