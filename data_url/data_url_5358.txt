Currently, GitHub workflow runs Dv2 or DSv2 instances (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dv2-dsv2-series). We may have more careful use of LCOV_EXCL_LINE (http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov/geninfo.1.php), but its use seems limited when we anyway hit a function, but a branch inside of the function is taken depending on the runtime architecture information (as in Memory.hpp).
Related discussion can be found actions/runner#1069.
Closed by #340. We may revisit this issue when the problem appears again, or we have dedicated coverage runners for AVX2/512 architectures.
