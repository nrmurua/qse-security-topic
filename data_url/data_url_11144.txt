Right now using most of the plugins or MolecularData class will default to the installation directory specified in the config file, which could be in a very inconvenient location for some people.  Also, in my own workflows I'm most interested in keeping data local to a particular project rather than OpenFermion itself, hence it would be better if the universal defaults were the working directory of the user of the code, rather than the installation directory. It should also be the case that when filenames are passed of the form "./data/myfilename.hdf5", that this is the 'data' directory within the current working directory, not in the installation data directory. Any thoughts to the contrary?
+1, it was pointed out to me (didn't know this was a thing at all) that storing data in lib/.../site-packages is considered bad form and that that directory is usually considered semi-volatile.
This might be unique to me and how I use OpenFermion, but I appreciate having all the data in one place. I tend to sort directories by molecule/ensemble, and having all data about various molecules/basis sets in one place makes it very convenient to sort through files/analyze things.
I like @jarrodmcc 's last idea. Perhaps the setting of the directory can be done with a function, like openfermion.set_data_directory('DIRECTORY_NAME') or something like that.
Setters are usually not necessary without a specific reason, I think it's simpler to just change the variable here. Thoughts on saving into cwd/OpenFermion-data/ or something instead of directly into cwd?
