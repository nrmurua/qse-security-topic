Nvidia fortran and nvc compilers (nvcompilers/2020) throw a lot of "declared but never referenced" warnings during the compilation. These have to be silenced.
I assume by silencing you mean cleaning the code by removing variables that are never used.
@agoetz These are coming from libxc since we use only some parts of the code in CUDA version. We cannot remove them. Adding -Wno-unused-variable into C flag list should easily solve this.
Ah, OK. Makes sense. But we should use that flag only for libxc. We don't want unused variables to sneak into our code. Thanks!
@Madu86 was this addressed?
Resolved in legacy build at the time but CMake build doesnt support NVIDIA compilers at the moment. Closing this issue now.
