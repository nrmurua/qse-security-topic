The Ethernet SFP0 LED is always off with Kasli 1.1, but works with 1.0. The Ethernet link works correctly on 1.1.
The code driving the LED is in MiSoC.
The LED   and a few more signals assignment changed between versions.
The code takes that into account already, but still it doesn't work. I'll look at the various input signals with microscope.
MOD_PRESENT polarity is different between the two versions.
