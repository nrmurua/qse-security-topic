Currently, when adding a hybrid algorithm it is stored as a QuantumAlgorithm but no quantumComputationModel is set.
Furthermore, quantumComputationModel in QuantumAlgorithmDto is set to NotNull.
Further mapping for HYBRID to QUANTUM algorithms is required.
See table quantum_algorithm:
First entry is a hybrid algorithm
