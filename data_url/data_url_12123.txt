Under section 5, links under 5.1 (Qiskit Artificial Intelligence), 5.2 (Qiskit Chemistry), 5.3 (Qiskit Finance) map to Qiskit Optimization page.
Click on the links within the notebook shown in the screenshot below:

The appropriate pages for each section are navigated to after opening another tab. For instance, clicking on Qiskit AI should navigate the user to Qiskit Artificial Intelligence
Update links
hi @fifimatu
i think it is the best way to have a new tab opened once you click on a link so that your main page and the new appropriate page is open.
if u wanna select any other link , you already have the main page opened.
but if the link opens up on the same tab you will have to go back and repeat the process, and that would result in waste of time and data consumption.
according to me there are no necessary updates for this concern.
hope i was able to clarify your issue.
and request you to close the issue.
This is no longer needed.
