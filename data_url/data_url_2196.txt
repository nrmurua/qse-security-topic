PhasedX(0.123)^0.456 makes the circuit diagrams really long. I propose changing it to PhX(0.123)^0.456
I wonder how confused people are by "phased"?  The one reason I don't like it is that it is a basis dependent concept, i.e. it means phased in Z basis.  RotXY, for example, would generalize to other two pauli rotations nicely, RotYZ, RotXZ.  On the other hand for qubits that are clocks it really is a natural gate.
But I do like PhX.
PhasedXPowGate certainly was not obvious to me at first but yeah I'm mainly concerned about circuit diagram width :)
Sounds good to me.
can you please assign it to me. I will have a look.
Hi,
I can see reference to word PhasedX has been spread across multiple files as listed. This includes docstring as well.
let me know if it's ok changed all of them.

Where do you see PhasedX in moment.py?
You should only change PhasedX to PhX in strings that are circuit diagrams or circuit diagram info.
ahh apologies @Strilanc ,  moment.py wasn't part of it. I will follow your instructions.
