A follow-on from #326. Using the --strict flag with mypy produces another 98 errors that will need to be squashed.

Looks like there is some discussion in the mypy project around how strict to be: python/mypy#7767
Even if we don't decide to go for full strictness, there are definitely errors in the above that are concerning and should be fixed.
