I'm running the notebook "1_getting_started_with_qiskit.ipynb". When I reach at the step
I get the error:
Run:
The said notebook from top, till the line
I was expecting to see the plot of the output state.
Install matplotlib in the running environment. Done. Still getting the same error.
Matplotlib version: 3.1.1
Dive into the code of state_visualization.py. Maybe the line from .matplotlib import HAS_MATPLOTLIB is problematic.
Hi mlliarm, it means you don't have matplotlib installed on your machine. Are you using jupyter notebook?
Thanks for your response,  but before I start messing with some files, I will like you do this for me.
At the very top of your code, before any other code. Open a new cell and type the following.
!pip install matplotlib
Try running it, then at the top of your qiskit code, bfr importing any library,  input this
%matplotlib inline
Follow by your codes..... Try this and let me know
If your in a notebook and you install something you need to restart the kernel
@nonhermitian That should be probably it. I restarted the notebook after having installed matplotlib from the terminal, and it works as it should. Thank you.
@esobimpe Thanks for the fast response but it was what @nonhermitian mentioned. For the history, the output of !pip install matplotlib yields:
Hello! I'm using qiskit on visual studio on a python script and I can't visualize plots. It tells me to install matplotlib which I did and I've already restarted the kernel. Does anybody have any idea on how to fix this?
Mmm I'm trying but it's giving me errors, it won't run
This is what my code and terminal look like



I tried but it gives me a syntax error

Yeah I've been using jupyter notebooks so far, but I want to pass to scripts and understand why it is giving me this problem. Thank you for your help!
I also have same problem nay by putting %matplotlib inline  on the top doesn't help.
