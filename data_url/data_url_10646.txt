Newer versions of the code allow the user to specify an individual value of chain strength for each chain by passing a dictionary to the sample function.
However, calling sample_qubo with chain_strength = dict_of_chain_strengths, warnings.py throws an error because it expects a scalar value as the chain strength parameter. Setting warnings = "ignore" bypasses the warnings function call and the system produces the desired behavior.
Obviously ignoring warnings is not desirable, so the warnings code should be updated to the new flexibility in chain strength input.
