DumpUnitary tool (a companion to UnitaryPatterns kata) still assumes pre-0.6 output format of DumpMachine, with just 3 tab-separated entries per basis state. Current output is more sophisticated, so the tool doesn't work. Here is an example of the current output format:
The complex number that represents the amplitude is tab-separated from the rest of the fields, and the real and imaginary components within are separated with spaces.
It would be nice to update the logic of parsing DumpMachine output (Driver.cs, lines 32-40) to parse the new format instead of the old one.
