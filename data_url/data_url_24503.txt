In upstream qcodes the test for MultiParameter (introduced here #140) breaks. In particular the test_scan2D function fails, but probably also some of the PAT measurements.
@CJvanDiepen Do you still use the MultiParameter functionality?
@lucblom @CJvanDiepen Can you look into solving this issue?
Working on it... More info see branch fix/MultiParameter.
Seems fixed, closing
