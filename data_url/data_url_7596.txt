branch math, src/Core/ folder.
add kron methods for a new kind of Sparse Matrix: PermuteMultiply
https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/stdlib/SparseArrays/src/sparsematrix.jl
add construction of more gates
add benchmarks for gate construction using new method and kron method, see time elapse and memory allocation.
gates to be realized are specified in gates.ipynb and basic_gates.ipynb
please uncomment the @assert statements to pass these tests.
see reference in slack for detail of these gates.
