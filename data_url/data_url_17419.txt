gives
Are you able to reproduce this on master? I took a look at this failure and I was able to reproduce it on 0.7.x but not on master (with the latest version of qiskit-ibmq-provider installed). Comparing the 2 it looks like it's because on master an Experiment object was added to the qobj object instead of using a dict for experiments on 0.7.x.
Ok closing this, and will re raise if necessary
