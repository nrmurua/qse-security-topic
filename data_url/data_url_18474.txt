Following the PR #148, in refactoring, a (reduce #'matmul (list a b c) in the optimal-2q routine was turned into (matmul a (matmul b c)) which mathematically should be the same. However, it caused tests to fail on the GitLab test runner, but not locally for me on macOS. Changing it to reflect the behavior of reduce, i.e., (matmul (matmul a b) c), allowed the tests to pass again.
This obviously suggests some degree of fragility.
This issue (as in GitHub Issue (TM)) could be resolved in any number of ways:
I've attached the log file broken-quilc.log of the previously failing test to this issue.
