I am trying to run the Grover's algorithm, it worked nicely on the local qasm simulator but when i change the backend on ibmqx5 i got the following error:
qiskit.dagcircuit._dagcircuiterror.DAGCircuitError: 'inequivalent gate definitions for cx'
and again when i changed the backend to ibmq_qasm_simulator i get the following error:
qiskit._resulterror.ResultError: DEVICE_NOT_FOUND: Device not found.
i have placed circuit.barrier(qr) in front of the oracle, diffusion as well as in measurement. and also i had changed the time out to 300
Thank you!!
Hi, thanks reporting this issue.
I also found a similar issue and am thinking that it may be caused by the mapper.
I have raised the issue here:
Qiskit/qiskit#492
By the way, please update your qiskit to the latest version by pip install -U qiskit.
Thank You @rraymondhp now ay get similar error as
https://github.com/rraymondhp/qiskit-tutorial/blob/ba1d80923fc02234f1fadda7be996bdd6fb4c712/reference/algorithms/grover_algorithm.ipynb
says
qiskit.mapper._mappererror.MapperError: 'initial_layout qubit qin[15] not in input DAGCircuit'
Hi @amantamirat
There is a bug when using two or more quantum registers with different names. It will be fixed on the next release.
Hi @amantamirat
The bug with multiple registers has been fixed with version 0.5.3
Please update your qiskit-sdk-py by pip install -U qiskit.
Meanwhile, I have updated the tutorial for Grover search as the link below:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/reference/algorithms/grover_algorithm.ipynb
@rraymondhp can we close
Thanks. Yes, it is solved.
Hello beautiful people sorry for lost , DAG circuit now is not the problem but this
qiskit._qiskiterror.QISKitError: '"{'message': 'Error parsing QASM. Error parsing qasm number 0.', 'statusCode': 400, 'status': 400, 'code': 'QASM_NOT_VALID'}"'
the code works fine in any simulator devices but when i try to run on real Quantum device it give me this Error
Hello,
Have you updated qiskit to be the latest (version 0.5.6)?
yes I have updated, but still the same error message!!!!!
Hi @amantamirat
I succeeded to run the program, so I guess I need to know more of your program.
Below is the link to my program:
https://github.com/rraymondhp/qiskit-tutorial/blob/rr-v56-grover/reference/algorithms/grover_algorithm.ipynb
Hello: my program is a Grover algorithm that searches from array but when i increase the size of the array the error is occurred .technically in ibm simulator no more than 8 elements i.e. 3 iteration and for ibmx5 is only 2 iterations are working beyond this size it is not working !!
