How is OpenQL debugged?
QL_DOUT around every statement makes the code less readable but QL_DOUT etc are useful to have an low-entry trace of events to get a first impression of what preceded a crash.
An improvement would be to have pass-level toggles to turn them on/off, or to a particular level; note that this is at compiler run-time, passing options on the compiler command line to particular passes.
