In the IAE algorithm, on line 478, shouldn't the probability prob be replaced by round_one_counts/round_shots?
In the case where the data from different iterations with the same Grover power are joined together, only the Clopper Pearson confidence intervals seem to consider the joint information, whereas the Chernoff method considers the total shots but the probability of the latest iteration alone.
