With the recently added support for Microwave channels and a corresponding "XY Mode" in a Pulser sequence (Refer to this reference for some background on the physics), it remains to add the corresponding simulation support. This implies adding an XY Hamiltonian which takes as time-dependent coefficients the pulses of the sequence, and will imply several changes to the Simulation class:
To check things are working correctly, one could try to add a test displaying Rabi Oscillations with similar properties as that of Fig. 1(c) of the Reference, with one and then several atoms in an array and global/local pulses.
Closing this just until #144 is merged.
Hello,
I would like to do it.
Hello Slimane,
Thanks for taking the time for this! Let me know if you need any help along the way.
Status update:
Support for XY Simulation has been successfully added and is currently residing in the xy-simulation branch. Since the work on this feature started, the develop branch has diverged to incorporate support for noisy simulations. Therefore, the changes in xy-simulation now need to be reconciled with those in the develop branch, with the goal of ultimately merging xy-simulation into develop.
Status update:
The xy-simulation has been (apparently) successfully merged into noisy-xy (which was branched from develop). This issue can then be closed once noisy-xy is merged into develop.
