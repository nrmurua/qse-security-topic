If you pass in a list of line colors ie
plot_gate_map(backend_real,label_qubits=False,qubit_color=qubit_color,line_color=line_color)
this works fine for the old provider, but with the new provider the line_color list is not synced with the coupling map (the edges which are colored are completely off).
Run this with a backend from the old and new provider
Old provider:

New (didn't even change an edge):

No response
