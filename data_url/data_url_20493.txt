Continuing a discussion from #91 regarding ssh and sshd command line examples:
I'm not sure off the top of my head what's going on here, but it seems like there's a good lead sign_and_send_pubkey to follow up.
@xvzcf : I traced this down to a routine peeking into the sshbuf: 
So, Question: Do you recall feeding this buffer correctly with the algorithm name? Where would this be? Possibly at the server? Please let me know if you do not have time for this issue; I'll then keep digging on my own. Simply disabling this bad string check for algorithm name has everything working OK, so it should be a minor issue...
I think I have an idea, let me investigate.
@xvzcf This is the only thing we're waiting on for making OpenSSH v8 the default. Will you be able to take a look in the next few days?
Updated to add: Actually, should say that @baentsch thought this was the only thing we're waiting on for making OpenSSH v8 the default, do you agree @xvzcf?
Looks like I introduced the bug through these lines. I've fixed it, will upload a PR tomorrow or the day after updating the test suite to test the README commands as well.
