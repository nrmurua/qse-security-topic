It's extremely costly to convert from stabilizer to ket, at the moment. This is because QStabilizer::GetQuantumState() is called with an intermediary full-size allocation, duplicated in a QEngine, then calling SetQuantumState(). However, I think it's conceptually valid if SetQuantumState() is overloaded to accept stabilizer tableau "format." This would halve allocation spikes, upon conversion.
