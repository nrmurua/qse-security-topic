circuit before compile
circuit above is truncated from full device size
circuit after compile
[0,5] and [5,10] are both in the device coupling map, default transpile remaps even though the circuit is already mapped
precompiled and compiled circuits should be the same
temporary workaround: provide explicit 1 to 1 initial_layout
I was not able to reproduce this.
In master:
In 0.7.1:
This issue is reproducible only when the cirucuit is submitted to the device.
I found the source of error: the barrier is considered in the check for circuit compatibility to the coupling_map. But only gates should be. I will push a fix.
