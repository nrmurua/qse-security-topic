No informative output for the %qiskit_backend_monitor backend and %qiskit_backend_overview commands:

Note that the text versions backend_monitor(back)and backend_overview() return properly.
Backend information, eg:

Hmm, I'm not able to reproduce this locally. When I ran %qiskit_backend_monitor and %qiskit_backend_overview it outputs everything fine.:


I did encounter a few failures, but there was always an error message that the api failed and returned a 502 (which is too common).
Just to check there is no stack trace or any errors anywhere and the boxes are just empty? Also just sanity checking are matplotlib and ipywidgets installed? Those are what's used to render the boxes in the magics. (although I would expect it to fail with an error message if it couldn't find the libraries if that was what's the issue)
matplotlib and ipywidgets are installed (other jupyter monitoring tools work fine), I just an empty box in the case of %qiskit_backend_monitor backend and no output at all for %qiskit_backend_overview.
Can you tell us what ipywidgets version you have?
I also can not reproduce this.  In addition I am getting many 502 and 400 errors (love the generic error), but they are all being reported.
The puzzling thing, and the one that makes me suspect ipywidgets version, is that the box shows up, but not the inside.  So the routine is getting to the final step without error, but nothing is visible.
Are you also doing %matplotlib inline at the top of your notebook?
@attp was this solved for you?
@nonhermitian - I am running %matplotlib inline at the top of my notebook and I'm using ipywidgets version 7.4.2
@ajavadia unfortunately, this hasn't been solved for me yet.
I have just tried creating a whole new conda environment with a clean install of qiskit, and it still doesn't work. I don't know what in my setup could be causing this. Feel free to close this if you want, I can't find anybody who can replicate the issue.
@nonhermitian any other ideas why this may be failing apart from ipywidgets?
I have no idea. It is JavaScript at output. Perhaps a JavaScript blocker in the web?  What happens if browsers are switched?
I have just tried this in Firefox, Safari and Chrome with no success.
Ok, last try. Run this in terminal then check again:
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
Or maybe this if in virtual env
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension
Success! (not sure which of the enabling extension commands fixed the issue, I ran both)

Ok great. I believe it was pip installing the widgets did not activate them.
