QInterface has quite a number of (slow) default implementations for operations which have already been optimized. These default implementations are convenience methods, calling back into the public interface to achieve implementation via decomposition into simpler public interface gates.
These have been essential in implementing new engine types, and they will serve the same purpose for any future engine types. They are also useful for debugging optimized gates against more reliable default implementations. However, they lack coverage, as they are hidden by optimized implementations.
We need unit tests specifically for the default implementations. It should be possible to still access them directly, for testing, in any class that inherits from QInterface.
I can do this, within the next few days, unless someone else would like to. It will probably take the form of a --proc-qinterface partial set of tests.
