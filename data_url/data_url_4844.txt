tensorcircuit is not installed in the image, as well as other issues after pip install tensorcircuit
thanks for the report, tensorcircuit is indeed not installed in the docker, it can be used via pip or there is a latest version tensorcircuit source code in the docker which can be used or some local develop version of tensorcircuit codebase can be mounted to the docker. (maybe I better to record the expected behavior somewhere)
Could you kindly remind me what other issues are within the docker?
perhaps some module compatibility issue. you can see it after pip install tensorcircuit, otherwise none.
