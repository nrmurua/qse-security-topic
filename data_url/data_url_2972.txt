This may be a duplicate.
Right now Schedule takes a device, but doesn't use it.  For example I can add a scheduled operation for a gate that does not match what the device says it should be.  I think schedules should always use the device?
Circuit right now doesn't take a device.  I propose that it should take a device, which by default can be an unconstrained device.
Right now there is some ambiguity in device's methods.  For instance validate_scheduled_operation takes a schedule and a scheduled_operation, but doesn't say whether that operation is required to be part of the schedule or not.  We'd need to make sure this was clear.  We'd also need to add a similar method validate_circuit_operation for circuits.
@maffo @Strilanc comments?
I agree that Schedule should use the device. Another example of awkward interface is that ScheduledOperation can be created using the op_at_on factory method, which takes a Device to get the right duration, but then when this operation is included in a schedule, we don't know whether it was created based on the schedule's device (e.g. we don't check the length). It might be better to instead have include take an Operation and Timestamp and do the length determination there.
I also think having Circuit take a device would be good, and then it can fail loudly (and early) if you try to add an operation that the device does not support (CZ between qubits that are not connected, for example).
Removing from milestone because the part that we needed is done.
@Strilanc this should be closed
Schedule and Circuit currently take device.  There is likely more work on this boundary, but I think these should be opened as separate issues.
