The current implementation of Krotov works for real pulses only. This needs to be fixed.
This is a prerequisite for #3, #4, #9 working as intended.
@danielreich Is there any drawback to not allowing complex controls, but requiring the user to write out the Hamiltonian explicitly with the real and imaginary part as two independent controls?
For example, a typical Hamiltonian H = H₀ + ϵ⁺(t) â + ϵ(t) â⁺ would be rewritten as H = H₀ + ϵᵣ(t)(â + â⁺) + ϵᵢ(t) (i â - i â⁺) with ϵᵣ(t) and ϵᵢ(t) the real and imaginary part of the original control (and ⁺ indicating the complex conjugate or dagger).
As far as I can tell, the only reason we don't do this in QDYN is because of the data structure of the Hamiltonian, which has a specific way of encoding complex controls, and for "molecular" Hamiltonians (i.e., not ham_matrices), we cannot represent Hamiltonians in the rewritten form. However, QuTiP has no such restrictions, and it would very greatly simplify the implementation of Krotov (besides not having to come up with a way to communicate the relationship between ϵ(t) and ϵ⁺(t) in the objectives, and to QuTiP)
In direct communication with Daniel, we came to the conclusion that this is indeed the way to go. Therefore, for example notebooks that require complex control fields (#3, #4, #9), see the section How to optimize complex control fields  in the documentation.
