No tests should ever be imported and so test directories shouldn't have init files.
However removing init files causes test collection to fail because (I think) text files don't unique names. For example, there is test_conversions.py for both mitiq_qiskit and mitiq_pyquil. See below.
Proposed fix is to get rid of all init files from test directories and make test filenames unique, e.g. test_pyquil_conversions.py and test_qiskit_conversion.py.
