When running ninja gen_docs, doxygen always generate the docs on top of the src directory instead of using the build directory passed to cmake. This happens because of this line in Doxyfile

And it will fail to create the directory docs if build doesn't exist already.
I don't understand what you mean by "generate the docs on top of the src directory" -- I see them being generated in build/docs.  That being said, I agree that we have hardcoded the directory in the Doxyfile to build/docs rather than whatever directory cmake was run in; I don't know how to fix that because the .Doxyfile is not generated by CMake.
I meant src/build/docs with src being the path of the source code. Probably this is not relevant for people just downloading the source code and compiling locally, but it can be an issue for packagers. I actually noticed this while creating a package for Arch Linux. The "standard" way of dealing with cmake packages in Arch (and I guess other distros) when building in a clean chroot environment is to have the src and build in the same directory, not build inside src (see how I pass -C and -S to cmake in the build() function).
Isn't it possible to delete that line from the Doxyfile and handle that in the CMakeLists.txt?
When you talk about src, are you talking about the src directory inside the liboqs directory, or is that src/src in your terminology?
Sorry for the confusion, maybe I should have used source instead of src. In my previous comments, that directory you mention is indeed src/src.
Okay, I understand now.  I've tried to fix it in #1357, can you see if that does what you're looking for?
