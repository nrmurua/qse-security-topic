DensityMatrix.from_instruction fails after measurement.
The second print fails with
QiskitError: 'Cannot apply instruction with classical bits: measure'
I expect the density matrix of the mixed state after measurement, according to https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-quantum-hardware/density-matrix.html#mixed
While I can use QuantumCircuit.save_density_matrix, it returns empirical measurements. E.g., if the true matrix entry is 1/2, it can return 0.496 due to variance.
My understanding is that the Statevector class and the DensityMatrix class from quantum_info do not support measurements (non-unitary operations in general) by design, so this isn't really a bug.
The description given in the qiskit textbook is simply an example of how the density matrix represents the "lack of knowledge" of a given state, which is expressed in terms of classical probabilities. Performing a measurement isn't really necessary to demonstrate this. It is equally valid to say that you have "lost access" to q1 or simply ignored it. This can be properly simulated using the partial_trace function to trace out q1.
