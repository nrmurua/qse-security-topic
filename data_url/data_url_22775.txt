AFAICT the various packages that are installed from anaconda can be combined into one:
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/.travis/get-anaconda.sh#L8
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/.travis.yml#L16
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/.travis.yml#L20
You mean combine those installations in a one liner?
like : conda install jinja2 migen cython pip coverage binstar
Yes Combine. Originally I had all conda packages installed at https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/.travis/get-anaconda.sh#L10 with the arguments from https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/.travis.yml#L16
But you can move them to wherever you like.
Done, thanks :)
In fact, installing conda-build and jinja2 is mandatory to take place in the "root" environment and cannot be done in the virtual env. I will add those in get-anaconda.sh.
