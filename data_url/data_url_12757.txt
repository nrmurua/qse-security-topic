In Part I. Matrices and Basic Operations - Matrices and Vectors
It says:
𝐴𝑖,𝑗  refers to the element in row  𝑖  and column  𝑗  of matrix  𝐴  (all indices are 0-based). In the above example,  𝐴0,1=2 .
But Wikipedia says:
The individual items in an m×n matrix A, often denoted by ai,j, where i and j usually vary from 1 to m and n, respectively, are called its elements or entries.

This is from Wolfram MathWorld (https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Matrix.html)

Mike and Ike also uses 1-indexed matrices.
That really depends on the convention. In programming (in most modern languages... not talking about Fortran) arrays typically use 0-based indices, and since this tutorial is heavily on Python programming, we chose to use 0-based indices to match the notation.
You're right :) Sorry about that. I was thinking from just a math perspective. I didn't think from a programming perspective. Indeed, numpy uses 0 based indexing for their matrices. Taking Linear Algebra this semester, so have math on the brain :)
