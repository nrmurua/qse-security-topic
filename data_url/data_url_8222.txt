Describe the bug
I'm trying to run some example projects but consistently run into an issue with numpy. I'm quite new to numpy so I couldn't figure out a suitable fix.
The following is taken from J. R. Johansson's tutorial 1 (Jaynes Cumming Model), which ran on numpy 1.81. I am currently running numpy 1.16.5. I also tested lower versions of numpy down to 1.14.0
To Reproduce
Here is the code to reproduce it:
The terminal out put is
Hi @life-elixir, you cannot convert output.states to a NumPy array because it is a list of class object defined in QuTiP (called Qobj). It is not just a matrix but has other attributes like dimensions. If you want to select a state from output.states at a certain time step t, you can use its index in your tlist.
For example:
You have tlist = np.array([0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]).
To get the state at t = 0.2, use output.states[2].
So a possible solution of your example is rho_list = output.states[t_idx]
