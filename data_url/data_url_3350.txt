In this line and similar other places in that module, the call rpc_timeout is explicitly set, which overrides the user-configurable timeout set on the quilc_client. This assumes that if quilc doesn't respond to the connection check request (which is how get_version_info is being used here), that it must be "unreachable" or "not running." If quilc is under heavy load, that may not be the case - it may just be delayed in responding.
This timeout should not be overridden and should be left as the same timeout as the other calls to quilc. This will allow the user to configure it, and will prevent confusing "not running" error messages.
Additionally, those error messages should be more clear that there are other possible causes for the timeout.
