Trying to execute this notebook on VS Code with python 3.9.6 but the following error appears:
whereas this executes perfectly on Google Colab. Wondering what the issue might be?
Moreover, having trouble installing TFQ too:
Any help is much appreciated, thanks.
Only tensorflow 2.5 and up supports python 3.9 (see https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip). Hence you won't be able to install tensorflow 2.4 on a python 3.9 system.
Like @lockwo  mentioned, right now there is no release version of TFQ that can work with TF >= 2.5.0. If you would like you can do pip install tensorflow==2.7.0 and then pip install -U tfq-nightly which should work on python39. We are planning to cut a new release version soon based off of our nightly releases that would fix this issue.
