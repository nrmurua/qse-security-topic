When one does import covalent as ct, all of covalent_dispatcher is dragged in by this line. Since result_webhook is only needed by Lattice.draw() which will be invoked only infrequently, we should consider moving the import of result_webhook inside that method.
With this change, import covalent no longer requires anything under covalent_dispatcher:
This would take a step towards decoupling the SDK from the server.
Another benefit of this change is that we can now import Lattice in result.py without triggering a circular import error.
