The QASM2 exporter creates an invalid qasm when an empty circuit is appended.
Running this simple snippet, where a circuit is appended to another generates an invalid QASM2:
Output:
Where we have an empty instruction.
It is incorrect because if cannot be re-imported:
Failing with error:
I would have expected a valid qasm file or an error while exporting.
Probably this corner case should be checked when creating custom gates at the QASM level exporter. Either  an error should be thrown when exporting, or ideally all empty instructions should be removed before exporting.
I think, according to the OpenQASM 2 grammar, gate empty_circuit  {  } is invalid.
I'm actually surprised that QuantumCircuit(name='empty_circuit') is valid :-/
Other non-valid OpenQASM2 exports:
Luciano: that second example is already a total lost cause in the OQ2 exporter - unknown Instruction instances shouldn't be permitted to be exported whether or not they've got classical bits, because an Instruction that is not a Gate is explicitly saying "you can't rely on me being unitary".  However, I'm fairly sure there are places using OQ2 exports that play loosely with to_instruction vs to_gate, so at this point it's unlikely to be worth trying to walk that back.
Erroring out when there's a clbit in the Instruction is fine, though, as is erroring out if there's no qubits.  Note that there are valid 0q unitary operations (advancing the global phase), but they're not representable in OQ2, which requires all gate declarations and uses to involve at least one qubit.
