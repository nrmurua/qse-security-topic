SciPy 1.8 deprecated importing functions from many submodules of scipy.sparse. For example, scipy.sparse.sputils. QuTiP fastsparse implementation accessing many of these functions because it extends scipy's sparse matrix support. It would be good to avoid as many of these deprecated imports as we can.
Note that SciPy 1.8 is the first SciPy to support Python 3.10.
