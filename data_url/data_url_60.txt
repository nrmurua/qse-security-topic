Currently, it is possible to apply an adjoint variant of a kernel using cudaq::adjoint and a controlled variant of a kernel with cudaq::control, but there isn't a way to apply them both.
It seems like some infrastructure work was already performed to allow this (e.g. the apply-op-specialization pass can handle quake.apply operators which have both adjoint set and control registers) but I couldn't find a way to create such usages of quake.apply with C++.
