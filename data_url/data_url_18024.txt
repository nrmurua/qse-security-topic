There is a minor bug when CouplingError exceptions are raised in qiskit/mapper/_coupling.py: distance.
The descriptions of qubits are tuple (e.g. ('q',0)) that are not automatically convereted to strings when "%s not in coupling graph" % q1, a TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting raises.
Duplicated with #751 .
