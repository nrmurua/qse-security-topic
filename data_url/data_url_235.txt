It will be good to add the info about the latest-hpc image here.
@poojarao8 The latest tag now includes all the hpc components. I will hence close the issue, since all other images are merely there to facilitate development of CUDA Quantum rather than with CUDA Quantum, and hence should be documented (only) on the GitHub repo. If you feel something is missing, please feel free to reopen.
