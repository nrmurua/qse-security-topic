Encounter JSON encoding error
running with the following qasm and setting
error message:
Without crash.
Terra should parse the complex vector to [ [real, imag] [real, imag]].
(I tried with above format, it will work)
@diego-plan9 can you please look into this? passing a config kwarg to execute() seems to not serialize correctly...
I think I need more info - but if you are modifying a Qobj instance directly, the data (in this case, I assume is appending the config) should be as close to the specs as possible, which would mean that the proper way for that information to be stored would be indeed as a bare list of pairs.
@chunfuchen , can you provide more information about how you are using the custom configuration?
@diego-plan9
here is the example script
Thanks @chunfuchen ! I think there are several forces at play here:
So I'm kind of rebounding the question and the decision to @ajavadia , and in general, the compilers project - we have several options, from specifying that the config should be passed in qobj-like format (the second option mentioned by @chunfuchen ), to only perform the conversion on a subset of configurations that we know are supported, to fully delegating on backends. Any ideas?
I would say that it should be possible to take a state vector returned by results.get_statevector() and feed it into the circuit in initial_state with no conversion by the user.  Since the former is a NumPy array, the latter should accept that as an input.
@diego-plan9 I found a related bug to this in QobItem:
The line
should be
to recursively parse arse a complex array, otherwise it will only convert the array to a list, but not serialize the inner complex numbers correctly.
Can confirm above fixes this issue:
Returns array([0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+0.j, 0.+1.j]) as expected.
Fix in PR #1436
