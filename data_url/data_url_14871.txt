Note: I am using M2 macbook air
I am trying to execute a dynamic circuit with AerSimulator based on the release note example code https://qiskit.org/documentation/release_notes.html#release-notes-0-25-0-prelude. However, it seems that TypeError is raised if I use expr.Expr instance instead of a tuple for IfElseOp.condition or SwitchCaseOp.case field. I highly doubt that it is a bug cause it is probably due to my inconsiderate misuse of the function, but I am creating this issue just in case it is a critical error common for newly added features.
(A) This is the code copied from https://qiskit.org/documentation/release_notes.html#release-notes-0-25-0-prelude
(B) This is the modified code that is suitable for old versions (<0.44.0), which does not support expr.Expr.
(C) The code I used for execution is:
The above code ((A)+(C)) raise the following error:
However, it should result in a figure of some distribution. Interestingly, the code (B)+(C) works as expected.

No response
FYI Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1915
As with most Qiskit features, whether something will run on a backend depends a lot on the backend.  IBM dynamic-circuits-enabled backends can run these conditions (within the support they have for general mathematical operations), while Aer is just working on adding support now (the PR link above).
I'll close this issue now because at most it would be an issue against Aer not Qiskit, but there's also already Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1915 tracking it.
It sounds like there are no ibm backends that can run dynamic circuit with classical expression. Am I interpreting correctly?
No, all dynamic-circuits-enabled IBM hardware backends should be able to run these circuits.  I was able to run this program successfully on Perth thirty minutes ago:
with the result
which matches my expectations.
