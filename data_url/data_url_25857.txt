The test action failed on the develop branch: https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/runs/5078639903?check_suite_focus=true
Hard to reproduce.
Test should pass.
The unit test test_dispatch_cancellation has failed because the workflow completes before it can be cancelled.  This will not happen often, as evidenced by the test passing in the other environments.  Suggested remedy is to increase the sleep time to something very large, to ensure it absolutely cannot complete before cancellation.
One can have infinite while loop in one electron to make it stay up until we cancel it.
Should potentially unbounded running times for the test be allowed?
I guess you could force kill the job (dispatch) at the end of this test. We want it unbound just till this particular test completes.
Should we add a timeout to the github test action?
