Still need to find a solution for the vivado-env shell.
Still need to find a solution for the vivado-env shell.
We can do a nix flake update and vivado-env shell can fetch the latest patch to fix it, and apply the LD_LIBRARY_PATH fix in artiq-main and beta.
There's a patch that fixes only the ncurses package that makes the FHS Env still work with the new nixpkgs that removed usr/lib.

It's a bit messy but it currently fixes vivado-env and vivado issue.
