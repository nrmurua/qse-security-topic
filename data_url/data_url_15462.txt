Sometimes it can be useful to erase all instructions in a QuantumCircuit. This request is for:

Sounds like these could be useful, do you need this for e.g. copying attached calibrations or what's the usecase you have in mind? ðŸ™‚
@Cryoris my particular use case is building new circuits based on an original one. For instance to duplicate instructions:
As you can see, it is important to retain the same quantum and classical registers, but also all relevant metadata as you mention. The easiest way forward is to create a cleared copy of the circuit.
I would therefore aim for qc.copy_empty_like() to be logically equivalent to qc.copy().clear(), but more efficient. I think this is the same behavior as in DAGCircuit.
