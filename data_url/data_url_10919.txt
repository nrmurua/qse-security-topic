Recently I upgraded my local servers of windows and linux.
The problem is non of D-wave tools are installing  "dwave-neal, qbsolv"
Error " Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement qbsolv (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for qbsolv".
I have tried both version of python3 and 2 could you please enlighten me a bit.
Thanks in advance.
The README should have said pip install dwave-qbsolv. It has been fixed now.
I was able to install dwave-neal with pip install dwave-neal. If you are still having problems there, please open an issue on that project: https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave_neal/issues/new
Yes, I had it fixed the day I added the issue after talking to yanbo. Thanks for the follow up.
