cirq.linalg.deconstruct_single_qubit_matrix_into_angles in particular.  It is not exported to the top-level cirq.* namespace so maybe the documentation script is missing them?
In this case, deconstruct_single_qubit_matrix_into_angles should probably be added to cirq/__init__.py since the rest of cirq.linalg is there.
Where are you looking at the docs?  Readthedocs?  The build docs script output?
Readthedocs: https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#algebra-and-representation
These are the URLs where I might expect it to be:
https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/cirq.deconstruct_single_qubit_matrix_into_angles.html
https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/cirq.linalg.deconstruct_single_qubit_matrix_into_angles.html

Yeah the doc coverage test only looks at a few namespaces for methods (cirq,cirq.experiments, cirq.testing, and cirq.google), so it would not fail if this were not at top level.  It would get generated by inclusion into the api.rst.
