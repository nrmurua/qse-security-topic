Currently the HDAWG backend uses the deprecated seqc function playWaveIndexed
Compiler Error (line: 39): function 'playWaveIndexed'
is deprecated as not compatible with AWG FIFO architecture\n\nCompilation failed
The last version with playWaveIndexed is 20.07 which does not exist for python 3.9 and newer.
We will need to write a new backend that uses the command table based programming which should support all usecases starting with release 22.08.
Short and mid-term solution: Stay on LabOne 20.01 or 20.07.
Long-term solution: Use new function executeTableEntry and use increase functionality for stepping voltages. Currently it is not possible to write a charge scan that goes to spin reload points in between each measurement. I am in contact with Zurich Instruments for a solution.
The new command table will probably get four different registers for each channels in the next release.
