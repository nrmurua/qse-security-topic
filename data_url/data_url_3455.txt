ValueError: PyQuil versions >= 2.4 can only talk to quilc versions >= 1.4 over network RPCQ.  You've supplied the endpoint 'http://____________:6000', but this doesn't look like a network ZeroMQ address, which has the form 'tcp://domain:port'. You might try clearing (or correcting) your COMPILER_URL environment variable and removing (or correcting) the compiler_server_address line from your .forest_config file.
I use a windows machine and run my qvm / compiler instances on a remote linux server, with a compiler endpoint removed from the above error message for security purposes, but that worked before updating to the reent version of PyQuil (2.2 -> most recent). I see that you now use the TCP protocol. How can I update my endpoint to account for this?
When you create your QuantumComputer object with get_qc you can provide a ForestConnection object with your custom endpoints:
Tried that with:
fc = ForestConnection(sync_endpoint="tcp://170.______:5000", compiler_endpoint="tcp://170.______:6000")
and while I'm not getting the error, the code is simply stalling now. It's not actually reaching the qvm or compiler.
I normally edit the default addresses for these variables directly in the pyquil.api._config file, which worked previously.
Apologies -- the QVM will still be running as an HTTP server rather than an RPCQ endpoint. I don't think using "tcp://" will work for that. Try changing the sync endpoint to use "http://".
Same thing. Not getting any errors, but the code just stalls when it tries to reach the compiler. I don't think the compiler is getting any requests.
So is what you suggested how we're supposed to go about doing the following?:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> IMPORTANT NOTICE <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< The HTTP endpoint has been deprecated in favor of the RPCQ endpoint.  In the future, it will be removed.  You're advised to modify your client code to talk to the RPCQ version instead.
Also, might there be a new version of the Forest SDK I'm supposed to get or something?
@almullay are you sure the quilc server port is accessible on the network?
To be clear, you should start quilc and QVM with the following commands:
You would then configure pyquil to connect to these with fc = ForestConnection(sync_endpoint="http://________:5555", compiler_endpoint="tcp://________:5000"). If you're using non-default ports, you will need to change them in the config code.
Working! Thanks so much man.
