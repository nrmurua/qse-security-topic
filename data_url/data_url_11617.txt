When I execute a notebook https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/legacy_tutorials/aqua/machine_learning/qsvm_classification.ipynb, qsvm.run raises DQCPError
#1083 might not be enough to fix this issue.
It is mentioned in a tutorial issue Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#932
Run https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/legacy_tutorials/aqua/machine_learning/qsvm_classification.ipynb
Notebook cell
No error
It may be because matrix P is not positive semidefinite due to sampling error of qasm_simulator. The code works fine with statevector_simulator, but raises the error with qasm_simulator.

We maybe need to correct P to be positive semidefinite.
