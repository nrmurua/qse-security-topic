RV has 3 parameters which are X, Y, Z components of an arbitrary axis rotation.
U has 3 parameters which are Euler angles.
How do we write RV in terms of U? This is a requirement of QASM that single qubit gates be written in terms of U. Here we have a conversion that works when the parameters are floats, but not in a symbolic way. We need to fix this if RV is going to be a valid OpenQASM gate.
When this happens, then RVGate can move under circuit.library.standard_gates
I made an attempt at something related which writes it in terms of zyz rotations which needed modifications of ParameterExpression. The code is here

It currently works almost everywhere except needs fixing in a couple of directions.
