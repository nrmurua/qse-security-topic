In the PR template, it says: "Ensure that code is properly formatted, by running make format or black -l 100 strawberryfields. You will need to have the Black code format installed: pip install black."
If you run this, it will change ~80 files, mostly in doc and tests, which would crowd any of the intentional changes of the PR, and maybe cause unwanted changes in these files. Perhaps it could say:
"Ensure that code is properly formatted, by running black -l 100 <filename> on any relevant files. You will need to have the Black code format installed: pip install black. Please do not run on test files."
Thanks @jakeffbulmer! Ah, I see the issue now: we wrote black -l 100 strawberryfields assuming you are already in the main repo (so at the same level as the setup.py) and are instead blacking the interior strawberryfields folder.
Regarding the test: we actually should black the tests :) However, probably best to do this in a separate PR!
