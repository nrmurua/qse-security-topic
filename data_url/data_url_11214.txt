I noticed building the new v0.11 that a single test was failing in conda. It looks to be correlated with the MKL version of numpy that is conda's default. Below shows conda python and numpy and the remainder deps from pypi fails a test by slightly (1.7e-6 vs 1.0e-6) more than the absolute tolerance. The openblas version of numpy also from conda is fine. Think this is a too tight test or a real problem?
Unrelatedly, I built openfermion with py38 and got the same problem. Is it definite that python support is <=py36?
This is probably a stability issue in my implementation of Prony's method that got hit by this version of MKL. I'll look into improving the algorithm. Thanks for raising the issue
Sorry for the late reply, I was waiting till I found a more satisfactory answer but I don't think one exists; the vanilla implementation of Prony's method is just known to be unstable. I've pushed an increase in the atol so that this hopefully doesn't happen again.
Closing by PR #601
thank you
