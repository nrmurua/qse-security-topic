There was a test failure in the nightly cron job which looks like it was for the quantum Shannon decomposer added in #7907.  This seems transient / rarely flaky, since most tests in the same job didn't fail, and I don't remember having seen this same test failure in PR CI before now.  See comment with full logs: #7864 (comment).
It's likely transient, but the traceback from the logs indicates that the follow test may produce the error:
We need to know the cause first - it could be that the tolerance of the test is too high for acceptable decompositions, or it could have been a failure in the decomposer.  Either way, we need to squash any transient failure.
