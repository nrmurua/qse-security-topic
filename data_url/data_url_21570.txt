Command line call of applet fails in nix shell.
I can run applet fine from within artiq_session.
Try adding wrapQtAppsHook to your python3.withPackages or apply it somehow to your entire shell environment.

I don't know nix well enough to implement your suggested change. Can you reproduce my error on your system?
Ping @rgresia
Remove wrapQtAppsHook (turns out it cannot be used easily to wrap an entire nix-shell) and just add this to your shell.nix:
Thanks! Confirmed that the following works. Please add this to your .nix recipes so this works for everyone.  :)
