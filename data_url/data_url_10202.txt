https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_cloud/reference/generated/dwave.cloud.client.Client.from_config.html#dwave.cloud.client.Client.from_config states that from_config() accepts "**kwargs (dict) â€“ Client constructor options" and https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_cloud/reference/resources.html#dwave.cloud.client.Client states that it accepts solver param.
This is actually expected/intended/documented behavior. Under dwave.cloud.client.Client / solver param we state:

So, solver passed to Client constructor (or from_config factory) will only specify a default filter to use in get_solver(). OTOH, get_solvers() will not use this default filter, and by default will return "all" solvers.
"All" solvers (under quotes) because solvers still get filtered by category/client. Perhaps inconsistent, but it's due to legacy/backwards compatibility reasons. Worth reconsidering for Ocean 4.
