Currently the measurement is hard coded to m and ignores a key that might be supplied in the circuit.
This is related to #2199 because AQT always assumes terminal measurements.
Let's use #2199 to track as they are very related (likely AQT currently ignores measurements because always assumes terminal measurements).
