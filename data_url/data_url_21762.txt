I tried to execute the calibration for the kasli-urukul synchronization but somehow it failed, prompting the error "ValueError: no valid window/delay".
The device data base, the synchronization script (#1143) and the prompt's output are attached.

Below line 133 in device_db.py:
This should be detected before trying to scan sync.
