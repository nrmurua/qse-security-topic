As discussed in #290, the BellStateChange3 task in the BasicGates kata currently rejects Y as a solution as Y differs from the intended solution by an unobservable global phase. That is, the task requires that the operation act correctly when called with the Controlled functor as well as when called in an uncontrolled manner. The task description doesn't reflect this requirement explicitly, such that the participant has to know that's what the is Adj + Ctl signature in the task definition indicates.
I will have a look at this
