Hello,
Is there a way to use the QVM/simulator without compiling to the native gates (with the updated pyQuil)?
Thank you!

Maybe I used the qvm incorrectly, but my simulator is automatically compiling. I'm using:
To generate a wavefunction once and sample from it many times (fast; no noise models) you can do
To control compilation with get_qc/QuantumComputer you can add explicit measure instructions and call qc.run(prog).
All of the get_qc methods are designed to work identically between a qvm and a qpu. If you want less realism, you can use WavefunctionSimulator. It's also on my radar to add more sophisticated options for turning compilation on and off. It's a little tricky because running on the qpu now requires compilation to a binary executable (for big speed increases when running variational algorithms)
Ah I see. Thank you!
