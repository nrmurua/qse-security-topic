There is a global phase in the current definition of the Rz gate (according to the documentation):
Rz(theta) = [e**(-itheta/2), 0]
[0, e**(itheta/2)]
An equivalent definition would be:
Rz(theta) = [1,0]
[0, e**(i*theta)]
I think the latter should be more efficient, since now half of the amplitudes of the state vector need not be modified when applying the gate.
Thanks for the issue. I agree regarding efficiency and using the current custom operators we can actually exploit what you describe.
In fact, what you propose was the original RZ gate in QIBO but it was changed to the current convention (with the global phase) to follow what was proposed in #51. If it works for everyone we can switch back to what you propose, however in the other issue it seemed that people preferred our current definition.
