Throws an error:
@lamberta has this come up before in moving docs around?
Might be related to data_files field in setup.py is no longer working with wheels
https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html?highlight=data_files
Looks like I neglected to update the basename of the file in setup.py when I moved/renamed a few tutorials. So these filenames should match the filenames in the docs/tutorials/ directory, e.g. docs/tutorials/binary_code_transforms.ipynb.
These were in /examples. Do you need to install them with the pip package?
I don't see a reason to install them with the package but we were doing that before.  Maybe a user could reference the notebook after they do a pip install to see how something works?  I think the docs should serve that purpose not the notebook.  Let's keep it in the install for now and I'll bring up the topic of deletion at the next openfermion-sync.  I don't think cirq installs their tutorials.
Can you make the appropriate change in the setup.py file to fix this?
