the only gates I saw in youtube are Hadamart and CNOT
when:
q = QuantumRegister(2)
c = ClassicalRegister(2)
qc = QuantumCircuit(q,c)
#hadamart
qc.h(q[0])
#CNOT
qc.cx(q[0],q[1])
I want to know how to write the gate U3=U3(theta,lambada,gama) in qiskit language
but I only find it on the Internet in Qasm language as: u3(theta,lambada,gama) iv`e tried it on qiskit but there is always error messege when I try to run the program.
please help and if it possible to send me link to the full dictionary of gates in qiskit language.
These are the standard set of gates known to Qiskit:

Please provide more information about your program so we can diagnose the source of failure.
It should be as simple as:

I hope the above answer resolved your question. If not, feel free to reopen.
As a side note, for this types of questions that are about using Qiskit, we prefer Slack.
Github is mainly used for tracking bugs, feature requests, etc.
