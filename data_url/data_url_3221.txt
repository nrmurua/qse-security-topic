Traditionally, randomized benchmarking experiments use the prepared state also as the fiducial state whose survival probability is measured, and the random sequences of Cliffords are constructed to compose to the identity. I suggest we explicitly promise and enforce that this property holds on the sequences returned by generate_rb_sequence method of the CompilerConnection.
There are use cases for random sequences of Cliffords that also perform a change of state, but afaik we can always build those off of identity-sequences.
