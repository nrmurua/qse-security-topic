An update after thinking about this: intuitively, to restore the previous optimization we need to compute
and check if A is a subset of (B | C) \ D.
However I believe we have the problem for open-controlled gates (as per the code adapted from UnrollCustomDefinitions): a gate's name might be supported by the target or belong to equivalence library, yet because it's open-control we actually can't skip synthesis and use the definition. Any suggestions?
If this is not a trivial task, maybe we can postpone restoring this optimization to a follow-up PR?
