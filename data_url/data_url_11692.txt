Would it be possible for Grover to allow a custom "lam" variable, referenced below? It could be a float, or a rotation count sequence, as described in the paper by Baritompa et. al. (link).

Is this something you would like to contribute and do a PR with unit tests covering the new function? If so please go ahead. I imagine you would pass lambda in as a parameter and default it to the present value but allow list of values as well as a single float and handle accordingly. Is this what you had in mind?

That is what I had in mind. I don't have the time to contribute the change myself, just saw the opportunity for an enhancement in my work on the GroverOptimizer.
Hi, I am working on it.
Maybe we can also extend the chapter https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html
with an example of using this lib?
