Currently, the top menu gives too much visibility to two interrelated, but highly nested, sections, "Contributing to Mitiq" and "Contributing to Mitiq Documentation". Best would be, in my opinion, to have only "Contributing".
One of the reasons is that these are two pages and would need to be rendered as one. Possibly three pages actually, as in #237 we plan to break up some of this in a mini-guide on releasing.
(The pydata Sphinx theme gives menus that are not drop down but dynamically appear on the right while scrolling down. With multiple pages for a single section a better use of the left menu would occur, e.g, compare the Getting Started page and the Contributing to Mitiq one. It should not be needed, but of course the theme is further customizable.
