Hi,
Cool simulator! While using DDSIM bundled with the provider and backends for Qiskit, I found that it does not utilize multi-cores for simulation. Is this feature supported and how to set num_threads?
Thanks
I found this paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9045711, seems like it is difficult to speed up DD-simulation by utilizing more cores
Hi,
thanks for reaching out. You're correct that DD-based simulation by default is difficult to improve with multi-threading.
However, you may want to try using the hybrid_qasm_simulator, which is able to efficiently split the simulation into several tasks.
Let me know if you encounter any problems.
Got it. Thanks
