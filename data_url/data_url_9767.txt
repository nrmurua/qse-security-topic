It would be nice to support C++14 (or newer versions) in python extensions.
The older python images in .circleci/config.yml appear to be for Debian jesse, which has GCC 4. Jesse is EOL since June, so I think these images could at least be replaced by images on stretch, which has GCC 6. Buster comes with GCC 8. I believe all the relevant versions of Clang and MSVC have C++17 support. GCC 6 supports C++14 and parts of C++17, and GCC 8 has essentially complete support of C++17. Also setup.py explicitly states --std=c++11 for compiler and linker flags on osx and linux. This could be changed to c++14 or c++17 or left off to use the compiler default (C++14 for current GCC and Clang).
Package wheels are built using manylinux1 image (based on Centos 5), not jessie.
I'm not sure we want to move to manylinux2010/manylinux2014 quite yet, as that would require users to have pip >= 19.0/pip >= 19.3 installed, and they were both released relatively recently (2019-01/2019-10).
Ah, I had only looked at the images used in testing. In that case, it does seem we're stuck with C++11 for a while.
