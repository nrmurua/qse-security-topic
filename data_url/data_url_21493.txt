At present event replacement is the default behaviour for all RTIO channels, including in the EEM definitions.
I don't want to rehash the pros/cons of this feature or to suggest removing it, but I do wonder if it should really be the default for all RTIO channels. IME silent event replacement is a bit of a footgun and a decent fraction of the time it's not the desired behaviour. By way of example, if one updates multiple Fastino channels without delays in between, only the final one will be updated. How often is that something one wants to happen without warning??
Proposal: disable event replacement by default and make it configurable in the JSON schema.
Thoughts?
Your example is wrong. Fastino does not support event replacement and disables it. In the same way it is wrong to say that event replacement "is the default". It's actually disabled explicitly on most PHYs. Every device where replacement is meaningless (when the implicit device state is not fully described by the raw RTIO event data) or not supported must disable it. Hence, changing the default in OInterface wouldn't change anything for the user.
Also I don't see how event replacement relates to the EEM definitions you reference.
@hartytp @jordens is right, this is enabled/disabled by each PHY as appropriate, and it does not belong at the JSON level - there is usually a clear choice for each type of PHY about whether replacement should be enabled or not.
Apologies for the delayed response...
@jordens thanks for the correction, much appreciated. I'd misunderstood how the code around event replacement works.
