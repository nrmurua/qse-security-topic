Use of the ControlledPhaseShift gate is currently supported by PennyLane default_qubit in Python (see here for supported gates and here for the Python implementation). This gate should also be natively supported in the C++ layer by lightning.qubit.
This will require the following steps:
Important notes to double-check before a pull request:
1. Named this new gate CPhaseShiftGate, to keep the name consistency of derived gates;
2. Added a bulk of comments describing this new gate at Gates.hpp:362;
3. Matched all functionalities of this new gate with the implemented ones, however, in comparison with the Python implm., there are _eigvals (returning eigenvalues), and decomposition methods that I wasn't sure about implementing them. Let me know if they are required too; and
4. Utilized gtest suites of lightning_gates_unittest.cpp to test new routines.
Yep, that is fine.
Comments are usually a good call
There should be no hard requirement for these, if they are not implemented for other existing C++ methods.
