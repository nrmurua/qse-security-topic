In an if_else statement, setting with else_: pass gets transpiled into a nonempty circuit.
Notice that the behavior is not replicated if  with else_: pass is omitted at all.
Run the following:
An empty circuit should be drawn as an output (else branch), but the following is produced.

@jakelishman FYI
This isn't a bug - you've explicitly made the branch, and the transpiler is ensuring that the virtual layout after it is the same as it is after the other branch. If you delete the else, you'd see more inverse swaps in the if instead.
