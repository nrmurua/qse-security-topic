I propose to review the names in the sections of the documentation in a way that is more user-oriented.
For example, "Unitary Folding" and "Factory Objects" are names that the user cannot relate to beforehand.
Maybe we could rename them this way:
Having them under dZNE may be too rigid, as factories may be used more fluidly beyond ZNE â€“ but this could be changed later when needed.
Agreed. My preference is for
'Digital Zero Noise Extrapolation'
Agree. My 2 cents:
But your proposals are also good for me.
