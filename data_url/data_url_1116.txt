During the review of PR#2709 Matthew Harrigan (mpharrigan) suggested that the number of Pauli states sampled (when having a Clifford circuit) should be more than just a flag that the user has to set without any guidance.
Instead, we could add an exhaustive option and do numerical studies. See the full comment there:
#2709 (comment)
n_clifford_trials is now called n_measured_operators.
