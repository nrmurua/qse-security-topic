Compiling SIKE with the CMake build and the -Wall -Wextra -Werror flags set results in several errors, and different ones at that for Clang on macOS and gcc on Ubuntu.
Here are the GCC-Ubuntu errors. Their validity has to be investigated.
Got it, I'll work on resolving these.
Pushed fixes on PR #556.
ubuntu_gcc_8_3_0_log.txt contains some more warnings with the latest code, with the compiler being GCC 8.3.0. The flags used were: -Wall -Wextra -Wimplicit -Wunused -Wcomment -Wchar-subscripts -Wuninitialized -Wstrict-prototypes -Wshadow -Wformat-security -Wwrite-strings
ubuntu_clang_8_log.txt has warnings reported by clang-8. The flags used were the same as in the previous comment.
