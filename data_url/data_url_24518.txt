This issue is a collection of pulse corruption I noticed. According to @Nomos11 these might not actually be cause by qupulse.
Example 1
Sample rate: 24.41kHz (100M base)




The constant tail appears at random voltages from run to run.
Removing read_pls from both the start and end of pulse_template fixes it:


This might be because it creates a repeat in seqc:
Does this still appear with #772 ?
Unfortunately I only have a sample connected, but issues like in #770 should still be visible. Not sure whether the issues here and in #770 are of the same origin.
However the Issue still exists with #766
Before (branch https://github.com/maxbeer99/qupulse/tree/issues/751_hdawg_multiple_issues_during_elf_file_upload)

After (branch https://github.com/qutech/qupulse/tree/issues/751_selene_fixes)

It is clearly visible for both that the pulse halts at the end uncontrollably
