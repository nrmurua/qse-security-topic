Describe the bug
When executing a distributed circuit without any gates and attempting to access the final state, a hard to understand error appears.
To Reproduce
gives
Expected behavior
Either print the correct final state which is |000...0> unless a different initial state was given, or raise a better error, eg. that distributed circuits without gates cannot be executed. Please let me know which would be preferrable.
I can reproduce this issue, looks like self.qubits is None, so most likely the queue attribute is not initialized properly before adding gates.

Yes, I think the proper way to fix this is to make the circuit return the initial state instead of raising an error, because this is what happens for non-distributed circuits. I will open a PR for this.
Great, thanks.
