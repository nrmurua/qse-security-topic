In the init_job method there is some discrepancy in information which is available once the document is created. Most importantly, it seems like circuit_depth is not calculated for Amazon braket circuits (documentation).
While these changes are small, it would help with analysis a good amount.
Thanks!


Yeah this isn't a discrepancy AWS vs IBM it's that the Mongo documents aren't being updated correctly when the job status is polled. If you notice, all the documents with JobStatus.INITIALIZING have values for all fields, while documents with any other status seem to be missing an entry e.g. circuitDepth. The initializing status is set automatically when the job is created. When the user calls myjob.status(), we poll the quantum job status through that vendor, and update our mongo accordingly. But it seems like during that process certain entries are being deleted or overwritten. If I had to guess, the data loss is probably from a missed keyword or naming mismatch from when we transitioned sdk from old mongo jobs schema to new mongo jobs schema.
This does point out a needed update though, which is we'll want to poll the user job status on a set interval so that the mongo db is up-to-date, instead of only updating mongo when a user polls the status. The same functionality will be useful for the get_devices function, which we'll also want interacting with mongo db device statuses on a set interval.
Should be fixed now!
