The following code constructs a circuit with 1140 common gates and then calculates the time it takes to run the Xmon optimization and Xmon gate conversion (separate procedures).
On my machine, optimization took 12.6 seconds and conversion took 2.7 seconds.
@dstrain115 Hey, how's this going?
From the latest code commit, it seems we have gotten about a 50% improvement so far.  I was starting to find it more and more difficult to continue improving this, without cutting out all the matrix decompositions.  I am open to suggestions.
From #1233 :
The cumulative savings of this change, in combination with the previous
fixes has decreased conversion from 2.7 seconds to 1.25 seconds and
optimization from 12.6 seconds to 5.4 seconds.
I think the next step for this would be to move the kak decomposition into C or Cython (which requires incorporating them into the build process), because that seems to be the huge bottleneck.
Merging #2070 here: we could also add shortcuts to two-qubit gates with known decompositions.
This seems to have gone stale with the new transformers API. Can we close this @kevinsung and re-open for transformers ?
Sure, I'm not familiar with the transformers API so I can't write a new issue for it, but feel free to close this one either way.
