If the bug manifests in unexpected behavior (as opposed to a crash), confirm that you have consulted the
API documentation
Please provide a concise description of what the bug is.
The FluxQubit only seems to have effective noise channels from critical current noise, and not from flux noise.
To minimize misunderstandings, please state briefly what you expected to happen.
I expected tphi_1_over_f_flux to be returned in the effective_noise_channels list from the FluxQubit.
If not clear from your description above, please provide the steps to reproduce the behavior:
Any additional information you would like to provide to aid us.
@petergthatsme Was there a reason/specific problem that led to this omission?
1/f flux noise has now been implemented in a FluxQubit in #185.
