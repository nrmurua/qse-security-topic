Windows builds, using VS2017 complain because the #pragmas for parallelizing for loops have different requirements than those for Linux/Mac. The variables showing in the loop need to be signed (e.g: int32_t instead of uint32_t)
Run a build.
As all of the loops involved are using the number of qubits for incrementing a variable, it's safe to move from uint32_t to int32_t.
