Starting with the merger of Qiskit/qiskit#4932, the Hamiltonian will begin returning with units of Hz. An adjustment in the simulator conversion code will have to be made to compensate for this.
A client got this error during Pulse simulation of a FakeValencia() model :  The symtoms is an error with RabiFitter  : "ValueError: array must not contain infs or NaNs" I had to factor by 1e9 each wq0 to wq5 but also each omegad0 to omegad5 to make it working. FOr now that's the workaround i proposed to the client
The only unit conversion the pulse simulator does is: when digesting the pulse qobj, it multiplies the qubit_lo_freq provided in the pulse qobj by 1e9, as - as far as I recall - the qobj output by assemble reports qubit_lo_freq multiplied by a factor of 1e-9 (whether this was a supplied as a kwarg to assemble or it was retrieved from the backend defaults). Aside from this no conversions are ever done.
So, I believe things should work as is so long as all parameters in the backend config and defaults, and any user supplied parameters (like qubit_lo_freq passed as a kwarg to assemble) are provided in consistent units. I may however be missing something or accessing parameters incorrectly - e.g. I know that there is a factor of 1e9 difference between accessing dt in the qobj.config as an attribute, or accessing it in dictionary form from qobj.to_dict()['config'] (we do the former in the pulse simulator).
Sounds good, thank you.
