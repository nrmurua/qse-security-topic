To be done when we'll figure out a reliable way to apply constraint on signals with Vivado ("dont_touch" signal attribute?)
What's the current status on that?
There are two things:
We could do 2) without 1) but we still have to fix 1) since I'm not sure timings constraints are correcly applied when building with Vivado (the Vivado log should show it when applying the XDC constraints, is there a log somewhere?)

Could this be the reason for the Ethernet bugs we are seeing with some switches?
Not sure but possible:
