Related to #7, I think? When I tried enabling Travis, this repo didn't show up as an option - I think only an owner can set it up.
@s-mandra, one note on this: Google has restrictions against using the commercial version of Travis (travis-ci.com) since it gives Travis write permissions on the repo. The free version (travis-ci.org) does not require this permission, so it's what we should be using.

I'll take a look into this.
Looking right now and travis requires write permission for:
Commit statuses
Read and write access
This application will be able to read and write commit statuses (no direct code access).
Deployments
Manage deployments and deployment status
This application will be able to manage deployments and deployment status (no direct code access).
Repository webhooks and services
Read and write access
This application will be able to read and modify repository webhooks and services (no direct code access).
Is this ok on the Google side?

This sounds correct. The Google restriction is specifically on code write permissions, which are excluded by the above list.
It's working :) I need to fix .travis.yml but, beside that, everything is working as expected.
@95-martin-orion, what do you think about this?
Is it possible to view the results of Travis CI for a particular PR? Nothing shows up for me in the "Checks" tab (compare with e.g. this Cirq PR).

Google internal docs give it the OK - would this be alongside or in place of Travis CI?

Not sure :( I never used Travis CI and I'm learning now!

Great! It would be alongside.
Let me know if you have any other integration it would worth to include. Thanks!
