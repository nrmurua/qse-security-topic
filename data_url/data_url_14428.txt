DynamicalDecoupling and PadDynamicalDecoupling have identical docstrings. This makes it difficult to understand the difference between the two classes by reading the documentation. I think that generally speaking, different classes should have distinct docstrings, and when two classes are similar, the docstrings should ideally elucidate their differences.
I'm hoping someone more familiar with these classes can improve these docstrings.
