https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-release-4/compiler.html#pitfalls says that you should be able to run round(float(numpy.float64(1.0))) to get an int on both core & host device.
When in a program, this line fails:
What is the proper syntax? And please update docs to reflect.
NOTE: on further testing, looks like this runs fine with the @portable or @host_only decorators. But I think that means the code runs fine on the host, but isn't actually being compiled for/run on the core device.
@drewrisinger Please follow up on your past issues and PRs before opening new ones.
Filing multiple clearly distinct issues in parallel is just fine IMO. There is no technical reason why that would be problematic. But please do follow up.
Followed up on all pending issues. Would appreciate an answer/improved documentation.
@drewrisinger Thank you.
Yes, @portable or @host_only applied to run() will execute the function in the regular Python interpreter on the host.
float(numpy.float64(1.0)) not working looks like a compiler bug, @whitequark ?
It looks like numpy.float64 is not currently recognized as a proper float. IIRC I did this for ints but I guess not for floats?
Yeah, can confirm. @sbourdeauducq Is it always OK to treat numpy.float64 exactly like Python float or are there caveats?
AFAICT it's ok.
In meantime, core question has still not been answered. What's the correct syntax for right now, pending bug fix?
