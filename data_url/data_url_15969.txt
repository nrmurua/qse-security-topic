The documentation for CSWAP gate incorrectly mentions it as a controlled-X gate.
See
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CSwapGate.html
and here as well:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html
The documentation should say that it is the controlled swap gate.
Update the appropriate docstring.
I will fix the typos, unless someone else has already been assigned to this.
I am not sure how to update the second typo in the qiskit.circuit.library file.

You already fix it :) Both places are generated by the same string that you just modified. You can see the results by downloading the artifact https://dev.azure.com/qiskit-ci/b6f351e4-6a09-4bf6-b029-4b7806a7bde7/_apis/build/builds/27404/artifacts?artifactName=html_docs&api-version=6.0&%24format=zip
Thank you @1ucian0. I updated the file with the comment by @ewinston
