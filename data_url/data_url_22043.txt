got this error in the last line of this file: https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/examples/master/repository/coredevice_examples/simple/ad5360.py/
@whitequark Is this the proper solution:
Why was it apparently not a problem before? @mntng is the issue present with ARTIQ-2?
@sbourdeauducq This is the proper solution. Likely what happened is LLVM decided to not inline or not unroll something, and an expression that was previously constant-folded is not, anymore. This should be backported to ARTIQ-2.
