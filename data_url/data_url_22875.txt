Hi, it appears in the gui that I am unable to specify an i-gain greater than shown below (3.9e4):

Why is this?
Is there a possibility to override this limit?
If yes, where can I do so?
Thanks.
Ok I just realized I can work around this by increasing my quadrature factor in my iq-demodulator instead to achieve higher "effective" gains!
