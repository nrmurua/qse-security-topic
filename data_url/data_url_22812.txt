with multiple sweep variables, using a swp_variable which is not the default 'variation' in plot_hamiltonian_results method, not all variations are displayed.
When trying to perform the same analysis while sending variation a list of variations (to plot different cuts of the parameter space), the plot_hamiltonian_results method only works with the default 'variation' as the swp_variable.
