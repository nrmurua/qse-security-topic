It'd be great to have some sort of optional visualization of progress made for passes.
A lot of visualization work can be done to improve BQSKit's user experience. This is a great suggestion, but I think progress bars may be a bit difficult to do generally. Instead, we might want to opt for a nice profiler for the runtime environment. Previously with Dask, we had the dashboard and could visualize how many steps were left, the number of blocks being processed, etc. This was very helpful in debugging specific issues.
Adding progress bars to specific passes should be straightforward with tqdm or other packages when running your local experiments, but I would be hesitant to accept a change to include it in the repo by default. Instead, we should have a conversation on how to build a profiler that can capture similar (and more) functionality more generally.
