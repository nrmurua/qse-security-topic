@imranashraf , When testing your latest fixes I find that there is an error in the .dbpd file that is generated. Some instructions are defined twice, which predictably leads to errors in the assembler.
I have found that this is because of an error in the config file I gave you.
For some Cc_light_instr fields different cc_light_opcodes are defined. The compiler now (incorrectly) adds two entries to the .dbpd file. I think that instead it should raise an exception forcing the user to specify a valid config file.
Tagging @Nader-Khammassi , @imranashraf told me you are already working on this :)
@AdriaanRol Is the problem still there, if yes could you send to me the hardware configuration file which is causing the problem ?
Fixed in 6cb19a6.
