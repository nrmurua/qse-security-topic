Should the comment in decomposition_standard2 for the Swap gate be : Decomposition of H gate  ?
@Jaakik, can you share a link to the actual line of code in question? Thanks!
This one:

@Q-lds, I suggested Marouane open this issue. @shaohenc, can you help clarify this?
@Jaakik I think the label is correct - the decomposition of the SWAP gate contains 2 RZ + 4 X gates + CZ + iSWAP/XY, and the decomposition of each of the X gates in terms of RX(+- pi/2) and RZ(pi) looks correct to me (eg by visualizing its action on a Bloch vector). Could you elaborate?
@shaohenc Yes it's clear now to me thanks.
