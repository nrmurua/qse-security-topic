GridQubit and LineQubit have Qid versions, but there is no version of this for NamedQubit.
@cduck was there a reason for not doing NamedQubit?
No reason other than to keep the number of different qid classes small.  Also GridQid was added later to match LineQid.
NamedQubit('a').with_dimension(3) works just fine but LineQid.range() is nice to have.
Yeah I noticed it works, I guess the only thing you really lose is the type information (and maybe a less nice repr and str)?
I think I would like to have a crack at this, as a first contribution. Is it simply matter of copying the format of LineQubit and GridQubit, but altering the functions to work like NamedQubit?
Yes, looking at LineQubit/LineQid and using the same structure for NamedQubit/NamedQid should be all that's needed.  Also take a look at the unit tests for them in the corresponding *_test.py files.
