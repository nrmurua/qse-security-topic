Two things to do here:
As far as I can tell, these options can only be set with a Free account once the repository is public. I leave the issue here so that we don't forget to do this once that happens, or in case we decide to upgrade one of the accounts.
Wow, that's too bad! I think it's a recent GH change in pricing.
However, there is some sort of partial fix if you want for the time being:
Both these things do not enable a strict protection rule and wouldn't close the issue, but we could open issues to do implement them.
You have started using the Actions minutes now that #23 has been merged to master, as there is a green tick next to the latest merged commit to master. We can edit the YAML file to allow the triggering of the CI tests on branches. If you want this, I suggest having this be triggered 'by hand' in the yaml, for example upon review request as trigger event, but it can also be implemented at each commit pushed on the PR branch (but then you need to check how fast you'll reach the quota, which owners can check at https://github.com/organizations/pasqal-io/settings/billing).
Now that Pulser is public, I have implemented this.
