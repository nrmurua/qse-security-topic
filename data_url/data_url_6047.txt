simulation of a basic circuit like applying a Hadamard fails when I choose "statevector_gpu"
in this colab notebook, you will find the required steps. less than 10 cells

I expect the counts of an entangled state with no errors raised
I think there is something in colab's environment or maybe I should git clone the repo itself. I don't know :/
@kareem1925 it looks like you didn't install the qiskit-aer-gpu package
So how should i install the packages in order?
You need to pip install qiskit-aer-gpu after qiskit so it will override the (non-gpu) qiskit-aer included in the metapackage.
hello sir, I've done exactly what you said but the same error occurs
here's the updated colab notebook
Running GPU on colab is not something we have tested or attempted to support. I am not familiar with what sort of system setup colab runs on with regards to GPUs, but that error message looks like it has wrong version of CUDA.
Seems like the GPU driver installed by default in Colab underlying system is not compatible with our CUDA version (10.2). This is the only tested version we support but it doesn't mean that other older versions won't work it is just that we haven't tested there.
Unfortunately there's nothing we can do at the moment.
Thanks for reporting @kareem1925
I was able to update google collab's CUDA version to 10.2, but I'm still getting the same error as @kareem1925. Notebook.
Has anyone found a fix or a workaround for this? Having the same issue
