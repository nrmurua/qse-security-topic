Build breaks:
Version: 2023.2
gfortran-12
FreeBSD 13.2
Interestingly, we do not find that issue on our dashboard where we are also testing gfortran-12. I see that your compilation flags do not include -std=f2008 whereas we explicitly add it in our tests. Could you add it to the FCFLAGS variable in your arch files and recompile?
Apart from that, I have an idea how to fix it. I will prepare a fix soon.
I cannot reproduce this issue with Gfortran 11 and 13. Have you tried it with -std=f2008 added to your compilation flags?
I have found it. Apparently, you do not have an up-to-date DBCSR submodule. Can you run
git config submodule.recurse true
git pull
git submodule update
make -j ARCH=... realclean
make -j ARCH=...
The problem seems to be solved now. Feel free to reopen this thread if necessary.
