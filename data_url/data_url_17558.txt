After  #1781, DAGCircuit does not support qasm method and it was replaced by the method in QuantumCircuit. However, many parameters were supported before (see: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/1781/files#diff-d2039341ad623e4c82f0beeec0ad1f87L772) that are not supported now.
Yeah but are those parameters needed? They were not used anywhere in the code.
#1747
Yeah I don't think we want to control qasm printing at that level. It should not be a smart function in my opinion. I did notice that one place where the aliases got used, but really no where else, and none of the other parameters were used either.
Related, other possible use in #875
I'm closing this as wont fix. Thanks!
