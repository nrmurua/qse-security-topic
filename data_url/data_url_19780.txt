The measurement error mitigation can be directly applied to the result object from the circuit with multiple classical registers. I think it is related to issue #147. If we build the calibration matrix for all qubits of a device, is there any flexible way to apply the whole matrix to particular qubits only?
When building the calibration matrix with CompleteMeasFitter, there is no space in statelabel since there is no need to differentiate whether or not they come from the same classical register. Nonetheless, the bitstring of the result object from the circuit with multiple classical registers had spaces, which is used to indicate where they from.
Note:
A counts structure is a little bit different, the key str will be split into multiple pieces according to the number of classical registers used.
My current workaround is:
Not sure is there any better solution? Any comment is appreciated.
There is a hack workaround which is to pad your classical register so that it has the same size as the calibration matrix (and make sure the qubits are in the same register locations as when you calibrated). But I will try and find a better solution.
