In NEB calculations, each electronic state of a structure may have different multiplicities. Is it possible to change the MULTIPLICITY parameter setting for each step in CP2K's NEB calculation? If not, is it possible to modify the source code to achieve this? As far as I know, NEB calculations rely on stack operations of the force environment. So, is it possible to modify the multiplicity setting for each step?
With my respect, Thank you!
Thanks for your reply!
So, for now, cp2k can't do this, right? If not, is there any plan for you to do this?
With my respect, Thank you!
Got it.
Thanks again for your reply!
