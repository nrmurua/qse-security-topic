derivative on TimeDependentSum fails;
schroedinger_dynamic promotes tspan and state  to Dual when needed, then TimeDependentSum is called with a Dual and fails.
Possible to call _promote_time_and_state here;

Hi Amit! Right, so the problem is indeed the type of the current_time field. We might want it to be a union including the appropriate Dual type here? Does that work if you do it in your Ftdop above?
Actually, I'm a bit puzzled in this case, as you are not taking a derivative wrt. time. Perhaps you could post the stack trace?
Hi Ash! I hope you're doing well and having fun!
schroedinger_dynamic is promoting the time and state via DiffEqBase to account for Dual 
This would also happed if I would be taking a derivative wrt. time.
If I initially build the TimeDependentSum with init_time as Dual everything is fine
Thanks. Is it really necessary to promote the times in schroedinger_dynamic? In any case, I think I agree we should be creating a new TimeDependentSum automatically with the correct time type here. It's required at minimum for derivatives wrt time.
DiffEq will promote the times if the input state is a Dual, so actually there's no need to promote the times in QO when using a function as the Hamiltonian.
But this still mean TimeDependentSum needs to be promoted.
I've added this solution #378
Maybe another solution could be propagating the Dual type all the way to https://github.com/qojulia/QuantumOpticsBase.jl/blob/5ad71582770c217718848e14f649ee7b39b2b6db/src/time_dependent_operator.jl#L139
