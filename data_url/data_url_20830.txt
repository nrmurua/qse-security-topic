In discussion regarding #172, we concluded that duplicate consistency checks should happen in both directions. If only A checks consistency with B but not the other way around, changes to (only) B won't trigger CI checks for consistency with A.
I don't think this is necessary. True, if the tests are run with PQCLEAN_ONLY_DIFFS or one of the other filters applied, then they might get skipped.  But on the full test runs, sufficient consistency checks would be triggered even if they're only unidirectional.
Agreed.
We should just make sure this is done before merging updates to existing schemes.
