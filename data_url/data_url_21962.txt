with artiq3.5,runartiq_compile idle.py ,
I can find  'device_db.py'   in
C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\envs\artiq-3.5\Lib\site-packages\artiq\master,
and I move it to
C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\pkgs\python-3.6.3-h9e2ca53_1\Lib\idlelib

but

the same things happened when I run artiq_run led.py  In accordance with the instructions of the instructions on http://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-release-3/getting_started_core.html
Those programs look for device_db.py in the current directory by default. Use the cd command to go to C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\pkgs\python-3.6.3-h9e2ca53_1\Lib\idlelib (though you may want to put those in a more appropriate folder)
the device_db.py has been copy to the folder where idle.py in(the first picture), from C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\envs\artiq-3.5\Lib\site-packages\artiq\master,

Your current directory is c:\windows\system32. It is looking for c:\windows\system32\device_db.py, which doesn't exist.
can moving the device_db.py to c:\windows\system32\device_db.py solve the problem?
c:\windows\system32 is not meant to hold the ARTIQ device database, use the cd command to change the current directory instead.
ok, I will try it. thanks.
