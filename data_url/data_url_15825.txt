Upon updating from version 0.17.4, there is a substantially amount of additional warning printing upon compiling cz gates to the basis gate set: ['h', 'cx', 'rz', 'sx', 'x']:
This doesn't appear to change the ability for the circuits to run correctly, it just fills up the terminal with a lot of non-needed statements, especially when running large algorithms requiring many cz gates.
Not printing a ton of warning statements upon compiling to this basis gate set
Remove the printing? The basis gates we are using is a pretty common basis gate set, and compiling away from the cz gate is the intended behavior.
I would like to take this issue.
The compilation is correct. This warning was built in so that users can flag such cases for careful assessment. Here what happened was the compiler was given the task of synthesizing the Hadamard gate over the {'h', 'cx', 'sx', 'x', 'rz'} basis, and came up with RZ-SX-RZ. Under the "shorter-is-better" metric, this means the synthesizer should be improved. Under an "error-rate" metric, this doesn't matter.
When we decided to include this warning, I think we didn't consider the "mixing" of native gate sets, where the synthesis method used (here: PSX) doesn't surject onto all the gates included in the native set.
Probably this is best handled by using something other than gate count to measure circuit improvement, and recent retworkx work would be relevant.
I'll look at this tomorrow.
Thanks anyway, @singhsanskar202 !
