IIUC a controlled channel is not well defined. https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/a/12197/14638. And certainly a measurement cannot be controlled.
Should we check has_mixture(sub_op) and/or not is_measurement(sub_op) at construction time? Or is this too resource intensive?
Note parameterized sub-ops will have to be allowed until resolution time since has_mixture always returns false for parameterized things. However measurements should always be rejected (a CircuitOp can be both parameterized and contain measurements).
