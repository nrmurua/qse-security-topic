The I/O expander init() invocation is missing. This should explain why the proposal in #2201 actually causes a behavioral difference and appears to resolve the issue.
Note that there are no changes to port A output level unless the virtual LED is updated, or the firmware panics. service() only emits I2C commands when there are output level changes to ports. Therefore, the port A of I/O expander retains the same output logic level across reboot.
The init() was omitted probably due to the board not selecting the correct default clock source. As agreed, later iterations of the EFC card will allow clock selection control via a DIP switch.
A PR to add back the init() will follow.
