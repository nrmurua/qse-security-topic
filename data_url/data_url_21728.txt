SUServo IIR coefficient read back does not work
The number we read back should match the number we write.
Readback seems to be: (((base+addr) | WE) >> 8) | ((addr << 5) & (1 << COEFF_WIDTH) - 1 ))
i.e. the 5 LSB of the number we read back are (((base+addr) | WE) >> 8) and the upper 13 bits are the 13 LSB of the coefficent.
Appears to affect the a0 and b1 coefficients equally.
Artiq 5.0.dev
@jordens I don't understand this: https://github.com/hartytp/artiq/blob/f70d6913bda8bd4113d45246639137a8e0fdb9de/artiq/gateware/rtio/phy/servo.py#L94
Doesn't self.rtlink.o.data contain both an address and data? Shouldn't this be something like:
i.e. won't the following fail:
@hartytp Yes that assert would fail since the new rtio layout. See #1266 (comment)
