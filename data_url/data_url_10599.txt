Once we have sampling/embedding warnings module, we want to enable adding of those warnings during embedding, sampling, etc.
We can add return_warnings flag to DWaveSampler/EmbeddingComposite/.sample(). Whatever option we choose, child/parent composites/samplers will have to be aware of its value.
If we decide to go with return_warnings as sample() parameter, we'll need to update the return_embedding accordingly.
