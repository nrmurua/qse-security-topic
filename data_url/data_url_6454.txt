Seen in #337. Copy of comment:
It looks like the AVX512 tests failed ASAN in this PR, despite this being a python-only change. {...}
(This failure was on commit 7ab4d53, in case it doesn't show up again)
Apparently this failure occurs when Github Actions selects a runner that supports AVX512. The runners GHA chooses from are Dv2 and DSv2, which include Cascade Lake and Skylake (which support AVX512) as well as Broadwell and Haswell (which don't).
I've opened a GHA issue since I can't find documentation for this feature.
GHA issue has been redirected to the Github Actions forum. I'll keep an eye on this, but we probably should assume that AVX512 will not be available for Github Actions in the near term.
