Any tips?
This looks like an issue with our unit testing framework Catch2 not being aware that Macs can have ARM processors now. We should probably update Catch2 to address this.
Can you confirm that this only occurs when you want to compile the unit tests, but not when working with user code?

That error looks like CMake is still trying to build with tests. Did you delete the build directory between tries? CMake often remembers configuration we don't really want it to remember, like building with tests.
If I delete the build folder then re-run a tutorial script,
I can then run make and ./demo and it works fine.
So this means I should be able to run my scripts?
As a workflow, would it be safe to assume to always delete the build folder each time?

Yes, they should run fine, though in #301 some performance issues were reported. I'd be interested if you observe those as well.
I will still leave this issue open for us to get unit tests running properly on M1 Macs.

It's usually not required to delete it every time you change the user code, only when the configuration changes. But when you are having compile issues, that's often a good first thing to try.
Thanks,
Ill keep an eye on performance and keep notifications on for this thread.
