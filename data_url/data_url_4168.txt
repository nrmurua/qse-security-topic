I have been referring to the API client in this repo, to build the a similar thing in The Julia Language. According to https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ/blob/develop/projectq/backends/_ibm/_ibm_http_client.py#L165-L169, and the docs too, there have to be three fields in the response, viz. downloadQObjectUrlEndpoint, uploadQobjectUrlEndpoint and uploadUrl, but I have been getting only the uploadUrl in response.
I happened to discuss it with one of the lead devs of IBMQ and he confirmed that there had indeed been an update, where there's isn't any need of the extra step and directly PUT the QObject to the uploadUrl.
I didn't try the code here in Python, but if someone can confirm then it'd be nice. :)
Indeed, I can see now there has been some (additional) modifications to the API since ProjectQ was updated. I will take a look into that
