On a 2 qubit test, the results do not return the reverse bit order (as is standard in Qiskit). For example, suppose you run a pi pulse on qubit 0. The resulting state is 10, contrary to the standard in Qiskit.
Run the following code:
The result is 10.
Using the standard Qiskit convention, the result should be 01.
