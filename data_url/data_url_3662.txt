Why do we support this? I was very confused why run kept returning all zeros even though I added MEASURE instructions to the end :)
Explicitly
throws out the result. You need to do
It's so you can do measurement just for effect. I agree this is the wrong default though and bad from a UX perspective.
Similarly themed tickets:
(dragging up an old issue) I disagree that this is a problem. IMO MEASURE is an explicit instruction that effects quantum memory (through the first argument) and classical memory through the second.
Leaving off the second argument makes sense that it would just measure the qubit and not deposit the result anywhere.
It's fine to have a Quil instruction - but this is such a stumbling block from the PyQuil side. We can support it but maybe not make it so easy to trip up: for instance by making the second argument mandatory and you have to pass None for measurement for effect
even from the quil side we should have MEASURE-FOR-EFFECT or a /dev/null equivalent to pass as the second argument. When the default argument is the opposite of how everyone uses it ... it's a bad default!
this is still a problem
I propose the resolution on the pyQuil side be as what has been described above:
