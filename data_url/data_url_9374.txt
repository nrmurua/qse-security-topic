The page needs to be reworked once we have a stable interface for Hamiltonian.
I think the it should cover the following contents, please feel free to add more
1, what is hamiltonian, why this is important
2, point out EaRyd using the waveform and lattice to directly build the hamiltonian
3, show how to build time-dependent hamiltonian
4, show how to build time-independent hamiltonian, and how to access hamiltonian at one singe time
5, convert hamiltonian into sparse matrix
6, how to convert Hamiltonian into sparse matrix in subspace
7, how to diagonize hamiltonian and treat hamiltonian as an observable and measuring in certain state. Here we will also show how to convert a vector to a quantum sate.
@Roger-luo, once you have finished the new interface, please try to cover these points (especially those related to codes). I can polish more once we have a rough version.
