This naming scheme for the conda-distributed .bit breaks artiq_flash which assumes a hyphen... 
Also, the name of the path is amc-standalone not standalone as in artiq_flash.py

That's not what the problem is, but yes, there is a discrepancy in artiq_flash regarding the sayma names and paths.
Yes, I ran into this too. I have a PR prepared for this, just needs checking.
artiq_flash will need a bit of refactoring to properly support Sayma and its RTM FPGA (we plan to put the bitstream in another flash partition like the runtime).
Fixed in f77aa9b.
Thanks!
