On Qiskit docs 2.0 we would like to divide documentation in different types using the diataxis framework. For that, we are creating how-to guides in each Qiskit repo.
@Guillermo-Mijares-Vilarino is going to convert one of the tutorial in qiskit-tutorials to a how-to guide in Terra.
To add the how-to guide example, we will need to add a how-to guide section in the sidebar.
