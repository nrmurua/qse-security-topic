The gmpy2 package is not available in binary form on all platforms. On unix without mpfr installed the installation fails.
When installing qupulse with pip the gmpy2 is downloaded automatically, but compilation fails. Can fractions.Fraction be made optional? (see commit 7261b07)?
Good point. I will impolement it as a fallback.
Implemented in #378
