seedQuESTDefault was run per process, which means that if ie procs started at different times, they could get different seeds. This could then cause them to decide on different outcomes on calls to the measure function, which would apply this function incorrectly. This would only have been a problem when running in MPI mode.
Incorrectly fixed in b607873. The seed was calculated on proc 0 and broadcast to all other procs, however the wrong data type was used for this broadcast.
Wrong data type fixed in b9da107
