With the current 3 layers to provide config options (like solver or endpoint):
it is impossible to "suggest" default option values (e.g. solver), but allow for user to override it on any of the 3 layers. Possible use cases:
Proposal: implement a mechanism to provide config options on layer zero -- a per-Client instance default value for each config option, provided on construction.
For example, adding defaults argument to Client constructor and from_config, which would .update the Client class-level defaults for all accepted config options. Additional benefits of this are: consolidation of the defaults, clearly documenting all accepted config options in one place. It can be nicely combined with #357.
