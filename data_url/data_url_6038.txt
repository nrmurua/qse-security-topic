Can use gpu in qasm_simulator but not in statevector_simulator
When I use qasm_simulator with backend_options={"method":"statevector_gpu"} it uses gpu.
When I use statevector_simulator with backend_options={"method":"statevector_gpu"} it doesn't use gpu.
Any program is ok, for example:
It should use gpu in statevector_gpu
It should be using the GPU running as you are above. Are you seeing an exception that "statevector_gpu" is not supported?
For your example circuit I would expect most of the computation time will be spent copying the statevector from the GPU memory to host memory to the output results.
