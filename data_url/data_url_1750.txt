I want to use CircuitOperation to carefully construct a circuit while respecting moment structure. At some point I need to flatten/unnest it to a normal two-dimensional circuit.
@Strilanc suggests
but I'm running into problems with circuit_operation.circuit respecting a qubit mapping.
On the original CircuitOperation PR I suggested that we should add a method to "apply" the various maps (qubit, measurement, parameter) to produce a new circuit operation with maps applied. That would then work with the code from @Strilanc. Currently, this map application only happens implicitly during decomposition. I'd be happy to take a crack at this.
Closed by #4188 if you want a PR instead of a commit hash :)
