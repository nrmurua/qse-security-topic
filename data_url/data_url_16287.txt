initial_layout can be passed to the transpile and execute methods to map the virtual qubits of the relevant QuantumCircuit objects to physical qubits of the specified real backend. However this functionality does not work if backend = QasmSimulator. The mapping of virtual to physical qubits is important when simulating with noise which varies from qubit to qubit. Obviously you can get around this easily by ensuring your virtual qubits implicitly match the appropriate physical qubits in your QuantumCircuit object, so it's not the most pressing enhancement. Nonetheless it would be a good one.
Thanks for reporting this @special-kay . Right now the preset pass managers only run _given_layout if a coupling_map is provided, which is not the case for the simulators. (ref: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/9b03b54/qiskit/transpiler/preset_passmanagers/level1.py#L197 ).
If you are running a simulation with noise, is there a reason not to provide a coupling_map? (Its could be a bug that specifying an initial_layout requires a coupling_map, but we don't check for it.)  If your circuit contains two-qubit gates, and the device you are simulating has less than all-to-all connectivity, the circuit run on the simulator may not be representative of the circuit that would be run on the device (it would be missing swap gates added in the routing stage).
Right - thanks for bringing that to my attention. Yes, the transpilation works properly if a coupling_map is provided.
