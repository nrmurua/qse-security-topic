After the addition of ISwapRotation in #2488, would it make sense to also add a CZRotation gate which takes the controlled angle as an argument? I usually find myself working mostly with angles, for instance for varitional algorithms, so I currently have to convert to exponents when creating circuits in Cirq.
I'm worried that the matrix of this gate would be ambiguous to users. What's the matrix at pi/2?
I see what you mean. 3 is what I had in mind, and that is also what cirq.CZ**0.5 yields. I think the trouble is due to what global phase one uses for the Z gate that is controlled? For instance,
which was a bit confusing to me at first.
Regardless, I think that it is quite common to want a gate with exp(i*theta/4*(ZZ-ZI-IZ)) = diag(1, 1, 1, e^(i*theta)). Perhaps a good name and documentation can minimize any ambiguity?
Hi @andbe91 - with the TwoQubitDiagonalGate since then there is yet another way to achieve this:
An idea here could be CPhase (similar to the quil version) which could be a shortcut to TwoQubitDiagonalGate.
What do we think about that name?
Also @viathor, not sure if you want to work on this - but you are assigned.
definitely seems logical to me. I'll let others decide on naming and if it is something we want.
Discussed on Cirq Cynq:
cirq.cphase(angle) --> cirq.CZPowGate ** f(angle)
