Currently, subroutineCall takes a expressionList .
I guess that this expressionList should be replaced with indexIdentifierList as quantumGateCall does.
This is correct, thanks @hhorii. Please add a PR with the fix and a test and we can get it merged it.
I just had an issue related to this, which I state here in case it helps others.
If I try to parse a returnStatement which contains
return a - b;
it gets parsed as subroutineCall (a is the subroutine Identifier and -b is the expression passed as an argument).
With the fix you suggested here it gets parsed correctly.
