At some point the ability to pass a noise_model to the pulse simulator stopped working. While this will initially be an unsupported feature, we had planned to have noise models be passable via backend_options to the simulator, and it would be nice to still have this work (even if it is untested).
The T1 example in the example notebook used to work, but now the output of that example seems to be totally insensitive to the parameters of the noise model, or whether one is specified at all (there is no observed decay).
I've tried tracking this down but as of now can't figure out what's going on. The only changes I'm aware of that should affect this have been in digest, but things seem to be being interpreted correctly there. I've tried tracking the various data transformations that the op_system undergoes before simulation, as well as the cython code generation, but am unable to find any issues.
