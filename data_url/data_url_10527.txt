I was working on my presentation for tomorrrow and it occured to me that dnx has a graph coloring function that could be compared to the binarycsp approach. Might be worth a mention in the docs at least
Hi,
@JoelPasvolsky This line mentions the neighbor constraint as defined in the paper so this is a classic Binary CSP.
Is it cool if I send a small pr to mention this in the docs?
Hi @Arafatk, please do. You can see some guidelines here: http://dw-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html
Thanks!
