When trying to load a model from file to a PyTorchDiscriminator object, nothing happens (the parameters of the object are not modified)
Substitute line 93 of file qiskit-aqua/qiskit/aqua/components/neural_networks/pytorch_discriminator.py /
with the following:
self._discriminator = torch.load(load_dir)
Thanks!
