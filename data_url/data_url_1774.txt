Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Raised in #3698. This issue is just to capture discussion; we do not need to act on this unless a decision is reached.
Simulator sweeps can potentially return large collections of results, which are only organized as an ordered list. For more complex results (e.g. lists of expectation values), this might not be the clearest presentation.
Describe the solution you'd like
Results could be packaged in a pandas.DataFrame object, similar to the Sampler API. This would be a breaking change, as both internal and external simulators rely on the existing (non-pandas) API
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
+1 to make the gap smaller between Sampler and Simulator
This is best described as a component of #3868 - support for multiple measurement-result formats will narrow the gap between the Sampler and Simulator APIs.
