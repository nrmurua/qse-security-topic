The last entry in row 1 of the matrix is incorrect and should be  -e^(i*lambda), not e^(-i*lambda).
Also, U2(0,pi) is H, and not U2(pi,0) as given in the docs.
@1ucian0 shall I go ahead and take this? I just need to change the docstring at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/4bd91fef2865c60a41de5c078994f027d38b536f/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/u2.py#L23
Right?
Indeed! Go ahead and fix it. Thanks 😊
You can build the documentation with tox -edocs to see the result (warning: it might take several minutes).
Cool, will do 👍
Thanks!
oh! I think this is a duplicate with #4133 (PR #4165). @FranckChevallier is already working on this.
Sorry.
Ah damn. Alright :)
I've got one pending PR over at qiskit-textbook, mind taking a look?
Keep an eye on #4133 and #4165. Just in case @FranckChevallier needs help or is unresponsive.
Will do, thanks
