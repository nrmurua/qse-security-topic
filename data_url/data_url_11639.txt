quandl is declared as a hard dependency, though it is just a data source, with restricted access (one has to get an API key to use it).
Try to install the package.
No hard dependencies on non-physics and non-informatics stuff.
Make quandl optional.
And maybe move financial into a separate package.
And maybe replace quandl with other data sources, allowing anyone to access it.
Thanks.
