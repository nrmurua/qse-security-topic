I'm getting type errors in pycharm when I'm trying to run a FrozenCircuit. I think there should be no downside to switching the type annotation to AbstractCircuit, of which both Circuit and FrozenCircuit derive?
Agreed; there are probably quite a lot of places where we could change Circuit type annotations to AbstractCircuit instead, but Sampler is certainly one.
Hey, I am new to Cirq. I just created the above PR for the issue, could you please check?
This is fixed thanks to @banrovegrie . I changed the complexity label lol since it turned out to be a pretty far-reaching change
