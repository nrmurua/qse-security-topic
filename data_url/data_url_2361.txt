It would be convenient to have access to some getters that would return iterables of gates of a specific type. For example:
etc.
This is something I end up re-writing a lot when benchmarking or composing partially random circuits
Thank you for filing this @peterse!
This sounds like a useful index for gates. An idea here is to have a single query function that would scan the list of all gates and can take parameters like:
We can start there and then we can build more functionality as required. What other "queries" do you typically use @peterse?
@tanujkhattar Maybe something to add to common_gate_families?
@tanujkhattar is this in your purview?
@tanujkhattar bump; please update
I see a few problems which such getters:
IMO, I think such methods belong to the user code where the user knows exactly what they want to include in these lists and the convenience methods can be written once and shared across library.
I'm curious to hear if others think differently, or else I think we can mark this as won't fix and close this.
From cirq sync:
We might want to do this for more specific gate classes, like cliffords or paulis. We should close this issue as it's too generic, and @dabacon will open a new issue to track adding more specific gate classes.
