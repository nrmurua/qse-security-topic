Converting qiskit.circuit.library.GR capitalizes the GR instruction (GR) when it should be gr. GR is not valid QASM. It also defines the GR gate in int parameters instead of ID.
Converting the qasm definition to gr comes up with a different error
The above snippets shouldn't throw exceptions.

Thanks for the report!  Please could you try this on a more recent version of Terra?  I believe this should be fixed by #7157, which was released in Terra 0.19.  I think the bug came because the GR gate used to say its "name" was GR(0.1, 0.2) and that it had zero parameters - the QASM 2 exporter used to just take the name verbatim (which was clearly incorrect), so here it ends up outputting something that looks like a gate definition, but is completely wrong.
At any rate, with the current main branch of Terra I get:
Yup, this is fixed by terra version 0.19. Thanks!
