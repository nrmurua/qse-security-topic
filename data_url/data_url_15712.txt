The transpiler pass Optimize1qGatesSimpleCommutation scales as the ~4th power in the number of qubits for a random circuit of equal width and depth.


This is qiskit-terra 0.19.0.dev0+637acc0
yeah i also noticed this pass scales very poorly as circuit size increases.
Hi @ewinston, I was trying to work on this issue. Could you provide the details as to how you generate this profile? I know about %prun in python but it would be great to know about the profiler (or the script) that you use to generate the above graphs.
