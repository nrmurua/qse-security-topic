The compressor currently has no support at all for hardware objects of order greater than 1. Augmenting the compressor to deal with higher-order hardware objects is a tall ask, but I think it will ultimately result in a more maintainable code base: parts of the logic of the compressor are quite kludgy (and, accordingly, hard-to-follow) and read more like band-aids than like something well-reasoned. I think that accommodating higher-order hardware objects will necessarily entail sorting all of these kludges out.
What is the physical interpretation of order > 1? Qubits are order 0, links are order 1, ??? are order 2 ...
@notmgsk Operations native to qubit triads. These would likely, though not necessarily, be arranged as planar triangles on a physical chip. For instance, if you had a native CCNOT. (But this isn't necessarily true. Ion traps don't have this geometric layout, but do allow high-order operations.)
