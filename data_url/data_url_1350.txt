Do not run this repro code unless you like thrashing your machine.
Because use_repetition_ids is set to False, no list of repetition ids is ever created and the code finishes in under a second. This remains true when using the operation for other actions that don't affect the repetition ids, like transforming its qubits or putting it into a diagram.
Internally, the code attempts to create a list of one trillion repetition ids. This list will never be used and also does not fit in memory. The code takes forever and eventually crashes.
For context, I know that Mike Newman has used stim to run circuits with hundreds of millions of rounds. If he ever attempted to use stimcirq to convert that circuit into a cirq circuit... *KABOOM*.
