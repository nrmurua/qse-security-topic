From adding type hints, I realized that there are built-in objects called Sequence, namely those of collections.abc and typing. This can create conflicts if we're not careful.
In case we want to avoid this, we will have to consider renaming the pulser.Sequence class and deprecating the Sequence name.
What a pity, Sequence was such a cool and meaningful name! üòÅ
Would the consequences be that bad?
Do you have any clue on how to rename it?
My 20 cents: Timeline? Flow? Progression? Procession? Run? Flow? Chronology? Arrangement? Succession? Chain? Train?...
Or by concatening Sequence with something else? PulseSequence ? Sequencer?
Would the consequences be that bad?
A bit, considering the central role Sequence plays. Virtually all existing user scripts would stop working or raise a DeprecationWarning if such a change were to take place.

I was thinking along the lines of a concatenation, yes, something like PulseSequence or PulserSequence. However, changing the name still sounds a bit drastic to me, specially because this conflict only needs to be taken into account by the developers, not the users.
