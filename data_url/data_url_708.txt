Here is a code snippet from the shor example.
That shows how to use the gt.MODMUL() properly.
The doc says something like this:
Note
... a and N should be co-prime.
Parameters
a    Positive integer less thanÂ N
The a in the documentation basically means the aj in the code, doesn't it? Since the gate does not check co-primality, it is the user's responsibility to make sure the argument such as modpow(a, j, N) is a co-prime of N. Is that correct?
I think the documentation is correct, and the usage is correct as well. First, aj = modpow(a, j, N) computes $a^j mod N$, which is smaller than N since we compute it mod D. Next, since $a$ and $N$ are coprime, then also $a^j$ (i.e., aj in the code) is coprime with N (that because powers $a^j$ of $a$ have the same prime factors as $a$). So there's no need for manual co-primality checks, it's guaranteed by the math.
Yes, very clear now.
I didn't realize that is guaranteed by math at first glance. Thanks for the enlightenment.
