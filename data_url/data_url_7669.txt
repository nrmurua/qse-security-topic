Hi Johnnie,
So if I have an optimized TN, is there a fast way to perform noisy simulation on each gate?

Hi @yuxuanzhang1995, there are not built in ways to do this, so it just depends what kind of noise you want? You could for instance add some unitary noise simply by making the parameters noisy.
That makes sense. I was thinking more of physical-related noises like depolarizing channel or dephasing channels. What you suggested make sense too, I could maybe add a small random matrix as noise to the optimized unitaries and then re-normalize them?
