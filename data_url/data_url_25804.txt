We are going to upload bytes and download bytes
We need to change the SDK wrapper to handle this change
Instead of changing StreamingResponse, we will handle the StreamingResponse with stream=True when calling the results service
To benefit from stream=True and StreamingResponse, we need to iterate through the requests.Response body through iter_content() or iter_lines(). Currently we load the entire response body into memory using the content property, so the stream=True argument has no effect.
That is true, but that gives us the option to handle loading into memory on the receiving end. So, if we're using things internally between microservices, we anyway will want to load the whole object into memory as we will be editing it in most cases. But when the user does the download, we can write the download wrapper in the sdk using iter_lines() or iter_content() so later on when we do support having > memory files we can provide the user the ability to download them.
