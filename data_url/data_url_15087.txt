The QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters() method does not work properly with the parametric controlled-U gate. The values passed to be assigned to the parameters seem just to be ignored (in both cases with inplace=False or inplace=True).

Each parameter of the controlled-U gate should be correctly bounded to the corresponding value passed to assign_parameters(), as it happens for any other parametric gate (Rx in the example above).
Thanks for the report - this is a known issue (#7326), so I'll just close this as duplicate.  There's a potential fix available (#9118) that I need to review properly.
The root cause is mostly that CUGate is a badly behaved subclass of ControlledGate, and really, it's not even really the controlled version of UGate (because it's got an extra parameter).

Yes, there is the extra gamma parameter serving as global phase.
Thank you and sorry for the duplicate, I didn't see that there was already an open issue on this.
No worries - it's really our fault that the issue's been open for so long.
