Since we are slowly moving it out of contrib, we need to have a paragraph or two in the readthedocs that explains it.
Hi @vtomole ,
I would like contribute by solving this issue, if it's still open.
Hi @vtomole,
can you once share the link of readthedocs and PauliString file, I am unable to find it.
Thanks for your assistance.
Here are the docs: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/tree/master/docs.
Here is pauli string: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/ops/pauli_string.py
Fixed by #3654
