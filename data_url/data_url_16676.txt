At this moment, large circuits generated by Aqua(IQAE for example) exceeding the limit of a real backend is resubmitted. Unless you kill the process locally, the backend is flooded . It would be really beneficial to have a way to avoid this.
Algorithms have been refactored over to use primitives and circuit execution etc is now handled by these. As such I am closing this issue.
