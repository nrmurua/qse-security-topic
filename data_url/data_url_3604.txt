Hello,
Is there a way to submit job(s) to the QPU and receive the results via email (this would be useful for submitting multiple jobs), or is it that we run a script and wait for it to complete?
Thank you!
@hsim13372 are you familiar with the asynchronous API provided by the QPU (and QVM) connection? This will allow you to submit jobs and receive back job-id's that you can use at a later time to fetch your results.
Ah I see, thank you!
Thanks for the issue @hsim13372! Closing as resolved.
