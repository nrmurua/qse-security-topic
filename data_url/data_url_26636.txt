The download process of latest SIRUS 7.0.2  can not been finished. several hours passed, it only downloaded 15.5 MB but the size of early editon 7.0.0 is 55 MB. hen i download it from github, it is sure that the package is only 15 MB and it report an unexpected ending when tar -xvf.  I don't think the main problem is the slow connection speed of the internet. kindly, please upload the file pack to www.cp2k.org/static/downloads as soon as possible.
thks.
The latest SIRUS 7.0.2 archive has a size of 55828 bytes and can be downloaded from Github. Since we consider Github as essential infrastructure, we generally don't mirror packages from there to www.cp2k.org/static/downloads.
Please note that redundant and off-topic posts help nobody. If you really can't download from Github then you should talk to your local admin. For usage questions you find a better audience at our forum.
