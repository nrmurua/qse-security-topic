We claim to support >=3.7.0 but the following happens:
I can confirm that qsim has no py3.11 build:

@vtomole, do you have an application that requires using qsim with python 3.11, or would restricting the python_requires to supported python versions be sufficient?
Ah, https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim/blob/master/docs/install_qsimcirq.md#linux-installation implicitly says python 3.11 is not supported as well: We provide `qsimcirq` Python wheels on 64-bit `x86` architectures with `Python 3.{6,7,8,9}`.
Restricting python_requires sounds good. I was just testing how compatible qsim was with recent versions of python. The main draw for python 3..11 is the performance improvements. But again, it was released relatively recently so no there is no rush in supporting it.
