The classical shadows documentation page in the user guide now contains two very detailed workflows, but the information may be a bit too detailed for that section.
Two workflows:
The existing worflows should contain more commentary in the main text and could be split into two images with two captions. The landing page of the user guide section on classical shadows could contain a workflow image that is more similar to existing workflow diagrams from other techniques, e.g., the ZNE one.

Edit: it might also be nice to have a SVG template for workflows of new methods.
