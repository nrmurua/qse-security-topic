Currently, QuantumCircuits support assign_parameters with ParameterVector input. The task is to add support similarly for Schedules, which now support parameter assignment as well.
can I try this one?
Yes, please! Let me know if you need help. I would start by looking in circuit/quantumcircuit.py and expect to make changes in pulse/schedule.py. (Plus a reno note and tests)
Hello, @lcapelluto I am a first-time Open Source contributor, do you mind if I take a look at the issue?
Hi @alejomonbar ! any progress?
Hi @1ucian0. Yes, I just got some feedback from @lcapelluto but I have this question #5240 (comment) for concluding with this issue.
This issue can be closed as this functionality is available in the current version of qiskit.
