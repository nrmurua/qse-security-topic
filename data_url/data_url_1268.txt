Description of the issue
These two equivalent circuits show different outputs.
How to reproduce the issue
Qiskit (version 0.37)
The documentation here at Gate conversion rules states that QASM u3(θ,φ,λ) is equaivalent to QasmUGate(θ,φ,λ) (as far as I could tell). So I'm not sure why the outputs are different. Interestingly, if I use circuit_from_qasm, and generate a circuit from qiskit's QASM, I get correct (in this case, similar to qiskit) result.
The documentation (and also this issue) leads me to believe that the u3 and QasmUGate are equivalent. Using circuit_from_qasm works, but using the gate directly doesn't seem to. Am I missing something?
Cirq version
1.0.0
I'm not a maintainer but I believe qiskit is in radians whereas cirq is in half-turns. Try dividing the angles by pi?
As @daxfohl said, QasmUGate takes half-turns, not radians, so the angles must be divided by pi. To confirm, I ran
and got
Note that documentation is explicit about the units.
Actually, not everywhere.
