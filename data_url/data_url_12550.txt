I have a 2D tensor of circuits. I wish to find the expectation values of an operator for these circuits, and take the mean along an axis.
I have tried using tf.reduce_mean().
it is giving me this error.
programs must be rank 1. Got rank 2. [Op:TfqSimulateExpectation]
am I doing something wrong?
Thanks in advance!
Hi, our circuit execution layers currently accept either a single Cirq circuit or a 1D list or tensor of circuits.  To emulate higher dimensional circuit inputs, you can use the tf.reshape op on the output of our quantum layers.
Here is a code example to demonstrate the reshaping:
Thank you @zaqqwerty . can i train such a model?
