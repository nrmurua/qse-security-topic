Several discussions occured during the course of the tutorials on using Qiskit Metal which revolved around best practices in simulation and advanced topics. The idea was brought up that these are problems everyone has and there are pockets of information that exist throughout labs in the world. There doesn't seem to be a workshop/conference centered around this idea of model matching to experiments. It would be a good idea to maybe initiate some sort of laying out for the community these techniques that have been developed to push the field of device modelling forward.
-Better understanding of superconducting qubits across more theoretical and advanced levels of application
Please comment with possible topics below
Tagging here @nbronn  and @marcolincs, we may want to organize this midway or near end of open tutorials.
I think for first one we can just self organize with Kallie. We can plan for something in 3-4 months from now.
