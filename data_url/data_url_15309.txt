Running the documentation build (such as by tox -e docs) causes a file new_hist.png to be dropped in the working directory.  This came from #8569, which added a jupyter-execute block to the qiskit.visualization documentation that leads a savefig command.
Run the documentation build.
No files outside the documentation build directory should be created.
The offending .. jupter-execute block can just be replaced by a .. code-block one, since it doesn't actually output anything visually, or execute code in the IPython kernel that needs persisting to later cells.
