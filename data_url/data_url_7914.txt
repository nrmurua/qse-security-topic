Would it be useful to add error bars to mcsolve results once the averages are computed?
I would also find this extremely useful. Currently, I need to call mcsolve once per trajectory if I want statistics and that is quite inefficient.

Sorry @jyagom, just to clarify: you can already call whatever ntraj and set the average states option to False, without calling mcsolve once per trajectory. One can then do statistics on that data. I just was proposing to provide it more easily. Or I am misunderstanding your issue?
An example is given in this gist https://gist.github.com/nathanshammah/f96f6c1db5c323243a4729467cb7351f.
Some performance benchmarking was done in PR #1024.
Hi @nathanshammah ,
Indeed you are right, but I was concerned that with large Hilbert spaces as in my case storing the individual states at all measuring times would be simply unaffordable. That is why I was wondering if mcsolve could provide not only averaged observables but also the associated statistical errors. I hope this clarifies my problem. Thanks for the example too!
