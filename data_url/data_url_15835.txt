The qc.draw() function does not draw the quantum circuit properly if we change the order of classical registers while initializing the QuantumCircuit() instance if there is a measurement in the circuit that is conditioned on the output of some other classical register.

Notice that in the above code, we initialize the quantum circuit as:
However, if we exchange the classical registers while initializing, like so:
we get this, which is the correct circuit...

The circuit in the first image should have the arrows going to the classical register c_b and the dots going to c_a, but here both of them go to c_a.
I can work on this. It may affect all 3 circuit drawers. Thanks for finding it.

Hi @enavarro51 , thanks for taking this up!
I checked the "text" circuit drawer and the output of that looked fine to me. However, I didn't check the "latex" option. But anyway you can try both of them out yourself also once :)
