Description of the issue - include code snippets and screenshots here
if relevant. You may use the following template below
Expected behavior: (What you expect to happen) pytest should work on Windows
Actual behavior: (What actually happens) pytest fails due to np.complex256 which is not available on Windows (see https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.clongdouble)
Reproduces how often: (What percentage of the time does it reproduce?) Always
System information: (post the output of import pennylane as qml; qml.about()) Windows
Please include any additional code snippets and error tracebacks related
to the issue here.
Any additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary
to reproduce the issue.
As this only a few people use Pennylane on Windows and this is almost nothing to do with a user code, I don't think this is an urgent issue.
Nice catch @chaeyeunpark! Although I wonder why the automatic tests that are being run by cibuildwheel after the Windows wheel is created isn't catching this?
As this only a few people use Pennylane on Windows and this is almost nothing to do with a user code, I don't think this is an urgent issue.
Could a user have the same issue if they repeat the same code that is written in the tests? Or are the tests explicitly setting complex256 as a test case?
Hi @josh146! Thanks for the comments/questions. Currently, our GitHub action only runs pl-device-test not the whole pytest.
In addition, the errors are raised only because there is no attribute named complex256 in numpy on Windows as  it is just an alias defined in Linux (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.scalars.html#numpy.clongdouble). 256 bit complex numbers are not supported by lightning even in Linux environments.
I think we can remove the complex256 from checks/tests. No long-term hardware support exists on any platform, and as reported the tooling only supports this on Linux.
