See title.
Is there a plan for the continuation of the room level?
Is there some outline for what should be included or a theme for it?
If given this information i would be happy to implement it.
edit: Realized it was not called an escape room sequence, but a level. My bad
It becomes very unintuivative to continue to escaperooms level 4
The same can be said about level 4 ending at room 5.
Room 5 for level 5.
Level 6 being 'blank', and the game then continuing at level 7 (but then again ending at room 5).
and then being blank for the rest of the game.
I think they just didn't add more problems...
