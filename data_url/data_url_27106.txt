Hello, I am working on an experiment with a different type of quantum reinforcement learning model using the same version of the Gym Frozen Lake environment that you have used in your variational quantum circuit reinforcement learning experiment. However, I am not clear on how to switch between the three different Frozen Lake configurations shown in Figure 1 of your article. If you would be willing to provide me with instructions on how to switch between the different configurations, I would really appreciate that. Thank you very much.
You can try with this modified code, you can design other configuration too:
