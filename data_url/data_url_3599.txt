There is a problem with DEFGATEs that has manifested itself in the phase_estimation module of Grove (brought to our attention here: rigetti/grove#145).
I have traced the problem to commit d309ac1
Each of the below test cases should deterministically return the input phase, for both phase_estimation and estimate_gradient. With this commit, result is not correct and nondeterministic for phase=3/4.
Great writeup!
If I take the program p generated for phase = 3/4, it seems to me that the second DEFGATE is wrong:
as this is not unitary (the third diagonal element is basically 0)
