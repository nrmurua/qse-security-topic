A comment from @oliverdial in private communication: Is there a reason to not also store the confidence interval if hmean < 2/3?  It’s still well defined, as there’s a probability that the average HOP < 2/3 but the actual is greater (thinking mostly about the first couple circuits here) ..  It’s a really minor point, but might help w/ figures like the one in the QV paper (QV64 paper figure 2a)
closing since some of it was done in #482, and the plots will be handled by @HuangJunye in as part of #213 and #224.
