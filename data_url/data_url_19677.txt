randomized_benchmarking_seq doesn't work when called with an interleaved_elem that has a pulse gate.
In the example below, the interleaved_elem is a circuit comprising of a single gate, custom_swap, which is a pulse gate.
Running this code is necessary to run pulse-gates for the Open Science Challenge.
It doesn't fail.
Not sure. Ideally there would be a way to both denote that the custom gate is clifford, while also preserving our own pulse-level calibration for it.
In a previous version of qiskit-ignis, we could pass in something like interleaved_gates = [['swap 0 1']] instead of interleaved_elem. Then we could hack around the resultant circuits to manually insert the pulse gates. But hopefully there is a more elegant fix.
@singular-value - thank you very much for reporting this. I think that this bug has just been fixed when PR #548 has been merged. Could you please check this again with the new ignis master?
Coolâ€”will do.
Seems that PR #548 fixed this.
