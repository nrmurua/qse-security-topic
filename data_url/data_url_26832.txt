Dear CP2K developers,
I'm new using CP2K and I'm having issues compiling it. The problem that I'm facing is linking it against libxc. I get the following error,
and others of the same kind. I tried with my on installation of libxc (which worked well with other ab initio programs) and the automatic installation from the ./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh script.
Running grep to check if the routine xc_f03_func_init is in libxc, I do find it in the library, but not in the module files present in the include directory
Do you have an idea of what goes wrong in my linking?
I'm trying to compile the master branch. I used the following option with the install_cp2k_toolchain.sh script
Below are the arch files
local.sdbg.txt
local.sopt.txt
local.ssmp.txt
Best regards,
Marc
Apologies for not giving feedback earlier. For installation problems you may get a quicker response on our forum.
Please check whether there are additional error messages in the log, like warnings about the linker unable to open a referenced library for example. One possible source of error can be the use of the ~ in --with-libxc=: while variables like $HOME will be interpolated by the shell before passing the argument to the called command, are ~ and globs (*, ?) passed along directly without expansion and then it depends on the executed command/script whether or not they are expanded.
Closing, since there seems to be no real issue here.
