We publish some documentation about the MLIR dialects that is used by nvq++ compiler, but these are very bare bones so far. For example, documentation about the types and operators is missing. Some documentation is generated by cudaq-doc build target, but not all of the generated documentation is included in the published docs. Even though the dialects are under heavy development and are not stable at this point, it would be nice to make more (generated) documentation available in some form.
We need to figure out how to include the tablegen generated documentation into the published docs. (Consider this a down vote for replicating this information in separate files.)
