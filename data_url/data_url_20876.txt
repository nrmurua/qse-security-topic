META.yml files currently include length-public-key and length-ciphertext.  They should also include length-secret-key and length-shared-secret (for KEMs).  Similarly for signatures.
Fixed by cc65166.
The size of the secret key can be different for different implementations; once we allow multiple implementations for one scheme, we need to revisit this one.
Good point. Is there anything against moving length-secret-key: to be a child of each entry in implementations:?

Seems fine.
