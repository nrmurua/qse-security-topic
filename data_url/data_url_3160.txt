PyQuil 2.0 was released almost a year ago, we don't need four sections at the top of the documentation devoted to the changes introduced in that version. The sections should be removed and their contents spread into the rest of the documentation as appropriate.
A broader and valuable task would be to rethink the documentation presentation, for which this would be a subtask.
@notmgsk Yes 100%, I'm just trying to break that massive task into issues that individuals could tackle in the next sprint. If you think that a larger tracking issue is a good idea, or if you have any ideas for additional subtasks please lmk!
