Here are some simple test cases:
Essentially, all the cases should produce the same final state as the Case 4 does.
Just a friendly reminder: a similar issue was fixed yesterday at staq.
@DevelopDaily Can you please point me to the corresponding issue in staq? Are you referring to this: softwareQinc/staq@6327a05
I am not sure how he fixed it. It seems qpp has already got that line of code in the commit you mentioned, yet still crashes.
Case 2 appears to be fixed in the latest version.
For case 1, the qasm parser doesn't allow '+' in front of integers/floats. The easiest way to support this is to add a unary '+' production rule and just shortcut it since it's the identity operator. I'll submit a PR.
@DevelopDaily Fixed by #85
