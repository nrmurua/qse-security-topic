The CX gate with an open-control does not get simulated correctly. This is a follow-up on #4180 where this has first been discovered.
The output state of
should be |10> (in Qiskit endianess) but the QASM and statevector simulator both produce |00>. The quantum_info.Statevector object however computes the correct result.
This might be a gate-naming issue, since the CX gate is called 'cx' both for open and closed controls. The same problem occurs for the CCX gate.
Aer's simulators:
Statevector object from quantum info:
Produce |10>.
Check the ctrl_state upon simulation for the gate names 'cx' and 'ccx'. But I haven't worked with Aer before so maybe this is also completely wrong!
This is changing the qobj spec for "cx" which is not a parameterized gate. If you transpile and assemble for a backend that only supposed "cx" this is the resulting qobj from your example:
An open-controlled-X gate should be compiled to x q0; cx q0, q1; x q0; for correct execution on a backend.
