Let's merge the tomography overview that @gadial make into the examples notebooks and clean up the notation @chriseclectic
These will replace the current tomography notebooks in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/tree/master/qiskit/ignis so make sure they provide at least as much information and are accessible (they can have parts which are advanced, but lead off with simpler discussion)
What about the relaxation and decoherence notebook in the same tutorials dir? do you want a similar merge with the newer text from @yaelbh ? Not clear to me what sits in ignis/examples and what in tutorials
copying the answer of @dcmckayibm in slack:
The folder that is currently called examples will be moved to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/tree/master/qiskit/ignis and overwrite the files that are currently there. So we still need to finish/polish those and finished the documentation in qiskit/docs.
Ok, based on my updated understanding we will not merge these notebooks. The overview will go into community, but let's merge @gadial 's notebook with what's currently in tutorials/qiskit/ignis
