BUG TEMPLATE 
The code :

And I add print,the result is

The output is :
** {'0011': 5002, '0111': 4998}**
I guess the right answer is {0001:10000} ,Because the circuit is full of X and CX gate and noise gate error probability is 1.0
So why it has two results? waiting for your reply,thanks a lot
You should draw the transpiled circuit to see how the controlled gate is decomposed into basis gates for the simulator
