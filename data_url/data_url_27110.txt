I've created a new issue (following #81 ).
What is the local site symmetry of FeSb2?
According to the output of dcore_pre, the five orbitals are not degenerate and
the site symmetry is quite low.
If this is true, this could be very problematic to any matrix CT-HYB solvers like (ALPS/CT-HYB, triqs/cthyb) because they use the site symmetry to reduce the computational cost.
According to the output of the ALPS/CT-HYB,
the dimension of the largest subspace of the local Hilbert space is 100 (could be too large).
There are several possible workarounds.
What do you think?
Hi,
I agree with you. The sysmetry might not be correct in the hr.dat file. The wannierization is performed by another team. In their input for wannier90, I see that site_symmetry is not used. If I understand the structure of FeSb2 correctly, the two Fe atoms in the unit cells are equivalent under certain symmetry operations.
I also figured that the wannierization result FeSb2_hr.dat have complex values which is considered as not good by the triqs/dft_tools. Will this also affect performance of the solver?
Best,
Zhijie
Hi,
The output of dcore_pre also indicates that the intra-atom part of the hopping matrix for the two atoms are not equivalent.
For DCore, any inequivalent shells must be connected by the "identity" transformation in the hopping file.
If SOI is not important, you could construct non-spinor Wannier functions.
