The idea was already mentioned in #52 but there a complete redesign of the MPI launcher was discussed.
My feature request is shorter and more goal-oriented.
I would suggest adding a bash script that simply launches an MPI job in syncro mode in a multi-CPU environment.
Maybe the code in quimb-mpi-slurm has to be changed slightly.
I've already tested a lot but still had no success.
What actually works is running a job in non-MPI mode on one CPU with 48 threads.
The SLURM batch script looks then like this:
But instead I want to execute the job not only on one CPU, but on different CPUs (nodes).
My script looks as follows atm:
Also, the commented-out lines at the end were not successful, where I already tried to change the start code to quimb-mpi-slurm.
Code of quimb-mpi-slurm:
No response
Hi @Babalion, sorry to be slow getting to this. I do now think it would make sense for quimb to basically just have two modes:
Getting rid of the other modes would hopefully negate the need for any quimb-mpi-python launcher at all. Then it would just be a matter of documenting how to fit it into usual MPI scripts/workflows, and taking some care with environment variables that control threading level.
What was not working / did you change in the launcher above?
Yes indeed, the documentation for launching a script in MPI mode could definitely be improved.
Your idea sounds good and furthermore may also solve #52.
I still had no success to run the script on the SLURM cluster in MPI mode.
Maybe we could reduce the quimb-mpi-python to a minimal working script only supporting the --syncro mode?
Then testing and debugging would be way easier for me.
Moreover, is it in general possible to utilize MPI for the TEBD algorithm?
