should return the voltage that channel is at.
Returns 0.03... (Consistently the same number every time on all channels which is totally unrelated to actual output, would write whole number but am on my phone so will add it in comments when I get a chance).
Any ideas? Possibly it's converting a message and there is a missing read() somewhere. I didn't get the chance to play around but if anyone has a chance to take a quick look (or while testing #552 pr). Cheers.

There is an implementation of a channelized version of the DecaDAC that solves this issue that you can see at spauka/Qcodes@76af2a3 that solves this issue.
You may want to backport the code that reads the DAC memory depending on your needs.
Thanks @spauka. Just had a look and it looks fab! It looks like you rewrote most of the driver ;) . I didn't see how that particular commit would fix my problem but that could well be down to my shaky DecaDAC knowledge. Hopefully can be merged soon and I'll try it out next time I'm using the DecaDAC :)
Now that @spauka's Decadac driver got merged in, can we close this? @nataliejpg, are you happy?
@WilliamHPNielsen yes and also excited to try channels ;P
@nataliejpg Oh, they're fantastic.
