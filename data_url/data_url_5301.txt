Many of the DD routines throughout the package include a start parameter that is supposed to indicate the lowest index in the DD. This was mainly introduced for the Hybrid Schr√∂dinger-Feynman (HSF) simulator and isn't used anywhere else.
As such, it is kind of a nuisance and leads to a lot of special handling throughout some of the functions.
It should be possible to work around this requirement by refactoring parts of the HSF simulator.
