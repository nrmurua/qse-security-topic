Hi there,
I would like to run SamplingVQE with different ansatz circuits and compilation options to evaluate their performance for a FakeBackend. For that, I run something like
Here, I experienced that I could enter an ansatz_qc that has not been compiled to the used FakeBackend yet and still get a valid result when running compute_minimum_eigenvalue when using the skip_transpilation=True parameter.
In the example below, an QAOA ansatz is created for a sample MaxCut problem for an instance with four nodes.
I would have expected an assertion error that checks whether the to-be-executed ansatz_qc actually is transpiled according to the used backend. Am I overlooking something here? How is the underlying noise model of the FakeBackend considered when the quantum gates are not part of its basis gateset?
