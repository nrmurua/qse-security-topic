The command line interface has two functions related to multi-signature functionality:
tx_multi_sig_create  Creates Multi Sig Create Transaction, that...
tx_multi_sig_spend   Transfer coins from src to dsts
This issue is to document the need for a tx_multi_sig_vote at the CLI allowing users to vote on a spend.
