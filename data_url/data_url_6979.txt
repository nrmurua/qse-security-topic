When testing on a mac in safari, I triggered a bug that resulted in what was a working state to degenerate into an unworking one. Current guess is that one of the polyfill constants on WebGLRenderingContext wasn't applied.
Seemed to have something to do with refreshing. Undo/redo also broke. Could be related to history pusher.
Fixed by adding polyfill imports to the top of test util files.
