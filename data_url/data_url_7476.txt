I'm trying to dispatch (not dispatch!) on a set of blocks where one or more blocks has been tagged as NoParams.
Then I tried implementing chsubblocks for the NoParams case as
but then I get a different error
and now I'm not sure what to do next. It seems like somehow it still expects 2 parameters and the NoParams tag was ignored, because the above error is identical to the one I see when trying dispatch(chain(1, Yao.Ry(1.0), Yao.Rx(1.0)), [2.0])
It's probably trivial, but could you help me out? Thanks!
Oops, I was trying to checkout a new branch and create a PR to resolve this issue, but turns out the branch name is not specified correctly. I pushed to the master directly by mistake. @Roger-luo
This is the relevant commit:

@vincentelfving it should work in the master branch.
@GiggleLiu thanks a lot! this is indeed fixed now
