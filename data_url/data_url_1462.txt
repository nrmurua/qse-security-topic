Description of the issue
The if not isinstance(other, cls_self) check below enforces that the other should be an instance of the same class type, which essentially leads to ignoring _value_equality_values_cls_ and returns NotImplemented.

How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
0.14.0.dev
+1 we want equality and approximate equality to be consistent
