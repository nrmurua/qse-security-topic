This used to work with my compiler, but prints 0 now.
coreanalyzer says this:
Is this the correct message sequence?
Actually no and this isn't a compiler problem, but a corner case with the RTIO core. It needs a delay between output and set_sensitivity as it can only process command per cycle; it works after adding it. AFAICT no real-world experiment will do this, so I don't think this case needs better handling.
