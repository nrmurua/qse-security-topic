With the new distributed analyzer, running artiq_coreanalyzer -p causes a panic in the satellite when the analyzer buffer is full.
The satellite's RTIO events will be returned.
The satellite Kasli panics with the following message:
The actual cause of this is lines 89-90 in satman/analyzer.rs.

I was going to propose the following patch, however it causes decoding errors, so I suspect I'm missing something here. Apologies.
