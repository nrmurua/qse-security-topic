The incremental coverage scripts used by Cirq and OpenFermion-Cirq are nice because you can use comments to indicate that certain lines don't need to be covered. I think we should move to that system and stop using coveralls. In the past we have had to override the coveralls status check many times.
That's fine. I feel like this is a bit redundant with #414. Also, I would deem all of this very low priority.
