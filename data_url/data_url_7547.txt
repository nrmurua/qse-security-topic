@frankwswang  but please notice Yao does not have any LTS (long time support) version at the moment (the v1.0 version), but we are approaching it, hopefully v0.4 is going to be the last beta version, thus, you will be asked to update your code when v0.4 is released.
It's fixed in v0.3.2 and as long as it's merged to METADATA (JuliaLang/METADATA.jl#22681), you can fix this by simply updating your Yao package by the following command
But we won't be able to fix any bug next week since Julia itself is migrating the whole package registration to the registrator, and there might be some glitches for registering new version.
