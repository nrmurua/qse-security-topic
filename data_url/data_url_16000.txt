The current code is based on the inequality (6.17) p254 of Nielsen & Chung (3rd printing 2017).
This is actually an 'elegant upper bound' for the number of iterations required, which is not necessarily optimal.

The optimal number is obtained with the equality of (6.15) p253.
For instance, the upper bound and the optimal are different as follows for num_qubits=7
@tamiya-onodera
Thank you for raising this issue.
I agree with that the current implementation in optimal_num_iterations actually represents the upper bound of the iteration ((6.17) p254 of Nielsen & Chung) and eq. 6.15 should be used for the number of the optimal iterations.
If you'd like, could you please fix the current implementation?
@a-matsuo
Thanks for your comments.    I will do it.
