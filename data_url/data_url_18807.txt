The OpenQASM paper, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14722.pdf, introduces new concepts to the language and eliminates others that currently exits in the spec. These updates are addressed in #205, #206, #207, #208, #210 (which are not necessarily exhaustive).
To accompany these features, the examples (https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm/tree/master/examples) should be reviewed and updated accordingly. New examples should be added as needed (for instance, for parametric programs).
