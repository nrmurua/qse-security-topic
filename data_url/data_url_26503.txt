The latest COSMA release adds support for AMD GPUs. This will be relevant for hardware like LUMI.
Unfortunately, it's still difficult to get access to AMD GPUs because they are not available in the public clouds.
Hence, I think the computing centers have to step up. Essentially, I see two possibilities:
I'm testing on my side the dashboard on AMD hardware (once per week?).
I think the best solution is to go for the solution 1. and set the tests on LUMI, just like we are doing on Piz Daint. I don't think solution 2. is easy implementable, but it can be something to request...
@fstein93 I think you will have access to LUMI at some point, so we can bring back this discussion by then...
I added the support for COSMA's HIP backend. So, this issue is solved for now.
