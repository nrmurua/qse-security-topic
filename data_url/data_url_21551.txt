This is regards the Phaser (https://github.com/sinara-hw/Phaser) board.
It would be useful if there was a functional block diagram of the DSP to give a nice overview of phaser, given its non-trivial nature. There is an old diagram here (sinara-hw/Phaser#1) , however I believe this is not quite up-to-date with the latest release. Does an up-to-date diagram exist?
DSP diagram updated here: quartiq/phaser#16
