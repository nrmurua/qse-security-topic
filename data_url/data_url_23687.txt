@jenshnielsen we ran into the same...
in loops.py this:
made me forget the issue ðŸ˜®
there is something wrong with that indexing, that j is just randomly (actually its not random...) counting and has nothing to do with the actual action index that parameter got.
Yes that also made me want to forget it ;)
@MerlinSmiles noticed that this leads to unsaved data. This happens because this bug results in lines that contains nan's and the match_save_range check  https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/data/gnuplot_format.py#L269 only writes complete lines
lol great that you found the reason, I didnt figure that part out
