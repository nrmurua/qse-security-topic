The "PEC with Cirq: Learning representations" example (learning-depolarizing-noise.md) in the documentation takes significant time to build (over 4 minutes.)
In particular, it is the learn_depolarizing_noise_parameter() call that requires the large amount of time to complete. By saving the results of this call to a local file, the time to build this piece of the documentation could be reduced.
