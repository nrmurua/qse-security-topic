QuantumCircuit.copy() is supposed to return a deep copy of a circuit, however if the circuit has a metadata dictionary it is not copied, hence if the copy metadata is modified, these changes affect the original circuit too.
Basic example
When copying a circuit metadata should also be copied. In the above example the final print statements should return
Check how copying is handled in QuantumCircuit.copy and update it so that circ_cpy.metadata = circ.metadata.copy()
