I am trying to customize loss function for QAOA. I have changed the files in variational.py and hamiltonians.py in customize_qaoa_loss branch.
In the minimization function of QAOA, I have introduced another input argument known as loss
and in _loss, I tried to introduce if-else statements to consider the alternatives.
The loss in _loss is something like <function QAOA.minimize.. at 0x14777fdc0> if I do it that way.
Is there any advice on how to introduce customize loss function in QAOA? Thanks
@shangtai I believe the safest approach is to pass a custom loss function as argument and use it directly with the minimizer. If loss=None you just use the default function you have quoted:
