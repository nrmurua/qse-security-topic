The statevector_parallel_threshold=1 is ignored.
Initialize with Aer.get_backend("aer_simulator", statevector_parallel_threshold=1) and run a simulation. I didn't observe any matrix ops parallelization.
I think this is the cause. In 
I created to a PR #1572 to discuss configurations of AerSimulator can be conditions of filtering and we decided not.
Your requirement will be satisfied with Aer.get_backend("aer_simulator").set_options(statevector_parallel_threshold=1), I believe.
I see, thank you!
I find it confusing that the catch-all kwargs is being used specifically for filtering (in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/3f9edfc83e6effdacbcce063361878d96b5ed1d5/qiskit/providers/providerutils.py#L47). If it were a keyword argument like filter_criteria={"key": "value", ...}, I would have encountered "unexpected keyword argument" when I passed in the statevector_parallel_threshold=1, and would be redirected to use set_options instead.
To put more context on me being confused: when I searched on the internet on how to set backend option, this was one of the relevant results: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.aer.AerSimulator.html.
Quoting the docstring:
These may be set using the appropriate kwargs during initialization. They can also be set of updated using the set_options() method.
The AerSimulator has this kwargs, and since I saw this before I read the docstring of AccountProvider.get_backend , I assumed that the kwargs of AccountProvider.get_backend also has the same functionality.
