Hi, I found in this link that there is a way to obtain wavefunction from quibit registers, and an  example is given:
its output is:
But when I was trying the code, I find that QuantumProgram and qiskit.extensions.qiskit_simulator can't be imported successfully. I am not sure whether it's because of the updating of Qiskit version. Then how can I obtain the wavefunction now?
Thank you!
I searched for the Changelog, and found that in the Deprecated part of version 0.5.0, there is a sentence saying ''Simulators no longer return wavefunction by setting shots=1. Instead, use the local_statevector_simulator, or explicitly ask for snapshot.'' What does it mean?
That standard way to the get the final state vector is to use the statevector_simulator backend to execute a single shot of a circuit with no reset or measure instructions. For example:
This will return the output
You may also use result.get_statevector(circ) to directly get the np array from the output of the statevector simulator.
Thank you so much! This is exactly what I'm looking for.
No problem!
