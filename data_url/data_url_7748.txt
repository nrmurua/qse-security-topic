Hello,
I have the following deprecation warning when I use quimb. It seems related to quimb/core.py.
Not that it affects the results or performance in any noticeable way, but I wanted to let you know. In case it is relevant, I have Python 3.9.5 with numpy 1.20.3.
Thanks for the issue @maxtremblay. In quimb itself I can only find this line:

FWIW if I run:
I don't get any warnings shown. That's using numpy==1.20.2 so maybe its a very recent numpy==1.20.3 change.
Same warning with numpy 1.20.2.
Also, I am using the version 1.3.0 of quimb which is the most recent release on PyPi, but doesn't seem to but up-to-date with the github repo. For example, in the core.py file, I have
with the from numpy.matlib import zeros at line 13 which is not in the develop branch of the repository anymore.
I guess the simplest way for me to update is to locally build the package directly from the git repo? Or is there a more up-to-date release somewhere that I can easily pull?
Ah yes sorry the released version is a bit out of date now. The quickest way yes is just to install directly from github:
(or clone and install locally if you want to play around with modifying things yourself).
Great. I will do that for now. Thanks
