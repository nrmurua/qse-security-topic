Current Problem
Currently, MaxGap will return an incorrect BQM. That is, the BQM will not reproduce the values in the configuration table. Yet, despite this error, it seems that check_generated_ising_model(..) is allowing the returned bqm to pass.
Please fix both MaxGap's BQM and check_generated_ising_model(..).
Example:
However, h['a'] * -1 + offset != 0 as initially requested in config.
Proposed Solution
The existing variable ground_energy probably pre-dates the concept of offsets and user specified ground states. Perhaps we should remove the sign flip, in that way, we can reproduce the user inputted ground state.
