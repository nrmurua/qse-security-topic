What the Gradient framework does is nicely documented. However looking through the code it can be quite challenging to understand the individual steps involved in the computation. We should add inline comments explaining what's going on so future developers have an easier time maintaining and developing the code.
I will help with this.
Most points have been taken care of in improvements and fixes, such as Qiskit/qiskit#5501.
