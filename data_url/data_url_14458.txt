The configuration of the Fakebackends is missing the "pulse_alignment" information needed for the new way of dynamical decoupling.
The dictionary entry should be returned
No response
I expect this is because the data snapshot for FakeLima was made before pulse_alignment and any timing constraints were being returned by the ibm quantum api. The only way to fix this is to update the snapshot JSON in repo for the device. You can do that with the https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/tools/update_fake_backends.py script and open a pr to update the snapshot.
I may try next week to do this due to easter vacation - if noone else has done it by then
