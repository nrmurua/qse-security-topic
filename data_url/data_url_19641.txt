There are some convenient functions in Ignis for measuring T1, T2, T2*, called t1_circuits, etc. It's particularly handy that t2star_circuits provides the nosc kwarg.
Currently, the wait times between pulses are implemented by concatenating a large number of identity gates. This gets the job done, but is limited in 1) the user needs to provide the length of a single identity gate (which can be hard to find), 2) it's a little annoying to have to generate circuits first which I then have to convert via schedule if I want to add custom pulses, 3) minor point but AFAICT working with id_gates limits time resolution to steps of 160dt vs working with steps of 16dt in Pulse, and 4) aesthetically it's a hack since qasm nominally doesn't have the notion of time.
Would be nice to have analogous Pulse-based functions, t1_schedules, t2_schedules, t2star_schedules. One possible approach:
