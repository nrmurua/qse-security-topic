Hello! Using py to run Katas sample? Possible?

Hi,
You can run the Katas either as C# projects using Visual Studio, VS Code or any editor you like with command line, or as Jupyter Notebooks. Some of the Jupyter Notebook tutorials (the ones dealing with classical computations only or the ones that require visualization) are implemented using Python, but most of them use Q#.
If your preferred setup is Python, you'll probably want to use the Jupyter Notebooks version, since the setup is closer to the Python one (and the tasks presentation is more polished).
I'll close this issue for now; please let us know if you run into any issues using the Katas with Jupyter Notebooks!
