A major version of OpenQasm has been released, v. 3.0. Mitiq has been tested with OpenQasm v. 2.0.
It would be nice to test that all current features are compatible with v. 3.0 (likely so).
It would be nice to see if there are specific features that could be employed, such as w.r.t. timing (moments issues with qiskit-cirq conversions) or pulse-level control (e.g. stretching for analog ZNE), see https://qiskit.github.io/openqasm/.
It looks like there is a lot more interface between classical and quantum instructions. This will require updating from_qasm to handle these new features (custom defined gates, gate modifiers, classical instructions, etc.). This portion is best handled by updating Cirq conversions in my opinion.
The lengthened instructions seem to be exactly pulse stretching.
Pinging this and requesting clarification.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
