Happy to pick this up.
(Comes after #1320)
I understand the first bit :)
The second bit I have a problem with - not sure how to delegate to ControlledOperation's method as ApplyUnitaryArgs only knows the indices of the qubits - hence there are no actual qubits passed to  _apply_unitary_ - how do I create an ControlledOperation instance without qubits from the gate? Maybe I'm missing something and qubits can be recovered from ApplyUnitaryArgs?
#1346 has the first bit done.
You can just make some arbitrary qubits, e.g. LineQubit.range(...). Alternatively, you can extract into a common utility method and call that.
Thank you, #1346 is ready for review!
