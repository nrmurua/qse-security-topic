When initializing an EnhancedTextProgressBar object the __init__ method is calling the start method of it's super class instead of it's own. When then using update (without calling start manually again) there will be an AttributeError because width is not getting initialized by __init__
Proper initialization of the width attribute by EnhancedTextProgressBar.__init__
Currently in master the __init__ for both TextProgressBar and EnhancedTextProgressBar have been commented out and made to just pass. See 
I would suggest making them both call their own start method to omit an additional call of start by the user right after initialization. This would also make both classes be in line with the usage suggested by the docstring of BaseProgressBar. Otherwise I would suggest to include the call to start in said docstring.
As I'm pretty new to github and git in general I would like to try and create a PR myself once you give me approval for the suggested change here.
