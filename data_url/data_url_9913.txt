Application
You use auditwheel on Linux, but I think you should do the equivalent on other operating systems.
On Windows, You could use delvewheel.
On MacOS, You could use delocate.
That's a great suggestion! Thank you @29rou.

Yes, I think You can fix the problem with that.
We now use cibuildwheel, which uses delocate by default and will likely add delvewheel in the future (see pypa/cibuildwheel#459)
