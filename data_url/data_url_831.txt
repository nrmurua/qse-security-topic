What did you find confusing? Please describe.
I am trying to submit a job onto OQC Lucy during its uptime, but find that my jobs are only CREATED and not QUEUED (single job).
Describe how documentation can be improved
Is there documentation what the different statuses of jobs mean, and, why it is only created and not queued?
Additional context
Is there any way to check the status of a device, i.e. obtain information about the queue?
Hello and thank you for reaching out. Here is some documentation around:
I shall review the documentation to see if we can improve the explanation for the catalyst for a state change for better clarity.
Thanks for the quick reply @math411 !
Some info on why the new tasks get stuck in CREATED without being QUEUED, and what that means, respectively, in the first place, would be great!
Hello, generally when a task is in the CREATED status, this means your task has been received by Amazon Braket. Once it moves into QUEUED status, it is now validated by Braket and in the queue waiting to run on the device.
Thanks! Quick follow up: is it common / expected that jobs get stuck in CREATED when the device is very busy?
While this is not a common behavior, customers may see their task get stuck in the CREATED state. If your task is in the CREATED state, please consider it valid.
Please reopen this if you have any further questions.
