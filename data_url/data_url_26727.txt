hello, I am a newbie of cp2k, and I want to install cp2k 7.1 on my mac. I followed the instructions on https://www.cp2k.org/howto:compile_on_mac, but it didn't seem work. I met this problem:
Element of assumed-shape or pointer array as actual argument at (1) cannot correspond to actual argument at (2)

I am not familiar with fortran, so I don't know how to solve it. Can someone help me resolve it. Thanks
Can you please report the version of the compiler you're using? My guess it's gcc 10.x, see also #969
ok, I assume that this is indeed a duplicate of #969
Please reopen if it is not!
