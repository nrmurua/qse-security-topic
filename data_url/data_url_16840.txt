The box of 'initialize' is disordered. It gets outside of the circuit and overlaps with other gates.

I'd like to give a shot at this, would that be okay to you?
Hi @NuoWenLei . Yeah sure. That would be very nice.
Ok, thank you. Would you mind assigning the issue to me?
I was able to locate the problem within mathplotlib.py`
, so I changed box_width = math.floor(len(param) / 8)tobox_width = math.ceil(len(param) / 8)`
This is the result:

Only uncertainty is the other custom multiqubit quantum gates, such as unitary.
That looks good. But, if possible, check if the width of the 'initialize' box can be reduced so as to eliminate the extra spaces inside the box. As for the other gates, it would be good to check that the change does not affect other gates for the worse.
Cool
Not sure if this falls under the same issue, but the circuit created by .gates_to_uncompute() also has drawing problems:
