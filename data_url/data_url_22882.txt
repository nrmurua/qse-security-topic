I followed the quick start steps on the red pitaya website, and after I write the image file provided on the website, I'm able to open the web interface, then I think I'm ready to start installing pyrpl.
I download the pyrpl-windows.exe and write the image file(redpitaya_v0.92.img) provided on the pyrpl website. However, when I'm running the pyrpl-windows.exe, I can't find the hostname or the mac address shown in the youtube video tutorial. Also some errors also occur as shown in the image attached.
have you tried typing the ip into the Hostname box and hitting ok?
I tried, but the window just disappeared after seconds and nothing happened then
I also see this behavior when trying to run pyrpl-windows.exe. After double clicking the executable I am prompted to pick or create a configuration file, or hit 'cancel' for no file. Whichever option I choose a gui pops up with a loading bar that says scanning LAN for red pitayas. When the loading bar gets to 42% the window closes as does the terminal window which opens on initial start of the executable. This all happens too fast to try putting in the ip of my red-pitaya as @RAILMEMS1 RAILMEMS1 points out
Did you solve this problem? I also can't find the ip address and mac address, but my pitaya is connected.
I am also having this problem. get the paramiko.transport errors, the automatic search fails to find the ip address, when i enter it manually, the exe file quickly errors and closes.
Some people i know were able to solve this by creating a renamed copy of global_config.yml when installing and using that instead but i have had no such luck.
