When I install qiskit-aer-gpu version 0.13.2 I cannot find any backends that support GPU
Executing a small test file
shows
I would expect to see some (GPU,) supporting devices as well.
Give some hints, what might be wrong.
Please try uninstalling qiskit-aer by pip uninstall qiskit-aer
After uninstalling qiskit-aer it works now!
Thank you for your support.
Btw, it might save time, if qiskit-aer  would not install anyway,
when installing qiskit-aer-gpu in the first place :  )
.. and since now, there are 12 AerSimulator backends, it would also save time, to give them more descriptive names...
I made fix for the name of AerSimulator
Now we can get correct name as following.
