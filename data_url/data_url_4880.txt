They can leverage the follow two optimisations for significant speedup:
See distributed manuscript!
Hi,
Is there any progress on this? I am also interested in this. If possible would like to work on it.
Hi Ananthakrishna,
Coincidentally yes! The optimised version was recently outlined in this manuscript, and implemented in this repo (see this function). All algorithms of that manuscript are presently being integrated into QuEST, simultaneously with a refactor of QuEST's backend, and expected completed in the next 2 weeks (fingers crossed).
Given that the algorithm's code is already written, but the surrounding software arch is not, there's not realy much possibility of external help, but thanks enormously for the kind enthusiasm!
