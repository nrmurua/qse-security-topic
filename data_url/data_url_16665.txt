Running the following on a 20Q device:
gives 20bit outputs instead of 5bits like  if the circuit were run directly, e.g.
This is not a bug and is the expected behavior of the device given Qiskit's current interpretation of the meas_map. Qiskit inserts extra measurements to account for device requirements prior to execution. Future device updates will relax this requirement. qiskit.result.utils.marginal_counts may be used to remove these extra counts.
Is this mentioned anywhere in the docs?
Yes in this notebook doc
Closing as "not a bug" given the above discussion.
