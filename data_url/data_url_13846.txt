Since exp(-iZ * theta/2) has period 4Ï€,  I'm wondering why some phases are modded by 2 rather than by 4, e.g.

And why is only one argument in u3 not modded by 2?

Sorry for responding so late.
Circuits in PyZX don't care about global phase, so the 4pi periodicity you are referring to wouldn't be visible at this level, as it is just a global phase difference. Additionally, ZPhase(alpha) = diag(1,e^{i alpha}) is not  equal to exp(-iZ * alpha/2) = diag(e^{-i alpha/2},e^{i alpha/2}, as they differ by a global phase that makes ZPhase exactly 2pi periodic.
I don't remember why there is an inconsistency in which phases are modded by 2pi in the qasmparser, but for these reasons it doesn't make a difference to the circuit.
