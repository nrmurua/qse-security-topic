When a pull request is created or some code is pushed to develop branch, workflows/tests.yaml will be canceled if any test in the matrix fails.
A failed test would disrupt execution of workflows/tests.yaml
All tests should complete, even though one or more tests might fail.
Add the fail-fast: false flag to the workflow strategy.
