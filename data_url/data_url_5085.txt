TN-QVM can compute reduced density matrices (RDM) for any number of qubits. We need to enable access to these quantities from XACC, something like Accelerator.getRDM(Qubits) --> const RDM &, where Qubits specifies a list of qubits for which the RDM is computed. RDMs are very useful, in particular they will allow plotting the entanglement entropy between any subset of qubits (1-body, 2-body, 3-body, etc.), so one will be able to dynamically observe the entanglement dynamics during gate application and plot a dynamic heat map how entanglement is evolving in the circuit during gate application. Would be a really cool feature for AIDE-QC.
