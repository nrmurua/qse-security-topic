We should allow the usage of the SDK in offline scenarios. This will restrict the user to deal with local simulators only. If the user tries to access some online feature, we will throw a controlled exception.
If there's no Internet connection, the QuantumProgram class will throw and exit.
I use it offline all the time, you just have to comment out or remove the line of code Q_program.set_api(...) since it is the set_api method that fails when there is no internet connection.
It would be better handled if the set_api method used a try block, something like:
Yes, this is the main point to fix. But I think is safer/more consistent if we wrap in a try block every call to the API so we can rise a controlled exception, or behave the way we want depending on the case.
