Parser for FCIDump files ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010465589900337 ) for the generation of one- and two-body integrals for molecular systems.
This will be in the form of a parser and an FCIDump driver, similar to HDF5Driver, that instead of reading HDF5 files as an input reads FCIDump files?
I was thinking of implementing FCIDumpParser which can be used by FCIDumpDriver to generate a basic QMolecule object. Since the FCIDump format only provides the bare basics (i.e. h1, h2, mo-energies (optional) and enuc) it will never provide a full-fledged instance like the QMolecule.load does at the moment using HDF5.
In this fashion the parser could also be reused by other drivers which are capable of providing more attributes of the QMolecule.
An FCIDumpDriver will feature only what you can extract from FCIDump of course. The HDF5 format, ie. QMolecule is a superset if you will of what is supported. Not all fields will be created by all drivers. For instance not all the drivers have dipole integrals. As long as the basics are created in the QMolecule from the FCIDumpDriver when its run with an FCIDump file then it should be ok. It is noted that not all drivers have all the support and we have logic catering to that which hopefully will be ok on what FCIDumpDriver creates. If not we will have to take care of that.
