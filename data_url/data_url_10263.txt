Prior to requests==2.30.0 (May 2023), urllib3 was upper-bounded to <1.27, but in 2.30.0 Requests added support for urllib3, v2.
In urllib3==2, way of specifying backoff_max time for request retries (urllib3.Retry) changed. Now they finally support it as a construction-time parameter, but before we had to override Retry.BACKOFF_MAX and in later versions Retry.DEFAULT_BACKOFF_MAX attributes either before or after construction.
Note that we don't use urllib3 directly in the cloud client, but via Requests, which accepts (passes) urllib3's spec for retries, max_retries.
For users with urllib3>=2 installed (fresh installs after May 3, 2023):
i.e. backoff_max would not be set to 60 sec (our default), but to 120 sec (urllib3's default).
Only if user explicitly wanted to modify the backoff_max time, via our http_retry_backoff_max config parameter, they would notice somewhat significant impact of this issue.
