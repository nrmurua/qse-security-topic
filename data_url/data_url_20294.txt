When building on ARM (#460) and running with QEMU, qTESLA causes a segfault.
In particular, the commands
lead to segmentation faults.
(Interestingly, so does tests/kat_kem -- maybe it's related?)
Delaying fixing this until the integrating of upcomming round 2 code.
When is this issue expected to be resolved? Are there any known workarounds yet?
We're still waiting on integration of updates to qTESLA from Round 2 and the more recent August 2019 updates announced by the qTESLA team. @christianpaquin may have more info on timeline.
Sorry, no specific date, but release is imminent.
PR #548 passes on ARM.
