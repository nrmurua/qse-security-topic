Add circuit extensions for specific snapshot types to make them easier to use. Initially we can start with the currently implemented snapshots and add additional ones in the future. The initial instructions should be:
I will create separate issues for each snapshot type with more details and collect them here.
There already exists a general Snapshot instruction in Terra, this can be used as the super class for these extensions. This base Snapshot instruction should probably be copied/moved to Aer for now.
Note: There is an issue with parameters and validation that they must be wrapped in numpy or sympy to validate.
@kanejess will get started on this
@chriseclectic I think we can close this issue, right?
