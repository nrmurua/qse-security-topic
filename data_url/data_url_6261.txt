Building Aer on OSX requires having XCode installed.  This is 6Gb of docs and other things that are not needed.  It should be possible to build Aer using only the Apple command line tools, homebrew llvm, or homebrew gcc.
You can use Apple command line tools. IIRC, I think that you are referring to the fact that when the target platform is not set, scikit defaults to 10.6, so it tries to build with an older compiler with libstdc++ support, but as we need C++11 the compiler fails to build and the message claiming XCode needs to be installed is shown, this is a misleading message from scikit I guess.
Try to force the platform target to 10.9 and see if the messages is still shown.
Yes, this is resolved.
