As I try to evaluate the expectation value of the WeightedPauliOperator as was suggested here, I am getting an error if the circuit was obtained via evolve() or initialize().
I am aware of this question on the same issue. However, I was not able to use the suggested solution to fix my code.
As you noticed already this is the same issue as #998, if you define your circuit without explicit registers it works:
For completeness, it seems like you're mixing the previous Operator logic with the WeightedPauliOperator with the new Operators. You could write your code like this:
Many thanks for the detailed response, that worked!
Let me just mention that the issue with initialize() is, in fact, not arising because of the reset instructions: manually removing them does not resolve the problem.
Also, could you please elaborate regarding the 'new' and 'old' operators? Has Qiskit changed the standards at some point? I'm using the WeightedPauliOperators because this is the output format of FermionicOperator.mapping().
