Calculate the Bures angle is a measure of distance between two quantum states [1].
The Bures angle can be computed as follows:
As this is a metric, the location for this should be in state_metrics/bures_angle.py. Ensure that proper tests in tests/test_state_metrics/test_bures_angle.py and documentation in docs/state_metrics.rst are included.
