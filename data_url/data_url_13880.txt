I wanted to give the "Getting Started" example in the documentation a try but I ran into the following problem:
Invoking CNOT_HAD_PHASE_circuit() without any arguments (just to tease what the arguments should be) gives the following:
Which is rather odd considering the PyZX source gives the following, expected definition:
The gates keyword argument seems to come from nowhere and I'm not sure if this is part of a larger problem or something with my installation.
I'm currently running Python 3.7.3 with PyZX installed through the recommended pip install pyzx in a Docker environment. I've also done the same installation locally on my Mac OS (just to make sure my Docker image wasn't the culprit.
I went ahead and used inspect.getsource() to get a better look at the definition from the pip install and I get the following:
The 'Getting started' in the documentation is based on the latest github version wherein p_had and p_t are optional arguments and gates is renamed to depth. I forgot I hadn't pushed this yet to the PyPI version.
I'm overdue for pushing a new version to PyPI anyway, so this should be fixed soon.
Awesome! Is there a possible ETA on the new version being pushed?
And I guess I'll default to the "git clone and install" method for the time being ðŸ˜„
Maybe next week? But then again, maybe not. "Soon"
Version 0.6.0 was just pushed to PyPI, so the pip version and the documentation should match up.
