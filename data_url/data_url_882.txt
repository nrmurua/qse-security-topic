Describe the bug
A TypeError: Object of type 'float32' is not JSON serializable is raised when a circuit composed of gates with parameters that are np.float32 is run on a remote device such as SV1.
To reproduce
If a = np.float64(0.14) there is no problem.
Expected behavior
Circuits can be run regardless of gate parameters being np.float32, np.float64 or float.
