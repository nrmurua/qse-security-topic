We should modify the QubitCircuit class to have input and output states specified for a quantum circuit. Currently the QubitCircuit class has only the following variables - N, reverse_gates, gates, U_list. We could add two more variables - input_states, output_states which could contain the input and output states as a list or a dictionary with the qubit number as key and the state as the value. This can be added to QubitCircuit here.
Then we can modify the function latex_code to add in the input and output states similar to how the gates are added so the qcircuit latex package compiles it.
The original discussion can be found in the QuTiP Google help group where Morten Kjaergaard suggested this.
As a hack, I created new gates for the input and output states.

It also seems like we have a qubit_states function which returns a tensor give the input states. This function is not used anywhere right now. Maybe it can be used to get the output state by acting the circuit's propogator function on the input state. But, for large circuits this may be an issue as it may take a long tome to calculate the propagators and get the output. Instead, we could initialise the output to None or a user provided list and only if output_states = True the output is calculated.
