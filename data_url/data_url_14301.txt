gives a unique QASM3 gate definition for each gate above even though they are identical.
Run above
Ideally, every unique gate would have a single definition.

This behaviour is 100% non-ideal, but it's not strictly a bug so much as a deliberate work-around for problems in the Qiskit data model right now.
The issue is that when the exporter encounters a gate with its parameters bound to real numeric values, there’s no proper way for it to retrieve a definition of the circuit that would apply to arbitrary (symbolic) parameters.  Since we can’t do that (and gates are even free to override their definitions, which we also wouldn’t be able to detect currently).  We can only get a version with the bound parameters right now, so to be safe, the exporter puts out a separate definition for each gate, if that gate isn’t in stdgates.inc.
I get that in this example, they’re all the same parameter so it’d be better if we recognised that, but unless there’s a serious need to fix that particular use-case right now, I wouldn’t have thought that that was super common.  Fixing it without fixing the general case would involve carrying around an extra nested dictionary, which isn’t very difficult, if getting “same gate, same parameters” unified immediately would be a big help.
(copied from slack discussions)
From offline discussions: I'll add some special cases to the OQ2 and OQ3 exporter paths to treat Qiskit standard-library gates specially with regard to parametrisation.  It's not perfect, but the general solution requires something like #7624.  That's a priority for Terra 0.24, but it's been pushed from several Terra releases now, and this should be a hopefully easy work-around that eases a lot of short-term pain.
