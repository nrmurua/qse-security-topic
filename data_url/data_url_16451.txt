.measure_active raises an error due to retworkx.
error
Which version of retworkx do you have installed in your environment? The minimum version was increased to 0.4.0 in #4569 That error looks like you are still using a 0.3.x release of retworkx which doesn't have the find_adjacent_node_by_edge method
Upgrading retworkx solved the issue. Thanks!
