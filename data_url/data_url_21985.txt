As per #893 m-labs says they are no longer supporting Windows. I'm fine with that. @dhslichter? If Windows support is now deprecated please update the documentation indicating this.

artiq != artiq-dev. Windows is still supported, what is not is conda packages that let you recompile the runtime etc. on Windows.
OK. Please note that here

We still definitely require Windows support.
@dhslichter Are you happy with support that includes running ARTIQ on Windows but not building ARTIQ on windows?
Regardless how @dhslichter answers, @sbourdeauducq please update the documentation to indicate the current status of support for Windows with respect to building.
@jbqubit we do not intend to do our own ARTIQ builds on Windows (can use a Linux box if this is really necessary), but we do require the ability to run ARTIQ on Windows.  This means maintaining CI for conda packages for Windows.
