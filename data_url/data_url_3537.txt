After upgrade of the Forest SDK, I got an error at the very basic sample program called quantum_die
Source: https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyquil/blob/master/examples/quantum_die.py
Execution of sample with SDK PyQuil Rel.  2.0.0b3
Is there an updated set of samples available?  Thanks in advance for your support.

Claude
Also getting a run-time error condition in example code "forest2-simple-prog.py" using latest Rigetti package
Thanks for the bug report. We take our "beta" label seriously and the current release is still a little rough around the edges :)
action items here are:
Thanks, this is good news so I will stay tuned to check the news and tested examples. Mainly the simple once like the quantum_die.py is very useful code to demonstrate the package. Meanwhile I will do some study on the rel 2.0 changes like for example the "ro" for measurements.
fixed by #611
