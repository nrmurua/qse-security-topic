The quilc server crashes when it is started.
Note: the problem can be avoided if a quilc command line option is used to disable the version check:  --check-sdk-version=False. The default is to run the version check and this causes the server to crash.
No user code is required.
Operating System:
Python Version (python -V): as installed in the docker container
Quilc Version (quilc --version): 1.25.1, 1.23.0, 1.21.0
QVM Version (qvm --version): 1.17.2
The error message indicates a problem with an HTTP request to:
http://downloads.rigetti.com/qcs-sdk/versions?quilc=XXX (where XXX is the version). This was tested on the Lenovo machine described above:
The HTTP request was successfully completed, indicating no network issues on the host machine. The output is shown below.
Thank you for the detailed report! What a terrible bug! Should be no problem to patch.
So, I don't know why the socket is getting EAGAIN, but nominally you'd retry the request. What's happening here is that the condition is getting signaled ("the exception is being thrown" in more traditional parlance), but the condition is not an error condition, so it's not getting caught by the Pokemon catch-all (which is only looking for error conditions).
PR #735 just handles these benign conditions that USOCKET might signal.
