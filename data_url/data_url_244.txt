See issue #16 as to why the project is stuck on LLVM 16.
We can and should try bumping tpls/llvm to point to the latest version of LLVM on the release 16 branch. If that is copacetic, then make that the version of LLVM used by the CI, shipped in the container images, etc.
As it stands now, tpls/llvm is stuck on an arbitrary commit before release 16 (pre-16).
See also issue #609 .
Latest is 16.0.6. https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-16.0.6
LLVM 17 drops typed pointer support.
