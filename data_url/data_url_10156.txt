Description
When I use dwavebinarycsp in following code as Steps To Reproduce,
I faced "AttibuteError: 'NoneType' object has no attibute 'classical_gap'".
I suspect that this should be modified as ImpossibleBQM or anything else.
Steps To Reproduce
This example code raises following error message.
Expected Behavior
I think that "ImpossibleBQM: No penalty model can be build for constraint xxx." should be raised as written in dwavebinarycsp/compilers/stitcher.py line 195, though the example above raised AttributeError.
Environment
Additional Context
In my understanding, this issue may be related to following files:
Original Implementation:
pm.get_penalty_model(spec) on "stitch" line 182 raises pm.ImpossiblePenaltyModel if the calculation is fault.
Many such cases are caught by try-except on line 183 and continued, so these are caught by else block on line 193 and line 195 raises ImpossibleBQM Error finally.
Problem:
If the max_graph_size is larger than 8 (max_graph_size=9 on my code example),
the graph instance G in "stitch" line 173 becomes larger than 8.
It seems that this max_graph_size isn't inputted into max_decision parameter on "generate_bqm" appropriately.
And especially if max_graph_size is larger than 8, this unexpected problem occurs.
On "get_penalty_model" line 56-60, no input parameter is assigned for max_decision for "generate_bqm".
This lead to the ValueError on "generate_bqm" line 111 because len(decision)=9 is larger than max_decision=8 (8 is default value on generate_bqm).
Question:
I wonder whether this behavior is bug or not...
I would appreciate it if you would give me some advice.
