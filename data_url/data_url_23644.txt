PR #899 breaks writing a 2D dataset with setpoints arrays. We create a 2D dataset manually. The format is
All values of .last_saved_idx are None. We then write to this dataset using a double for loop:
This generates a warning format.py here: https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/data/format.py#L220
After the first  alldata.store((ix,), {'VP2': x}) with ix=0 we have alldata.VP1.last_saved_index equal to 3999. How can we prevent this warning? Are can we change the warning in a specific type we we can ignore it?
@jenshnielsen
@peendebak Does it break or just generate a warning?
But this warning exactly means that after the first call to store the data set thinks that up to index 3999 has been written to file but the file does not in fact exist. It seems to me that is a hint that something is wrong and we should handle that
@jenshnielsen It only generates a warning. The example code that I posted seems like a valid way to use the dataset, so I think the warning should be removed or the formatter improved.
@peendebak Could you provide a complete example of what you are doing because I can't reproduce the issue with the code below
@peendebak can you still reproduce this with the correct init code?
Closing due to lack of response. It seems most likely that the dataset was used incorrectly but without a minimal example there is no way to tell
