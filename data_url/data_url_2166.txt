Devices can now be found in https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/google/devices/known_devices.py
Sycamore and Sqrt_iswap gate sets can be found here:
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/google/gate_sets.py#L34
Optimizers can be found here:
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/google/optimizers/optimize_for_sycamore.py#L76
These should all be accessible at the cirq.google namespace.
Documentation is newly committed at:
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/docs/google/devices.md
It should appear on readthedocs after the next documentation build.
Closing this ticket.
