mesolve should be able to take arbitrary times as the tlist input, but it seems to give wrong results if tlist is not linear. For e.g. a quadratic spacing of the times, the decay of a cavity field seems to be inhibited - including more time steps even leads to less decay!
The sample code below produces this graph:

Black is for linspace times, red for quadratic times, and blue for a linspace with every 6th element removed. I guess all curves should follow the black one.
Yikes - it's already been fixed!
That will teach me to pull the latest version before filing an issue (＞＜)
Hi Jonas. Thanks for the bug report! Yes, this should be fixed already. It was only a few days we fixed this bug, so no wonder you hadn't seen it.
Hi Robert. Yes, I saw that, but still annoying - I could have saved an hour this morning if I had updated beforehand :)
