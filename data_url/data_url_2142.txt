The following error looks weird to me.
Because we provide the following iterator property of Moment:
Is it ok to add subscriptability into Moment?
It behaves like a python set. There's no "order" to the operations in a moment, per se. You could also imagine having indexing work by qubit (so it behaves like a dict) rather than by op index
Internally Moment stores its operations as a tuple. If we only need setlike behavior then we should change it to a set.
xref #1913
I see then it is a set, and behaviors as intended. Thanks.
