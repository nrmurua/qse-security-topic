I was trying to go through the steps of git integration on windows. I've done the following,
I tried running artiq_master -g from /c/Anaconda3/artiq_test/ and I get an error message saying Python has stopped working.
I should add that I had installed git bash to put in the git commands.
Probably pygit2 crashing when interfacing with libgit.
This is sufficient to cause the crash:
The crash happens in msvcr120.dll called by git2.dll.
What's the exact backtrace?
I don't know, visual studio DRM bullshit prevents me from seeing it.
To make VS work, set the date to Feb 1.
This is how it crashes:

Looks like a libgit2 bug...
I suppose enabling debugging symbols in libgit2 would give more info.
It was an ABI mismatch; libssh2, libgit2 and pygit2 were built with VC12 but at some point conda upgraded Python to VC14 (or something like this).
It is fixed now. Note that I ripped out openssl from libssh2 because openssl is built with old VC, no idea whether this materially affects ARTIQ.
Other conda packages seem to tie down the msvc_runtime abi of their python.
I think it does something mostly right when Python is a dependency but in our case it isn't, and CMake needs explicit specification of the toolset.
pygit2 should have python as a dependency, right?
I guess.
