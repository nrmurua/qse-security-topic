Consider any linearly coupled circuit, eg

When using optimization levels 0 or 1 (the default) on a system where the qubit numbering is not left-to-right ,e.g. any 16, 27, or 65Q system, the circuit cannot be mapped without adding swaps:

Optimization levels 2 and 3 work as expected, and map the circuit without swaps.
No added swaps if the system topology supports it.
I think this is fixed with the VF2 mapper layout finder.
It does fix it for level 1, but we don't enable VF2Layout on optimization_level=0 because the typical expectation for that is you just want the trivial layout (it doesn't even use DenseLayout by default).
