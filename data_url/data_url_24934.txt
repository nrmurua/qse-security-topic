The user is allowed to do the following: create an object of type FluxQubit with a set of given parameters,   myqubit = FluxQubit(parameters...).
These parameters may later be changed as follows:  myqubit.ECJ1 = 2.3.
If I am not mistaken, that change will, however, not trigger another call to _define_parameters , _define_capacitance_matrix and _define_charging_energy_matrix. So there will be internal conflict between new and old parameters, leading to wrong results.
There are several possible solutions, some not very elegant and to be avoided. (I'm surprised that this comes up for the flux qubit, but could entirely be avoided by zero-pi.)
