I've already sent this in mail to Alex, but he requested that I post it as well.
I just got rid of all my changes, did a fresh pull and still get the following:
Here is the explanation. Should be easy to fix.
Thanks @dbwz8 - I've coerced the Windows behavior and replicated this error by adding to the first cell of the example notebook:
@akhmerov thanks for the link - should be an easy fix indeed.
@dbwz8 Good point - all our measurement computers run Windows so in fact that should be the primary OS we test on.
Of course Windows has a disadvantage that it will never be able to run Jupyterhub, and also I'm not sure how easy it is to securely publish a Jupyter single user server running on windows. @guenp did you try/succeed?
@dbwz8 can you pull and try it again now? qdev-dk-archive@c866552 (no lambdas or closures) and qdev-dk-archive@36c0dbe (no functions or classes in the interpreter session) solve it for me using 'spawn' on my mac.
In general it's nice to keep definition code out of the notebook but for simple examples it's a bit annoying that they can't be self-contained... it's also annoying that with spawn any errors in the extra process only show up in the terminal where you're running jupyter, in the actual notebook it's a silent failure. I'll poke around a bit and see if there's a way to get them pushed into the notebook.
