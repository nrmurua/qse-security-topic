I want to use tfq.layers.NoisyPQC to construct a noisy quantum circuit, the tfq version is 0.6.1, but there is a 'Circuit' object has no attribute' depolarize' error when using cirq.depolarize.
I want to know which version of cirq can solve this error and match tfq?
TFQ 0.6.1 has cirq requirements
You can see successful usage of depolarizing noise in: https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/noise
