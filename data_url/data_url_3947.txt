currenty barrier() expects a list of qubits. For surface-7, when we have to add a barrier for all the 7 qubits, we have to mention all the 7-qubits. On the same lines, for surface-17, all the 17 qubits would be required as an argument.
A simple solution to make a barrier for all the qubits while being surface agnostic would be add the support for barrier_all().
@jvansomeren this is what i did on https://github.com/QE-Lab/OpenQL/tree/enh/barrier_all-225 branch.
