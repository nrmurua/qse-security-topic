Cell number 17 of the following tutorial
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/circuits_advanced/04_transpiler_passes_and_passmanager.ipynb
Throws some nasty errors
Run this notebook in a jupyter notebook (e.g. via anaconda)
cell number 17:
from qiskit.converters import circuit_to_dag
from qiskit.tools.visualization import dag_drawer
dag = circuit_to_dag(circ)
dag_drawer(dag)
the last statement throws an error:

I get the same error when running the above (and the code that it prereqs) in a python shell, so not notebook or anaconda specific, at least not directly.
should work without error
instructions on how to get this work. I have a feeling this is a setup error of some sort, e.g. I did not have graphviz installed which I installed using pip install graphviz resulting in graphviz 0.19.1 being installed.
Looks similar to: Qiskit/qiskit#3099. I cannot reproduce the issue with qiskit.terra 0.19.1. The tutorial runs correctly.
Was there a filename present?
I just re-ran the tutorial with the following Version Info, so I can only presume that some other library is not at the right level.
I can reproduct the error with even the simplest circuit:
what are the versions of pydot and graphviz that you are using @iuliazidaru
the pydot library tries t call graphviz with an argument of "dot"
resulting in the following

I have:
pydot                   1.4.2
graphviz                0.19.1
You probably do not have graphviz installed. Graphviz is not a python program it's a standalone application (written in C) that can't be installed via pip or imported via python (the graphviz package on pypi that gets installed with pip install graphviz is a python binding library and not actually graphviz). The dag drawer is calling out to that external program to generate the visualization and the error you're hitting is because the graphviz executable can't be found. You can find instructions on how to install it here: https://www.graphviz.org/download/ for your particular platform.
FWIW,  this requirement is documented in the function documentation: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.visualization.dag_drawer.html
oh that's embarrassing, you're absolutely right, I installed it with brew and now things are working. Closing this now.
