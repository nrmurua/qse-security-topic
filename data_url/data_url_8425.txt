I'm hitting the limit of ints in python, which causes troubles with large ket vectors.
Minimal example (I can go up to size 16 before it crashes):
Returns:
Similar code works fine in MS LiQui|> using the same workstation so my hardware should be able to support this state size. What is the current ket size limit that is officially supported in qutip? 16?
There is no official size limit.  The code probably just needs int64 support.
I spent some time looking into patching this last night, but it seems like it would require a complete overhaul of many parts of the code so not an easy fix unfortunately. Perhaps this is something to put on the todo/request list, because without this, most ML QIP research that I've been looking at would not be implementable (need around 10-20 qubits, just a 2 qubit QRAM already requires 11 working qubits).
From 4.4.0, ptrace works up to 31Qbit
