For example, if i create a circuit including cirq.X ** a/2 where a is a sympy symbol, op_serializer.py fails in the _check_value method with the following error:
ValueError: Expected type convertible to float but was <class 'sympy.core.mul.Mul'>
@Strilanc do you know if not supporting this is intentional, or has it just never been added?
@dabacon any thoughts on this? I figure it might have something to do with what you guys want to support on the engine side of things.
If your circuits have formulas you need to flatten them.  See https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/study/flatten_expressions.py.
We can consider making this automatic by default, but we need to be careful with too much automagic that people don't understand.

This now uses the func arg language construction for a small subset of symbolic expressions.
