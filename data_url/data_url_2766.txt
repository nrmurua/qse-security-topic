After some investigation, I have tracked this down to what appears to be a bug in the interaction between multiprocessing and numpy. The fault is that, in cirq/google/sim/mem_manager.py, the shape of an 2d array is lost when the first index has length 1.
The simplest way to repro the bug is to modify the body of create_array to check that what went in actually came out:
and modify _create_array to print out what is stored:
and modify _get_array to print out what is retrieved:
At which point you will get this output when running pytest cirq/google/sim/xmon_stepper_test.py -v --maxfail=1:
Note that the addresses differ.
@dabacon Any idea why this would be happening?
I have reported this issue on the numpy repository: numpy/numpy#11636
In the meantime, we'll work around the issue by manually tracking the shape: #773
