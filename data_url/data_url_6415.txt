Swap and CNOT variants were recently found to be bugged. The matrix multiplication versions of these gates have been replaced with length=1 cases of register methods, which pass unit tests and might have comparable or even better performance. Controlled rotation and phase shift gates still rely on the same matrix multiplication approach as CNOT and probably need to be corrected. Either the multiplication approach must be salvaged, or the gates must be given new respective implementations.
Pull request #46 fixes this bug by correcting the matrix multiplication algorithm for controlled and doubly controlled gates.
