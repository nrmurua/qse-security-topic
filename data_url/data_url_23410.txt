@nataliejpg ran into an issue trying to debug this code:
Which throws an error:
The root cause is that the getattr call yields a Parameter, not a parameter value, so needs to be evaluated right away:
But because the np.multiply call actually succeeded (burying the Parameter in a new DeferredOperations object), this was tricky to debug.
Had Parameter not been a DeferredOperations at all, the error would have happened in np.multiply, with something like:
Which is a lot easier to tie back to the root cause. Perhaps we can have DeferredOperations override __getattr__ to point back to its roots with the error message, something like:
