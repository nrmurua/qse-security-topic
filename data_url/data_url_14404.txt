None of the gates in the Circuit Library have any code examples that show how to add them to a circuit and that the matrix is the one advertised. I believe adding these examples could help users get a better understanding of how to deal with gates.
For example, for the XGate page, I suggest adding to the docstring something like:
That way not only we get as output both the circuit symbol and the matrix representation of each gate instead of only getting the circuit symbol drawn, but users also get a quick overview on how to add that particular gate.
Personally I think this is fairly obvious since now we have a sentence in each gate documentation that says "this can be added with QuantumCircuit.some_method" ðŸ˜„ However if the circuit library code example that you linked first doesn't show any example, we certainly should add one!
However not all gates have specific methods like the C3XGate. And there aren't any examples in the method pages I linked to either.
I also thought it was nicer to show the users that the matrices effectively work as told, ie, that the matrix representation we show in the docstring is right.
How to generally add a gate is explained in the circuit library docs, isn't it? ðŸ™‚

I also thought it was nicer to show the users that the matrices effectively work as told, ie, that the matrix representation we show in the docstring is right.
I'm worried the pages are a bit crowded and that's not such an essential information -- hopefully users can rely that Qiskit implements gates correctly (that's what we have the unittests for, right?) ðŸ˜‰ If we add this, then I think a short and plain code example (without showing the matrix) would be better.
