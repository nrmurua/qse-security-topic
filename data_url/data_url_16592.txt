qiskit.quantum_info.Operator(QuantumCircuit) seems to have a memory leak.
qiskit.quantum_info.Operator(ndarray) does not have this issue.
I ran the following code and saw that RSS and DATA increase.
Code:
https://gist.github.com/t-imamichi/c0405d57e61b3393b773d182ec7777ac
Output:
No increase of RSS and DATA.
No idea.
This is caused by https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/1abc489/qiskit/converters/circuit_to_instruction.py#L94 , which automatically registers converted circuits in the equivalence library. I've got a branch that makes this behavior opt-in (because it causes other problems) that will resolve this.
