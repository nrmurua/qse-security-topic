Currently, openfermion-cirq has to point at this github repository in order to use in-development features of openfermion during development of openfermion-cirq. This causes a bunch of problems w.r.t. packaging, since github dependencies aren't valid dependencies that can be uploaded to pypi or used by setup.py. I recently started making development releases for cirq (scripts are here, example package here) and it immediately solved the analogous problem between cirq and openfermion-cirq. You just depend on cirq~=0.4.0.dev and it grabs the latest dev release of 0.4.0, and this is a valid version that works with pypi and setup.py.
We should get the same thing working in openfermion.
