Quirk uses floating point textures when simulating circuits. If binding a floating point texture to a framebuffer doesn't work, Quirk can't simulate circuits.
It's technically possible for me to fix this limitation, but it would require rewriting every gate's shader to manually pack/unpack its outputs/inputs into/from a byte texture. Which would be a huge hassle, and would affect performance.
Currently I don't plan to fix this issue. If you feel differently, this is the place to complain about it.
Note: there is a bug in firefox mobile that causes this issue even if support for WEBGL_color_buffer_float is present.
Here is the code Quirk uses to detect if this issue is present:
