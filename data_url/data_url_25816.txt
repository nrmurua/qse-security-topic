When clicking on a sublattice on the Covalent UI, instead of showing the code definition of the sublattice, it shows the web app code. Screenshot below:

It no longer shows the app code, but instead shows:
# root was not inspectable
which seems to be due to an exception inside get_serialized_function_str.
This is the value for function_string on the node as returned by the results service, so this probably happens somewhere during results processing and dispatch.

Reopening as #388.
