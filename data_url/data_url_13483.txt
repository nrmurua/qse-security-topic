Running make test and make test-all locally on my computer leads to pytest not recognizing argument -n. Both have this argument in [their code (https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/blob/3b3d8865eaa6e533a0c66c31c4d51dc13414bdf7/Makefile#L63).
Curiously enough, when these tests are run in a PR workflow there's no error message. I tried to test one of my branches on my fork of the main repo and these checks passed even when test.yml is supposed to run the same test.
Run make test and make test-all locally.
I have verified I have the latest version of pytest. When I used pytest --help, the arguments listed did not have any -n argument but there's a -nf (new file first argument).
I guess a better question would be, what is the expected behavior of -n in the two arguments listed above ?
It was pointed by @rmlarose that I do not have all the dev_requirements installed. Closing this because this suggestion fixed it.
