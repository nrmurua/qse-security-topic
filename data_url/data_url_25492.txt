Decsription
Placeholder to update the demo website with the latest version on /develop.
Tentatively planned for Aug 16th
Please add your planning poker estimate with ZenHub @Prasy12
@wjcunningham7 @santoshkumarradha The current version of demo website has the all the up to date versions except only a couple of UI fixes.
Since there is a lot of code structural changes we are looking at making sure that the demo website branch aligns with the current develop branch which might take a bit more time than usual. We will look at definitely updating everything before your original release.
