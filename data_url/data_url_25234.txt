By default, the working directory for a local or Dask-executed Lattice is the Python package folder for the Covalent UI (e.g. ~/anaconda3/envs/covalent/lib/python3.9/site-packages/covalent_ui). This is problematic for several reasons, in part because this is not an expected location for the user. Also, the filesystem where the Python package is installed may not always be the fastest for large file I/O that might happen at runtime.
Note: I brought this up in #1592 but now have made a standalone issue for it.
The job.txt files should not be written in the ...covalent/lib/python3.9/site-packages/covalent_ui path, but it is. This is just a demo of the issue, not an actual use case. Also, the file from each electron overwrite one another (but that problem is discussed in #1592).
I can verify this issue.
This is basically happening because the FastAPI app is being served from covalent_ui.
In most other executors, we use containerization so this problem wouldn't arise -- it should be isolated to Local and Dask executors.  We could leverage something existing like dispatcher.results_dir although files there really shouldn't be touched by the user.  It might be appropriate to introduce a new workdir directory for these two executors as suggested by @arosen93.  Any comments on UX @santoshkumarradha?
@wjcunningham7 Can I work on this perhaps? Your thoughts resonate with me, dispatcher.results_dir basically contains many .pkl and .log files, which should ideally be separate from user intended output.
While I can't speak for @wjcunningham7 of course, I know that I would certainly appreciate your help on this one :) Defining a wokrdir variable for the local executors (and having the default be in a more logical place) is a necessary pre-requisite for me to address #1628.
