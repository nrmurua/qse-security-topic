Something like
There are a few problems with this though:
I see why using a flag would be annoying, but can you say something about the advantages of setting this at invocation versus some attribute you can set later?
@JoelPasvolsky , I am not sure I understand, can you make a quick pseudo code snippet like above?
Something like this:
Part of the reason is that we generally consider the attributes of the dimod Samplers to be 'static', because otherwise you might get things like
(the exception is the failover flag, which we explicitly warn about)
That said, a method like DWaveSampler.change_coordinates could definitely also exist, if it came with appropriate documentation.
Okay, thanks, I saw that as the user needing to be responsible for being consistent in using a coordinate scheme rather than breaking the sampler, but it is safer to use separate ones like sampler = FixedEmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler(coordinates=True), embedding) and sampler_nice = FixedEmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler(nice_coordinates=True), nice_embedding)
