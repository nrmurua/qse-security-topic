Just merged master and ran check.sh and it is failing due to tensorflow
I think the fix is to add tensorflow to dev_tools/conf/apt-list-dev-tools.txt, or alternatively to modify the test script to pip install -r cirq/contrib/contrib-requirements.txt
Should try to keep in line with travis, so I guess second fix is correct one?
I agree
