User should be Able to set the Loop Iterations Count of the Target Program. By Default Programs run within an Infinite Loop, an Optional 'Iterations' Field can allow the User to set a Specific Iterations Count.
In the Current state, the Hardware Averaging Parameter which can be set through the CBox Driver acts on the Measurement Unit and Does not Allow to set the Number of Runs of the Actual Program which Loop Indefinitely.
The compiler Should be Able to set the Loop Iterations Count, this is Particularly Useful to Drive the Measurement Unit of the Spin Qubit which does not Average Measurements by Default or to Drive other External Instruments.
Loop Iterations Setting has been Implemented in Commit f9b40aa
The Output Code has been Tested on the CBox and the Exact Iterations Count has been Checked on the Scope.
