On my system of ubuntu 22.04 with python 3.10, it's not possible to poetry install pyquil. Doing so leads to an error. This appears to be true for python 3.10, 3.11.
If useful, provide a numbered list of the steps that result in the error.
Otherwise, just fill out the "Code Snippet" and "Error Output" sections below.
Use the following Dockerfile to reproduce the issue:
To build:
I don't understand why numpy and scipy have problems installing on higher versions of python. Maybe there is a way to make that work.
If not, we upgrade the versions of numpy and scipy in the lockfile. However, doing so requires dropping support for older versions of python
Finally, we can use poetry's multiple constraints dependencies:
This was fixed by the 4.0 release
