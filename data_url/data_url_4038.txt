The QASM Syntax Allows Specifying Binary-Controlled Operations, however Currently, the Binary-Controlled Operations Specification in the Configuration File does not Indicate whether an Operation is Binary-Controlled for All Backends. Consequently, this Translate into Invalid QASM.
For Instance, in the CC-Light Configuration File, the Binary-Control is Indicated as a CC-Light Backend-Specific Attribute :
This Can be Solved by Adding a Generic Attribute which Indicates that the Operation is Binary-Controlled when needed, this will Allow correct QASM Generation and Code Simulation.
For now, the QASM Validity Check has been Removed from the Fast Feedback Tests because it will Fail Automatically.
