It seems that the latest release of numpy (version 1.22.0, released on 31/12/2021) breaks the compatibility with qutip, right on import. Specifically, I'm seeing this error:
I've found that downgrading numpy to version 1.21.5 fixes this, so for now I will enforce this in requirements.txt and in setup.py. I will do this as an hotfix and make a new release, to make sure new pulser users are not affected.
