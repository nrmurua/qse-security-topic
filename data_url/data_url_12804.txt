As of #290, the katas now use a version of IQ# that includes the enhancements from microsoft/iqsharp#81. By calling the WithJupyterDisplay extension method at simulator creation time, the %kata magic can thus be extended with support for this new functionality.
I can have a look at this. To implement correctly there is an open issue in the IQSharp project which probably needs to be solved first.
This should be addressed in the next release following #344. I'll close this issue for now, and reopen if it turns out more work is needed. Thank you @cgranade for flagging this and @vivanwin for working on this!
