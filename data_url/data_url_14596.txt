In tutorials/circuits_advanced/06_building_pulse_schedules.ipynb (see here) add a new section titled "Schedules with Parameters".
In this section, answer these questions for your reader:
In tutorials/circuits_advanced/05_pulse_gates.html (see here) add a new section titled "Pulse Gates with parameterized Schedules"
Now that you've explained how to create Schedules with Parameters, we should answer "How does this work with Pulse gates"? There are some examples already for how to add a Pulse gate where the gate has parameters, but none of the examples have parameterized schedules. I will leave the explanation to the implementer, but to get you started, I'll write up an example which you may want to use in this section. Play around with this to make sure you understand how it is working.

Note that the parameter drive_amp is the same object shared between the circuit and schedule. Is this required? What happens if they're not the same?
Also take care to notice that parameters are referenced by object, so even if you instantiate two different parameters with the same name, they won't be treated as the same parameter. (I.e., I can create a = Parameter('test') and b = Parameter('test'), but if I use a in my circuit, and try to execute assign_parameters({b: val}), this will have no effect.)
Dear @lcapelluto ,
can I have a look at this?
