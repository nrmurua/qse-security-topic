The links to the possible cirq backends in the tfq.layers documentation yield a 404 error, for example see documentation for the Sample layer.
This is a known issue. Pretty sure it has to do with @yashk2810 working with other docs ?
This should have been fixed last week but my jobs failed due to a TFP issue.
It'll get fixed today or tomorrow.
Fixed.
