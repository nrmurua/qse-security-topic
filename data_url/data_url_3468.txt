Hi, @vbatista73. It looks like you're using an old version of pyQuil.
We recently released the Forest SDK which updated pyQuil to version 2, and at the same time deprecated pyQuil version 1. This means at lot of stuff from pyQuil 1 will no longer work -- namely, use of QVMConnection is different now.
Please see the docs on migrating to pyQuil 2.0.
