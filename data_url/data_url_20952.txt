Really nice collection of things that should be linked to, if there is not enough physical room on the top of the website for this I think it would make sense to have
I also think wallet / explorer should be near each other, I liked how it used to be a corner menu item. Thanks for putting in the time to write this @PQAdvantage. There definitely should be a link to an exchange and a link to a comprehensive page for potential partners
Thanks, I concur re concerns about space.  I should add I like the links for 'Academia' that were added, but I think maybe they should be rolled into a broader dropdown.  Also, I think potential partners is so important that it may make sense for 'Partners' to be a top level drop down with links to contact email, comprehensive page with info about QRL, anything else that would be potentially attractive.
Chaps these are great points for the website maintainers but this is the QRL node repo: could you please direct the discussion to https://github.com/theQRL/theqrl.org/issues ?
Thanks!
