Hi
Is it possible to have a feature number higher than 3 for the svminput? In the qsvm_kernel_classification notebook it says "we support feature_dim 2 or 3", i passed n higher than 3 in my own code with some random dataset and it seems to be fine. Is this constraint only because of data visualisation or svminput just can't have more than 3 data dimension?
This is from a while ago, and no response from @pistoia.  If @XBLDev still has some issues, please reopen.
