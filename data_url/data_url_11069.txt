In each page of documentation for the modules, at the bottom of the page (here, for example: http://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/qaoa.html#source-code-docs), only the headings for the Source Code Docs show up, but no code/documentation.
Issue is this: http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#my-project-isn-t-building-with-autodoc
I have a branch with a fix named bugfix/55/add_pyquil_doc_dep. Trying to test it on readthedocs now.
Seems to have worked: http://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/pyquil-doc-dep/grover.html#source-code-docs
NB: RTD only picks up new versions if you push a new tag AND trigger a build.
