Github action: actions-ecosystem/action-get-latest-tag@v1
the actions-ecosystem/action-get-latest-tag@v1 action at times yields the latest tag incorrectly (see the upstream issue actions-ecosystem/action-get-latest-tag#13).
For covalent, this mean sometime the changelog.yml get the incorrect latest git tag that causes further issues downstream when pushing the changes to main.
Happens occasionally, when merging a PR into develop that subsequently causes a merge to master
push_to_master step must fail
Do not use the get-latest-tag@v1 action instead revert to using the git command git describe --abbrev=0
git describe will have the same problem as action-get-latest-tag, in fact all the action does is git describe
https://github.com/actions-ecosystem/action-get-latest-tag/blob/b7c32daec3395a9616f88548363a42652b22d435/entrypoint.sh#L16
The right way to do this is to use the /tags API
https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#list-repository-tags
@scottwn would this work
instead of curl, use request-action, like this

We may be able to stick with git describe
Another possible solution is to check for inequality rather than equality, so only do the push to master if the version is greater than, rather than not equal to
you can use compare-version to check the inequality https://www.npmjs.com/package/dpkg-compare-versions
