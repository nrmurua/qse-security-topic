As detailed in #1993, it is possible to quickly write code for computing the depth, num_tensor_factors etc, of a QuantumCircuit that is one to two orders of magnitude faster than the equivalent calls to the DAG.  These timings do not include circuit -> DAG conversion time, and as such indicate that many common DAG operations are markedly slow.
I think we good bow.
