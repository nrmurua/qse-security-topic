If the Quick libraries are already installed, they are being deleted when the configure script is executed. This should not happen. Old libraries should be overwritten only when new ones are installed during make install or deleted during an action like make uninstall, not by the configure script.
@vwcruzeiro I have failed to reproduce this issue. In fact, I am not deleting any install/build directories from the configure script: https://github.com/merzlab/QUICK/blob/master/configure.
It is probably the symbolic links in $AMBERHOME/lib that are being removed then. Could you please check? Thank you!
I have removed symlink creation from Makefile. Instead, we are moving the libraries into amber/lib. Please check PR #42.
@vwcruzeiro Is this issue resolved?
Yes, issue is resolved in the current master branch.
