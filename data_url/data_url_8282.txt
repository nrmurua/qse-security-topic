There are two very different types of contributors that can help with QuTiP development:
I would advocate to add two new labels for issues, e.g., "code" and "physics".
All open issues and PRs have now been labeled with the code and physics labels, some of them with both. I would add in the contributing to QuTiP guidelines something about this for new issues and PRs.
Added a comment about this in the Wiki, https://github.com/qutip/qutip/wiki.
