Allow formatting of custom gate names in circuit diagrams. The names of custom gates are shown as plain text. It would be nice to format these as latex or html.
For example the following code generates a circuit diagram with a custom gate
The custom gate is labelled as X_t, but I want the name to be formatted as an X with subscript t. The custom gate name is transformed by utf8tolatex, but it is escaping the _.
Also variations as qc.append(Gate(name=r'$X_t$', num_qubits=1, params=[]), [0]) do not work.
Note: here is also a discussion on stack exchange on this: https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/8329/how-to-plot-custom-gate-labels-in-qiskit
