I have been spending quite a bit of time in sesolve.py and mesolve.py recently. I have noticed a few things that could potentially be tidied up.
Sorry if this seems like Nero fiddling while Rome burns. Just recording this as a todo mainly.
I will try to look at the bigger issues very soon
Checking if this got already solved by @Ericgig refactoring of stochastic solvers and sesolve.
Everything mentioned in this PR looks solved with the merging of QobjEvo, and a few other bits and bobs changes to sesolve and mesolve.  At any rate, anything that isn't covered is obsoleted by #1461 and #1462 (and one further PR based on #1409).
