If a collection of Quil instructions merely read from a mutual classical memory resource, they don't really block each other: these reads all commute, and can even be done "simultaneously". By contrast, writes neither commute with each other nor with reads. resource-abstraction could be modified to make use of this observation, to more aggressively schedule read-only events earlier in time.
