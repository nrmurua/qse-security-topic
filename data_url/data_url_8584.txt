The six library is used for Python 2.x and 3.x compatibility tricks. It failed to import during Travis tests. Should we make this library available in Travis tests?
Is six used in qutip now? If so then go ahead and add it as a dependency, I'd say. Personally I don't like use six, and prefer to write idiomatic Python 3 code that also work for Python 2, but I don't see any problems with anyone else using it. It is a pretty standard dependency for Python 2 and 3 compatibility needs.
Yes, I had used it to check whether a variable was a string type. I saw it suggested somewhere. It has only just come up as I am adding (long overdue) tests for the control modules.  I have now replaced the six based method with something else, but I think the six.string_types method was more elegant.
This is now closed.
