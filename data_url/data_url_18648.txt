ANON-GATE is OK to take a matrix, but it should build a simple-gate out of that argument. It's currently making invalid GATE-APPLICATIONS, at least with respect to the QVM & co.
This change would probably require changing guts around the compiler, but it shouldn't be hard since gate-matrix allows you to get what you want at any time.
