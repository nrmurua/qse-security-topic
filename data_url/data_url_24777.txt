While in theory it is possible to use python object from MATLAB, these cannot be imported if the corresponding module file imports matlab.engine as is the case in the PulseControlInterface which needs to access pulse_controls plsreg method.
Thus, it is currently not possible to use the qc-toolkit from inside MATLAB.
Task: Do some research and test, if something can be done about this.
Belongs to issue #64
The error is an endless recursion while our python module and matlab.engine include themselves circulary. This problem seems to be caused in the matlabengineforpython3_4 module imported by matlab.engine and is thus outside our control.
