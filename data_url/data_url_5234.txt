You can start the QVM with a persistent wavefunction using the shared memory command line arguments, but it would be nicer if this could happen on a request-by-request basis.

I think this is an item worth implementing soon, especially given @kilimanjaro's work to allow for-effect computations, and my work on custom allocators. My inclination is to have something like the following:
The biggest challenge is going to make sure we don't spaghettify the code more. There's an outstanding issue #40 which generically touches on this. Maybe we can do this surgery carefully, cleaning up previous mistakes.
(I think one way to start this is to get rid of passing around this extraneous noise model information all over the place. But maybe that's too hard for now. Perhaps we do away with Kraus operators in Quil files, but that's for another issue.)
