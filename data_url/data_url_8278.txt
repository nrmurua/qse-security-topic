The current version of clebsch gives wildly incorrect results for high j, because it relies on the precise cancellation of extremely large quantities. This leads to incorrect answers for anything that depends on this function, such as the spin Wigner function for Rydberg atoms.
Example of problem:
Is it possible to implement one of the many higher-precision methods to compute Clebsch-Gordan coefficients? If that would be slower, is it possible to add a flag to toggle between the methods?
