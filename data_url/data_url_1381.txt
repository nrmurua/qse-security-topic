Can such a project even be created/implemented in Ruby so that the innovative idea and project will not just be limited to just one community of interest ?
Please try to implement even a ruby version as there is also a big community of rubyists who don't wanna be devoid of it .
P0 - this should land no later than a month
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion
Hey @Ash-the-practical-programmer,
Thanks for this question.
After a quick search of quantum programming frameworks in Ruby, i haven't been able to find anything of note. This might be because Ruby isn't big into scientific computing like Python is.  Are there easy ways to interoperate with Python code in Ruby?
Hey again @Ash-the-practical-programmer. We might be able to do this by having quantum_ruby export QASM and use Cirq's QASM importer to consume the generated QASM.  Maybe there is a way to transpile cirq-web to Ruby. Since i don't know Ruby, I've assigned this issue to you. Let me know what you find.
@Ash-the-practical-programmer Please re-open this issue once you confirm that you are looking into this.
