When given a QuadraticProgram instances to solve as an input the RecursiveMinimumEigenOptimizer.solve function should return an object with two attributes. the x attribute represents a bit string and the fval attribute represents the output value of the obective function of the QuadraticProgram when given x as an input value.
However, when trying the algorithm on a QuadraticProgram representing the MAX-CUT problem I sometimes receive an output where the value of fval does not correspond to the value of the objective function at x. An example is provided below.
The following python snippet reproduces the issue:
Here is the output:
For the above example, I believe the fval value returned by RecursiveMinimumEigenOptimizer should be 4. Which is the value of putting x=[1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0] back into the objective function.
A cursory look suggests that the issue might be because RecursiveMinimumEigenOptimizer sets fval = result.fval where result.fval represents the value calculated by the cutoff optimiser on the reduced problem. However, having read the paper available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.08980.pdf it seems like this value does not correspond with the value of the objective function matching the bitstring x returned by the recursive QAOA algorithm.
@AminKaramlou I confirm this behavior in Qiskit 0.19.0. I have run the problem you posted and got 9 correct fval values out of 20 iterations. Basically the issue is floating, sometimes the answer is correct, sometimes not.
But when I upgraded to Qiskit 0.20.0 everything becomes fine and I've got all 20 answers correct. Could you please upgrade the Qiskit version?
@adekusar-drl thanks for getting back to me. I can confirm that after upgrading the Qiskit version the fval values and the bitstrings returned by the algorithm correspond.
@AminKaramlou good to hear this! If you don't mind I will close the issue, or you can do this yourself.
Hi @AminKaramlou, @adekusar-drl
How we can plot the histogram of rqaoa after solving the qubo problem.? Because Recursivemin eigensolver does not have such attribute histogram..
