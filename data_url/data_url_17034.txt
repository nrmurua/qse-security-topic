If a filename without extension is passed to the function dag_drawer, this line reports two errors:
This is confusing because the second error thrown by Qiskit is not the cause of the problem.
Try dag_drawer(dag, filename='abc')
Make the error catching better.
We could either catch this error by reading and filtering the error message, or we could check the existence of the filename's extension, and provide a default one.
Hi @we-taper , thanks for reporting, and I agree the conflicting error messages are confusing. It looks like the error catching around https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/d090eca91dc1afdb68f563885c4ccf13b31de20e/qiskit/visualization/dag_visualization.py#L91 could be refined to either inspect the raised nxpd.pydot.InvocationException to try to determine the cause of the error, or at least include the generated stderr in the VisualizationError that's raised by qiskit.
Newcomer here, recently started learning QisKit. Would not mind taking a crack at this.
go for it @Rajan117! I've assigned to you, let us know if you have any questions
Thanks.
I am using this code to reproduce the error.
`from qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.dagcircuit import DAGCircuit
from qiskit.converters import circuit_to_dag
from qiskit.visualization import dag_drawer
q = QuantumRegister(3, 'q')
c = ClassicalRegister(3, 'c')
circ = QuantumCircuit(q, c)
circ.h(q[0])
circ.cx(q[0], q[1])
circ.measure(q[0], c[0])
circ.rz(0.5, q[1]).c_if(c, 2)
dag = circuit_to_dag(circ)
dag_drawer(dag, filename='abc')`
But I instead get this error.

I assume I have done something wrong in setting up my test environment but unsure how, followed the official QisKit YouTube guide.
I will be honest, I have had a lot of issues in setting up test environments to attempt fixing issues. Is there an easy way to do it?

It's best to follow the steps outlined here for the best way to set up your environment (including pip install -e .)
Thanks! Will give this another go over the weekend then :)
unassigning due to lack of activity.
I think the message is pretty clear now.
thanks for checking if this is still valid @iuliazidaru! However I think the error is still not very user friendly and it would be good if we could catch it better in the dag_drawer
@javabster Please assign the issue to me.
