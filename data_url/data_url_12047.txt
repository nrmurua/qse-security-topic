This issue points out some places where information (mostly text) is rendered inconsistently between the docs on qiskit.org/documentation and the corresponding Jupyter notebooks which generate the pages.
1 Quadratic Program
2 Converters for Quadratic Programs
3 Minimum Eigen Optimizer
4 Grover Optimizer
5 ADMM Optimizer
6 Max-Cut and Traveling Salesman Problem
7 Vehicle routing
@nonhermitian Who would be the person to work with to figure out why these inconsistencies happen?
Limitations number four in the readme might help.
@nonhermitian How so? There's no math in these lists....
Is there a doc somewhere that outlines how the rendering as RST files works?
Ok, I guess I misunderstood the issues.  Here is a link to the conversion program docs:
https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.1/
In short, Sphinx parsing is much more strict than that allowed in Jupyter notebooks.  This is why you are seeing what you do.
It's worth pointing out the actual rst generation is done using pandoc (at least until spatialaudio/nbsphinx#36 is implemented). Basically nbsphinx runs nbconvert on the notebook to generate a markdown file then runs pandoc on that markdown output to generate restructured text which is what gets passed to sphinx for building the html version. The pandoc conversion is where I expect this is going wrong, there are a lot of edge cases there and pandoc doesn't always know what a renderer is looking for.
Closing as (kind of) solved.  Can reopen if otherwise.

Has this been fixed? Because the documentation is still inconsistent for 6 Max-Cut and Traveling Salesman Problem
