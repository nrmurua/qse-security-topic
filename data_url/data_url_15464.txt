When trying to compile qiskit, six tests fail with the following messsage: "AssertionError: False is not true : The images are different by 10.226851851851848% which is more than the allowed 10.0%"
Try to install Qiskit on NixOS.
The tests should pass.
The tests should not fail based oi images, or the requirement should be relaxed.
