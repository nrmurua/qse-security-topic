need to clean up the order of loading such that all modules are fully loaded before the saved properties are set
fixed by only executing load_setup_attributes at the very end of the startup procedure, and by doing so first for the software_modules and then for hardware_modules. Otherwise, Scope.input1 and 2 will not be able to be set to lockbox inputs, for example. A gotcha remains in the fact that - when the lockbox class is changed and inputs/outputs change their names, the scope input will return to default values since the new lockbox does not have the corresponding input.
