When observing the time evolution of simple spin chains, I encountered an issue with the CSPLayout. In case a circuit is mapped to a device that allows for multiple exact (non swap introducing) mappings of this circuit, the CSPLayout method does not always choose the best solution. It chooses the one which occurs first in its solution process. In such a case it should provide the solution with the least noise. Therefore, I suggest to make CSPLayout noise aware and will try to work on it.
I would suggest to create a new CSPLayoutNoise pass instead of modifying CSPLayout.  CSPLayout is simple and fast. It can be useful in some situations. CSPLayout can be extended with noise awareness. See #5075 (comment)
Given that the linked PR #5075 was closed in favour of using VF2Layout (and subsequently VF2PostLayout) in the preset pass managers, I'll close this issue as stale now.  CSPLayout is no longer used in default pass managers (we use Sabre for almost everything now).
Feel free to re-open if there's more to say about this.
