I was playing around with the CircuitSampler and noticed that sometimes it produces different results, depending on whether a VectorStateFn is used as initial state versus DictStateFn.
This code outputs the following
8.0 is correct, but 32.0 is not. v1 and v2 are the same only when both coeff=1, otherwise they are always different.
I narrowed down the problem to the following reproducible case.
The difference comes from the to_circuit_op() method in VectorStateFn which handles the coeff incorrectly. The following two lines
create the following two objects
The coeff in the first object is incorrect.
It is expected to be 2.8284... like in the second object (2*sqrt(2))
The line csfn = CircuitStateFn.from_vector(self.to_matrix(massive=True)) * self.coeff in the to_circuit_op() method of VectorStateFn should be changed to csfn = CircuitStateFn.from_vector(self.to_matrix(massive=True)) since the to_matrix() method takes care of multiplying by coeff.
Sorry, I forgot a comment on this issue.
Thank you for the report.
I fixed this, as you suggested.
Your advice was very helpful.
