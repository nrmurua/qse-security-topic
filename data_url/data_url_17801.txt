This issue tracks potential changes to the set of schemas. This should reduce the frequency of schema changes and help synchronize all layers of the software stack.
Is there a reason to remove these?

After discussion with @jaygambetta and @dcmckayibm , and part of the standardization effort, it seems the results schema needs to be updated in relation to results.data.unitary and results.data.statevector:
I'm also linking to #1047, as seems to be closely related to this issue.
Why do we need to remove backend_name and backend_version from the qobj schema? In #1279 I'm actually making the simulator backend configurations conform to this.
I am fine keeping it the schema as well.
