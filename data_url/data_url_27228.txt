Dear SIDH Team,
I am sure it must have been devastating to find that your work was broken, given the mountain of effort that must have gone into your submission. I am really sorry this happened to you.
The purpose of the issue is to thank you for your 4th round submission and postscript. I for one would not have seen the issue had you not made this submission.
My side research project is to monitor long term risks to crypto systems. Finding obscure maths definitely falls into this category. My hunch is that over time finding and applying obscure maths will be increasingly easy as LLM's and other forms of AI, combined with proof systems such as LEAN evolve. Yours is a good canary for this type of risk.
Again, sorry for the break - thanks for the publication.
Many thanks,
Philip
