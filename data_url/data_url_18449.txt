would it be reasonable/possible to modify OUTER-INSTRUCTION-LOOP in ALGEBRAICALLY-REDUCE-INSTRUCTIONS to try and detect when it's stuck in an infinite loop? Even just a heuristic check and issuing a warning might be helpful to aid diagnosis in case something similar were to happen again. I guess it would have to be relatively inexpensive check to avoid slowing things down too much.
