Description of the issue
When controlling an operation that has an exponent, the exponent should be drawn on the target qubit in the circuit diagram to clearly convey what's the underlying operation which is being controlled.
However, ControlledOperation's circuit drawing function has multiple bugs. The code snippet to determine the exponent index of a ControlledOperation is given below:
See the example below for more details:
How to reproduce the issue
Expected output of the above circuit should be:
Note that fixing this would be a breaking change for diagrams.
Also, a similar bug exists in QuirkInputRotationOperation, which always draws the exponent on qubit 0 if the underlying operation is not a ControlledOperation and hence operations like CXPowGate, which specify an explicit exponent_qubit_index but are not instances of ControlledOperation will have a wrong output.

Discussed on Cirq Sync:  Let's fix this.
