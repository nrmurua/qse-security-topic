A minimal example:
The definition of MockMeter is
Can we move the toymodel.py into qcodes? Then we could add nosetests for the MockMeter, MockInstrument etc.
This the same issue as before, that model needs to be provided as a kwarg... but ugh, that traceback doesn't help much in figuring that out. I should be able to find a way to give better (and quicker!) error messages about this.
Re: testing - we do test MockInstrument, and I make a bunch of mock instruments very similar to these over the course of testing all the things that use instruments. But what would be cool is to use these instruments as examples for writing and running instrument driver tests - using the DriverTestCase class that @AdriaanRol has already experimented with eg here.
Why not remove model from the constructor, e.g.
This will generate a proper error message.
Should not use mock framework for simulation (moving to insturment)
