In the GDS renderer popup window, have a timer always running in the background that auto-refreshes the view whenever components are added/deleted/renamed or the design is switched out. To optimize the runtime, only account for modified components. The timer essentially does the job of the "Refresh List" button, but keep that button anyways to preserve the users' sense of security.
easier workflow
