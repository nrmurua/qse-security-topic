The save function in covalent/_results_manager/result.py is called for every task. This function calls _write_dispatch_to_python_file, which writes the operations of the dispatch to file. The latter only needs to be done once.
Running a simple workflow with a debug statement in the _write_dispatch_to_python_file will show that this function is called multiple times.
Ideally, _write_dispatch_to_python_file is only called once in a workflow operation.
The save function in covalent/_results_manager/result.py can have a flag (default value set to False), such that only the call to save in _run_planned_workflow in covalent_dispatcher/_core/__init__.py results in _write_dispatch_to_python_file being called.
