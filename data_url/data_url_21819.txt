Hello,
We use a Kasli-tester setup, so including Kasli and Zotino, with a recent commit (16b917b).
The dashboard recognizes the Zotino module from the device database and displays the 32 channels, but their values are never updated (everything is fixed at 0.000%). Everything works well when setting the voltages via a EnvExperiment, as well as reading the voltages via the read_reg() function.
Are other monitoring features e.g
TTL working correctly?
All the TTL are working correctly through both the EnvExperiment and the dashboard.
Did you create a artiq.gateware.rtio.phy.ad53xx_monitor.AD53XXMonitor in the gateware?
