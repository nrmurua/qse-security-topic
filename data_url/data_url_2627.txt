We currently have two tests in qasm_output_test.py that attempt to import qiskit (in order to test that the output QASM is valid) and silently skip if the import fails. We should instead warnings.warn that this is happening.
We should also update pip-list-dev-tools.txt to include a specific version of qiskit, so that these warnings do not occur when running travis builds.
This has been fixed.
