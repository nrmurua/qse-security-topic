I'd follow (and rip out) the heuristics from e.g. https://github.com/joyent/python-manta/blob/master/manta/appdirs.py#L31 maybe even pull in appdirs.
@whitequark @sbourdeauducq ok/comments?
I'm fine with those heuristics, the only thing that worries me is handling cases like the pyon folder or its parent not existing.
