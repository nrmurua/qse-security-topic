Now that we have the StagedPassManager class this gives us flexibility in how we can compose and hook into the transpilation pipeline at specific points. The first piece of this is transpiler stage plugins which is being done in #8305 the other piece which is needed is a way for backends to add additional backend specific passes to the compilation pipeline. The idea being some passes are hardware specific and having a mechanism for a backend to provide it's own PassManager that will be run at fixed points in the compilation pipeline will enable backend authors to implement these hardware specific passes in a standardized way and when the compilation target is that backend it will run the pass manager at the appropriate point in the compilation.
