I try to build liboqs for Fedora (see https://github.com/beldmit/liboqs-spec as a draft spec) and see several .cmake files as a part of devel package:
I'm not a CMake expert. Are they necessary? What is their purpose for the devel package?
Many thanks in advance!
Far from being a cmake expert myself I added them to permit inclusion of liboqs as a cmake subproject (find_package instruction). See #1190. If you know of other approaches, we're all ears.
Thanks, got it. I'm not sure it's a must (AFAIK, OpenSSL doesn't provide similar files itself and still can be found by find_package).
Oh, I see. In case of OpenSSL it is provided by CMake vendors.
Thanks for the clarification!
