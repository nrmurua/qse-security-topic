In the most recent version of Terra gate objects now support a custom label string (default None). If this string is set it would be good to display this in the circuit drawers.
For example:
currently shows:
But with this change would ideally show:
This might just be an issue for unitary gates, which probably set the name parameter to unitary. I know for non-unitary custom gates this definitely works as you're describing.
Oh, I missed the custom XGate there too. I expect that's the same issue those subclasses of Gate set the name parameter and assigning a label doesn't override that.
What's the expected output if there are parameters? Also Instruction has no label...
And what about gates that dont have a place for label, like swap?
I see two options.
On the use of the label as an identifier Qiskit/qiskit-aer#207
if we override then the swap becomes a box with the label with 0 and 1 as Chris gives in the example above
It seems like this is the way to go.
