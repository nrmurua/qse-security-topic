Dulwich is marked in setup.py under install_requires which makes it a mandatory dependency. It is used under qtt.tools for controlling information of the git repository, but is not required to run for normal operation.
When installing qtt via pip install git+https://github.com/vandersypenqutech/qtt, dulwich blocks installation. The normal installation of dulwich requires c++ build tools. An alternative pure-python installation is possible, but since dulwich is not strictly required for running qtt, it is better not to mark it under install_requires.
@eendebakpt What do you think?
Dulwich is called by the function qtt.tools.code_versions, and code_versions called by qtt.measurement.scans.py, which is used many times in qtt.
What happens if you try executing the following command first?
pip install dulwich --global-option='--pure'
You can also install using anaconda or miniconda. See INSTALL.md
Hope it helps!
Thanks for your response. To circumvent the installation issue I added dulwich to the conda environment file for the subproject of spin-projects. I'll close the issue although I think this type of feature should only be available in a development setup, not in a production installation. (then again, we don't really do production installations)
