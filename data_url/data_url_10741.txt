The dnx requirement creates a dependency loop. I think the logic that is being imported from dnx is sufficiently small and self-contained enough that it can be duplicated in dwave-system.
Thoughts @bellert ?
draw_tiling() is really just a diagnostic tool, and can be removed if necessary. At the very least, the dwave_networkx import should be inside of this function in tiling.py. As for the mock samplers, I'm not a huge fan of duplicating this functionality, but if it's the only way, then it's the only way.
Upon closer inspection, I'm not seeing the dependency loop. dwave_system requires dimod and dwave_networkx. For the "all" extra, dwave_networkx requires dimod.
