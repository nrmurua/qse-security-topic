There is an issue with deployment for stable releases, after tagging v0.1.10 we get:
By looking at the fonts, I guess there is some link url update missing.
The error is in the workflow: it is always falling in this branch of the if
So the two versions are always the same, and they have been overwritten by the new run (not 100% sure, but 90% yes, since there is no log from the tar command, but -v is not passed).
Why the stable is using ubuntu font while the latest furo?
The developer is on holiday, please contact the other maintainers (or wait until tomorrow) :P
Looking at the log, the if branch seems to work because the wget always exits with a true status, furthermore the two docs are different, which means that the copy step was not performed (as @alecandido suggests, I agree to add the verbose option). I suppose the issue comes from the fact that the last workflow was launched one minute after the previous one. I tried with a forked Qibo repository to create a new tag and I had the same issue. Since the artifact was generated correctly but the github-pages were not updated, when I changed the version in the main branch a few minutes later, I do not see what I expected. I solved the problem, repeating the entire process and waiting for the webpage's update. I re-runned the workflow, and now the website is working correctly.
Thanks @Edoardo-Pedicillo.
