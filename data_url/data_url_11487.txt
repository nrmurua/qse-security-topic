As Aqua will be completely deprecated upon the next release, consider pinning versions in setup.py, for this final release, to the known working latest version(s) of terra, ignis and also appropriate versions for external dependencies. This will alleviate any necessity to fix anything that might break due to a version change while this package remains out there.
