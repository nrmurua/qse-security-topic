Here is the error message,
I made only one modification to the 2023.2_mpich_znver3_psmp.def file, specifically pointing the source code to the support/v2023.1 directory. After doing this, everything worked as expected.
All 2023.2*znver2_psmp.def and 2023.2*znver3_psmp.def under tools/apptainer failed to build the container.

Fixed.
