All state visualizations return a matplotlib.Figure. However, some docstrings report this as a Figure, some as a matplotlib.Figure.
ex: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_vector.html#qiskit.visualization.plot_bloch_vector
ex: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.visualization.plot_state_hinton.html#qiskit.visualization.plot_state_hinton
The inconsistency is a bit confusing (for example, a user might wonder if there's a difference between a Figure and matplotlib.Figure).

Ideally, all would list a common return type.
I'm happy to submit a PR to update all return types to matplotlib.Figure if that's the agreed-upon solution.
Thanks for the report.  The actual ideal return value would be something that intersphinx can resolve into a link to matplotlib.figure.Figure.  I don't know off the top of my head how easy Sphinx will make that, especially if there are any instances where we're using autodoc's automated processing of type hints to produce the Sphinx rtype directive, but it would be a welcome PR to make that cross-referencing work correctly.
Ok -- I'll dig into it and open a PR once I've got the cross-referencing to the matplotlib doc working.
