in the section "Classical bits and registers initialization" we could add support to use the prefix 0b for binary format, instead of only the String format. Example 0b1001, instead of "1001".
It would allow to be more flexible to introduce the numbers in other bases and transform them in a simple way.
Also this format is common used in other languages like C, Python, Rust, Java ...
I like it -- it will make lev happy as we can have hex.
Yes, we also want the hex prefex 0x.
