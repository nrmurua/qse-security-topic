Hi! I have been trying to simulate universal gate or U3 gate (in qiskit) using these reference:
https://qudev.phys.ethz.ch/content/courses/QSIT07/presentations/Schmassmann.pdf
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/qasm/libs/qelib1.inc
and this code
def u3(q1, a, b, c): #defining universal gate
"""
#af is a function that returns the approx step value
I am not getting the right outputs for this gate. Is there any better way to implement U3 gate using simulaqron?
Hello @invalidexplorer
What outputs are you expecting and what outputs are you seeing? Note that the values passed to rot_* will be converted to an integer n such that the rotation is n 2 pi / 256. Could it be that this rounding gives you the unexpected results?
There is currently an issue (SoftwareQuTech/CQC-Python#6) where we are thinking if instead specifying the angle as a pi / 2 ^ (n - 1) such that one can specify more accurate angles and concatenate these if necessary.
Hi Axel! I have already a function that accepts the value as radians and returns the most closest value of uint (the step). Hence that isn't shouldn't be a problem. I feel the problem is in the implementation of the u3 gate, I am not sure how to implement Gaussian gate in simulaqron, if I can do that I might be able to implement a better u3 gate
@invalidexplorer Could you verify whether the problem is with your gate or if there is an issue with the implementation in SimulaQron?
Hello @invalidexplorer ! Could you share the full code you're using? If you don't want to do that here you can send me an email.
