Graph objects should be separated from the graph base elements (GBE) such as Vertex and Edge.
We should define a base graph class and base GBE classes that are stripped from decoder specific attributes.
Every decoder should add decoder specific methods and attributes through inheritance, defined in their modules_decoder folder.
This allows graph object attributes and methods to be added at the decoder level in stead of the main level.
Implemented in #26
