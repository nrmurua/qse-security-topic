Currently Mitiq depends on a 2.x version of PyQuil, and since July there has been a new, breaking release out 3.0. It would be good to assess what changes would need to be made to upgrade our dependency and if there are new features we could take advantage of.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
