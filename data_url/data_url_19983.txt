https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Customizing-liboqs doesn't document in all cases the default values. This issue is to trigger discussion and documentation on those:
Strawman proposal:
Thanks Michael, this is a good improvement.  I agree with the proposed defaults on all of them except USE_SANITIZER -- I don't think there should be a default sanitizer enabled, because most builds would not be built for sanitizer checking.  The change for OQS_DIST_BUILD is particularly good considering the recent liboqs-go issue, as I was reviewing the PR there I thought that perhaps we should change to make builds distributable by default.

Good for me. But then we shall document that.

That also triggered this for me. But this might bring #1264 to the fore... But then again, we don't have CI for that OS/HW combination. So will do a PR before updating the Wiki.
The last statement makes me wonder: Why do we keep this information only in a Wiki and don't put it in a file (that would then be contained in a distribution)? I think I'll change that as part of the PR unless there's voices to the opposite. Edit: Changed Wiki to link to the (already existing) file.
