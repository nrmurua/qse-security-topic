Example to reproduce the issue:
Errors:

Thanks for the bug report!
This is because Qfactor does not currently support state prep yet. When you use VariableUnitaryGates the instantiation pipeline will select Qfactor by default as the instantiater. We plan on adding support for state instantiation in Qfactor soon.
In the meantime, you can use differentiable gates, e.g. PauliGate rather than VariableUnitaryGates.
