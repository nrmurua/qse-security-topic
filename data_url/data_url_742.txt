Say I have two qubits psi_1 and psi_2. I entangle them and wish to measure them separately. Please consider the code below taken from example, slightly edited to illustrate my question:
If the psi_1 measurement result is <0>, psi_2 measurement result must also be zero for a Bell-00 state.
But if one runs the code above a few times, it will produce results were psi_1 results in <0> while psi_2 results in <1>.
I am aware that if I use measure_seq I can measure both at the same time and get consistent results but things get muddled quickly.
Is there a way to maintain consistency of results without having to measure all the subsystems at once using measure_seq?
The thing is that in your code you measure on independent copies of the Bell state (i.e. result). You need to use measure_seq().
Yeah, after reading the reference manual, I noticed that measure_seq was the only way forward. Thanks for confirming it.
