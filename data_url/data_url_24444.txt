Long standing bug that occurs on replotting, sometimes the bounding box rectangle does not restore correctly

The bounding box rectangle should restore correctly

This issue doesn't match the title, issue #24 that was closed was a separate issue.
Whatever the problem was, it's working fine now and I was able to render a concentric transmon in Ansys:

Confirmed by @dwang429 as well, so I'm closing the issue.
