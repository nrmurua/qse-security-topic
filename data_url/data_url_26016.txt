Write a function in qbraid.interface.qbraid_qasm.tools.py that converts an OpenQASM 3.0 program / string to an OpenQASM 2.0 program / string. Related to #223
Resources:
Example usage:
One rough example of a way you could test for coverage:
For now, can just use the qiskit.qasm3.loads to create a qiskit.QuantumCircuit, and then do conversion qasm2 from there.
May not need explicit implementation once #270 is complete, TBD
