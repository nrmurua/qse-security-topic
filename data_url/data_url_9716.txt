For large CQMs with lots of linear constraints, the user can run into memory/performance bottlenecks. One place we could potentially relieve the bottleneck is to not encode the linear constraints as quadratic models. I see a few possible approaches:
In either case I think we can maintain serialization compatibility by just continuing to serialize them as quadratic models
