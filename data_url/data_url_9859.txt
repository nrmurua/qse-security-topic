Description
I can set conflicting bounds if I first add a constraint with bounded variables and then set the variable's bound in the CQM but not if I first set the CQM bound and then add a constraint.
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
Consistent handling of these two cases.
This is intended behavior. Since you're overriding the lower bound, subsequently adding new constraints have to match the variable domain.
