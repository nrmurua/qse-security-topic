The reset channel is equivalent to performing an unobserved measurement which then controls a bit flip onto the targeted qubit. It is also equivalent to tracing out a qubit and then swapping a fresh 0 qubit into the system.
I'd like to work on this (I need this for a simulation I'm doing anyway).
I looked at the channel protocol and I think that I have an idea on how to implement this.
My idea is the following:
The measurement Kraus operators are [[1,0],[0,0]] and [[0,0],[0,1]], where the latter corresponds to the 1 state. If we measure 1, we apply a Y-gate with the unitary [[0,1],[-1,0]], i.e. the second Kraus operator becomes [[0,1],[-1,0]] * [[0,0],[0,1]] = [[0,1],[0,0]]. So to implement this in Cirq, I just make a class analogous to one of the common channels, but with the _channel_ method returning (np.array([[1, 0], [0,0]]), np.array([[0, 1], [0, 0]])). Which is equivalent to an amplitude damping channel with probability 1.
Does this sound reasonable?
What is a good circuit diagram symbol in this case?
That is the correct channel (although applying X also works).  I would suggest implementing this like AmplitudeDampingChannel or GeneralizedAmplitudeDampingChannel.
@dabacon might have ideas for a diagram symbol.  R makes sense but might be confused with rotation.  |0âŸ© (and |0> for ASCII mode) could work.
