I think when parsing qiskit writes a temporary file /tmp/parsetab.py . This poses a problem if two users use qiskit on the same machine. The temporary file should be unique to each user.
Temporary file should be unique for each user.
Temporary file is not unique for each user which leads to write conflicts.
Add user name to the parsetab file.
ls -l /tmp/parsetab.py
Yep, you are right!
Thanks for reporting! ... will be fixed ASAP.
Closed via #139  - as usual, thanks for reporting!
@nikomoll We have issued a new release: 0.3.9 which fixes this issue as well. You can update it via pip  (if you are using pip): pip install --upgrade qiskit
