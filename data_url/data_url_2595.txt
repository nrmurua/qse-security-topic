When interactively working it's odd to create a qubit when what i really want to know is whether the Gate is an xmon supported gate, not whether the op is.
I'm willing to work on this.
@dabacon I can add a new function called is_native_xmon_gate next to is_native_xmon_op which checks if the provided Gate is an instance of one of the gates native to the xmon. I will then write a test for it, along with docstrings for both is_native_xmon_gate and  is_native_xmon_op which is currently lacking documentation. Does that sound good to you?
Sounds good to me. I'll add you as a read-only collaborator so I can assign you. (You have to accept the invite and have 2FA enabled)
Thanks for the invite, I just accepted it.
This issue can now be closed right? Or is there anything missing?
Ah, we must have forgot to put Fixes #1150 in the commit message.
