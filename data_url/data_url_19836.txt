A lighter version of the RB & Clifford module in Ignis only for 1&2 qubits, independent of the general Clifford module that should be added in Terra.
The output Cliffords will be in the form: (H.P.V) where H is either H or I, P is the Pauli and V is the axis swap group (I, V, W).
The code will include the following files:
As well as Jupyter tutorial notebooks:
Following the reviews:
In the function get_quantum_circuit (in clifford_utils.py) we need to revise the ops names from v (and w) to hshs (resp. sdg h sdg h), since QuantumCircuit has no attributes 'v' or 'w' yet.
Is there another solution?
We can use the following equivalent shorter presentation: v=sdg h, w=hs - is it better?
Clifford.py is now based on the new Clifford class (see: https://github.ibm.com/IBMQuantum/qiskit-ignis-internal/issues/62).
Where should it be located when the RB code will be released? In Ignis or in Terra.qi ?
For testing the RB code - is there an independent function (not based on the current code) that can verify that the generated RB sequences are all equivalent to the identity in the Clifford group? Is there such a function in Aer?
unitary_simulator
It will calculate the unitary for the sequence and then make sure it's the identity, I think there should be some examples in terra
Let's leave the clifford in ignis and later when chris is ready to put the clifford module in terra we will update
