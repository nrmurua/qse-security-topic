In the current code, execute_with_mitigation() is an independent function which takes as input a calibrator object.
My proposal is to re-define it as a method of Calibrator.
cal.run()
cal.execute_with_mitigation(...)
Motivations:
Do you agree? Am I missing any drawbacks?
P.S.: If useful, we could also have both: the method and the standalone function. But I am not sure we need both.
Decision from Mitiq Friday call: keep both.  Right now the method is more convenient but, in the future, we may need a more  flexible standalone function.
