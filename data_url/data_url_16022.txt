Controlled the HamiltonianGate seems to produce wrong results, whereas manually exponentiating and then using the UnitaryGate works fine.
This yields:
Controlling the HamiltonianGate (and reversing bits) should produce this matrix:
Check what's going on in HamiltonianGate.control, maybe it's a relative phase that's introduced.
@Cryoris Under extensions/hamiltonian_gate.py, I don't see a .control method for the HamiltonianGate class. Any ideas where I can look into this?
@paniash The control method is implemented in the parent Gate class.
I noticed that when you create a HamiltonianGate directly it looks ok,
prints;
This may actually be an issue with the Unroller preserving global phase;
yields,
