This line raises an exception:
https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/frontend/artiq_ctlmgr.py#L69
as it ends up doing https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/tools.py#L98  but the process is created with stdout=None
Merging this branch would fix this bug: https://github.com/fallen/artiq/tree/ping_controllers
Does it seem clean enough for merging?
