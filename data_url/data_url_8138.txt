OpenMP handling is broken in the current master.  It is likely caused by changes made in #1289.  Trying to import qutip with OpenMP built produces errors
The issue is probably due to __init__.py being out-of-date with regards to the change to how the qutiprc file is written.  The immediate fix should be very simple, however it highlights a larger problem with our testing - this should have been caught by the OpenMP tests.
In this case, I believe that the tests don't see the issue because there is a test in __init__.py that doesn't trigger the OpenMP calibration if only there is only 1 CPU.  Presumably, we only ever get allocated single-CPU VMs on Travis, so it hasn't got caught.  That makes me worry a lot that the OpenMP code isn't even being tested correctly.
In testing.py, we made sure openmp was used even on 1 cpu for the tests. But this is no longer used with changes to travis.yml to use pytest. I believe pytest.fixture could be used to set openmp_thresh for openmp tests, but I don't see how to catch issues in __init__.py with that.
Good first issue?
I already fixed it, to be honest.  I was just also tidying up __init__.py while I was at it before making the PR.
Also, we can "solve" the testing issue by forcing the environment variable QUTIP_NUM_PROCESSES=2 before importing QuTiP, I think.
