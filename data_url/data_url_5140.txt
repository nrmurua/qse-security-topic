Currently, if a user does not call the delete-qvm and/or delete-job RPC methods to delete persistent qvms and async jobs when they are done with them, then the objects will persist indefinitely. We might consider garbage collecting sufficiently old objects after some timeout, to prevent unused objects from consuming RAM.
