Our example code is supposed to be a demonstration of source code, as opposed to functionality. We can reasonably expect people to copy paste it into a project. Therefore it needs to work in both python 2 and python 3 without conversion.
For example, 1/2 evaluates to 0 in python 2 because / means integer division unless from __future__ import division is specified. And our current tests would miss this fact because the python 3 example code gets transpiled to python 2.
Fixing this requires:
