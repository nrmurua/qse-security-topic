For when we move the transpilers from qibolab to qibo, it would be good to have a unified approach of gate transformations.

I do not know how is the situation with the transpilers right now, but it is good to point out that decompositions are generally not unique. So we should also take that into account and have multiple decompositions at least for the most important gates (e.g. $U_{3}$)

Indeed, in the current qibolab transpiler we have a GateDecompositions object which holds the decomposition of each gate. The idea is that you can have multiple instances of this object holding different decompositions depending on the application.
@Simone-Bordoni @stavros11 now that the transpiler was moved to qibo, could we take a look at this again?
