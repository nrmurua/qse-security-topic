With the new Qibo version, some Qibocal's tests fail ( here the installed version ).
Here is a minimal example that I believe reproduces this issue
Particularly the issue appears when one tries to deepcopy a measurement gate object after it has been added to a circuit. Note that it is not related to circuit.copy, it appears because qibocal is using a custom function to perform the circuit copy:
https://github.com/qiboteam/qibocal/blob/37a6424c16c1fdb00cbd610152f4e1eeff77519c/src/qibocal/calibrations/niGSC/basics/utils.py#L86
@Edoardo-Pedicillo please confirm that this is the issue you are refering to.
I am having a look on what is causing the issue with the deepcopy. In the meantime, in may be worth replacing the custom copy in qibocal to circuit.copy(deep=True) which I believe does the same, to avoid code repetition between the two libraries.
