An important speedup by using Einstein summation for enlarging one and two qubit operations.
An example of runtime for a random circuit of 100 gates on my laptop (Macbook pro 3.1 GHz i7, 16 GB Ram):
Timing results for new implementation are:
Timing results for old implementation are
(I wasn't patient enough for the 12 qubit circuit)
The python file used for printing benchmarks was:
