There's a recurring CI error on main branch that's apparently now also holding #1210. Who knows about/looks after that environment? @christianpaquin ? Or shall we drop this? Anyone using this? But then again, the consistent error message about an array index error in picnic may be worth while checking out...
I'm not interested in the platform, personally. I'm ok to drop picnic per #1220.
Fine with me. Let's close this issue then in a week or two if there's no-one speaking up against this (re)solution.
I'd appreciate to be pinged on issues with Picnic.
@sebastinas thanks for your interest in getting involved with Picnic issues we find. What's your preference on this issue then: Do you want to look into this/provide a solution or shall we close/drop/disregard it?
My understanding is that msys2 support is being dropped in #1222. So I'll eventually look into fixing it upstream, but it's not a priority.
