All notebooks using ExactEigensolver crash for me. For notebooks, the kernel dies. Running py files, I find an exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV). I have reduced the problem to a minimal example below.
I installed a fresh qiskit_aqua using pip today, April 1. My operating system is Linux Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS. My python is 3.7 and the package version numbers are:
qiskit                      0.8.0
qiskit-aer                0.1.1
qiskit-aqua             0.4.1
qiskit-chemistry      0.4.2
qiskit-ignis              0.1.0
qiskit-terra              0.7.1
minimal example:
The above code reproduces the error and gives
Process finished with exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV)
The expected output is the lowest eigenvalue of the operator.
I don't know a solution as it is unclear what causes the crash. I found that a diagonal operator does not give any problems, i.e. run the above with ZZ or any sum of I's and ZI's etc and it works fine. That means the QAOA notebooks don't give issues, just the chemistry ones for example.
I ran your sample above on a VirtualBox Ubuntu 18.10 using a newly created Anaconda environment with python 3.7.3 and it worked. The environment just contains those libraries:

The result I got was: The exact ground state energy is: -0.30000000000000016
Could you please check if your numpy and scipy are the same ? And if you could create a minimum environment to test it ?
@manoelmarques thanks for checking; I have re-installed all packages including numpy and scipy and now it works for me too. I think there must have been some problem with underlying linear algebra packages, which are probably only called when the matrix to diagonalize is not yet diagonal, hence the strange behaviour.
"Unfortunately" I was not able to reproduce the error again. I will close this issue now.
