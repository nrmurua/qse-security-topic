How can I add two pulses? I can concatenate pulses with the @ operator, but there seems to be no + operator.
A minimal example:
There is currently no + operator because we have not yet defined semantics for it. "Adding" pulse templates could be interpreted in several ways:
With that, what would you expect as the result of wave1+wave2 in your example?
In my opinion, a mix of 2 and 3 would make sense but this is currently just not implemented. It should also be noted that implementing 3. is a very challenging task because of the many different possible variations of inputs to the + operator if we allow it to be usable for arbitrary PulseTemplate instances. We could maybe have a version that deals with atomic pulse templates (TablePT, FunctionPT, PointPT) only but even then, once parameters come into the mix, this is not trivial to implement..
We have an issue open for arithmetics with PTs #262
I did not come up with a satisfying solution yet.
@lumip I was looking for option 3 (optionally with automatic zero padding if needed). Since #262 is there I will close the issue.
