The generated executable terminates with an uncaught exception being thrown.

Optimize with no gradients.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::exception'
what():  std::exception
Aborted
The example should run and produce a result.
Not a regression
No response
From Alex: At some point, the nlopt package should be replaced with some other library.
Same issue with quantinuum target.
Dear maintainers,
This is Dr. Zaikun Zhang from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Together with Professor N.I.M. Gould, I am responsible for maintaining the derivative-free optimization solvers of the late Professor M.J.D. Powell. I have developed PRIMA, which is a package for solving general nonlinear optimization problems without using derivatives. It provides the reference implementation for Powell's derivative-free optimization methods, i.e., COBYLA, UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, and LINCOA.
Thank you for making COBYLA available in your library. I note that the current version is provided by NLopt based on the original Fortran 77 implementation. However, The Fortran 77 code of COBYLA is not maintained anymore.
Although the Fortran 77 code is truly a masterpiece, it contains many bugs, most of which are due to the language itself.  What you have encountered is totally expected. For more examples, see Section 4.4 of our recent paper and the GitHub issues / requests listed below.
The Fortran 77 solvers may get stuck in infinite loops.
Gradients example doesn't make progress on the GPU runners
optimize: COBYLA hangs / infinite loop #8998
BUG: Scipy.optimize / COBYLA hangs on some CPUs #15527
COBYLA freezes (though maxeval and maxtime are given) #370
COBYLA hangs #118
NEWUOA_BOUND stuck in infinite loop inside MMA #117
Cobyla freezes in 0T1.16rc1 #1651
Optimization freezes #25
BOBYQA gets stuck in infinite loop. #7
Algorithm turns into infinite loop and never finishes #3
The Fortran 77 solvers may crash with segmentation faults
due to uninitialized variables that are used as indices.
Fix all uninitialized variable warnings #134
BOBYQA uninitialised variables in rare cases #133
Use of uninitialized variable in BOBYQA altmov #36
Fortran 77 COBYLA may not return the best point that is evaluated; sometimes, the returned point can have a
large constraint violation even though the starting point is feasible.
nlopt COBYLA optimizer gives unexpected output #182
Last Result Returned Not Optimized Result #110
COBYLA returns last evaluated function which might not be minimum #57
Successful termination when constraints violated #1
To avoid the problems originating from the Fortran 77 code, I suggest you use the PRIMA implementation of Powell's solvers. PRIMA provides the modern implementation of the solvers in Fortran 2008. It fixes bugs in the original Fortran 77 code. In addition, it introduces improvements that boost the performance in terms of the number of function evaluations, which is the standard measure of computational costs in derivative-free optimization.
See the GitHub repo of PRIMA for more information. I will be glad to provide assistance if help is needed.
Thanks.
