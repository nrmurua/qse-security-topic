@Hirmay do you have terra 0.15.1 installed?
Oh my bad, I was just going to delete that as I realized that mine is not the newest version. If you want can you assign me so I can give it a shot?
That's okay. I am not part of the terra team though so I cannot assign.
Okay so @1ucian0 can you assign me this issue?
assinged!
Thank you @1ucian0
I have found what is causing the error but I need some help to solve it @1ucian0
Great! Do you want to PR and we discuss there? Or do you prefer explain here first?
I have created a PR @1ucian0  you can check that out and we can hopefully fix the bug.
@1ucian0 should I close this issue now a fix has been merged?
Closed via #4948
How can I access the fixed code? Do I have to wait until the next release? I'm stuck in this error now and it would be great if I can know how manage this error now if possible.
The fix is tagged to be included in 0.15.2, to be released soonâ„¢.
If you need the fix right now, you can install the master branch code.
Sounds good, thank you!
