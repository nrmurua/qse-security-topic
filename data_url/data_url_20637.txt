In step 0, please replace
sudo apt install cmake gcc libtool libssl-dev make ninja-build git
with
sudo apt install cmake gcc libtool libssl-dev make ninja-build git doxygen graphviz
This will avoid errors in the cmake step. Thanks.
If doxygen and graphviz are not present, cmake will still run (at least it does on a stock Ubuntu 18.04.2 image), however cmake will not generate the gen_docs target for liboqs.  But this is not required to successfully build OQS-OpenSSL via the instructions we've provided.
Closing due to lack of activity. Feel free to reopen if any build errors persist.
