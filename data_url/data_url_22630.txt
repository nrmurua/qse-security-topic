Initialized pdq2 with:
When attempting to use command "cmd", get the following error message:
This error occurs in general when passing a string to the command.
The relevant definitions in the driver, including a definition that was added to Robert's driver for debugging:
Pdq2 driver at artiq/devices/pdq2/driver.py:
Not sure if this is a related or not, but additionally when I run pdq2_client I get the following error:
with pdq2_controller running
" characters are interpreted by your shell and need to be escaped, e.g. "RESET"
The other problem is unrelated and comes from the fact that pdq2_client is somewhat out of sync with the latest changes in the driver. @jordens Does the new pdq2 driver still need the equivalent of that init() call?
I don't remember why init() was added. According to blame, you did that.
There is the same problem with set_freq.
Closing in favor of #178
Please provide comments there if anything from this bug here gets lost there.
