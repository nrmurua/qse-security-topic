From @marcolincs
Current code uses math precision for operation but it does not use design precision to determine the points. Will need to "round" points to the design grid. If there are meanders on the route, the left-over length (if any) should be attached to one of the meanders.
Consistent precision
Documenting:
currently the code contains two precision numbers, but it would seem that they both achieve the same thing.
We should separate scope of the numbers:
The first number will normally me a lot smaller than the second number as scaling goes, but it is possible that at this time the two might be comparable. But the main difference is the scope in which they must be used (1. to round algebra/mathematics, and 2. to round vertices of polygons and paths)
