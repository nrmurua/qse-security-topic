I was trying to implement a gate that had a mixture, and noticed implementing _mixture_ didn't actually work because GateOperation._mixture_ forwards directly, without giving any qubit information to the gate mixture method (like _decompose_ does) and without filling in qubit information on the way out. The same appears to be true of _channel_.
Okay, looking at this more, I realize the issue is that I thought I could return things besides unitary matrices in the mixture.
@Strilanc Should we close this?
Discussed at cirq design meeting; should be fixed but not necessarily in the way the title suggests. Mainly we should be able to return things besides matrices from mixture.
I noticed this when working with DepolarizingChannel from Clifford simulators. It would be nice for Clifford simulators if it could return a mixture of Pauli gates instead of raw matrices. Clifford can't use the matrices directly and has to recompile the matrices into gates, which is slower.
Dupe of #1657?
Gonna close since this does look like a dupe.
