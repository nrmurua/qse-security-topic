Hi!
Latest quilc version 1.11.1 [c914232] crashes when launched as quilc -S in powershell; this is the error message:
It works in the standard cmd.
Best,
Johannes
It's strange that it works in cmd but not powershell. CL-SYSLOG::VALID-APP-NAME-P is defined like so:
Quilc ensures the app name is clamped to maximum 48 chars, so perhaps the ascii-graphic-string-p test is failing? That function just checks to ensure the app name doesn't include any ASCII space or DEL characters...
How exactly are you invoking quilc? Can you copy/paste the command you run to start quilc in powershell?
This is fixed in the latest release, which can be found at https://qcs.rigetti.com/sdk-downloads
