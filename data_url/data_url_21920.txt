I tried looking around to see if this was covered in an earlier issue but couldn't find any...
On Artiq version 2.4 on windows 64 bit, I have the following experiment:
Which always prints False.  If I use the  == operator instead, the comparisons seem to work fine: 'a' == 'a' returns True and  'a' == '' returns False.  Are string comparisons like the one above allowed on the core?  If not, we can easily do the comparisons using == instead but it's easy to forget while writing that using != and an empty string returns False instead of True.
Seems like a bug.
This actually has nothing to do with comparing by value, I compare strings for nonequality with
which is obviously wrong.
