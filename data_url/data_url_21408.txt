Minimal repro:
NB: msys2/MINGW-packages#15242 broke llvmlite completely (it now segfaults), version 0.38.1-1 must be used for now.
Unlike LLVM 11, LLVM 15 expects byval to be used like this:
But MSYS2's patched llvmlite still outputs the LLVM 11 syntax:
I think we can eventually upgrade to the LLVM 14, since llvmlite 40 was released, and MSYS2 finally has fixed versions of LLVM 14 and 15
Closed by msys2/MINGW-packages#17370
this issue is also observed in conda, see https://gitlab.com/duke-artiq/dax/-/issues/144. we now mitigating it by limiting the llvmlite version to <0.40.0
also maybe unrelated, the conda ARTIQ 7 version lacks behind the nix version.

Is it possible to restrict it by specifying <0.40.0 in the dependencies of the artiq package? The conda garbage has a track record of wantonly ignoring such specifications.

Unrelated and expected behavior.

That works fine for us, see https://gitlab.com/duke-artiq/dax/-/merge_requests/141. Though we use mamba instead of conda, which is basically a reimplementation of conda (so no fundamental improvements, just a slightly better and faster implementation to my experience).
