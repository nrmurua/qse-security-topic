The goal of this issue is to finalize Abelian grouped evolution for Trotterization. Currently, there are some commented code fragments that prepare for this feature but they are not complete and not tested.
The development should start from this branch. It includes aforementioned commented code fragments for Abelian grouped evolution.

A Quantum Real Time Evolution algorithm based on Trotterization that follows the unified design is available here:

Comment to be able to assign me.
Given the gradient refactoring that has taken place + new time_evolvers module + opflow deprecation, this issue has become out of date, so I think it can be safely closed.
