In principle, it is possible to display 2 spectra simultaneously in baseband mode of the specan. This could, among other things, be used to debug the IQ mode of the specan.
I am not sure what you mean, because, in baseband, multiplying by sin(0) is pointless so that only the cos quadrature contains some meaningful information.
Also, since we are performing the Fourier transform on a real variable, the negative frequencies of the Fourier transform are redundant with the positive ones.
Are you talking about taking the real part and imaginary part of the spectrum instead of the modulus or am I missing something?
No. I meant that in baseband mode, we only need one scope channel to acquire the data for a spectrum. That makes it possible to use the second scope channel to simultaneously measure the spectrum of another dsp signal, e.g. the spectrum of pid1 and pid2. That can be practical a lot of times and is faster than just using two separate SpectrumAnalyzer modules (which will each only use the scope half of the time).
OK, makes sense...
implemented afaik. see also #211
