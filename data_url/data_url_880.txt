Describe the feature you'd like
It would be great if a Circuit could return its 2^n by 2^n unitary (by multiplying across the moments)
(Please let me know if this feature already exists)
How would this feature be used? Please describe.
I'm looking to use this feature in unit tests for a function converting between different quantum circuit languages (qiskit, cirq, etc.)

@singular-value Thanks  for providing your input. This feature does not currently exists but I will add it to our queue for future consideration. You are also free to create a pull request that we will review and consider merging. We would likely make this a feature of the LocalSimulator rather than the circuit itself.
üëç right would make sense to include in LocalSimulator
Hi all,
I would like to give this feature a try. If I create the MR, will you consider to merge it? Maybe you already evaluated this feature and you are not interested on it ... for now :)
Regards.
