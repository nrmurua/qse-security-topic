Probably very low on priorities.
Add new templates in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md and .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates
New templates for issues should be a quick fix from the Settings tab:
https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-templates
Edit: @vprusso I am unassigning myself from this issue and assigning it to you. I don't have access to Settings.

But as the above link (Creating Issue Templates section) shows, it should be a quick change on your end.
