The co-authors have agreed on making public the code relevant to the code snippets and plots appearing figures of the Mitiq paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04417).
We discussed different possible routes. One was to have a separate repository, mitiq-paper. The one we are implementing, to ensure that the code keeps working and to reduce overhead, is to have the code snippets and plots included in the documentation of the library (run and tested with continuous integration).
We proposed to have the jupyter notebooks along with other examples in the Mitiq Examples section of the Users Guide in the documentation.
We will also have accompanying data, that I propose we include simply in a data/ subfolder there, under docs/source/examples. It is not heavy so it shouldn't be worth to selectively exclude it when cloning the repository.
We also mentioned the fact that tags for the arXiv versions could help us pinpoint eventual modifications in the repository.
I propose to also add some information about it under the Research section of the documentation.
We did not create a Zenodo repository to avoid duplications of bibliographic records, with respect to the paper (once published) as this generates a DOI.
Copying over notes from duplicate issue:
The current code for figures and data for the Mitiq paper is a bit spread out and as discussed a the 6/25 community call we decided to add all data/sample code/figure code to the docs.
We discussed this at the Mitiq meeting today.
We decided the following:
Closed by #838.
