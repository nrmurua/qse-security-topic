Batching is added.
Async is still outstanding.
Updates:
I think this goal has been achieved given maffoo's comments.  We have also added a run_batch interface to engine as well.  If not, we should clarify what specific things should still be added to accomplish this goal.
There are some additional things we want to add (proper async interface to Quantum Engine, "dynamic" batching that adapts based on request size, etc), but I think the sampler interface itself is in reasonable shape, so we can probably close this and address further improvements in separate issues/PRs.
