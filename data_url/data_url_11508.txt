Currently the repr of SummedOp is not very readable, especially at larger qubit counts where is ti dominated by boolean True / 'Falsevalues.  Instead, this should be replaced by something similar to what is returned byprint(SummedOp)` but is actually executable if copied and pasted. E.g.
Now we have PauliSumOp.
repr
str
We have to improve __repr__ in SparsePauliOp at first.
For SummedOp[PauliOp], the problem is resolved by Qiskit/qiskit#5261.
Is it resolved?
Closing as resolved as stated above. If the resolution needs any further work then an issue should be raised in Terra where the opflow has been migrated and is now being maintained.
