Implement an option for continious running of AWG pulses without the need of a trigger signal
So you mean an inifinite repetition of the currently active pulse? Can you specify how you would use this and what you expect of the device? What would you expect if a pulse is uploaded on multiple devices by the HardwareBackend?
I think this can currently be hacked manually, at least with the tabor AWG in the short term. I put this into the features of the new AWG model.
yes I mean infinite repetition of the currently active pulse, which might contail subsequences. I expect that the pulse can be uploaded. Then started and stopped by a software command. Between start and stop command the pulse runs continuously. If such a pulse is uploaded on multiple devices synchronoty between pulses is not required. The normal mode of a cont. mode is basic testing using one AWG only, but potentially all channels and marker channels of an AWG. I am sure this can be hacked somehow on the short term.
I implemented an interface for this feature in #464 for the Tektronix driver:
If this turns out to be a feasible way of doing it this should become part of the AWG interface class.
