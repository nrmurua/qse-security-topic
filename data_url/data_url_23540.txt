If I understood correctly, ArrayParameter is deprecated and ParameterWithSetpoints is now the way to describe multidimensional parameters like 2D images coming from a camera for example. However I can't find a way of storing this data neither using a Loop nor the DataSaver functionality.
I would prefer saving it using the Loop functionality, since we plan to work with the HDF5 backend for disk storage, that as far as I can see currently is not supported by the DataSaver.
Data is stored in a multidimensional array
For the storage attempt using the Loop following error is raised:
This seems to be related to the open issue #627 , where the workaround of converting the data to a python tuple is provided. This however is not suitable for large amounts of data like MP camera images. Is there any update on this?
For the storage attempt using the DataSaver following error is raised:
The datasaver is apparently expecting {'cam_x', 'cam_y'} to be set as well. In this case these however should stay constant during the run, the camera is generally not providing the image pixel by pixel. This is were ArrayParameter sounds to be the more suited class to take. Is there a way to flag these parameters as constant?
I wonder if anybody encountered this problem before. Is there some driver implementing this behavior already? I looked through the spectrum analyzers, oscilloscopes drivers, but couldn't find anything suited. The Andor DU401 driver in the contrib_drivers repo is using python lists to return the data, the TPS 2012 is using ArrayParameter.
I would be grateful for any ideas.
P.S.: Thanks a lot for this wonderful work here. I'm really looking forward to use QCoDeS more extensively in the lab.
Both the Array parameters and the ParameterWithSetpoints intend for you to supply setpoints. QCoDeS was mostly designed with the idea in mind that you want to have explicit dependencies on all axis. There is currently no support for specifiying non changing setpoint axis but that is a resonable request.
The Loop is part of the old legacy dataset and does not support ParameterWithSetpoint. I would recommend against ever using it.
However, for now I would suggest that you simply use a Parameter with a Array validator
Something like this
Note however, that the build in plotting in QCoDeS does not currently know how to plot this
due to the missing setpoints
Thanks, that at least stores the data now.
However if providing a setpoint parameter that is varied from shot to shot, and registering it to the measurement, the resulting dataset has a quite storage hungry format of the set values.
This
returns
Is this necessary for the logic of the dependencies? This would get a little bit inconvinient and space inefficient for large image data for example. Or is this just the returned representation and the database is storing the data more efficient?
@ThorstenGroh Those extra values of the t setpoint are not actually storred within the database. They are expanded on load time by get_parameter_data
Okay, that is nice. I think, I can close this now then. Thanks a lot for the quick help.
