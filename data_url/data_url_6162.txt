We need tests for testing that conditional operations logic work as expected.
Not all operations can have conditionals (like barrier), so if a qobj is sent to the simulator
with conditionals in unexepected operations, the simulation will error.
Although, we need to test that those operations allowed to have conditionals, work as expected too.
I can work on this, if it doesn't conflict with anyone else. You can assign the issue to me.
Thanks @SatyaKuppam! There was actually several tests added after this issue was created which you can see here:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/test/terra/backends/qasm_simulator/qasm_conditional.py
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/test/terra/reference/ref_conditionals.py
But it would be still good to fill in the gaps and increase coverage. Some additional tests could be:
I see. Thanks for the info. I will work on increasing the test coverage.
