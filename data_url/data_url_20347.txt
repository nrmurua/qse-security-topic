On nist-branch we build test_kem (which statically links against liboqs.a) and test_kem_shared (which dynamically links against liboqs.so) and test both of them in Travis.  Is there a way to do that on master branch?
Depends on #358.
Mac builds are failing because of utilities.c contain no symbols.
The only way I could come up to fix it is disable static library build on Mac.
But I'm not sure if we want to disable static build of liboqs on Mac.
May be Nir can look into this.
The failure has nothing to do with the message about utilities.c containing no symbols.
It has something to do with how clang tries to build static executables on macOS.
Run the following command on macOS:
The last few lines of output look like this:
Ignore the lines about utilities.o containing no symbols, those are just warnings.
Notice that liboqs.la was built successfully, then it says "Making all in tests", and then says "Nothing to be done for all", and then looks like it's running configure again.  This configure is what's failing.  I'm not actually sure why it's running configure again, but it apparently is.  If you look in config.log, you'll see how it fails.  On my system here is the relevant extract from config.log:
The key error message I think is "library not found for -lcrt0.o".  Googling this error message yields the following StackExchange discussion: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3801011/ld-library-not-found-for-lcrt0-o-on-osx-10-6-with-gcc-clang-static-flag
Can you investigate from there?
