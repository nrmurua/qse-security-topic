Yes, install asyncserial manually if you want to install misoc this way.
@sbourdeauducq So why wouldn't we publish asyncserial on pypi?..
If we put packages on pypi, we have to ensure that they are maintained and properly versioned there as well, otherwise there will be incorrect versions installed silently, and corresponding support issues. And pypi/setuptools don't have good ways of dealing with version dependencies, unlike e.g. cargo. So I think it is better to only support conda for packaging, which is enough of a PITA already.
We already have pythonparser on pypi.
