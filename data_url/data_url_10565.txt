Description
Embedding overlapping chains with the FixedEmbeddingComposite gives a DisconnectedChainError error, although the chains make sense individually.
To Reproduce
gives an error:
From the user's perspective, 'a': [0, 4, 5] is a good chain:
Expected behavior
Would be helpful to get an error showing something like, OverlappingChainError with the overlapping nodes:
Environment:
Additional context
I assume the chain is disconnected in the embedding because of prior use by a previous variable, but from the user's perspective each of the chains by itself is connected.
