Not all the standard library can be specified "by name" in TwoLocal(..., entanglement_blocks=...). This creates confusion. IMO, 'by name' is just a source of problem and the parameter should be set by instance.
I see your point, but it's just so much more convenient to set by name than importing the gates and I think we would really deteriorate the UX if we don't allow it. We can raise a better error or maybe automate improve how gates are selected by name eg by importing all gates and checking their name or so.
Proposed solution from discussion with @Cryoris:
It's a lot nicer for the user to be able to set by name so would be best if we could make that work. Also the current TwoLocal class uses a hard coded valid_layers dictionary to get the required gates which is not ideal. So we suggest the following:
