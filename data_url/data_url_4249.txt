Some classical operations need to know the size of the register they are applying to. For example: left-rotate, right-rotate, reverse, etc (anything that involves permuting bits).
There are also operations such as 3**(2**k) (mod 2^n) that grow very large very fast if you don't know n.
Sure, we could have an AdvancedBasicMathGate, which does something similar to this (second example) by default.
I actually didn't realize this was the reason for the function that took the registers and returned the implementation. The existing thing does this.
