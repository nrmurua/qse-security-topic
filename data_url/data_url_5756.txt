Passing different parameters to multiple circuits will result in an error.
Binds correctly.
Frankly, I don't know if this is a bug or a specification. However, from reading the documentation, it seems to me that the validation is too strict (bug). If it's a spec, I'd like to know how to bind it correctly (and should be documented.).
@hhorii Thank you for fixing this!
