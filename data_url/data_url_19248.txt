I came across the maxcut class in Qibo and came across the following code:
Maxcut is an optimization problem where the question of interest is what is the maximum cut that we can find in a particular graph. However, the input argument just takes in the problem size,  it is independent of the graph.  The hamiltonian constructed just returns the  corresponding Maxcut Hamiltonian for the clique corresponding to the size. I wonder if this is intentionally coded for an application.
@shangtai please have a look at these definitions: https://github.com/scarrazza/QITE/blob/main/hamiltonians.py
@scarrazza Hi Stefano, thanks for the reference.
I pass the following based code to my team for benchmarking previously.  Here w is the matrix representing the weight.
