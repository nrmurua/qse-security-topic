Currently LeapHybridDQMSampler().sample_dqm(bqm) raises AttributeError: 'BinaryQuadraticModel' object has no attribute 'num_variable_interactions', this should be more informative.
Hi @arcondello, I am a newbie and would like to try this out.
As a first step, how can I reproduce this issue in my local?
Hi @Abdullahjavednesar , something like
should reproduce it.
❤️
I am facing an issue installing minorminer in my mac, getting the following error.
Can anyone please help.
Hi @Abdullahjavednesar , can you try upgrading your pip and setuptools? pip install pip setuptools --upgrade. Also, do you happen to have an M1 mac?
Hi @arcondello, I have tried upgrading pip and setuptools, didn't work, still the same issue. Tried multiple things nothing worked :/
Also, do you happen to have an M1 mac?
No, its an intel core i7 processor. macOS Catalina v10.15.7.
Anyways, I could reproduce the issue in another system. Can you help me as to what should be the Exception raised? Does TypeError(f"Expecting DiscreteQuadraticModel object, got {type(dqm)}" look good?
Yes, that looks good!
