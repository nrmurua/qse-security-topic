On the qubyte setup I have measured a difference in clock speeds between the digitizer and the AWG of 1.002. For the ttraces code we have traces of 5ms with 8 blocks of data. For the last block of data the difference in clocks is clearly visible. For the ttraces code there is a PR #245 to compensate for this.
We need to check whether this makes a difference for the videomode and scan2Dturbo.

If I understand it correctly, the clocks are off by 1.002, so it's 10 us at the end of the trace. Quite a lot I think. Would it help to have an additional trigger signal to sync the clocks?
An external sync of the clocks would help, but we have to look into the m4i docs to see whether we can connect it with the 5014.
Sync seems to have worked on the V1 station. @Christian-Volk knows the details.
