Currently users can only save HDF5 datasets in the datasets group of a file. This does not provide a clean way to save custom metadata, which include parameters not fetched as experiment arguments and other experiment parameters (wavemeter frequencies, ion trap voltages, etc.).
Some solutions are:
Comments/ideas from others would be appreciated. It would be helpful to know how the more advanced ARTIQ users save their metadata in the data file.
This is linked to #1545 and references therein (in particular #1345).

Why not just save those as output datasets? Taking laser wavelength and ion trap voltage measurements is pretty much part of a regular Experiment.

I would prefer to save these variables in a different hdf5 group than "datasets" to organize data better. We also save data such as AOM frequency shift direction, single/double pass, etc. These configurations seem more like attributes than datasets to me, though I agree we could save them as datasets too.
Currently we use a homebuilt server to save hdf5 files in custom format, so I can close this issue if you would like.
