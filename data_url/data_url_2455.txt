A failure modes of the incremental checks, formatting and coverage, occurs when you start a branch A, leave it be, pull from origin master to start some other branch, then return to A later. When you run the increment check again, it will compare against origin/master, instead of from where A branched off from origin/master. This can cause a lot of spurious and redundant formatting, which can lead to merge conflicts.
The solution to this is to compare against the revision returned by e.g. git merge-base [comparison-branch] [HEAD]..
