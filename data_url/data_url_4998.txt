On Ubuntu 19.04 I get a test failure out-of-the-box while following the quick start in the README.
CMake output:
Test output:
I cannot immediately see how to get a more verbose output to pin down what exactly is failing.
Have you got an error log file created? That should say which test failed. If not, try to run ctest -V and show me what it says.
Hmmm... apparently that unpacking style was added in PEP 448 (Python 3.5) will fix it, for now, you can just switch that line to:
if test1 and test2: print(*out, flush=True, **kwargs)
Ok, thanks.  Alternatively could consider turning off Python 3.4 support, as that version has reached end of life.
Enough HPC machines (see: Archer) still have Python 3.4 as their default that I don't want to drop it just yet.
Confirmed that that fix (and using newer python) resolves the issue.
