Plot the histograms vs the ideal (similar to the paper). Add to the volume fitter.
I want to add this feature, but I canâ€™t find the figure you mentioned in the original QV paper. Perhaps you are referring to another paper? I can imagine how the figure might look. Do you want the exp vs ideal histogram to have separate bars next to each other similar to this or overlapping bars similar to the gate error figure here?

Thanks, I'll make a function to plot this kind of figure! I have seen this figure, but can't remember in which paper. Can you point me to the paper on arXiv?
I'm not sure...it was a plot I had from some talks that I've given, but I don't remember where it originated
