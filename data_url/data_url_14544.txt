Error decomposing node of instruction 'p'.
"Error decomposing node of instruction 'p': 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'global_phase'. Unable to define instruction 'u' in the given basis."
Execute the following code:
The circuit unrolled
We switched over to using u as the name for the generic 1q gate, since the u1, u2, u3 gates were IBM specific. Therefore the basic definition is not in u3 anymore but in u and if you exchange u3 for u the unroller works:
If you want to use the u3 cx basis you can use the BasisTranslator instead since this is not an unrolling action but rather a translation. ðŸ™‚
Great explanation @Cryoris !
The 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'global_phase'. error is a bit confusing tho. I'm renaming this issues to improve the error message.
