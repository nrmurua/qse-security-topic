The transpile function fails to unroll an UnitaryGate containing an identity matrix of more than 2 qubits when the backend argument is set to be a remote quantum computer or the coupling_map argument is set.
Notes:
Successfully transpile the circuit.
Hi I think I'm getting a similar error
QiskitError: "Cannot unroll the circuit to the given basis, ['u0', 'u1', 'u2', 'u3', 'cx', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'h', 's', 't', 'snapshot']. Instruction id not found in equivalence library and no rule found to expand."
when I'm using the qiskit-jku-provider. It occurs when I try to execute the job with backend=jku_backend

Hi @EziOzoani , that error is raised because the circuit being transpiled contains an identity gate, but the backend does not report that it can implement an identity gate ('id' is not in the backend's basis_gates). The transpiler won't remove identity gates (id ) as they're generally left for the backend to decide how to implement (IBMQ backends, for example, have traditionally implemented id gates as an implicit delay, though this behavior will be removed in the future).
One option is to remove the id gates from your circuit before running it, or you can open an issue on the JKU provider suggesting the id gate be implemented. Feel free to reach out on the Qiskit Slack if you have further questions.
