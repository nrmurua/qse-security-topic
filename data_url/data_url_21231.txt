There are currently no methods in the phaser driver that let the user convert parameters from SI to machine units without setting those parameters for NCO/DUC/oscillators. If the user wants to cache parameters in machine units ahead of time for different pulses, it seems that currently they have to copy the relevant code for the calculations from the driver into their experiment.
Expose methods like frequency_to_ftw_nco, amplitude_to_asf_osc,... in the coredevice/phaser driver, similar to how this is done in AD9910 driver.
