Hi,
I am installing TFQ (0.7.2) on python=3.9.7 version and TensorFlow 2.11.0, protobuf=3.17.3. But throws an error.
Earlier I worked with TFQ (0.7.2) with python 3.8.16 and TF= 2.7.0. It worked fine.
But now i have to use python=3.9 and it throws an error of file _tfq_simulate_ops.so.
Please help.
I don't think 2.11.0 support is finalized yet (see #756 and #755). When it is finalized it will be through TFQ nightly, 0.7.2 requires TF 2.7.0 (see the requirements file for 0.7.2: https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/v0.7.2/requirements.txt#L8)
can you please specify the steps to install with bazel. I checked tfq website. and installed bazel 5.3.0. But not sure how to make it compatible tf2.11.0 and tfq with bazel.
To install with bezel, see the install from source instructions: https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/install
I tried installing but it throws an error of undefined symbol _ZNK10tensorflow80p....
Hmmm there are probably other issues in TFQ that need to be fixed before being stable than, TF 2.11 support will probably be out with the next release.
any hope when it will be released?
I do not know the release schedule for 0.8, though there was a 11 month gap between 0.7 and 0.6, and a 8 month gap between 0.6 and 0.5 for context.

Please, please rebuild TF 2.11.0 with the right build options: ABI is set to 1, std c++ is 17.
Here is the newly updated installation guideline:
