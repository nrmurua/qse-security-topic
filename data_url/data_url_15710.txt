When applying the PauliTrotterEvolution to exp(i X^Z), the resulting circuit contains undefined gates.

Is there a necessary step that I'm missing?

qiskit 0.31.0
These are just circuit blocks that are not decomposed, they are not undefined ðŸ™‚ If you want to look at your circuit in a certain basis set you can just transpile it to that basis, e.g.
Note that for me it shows the RZX gate and for you something else since I'm running the dev version of Qiskit, but the transpilation should work the same for you.
I tried to call decompose, but it didn't change anything. And from the example, shouldn't those just be identities anyways?
Transpiling works, though, thank you!
