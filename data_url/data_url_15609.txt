The custom passmanager from qiskit tutorials fails due to transpiler errors.
While using qiskit-tutorials/tutorials/circuits_advanced/qv_tools.py, I am getting errors of this form: Duration of cx on qubits [0, 5] is not found. The catch is that this is for ibmq_montreal; qubits 0 and 5 do not have cx connection on that backend. The full traceback of the error I get:
I am not quite sure what the cause is, but it seems to be because the DAG object in qiskit.transpiler.passes.scheduling.alap contains some objects which are not valid operations on the backend.
The expected output of qv_tools.py is a compiled circuit to a specific backend.
No response
I'm not sure which file you're referring to here - neither Terra nor the Qiskit Tutorials have ever distributed a file called qv_tools.py according to their source control history.
I assume it's this file here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/pull/1241/files#diff-0d6b5d6d178c8ae770c7365ae469e30a8cedf71424e2ae114b85bf5dac18a7f9 which might have been published on the ibm quantum documentation's tutorials, but the PR to the tutorials repo never merged
@mtreinish Yes that is the one I am referring to. I got it from this reference on the IBMQ site: https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services/docs/services/manage/systems/improve-qv/
It is possible that this is still a bug, but I was able to resolve the error by setting natural_direction=True (as opposed to None) for the Unitary Synthesis (in https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.transpiler.passes.UnitarySynthesis.html).
