We have identified a few obvious discrepancies between the current version of the arXiv paper and the state of this live specification.  Since we anticipate making a new version of the paper, this issue tracks those changes:
We could make the supremacy of the live specification clearer in the arXiv paper, e.g. "Where this paper differs from the live specification, the live specification should be taken as accurate.".
sec 3: paper says
Top-level circuits in OpenQASM2 must begin with the statement OpenQASM 2.x;, possibly preceded by one or more blank lines or lines of comments [...] Top-level circuits in OpenQASM3 begin similarly, e.g., with a statement OpenQASM 3.x;
The incorrect capitalisation of OPENQASM in (both) the statements should be fixed, and we should remove the comment that the statement is required - the live spec, including the examples in this repo, has never had this restriction.
Depending on the resolution of Major gates.rst revisionÂ #393, we may need to update the definition of U.
