The xarray dataset created by to_xarray_dataset should be saved by the default xarray methods
On running xaDataSet.to_netcdf('file.nc') an exception is generated.
The problems seems to be caused by the depends_on field in the generated xarray structure.

@peendebak could you paste the complete traceback, please?
It seems like xarrays to netcdf simply does not like lists of strings in its attributes.
However this error is specific to the netcdf3 backend from scipy that xarray falls back to if you do not have netcdf4 installed.
pip install netcdf4 and restarting resolves the issue for me. See http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.to_netcdf.html#xarray.Dataset.to_netcdf
@astafan8 Perhaps we should depend on netcdf4 explicitly.
This is the relevant issue on the xarray side pydata/xarray#3374
@jenshnielsen yes, that makes sense, let's add this dependency!
