@ewinston says in #3864:
In PR #3739, open controlled gates were implemented. With that PR a new keyword argument was added to specify the control state,
XGate().control(3, ctrl_state=6)
This creates a 4 qubit gate where the first three qubits are controls and the fourth qubit is the target where the x-gate may be applied. A ctrl_state may alternatively be expressed as an integer string,
XGate().control(3, ctrl_state='110')
where it is more apparent which qubits are open and closed. In this case when q[0] is open and q[1] and q[2] are closed the x-gate will be applied to q[4].
As a reference #3867 implements open controlled gates for the text visualizer like this:

Hi @ewinston, just checking how this is going. I want to try out this, but wanted to check with you before proceeding!
I think you can jump in directly, @Hrishik-Shrestha ! Let me know if you have any question.
Hi @Hrishik-Shrestha . Any update on the issue?
