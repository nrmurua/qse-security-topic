Summarize the task
Make measurement key class variable names consistent for both string and MeasurementKey types. Channels use key and _key respectively but MeasurementGate uses key and mkey.
I think key and mkey are better names and more indicative of the type. Also, the public interfaces of these objects are different. The channels don't expose a key attribute but MeasurementGate has to continue exposing it as a string or do a deprecation cycle on it.
Updating the channels would also entail inward-ing and recreating the JSON serializations.
Acceptance criteria - when is the task considered done?
When the naming is consistent.

I raised this concern in #4497, but it's fairly trivial. Given the removal of string-based keys since this was released, the cost of updating serialization formats, and the lack of activity on this issue, I think we're fine to close it.
