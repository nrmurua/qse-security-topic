We've recently added a function qbraid.interface.circuit_drawer() that takes any supported program type as input, and draws the quantum circuit representing that program. It interfaces with the circuit drawers of each of the different supported package, allowing for cross-over, also includes a number of different output and format options.
In this issue, we would like to add a section to the user guide on our docs page showing examples of how this circuit drawer can be used. The code examples should be written in a new .rst file docs/sdk. See CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation for instructions on how to build docs locally.
I would like to work on it
@nitin-pandita Are you still working on this one as well? Or should I re-assign it?

@ryanhill1 I am working on it
Hi @nitin-pandita, do you think you can have a PR ready for this by the end of the week? If not, it's totally ok. But we would like to get the documentation added, so if not by the end of the week, I'll have to re-assign.
@ryanhill1 sorry for the delay, I will not make it to the end of this week, you can re-assign it to someone else, sorry for the time delay
@nitin-pandita no problem, do you think by end of next week you could get around to it? Or are you occupied with other things at the moment?
