Lets the user pass a list of numbers as an initial_layout to the compile function that maps the circuit from top to bottom in the quantum registers.
Currently:
We decided to alter the format of the initial_layout to something like this:
where each tuple specifies one circuit qubit, and each position in the list corresponds to a physical qubit on the chip (in this case 5 qubits). The physical qubits are assumed to be ordered (Qobj has this assumption too).
This will hopefull have the flexibility of the current dictionary approach, but much easier to write (which was the goal of #727).
we want a single initial layout for a batch of circuits. This needs to be documented as well
this is done with the Layout object that receives a list.
the rest is propagating it to the global compile/execute functions as part of #978 .
