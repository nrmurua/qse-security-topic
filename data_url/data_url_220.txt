Our only reference to tensornet in the docs is here, where we say:
The tensornet target provides a tensor-network simulator accelerated with the cuTensorNet library. This backend is currently available for use from C++ and supports Multi-Node, Multi-GPU distribution of tensor operations required to evaluate and simulate the circuit.
We should update this documentation to say that it is indeed available in the ghcr.io/nvidia/cuda-quantum:latest Docker images for Python. We should probably provide examples for both Python and C++, too.
My understanding is that the only current limitation w.r.t. Python and tensornet is that the multi-GPU version of tensornet may not be supported yet. If that is true, then that should also be included in the docs.
