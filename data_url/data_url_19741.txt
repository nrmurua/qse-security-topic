Currently, when I try to apply my results to the filter, I get an empty dict back. No values :(
Expected is to see the mitigated results from my earlier job
Here is my fitter calibration:

I've encountered the same problem, this error is caused by the insonsistensy in size of quantum registers, quantum computer returns results with the register of size 4, but your calibration circuits have the register of size 5.
Just try to change this part
cal_circuits, state_labels = complete_meas_cal(qr=circuit.qregs[0], circlabel= 'measerrormittigationcal')
to this
cal_circuits, state_labels = complete_meas_cal(qr=QuantumRegister(4), circlabel= 'measerrormittigationcal')
This is not exactly a bug; it's an incorrect usage that does not fail gracefully. It's a good question how to avoid such cases in the future; maybe enable passing the original circuit to complete_meas_cal?
