The format of the title should be correct.

This should already be fixed on master.
A bit unrelated, this build of the 4.7.X docs failed -- https://readthedocs.org/projects/qutip/builds/19616097/
Perhaps we can close this issue though? The docs at https://qutip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/heom/bosonic.html seem good?
Yes, it does, both for 4.7 and master.
Im now wondering how did I see this compiled wrongly.
I got it from here: https://qutip.org/docs/pre-release/guide/guide-heom.html.
This is the link that "online html documentation" links to in the qutip webpage. Is this not keept up to date, as https://qutip.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/guide-heom.html is?
The Read The Docs version is compiled on each commit, but the website version requires downloading the update version and manually updating the website repo.
I see, thanks for the explanation!
