Optimized common code is currently available for Intel x86-64 and Arm64v8: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/main/src/common.
Re. other platforms: S390x [1] and ppc64le [2] in current revisions provide AES, SHA2 and SHA3 instruction sets. Work items to add optimized common code for these architectures are the following:

There's some Picnic code that could be lifted for SHA3/SHAKE support on s390x: https://github.com/IAIK/Picnic/blob/master/sha3/s390_cpacf.h. It doesn't have runtime detection yet, but can be used as basis.
The AVX2 SHA-3 code doesn't work properly on Windows either. This was the reason for disabling SPHINCS+ AVX2 optimizations in Windows on #1478.
