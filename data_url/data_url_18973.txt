If the min or max value of a Quantity object are set to a very different order of magnitude compared to the actual value, the normalized value that is stored is very close to zero/one. When trying to recover the original value with get_value() machine imprecision leads to a completely wrong result.
Quantity(10e9,min_val=0e9, max_val=10e30).get_value() will give 0
Quantity(10e9,min_val=0e9, max_val=10e30).get_value() should return 10e9
This is a precision error from applying a transform from physical range to [-1, 1]. It has not been working properly if you exactly hit the bound, too, so the corresponding methods (e.g.
