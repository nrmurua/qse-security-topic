The documentation of Circuit.Compile does not mention if an arbitrary function is only translated into a list of specific gates  from a specified set or liquid instructions are mapped to their gates. Does Liquid support the compilation into specific gate sets?
LIQUi|> itself really has no understanding of gate sets. A Gate definition is really just a recipe for converting a function call into a sequence of one or more unitary matrices. This means that you can define your own gate sets (unitary operations on qubits (sorry, no qtrits or qdits at this time)), write functions that use your gates and then compile, optimize and run them.
So in answer to your questions:
