There is currently a ct.get_result(<dispatch ID>) function, which works perfectly. It would be even more awesome if there were an option to do ct.get_all_results() that would automatically return all results!
The "manual" way I'd come up with is something like this (it's a bit messy but you get the idea):
I'm not sure if there is a more efficient way. Of course, I'm happy to open a PR based on this if what I've proposed is the optimal route.
Looping, like above! :)
@arosen93 , thanks again ! this is a nice feature. Could you also add a bit more about the UX of how one might want to deal with if its a large graph and the objects are significant as well? Maybe it returns a generator instead of list ?
That's a great question! Yes, I think a generator would probably be the ideal solution for this problem.
As a part of this issue, we want to be able to filter by a list of dispatch IDs and statuses.  Additionally include fields such as started_before, started_after, completed_before, and completed_after.
This issue is a part of Hacktoberfest.  Closing this issue will earn you 2 points.
In which folder is the above function located?
Would like to work on the issue
@akash47angadi: It's here: https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/blob/develop/covalent/_results_manager/results_manager.py#L38
Are there any alternative ways to get the list of dispatch ids?
I've added a pull request (#1901) with the the desired implementation. I think everything checks out but if any changes are required I can make them. If @Andrew-S-Rosen or @wjcunningham7 could take a look (or anyone else) and let me know if I need to fix anything else.
