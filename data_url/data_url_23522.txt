Qcodes driver example for UHFLI is based on old qcodes driver (and qcodes loop measure functions) rather than the new ZI provided driver. Link to example
Very minor issue but confused me for quite some time as I missed the deprecation warning on import of the qcodes driver and could figure why some functions didnt match other examples I had.
Maybe worth adding a large warning in the top of the example? Or maybe completely remove it so this is not the first thing that shows up when googling: "qcodes example UHFLI".
Since the driver is still not removed and only deprecated, I think the example should stay. On the other hand, this example is also using old QCoDeS Loop. This makes it a little complicated because one should sit and correct the example for a deprecated driver :)
I think adding a note (saying this example and its corresponding driver are deprecated in favor of zhinst implementations) in the begining of the notebook is a better solution.
I can do that if we agree on it.
@FarBo I think remove the example is fine. No need to document a deprecated driver. Furthermore the driver has already been deprecated for a while by now
@jenshnielsen
HMM. That's also true. Then we can proceed with the axing path
I will do that if there is no objection from anyone else :)
