I just built and installed Qutip on the command line using Enthought python.  No errors...
Then when I run I get:

This seems similar to the build error in Installation on OS X with Homebrew script error #348.
Is this a bug in qutip ?  Is there a way to fix this?
The canopy needs to be updated as it points toward an old os 10.6 whose SDK is not available on your newer osx.

@nonhermitian I am not a Mac man, so I am not sure how this would be done. @cgranade are you a Mac user?
I wouldn't mess with it at all. Instead I would just get the anaconda package as it is the most up to date complete package and is guaranteed to work.

I'm not a Mac user, no. I run a Linux desktop and a Windows 10 laptop. That said, helping colleagues deal with OS X / Enthought Canopy compatibility issues is a big part of the reason that I started using Anaconda instead. They seem to do a much better job at dealing with Xcode updates erasing old SDKs.
+1 for anaconda over enthought on mac (mac user here).
Looks like Anaconda is a winner most typically
Closing this as well.
An alternative solution if one does not wish to use Anaconda can be to change the Python version in use to a user installed one instead of the default version supplied by macOS. I have discussed it in #348
It is perhaps because the default Python version does not detect the local python packages (numpy/scipy). After this fix, I was able to do a sudo -H python setup.py install and everything worked fine for me.
