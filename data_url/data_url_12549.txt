I want to save a full Keras model with the save() method, which looks similar to the following basic example:
This fails with the following error:
When I change to another initializer, e.g. initializers.Zeros, the error message still says that there is no encoder for the RandomUniform object, so I'm also wondering if something with passing the initializer is also going wrong?
We don't support model.save at this time, but we do support model.save_weights which will allow you to fully reconstruct your original model if you have the source code. Check out ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60682091/cannot-save-tensorrflow-keras-quantum-model-using-save-pickle )
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
