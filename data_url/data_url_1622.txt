Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Recently, #4213 added (will add) the SQRT_ISWAP=ISWAP**0.5 gate to the core set of gates.  Several places throughout Cirq define it and one place even defines it as ISWAP**-0.5 (see https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/search?q=SQRT_ISWAP for the full list) which could lead to inconsistencies or bugs.
Describe the solution you'd like
These duplicate definitions SQRT_ISWAP = ISWAP**0.5 should be removed and all uses of the gate should be updated to ops.SQRT_ISWAP or cirq.SQRT_ISWAP as appropriate.  https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/search?q=SQRT_ISWAP lists all places that need to be updated.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters
Hi @cduck, I am a beginner learning to contribute to open source. I am not sure if I completely understand the issue, but I would like to try solving this issue. I might be able to work on it with some guidance.
Correct me if I am wrong, for example, here, are we trying to remove

And, are we just considering the cases where we have SQRT_ISWAP = ISWAP**0.5 or  SQRT_ISWAP = ISWAP**-0.5?
That's correct.  Within cirq-core, use ops.SQRT_ISWAP and use cirq.SQRT_ISWAP elsewhere (cirq.ops is used to avoid circular dependencies within cirq-core).  If the file uses ISWAP**-0.5, this is equivalent to cirq.SQRT_ISWAP**-1 (i.e. x**-0.5 == (x**0.5)**-1).
Thanks for the clarification. I will try to solve and issue a PR. I will let you know if I have any questions. :)
I like the idea of consolidating these definitions. I'd suggest that we define both SQRT_ISWAP = ISWAP ** 0.5 and SQRT_ISWAP_INV = ISWAP ** -0.5.
@cduck, Can you please guide me on how can I perform the test? I couldn't find the procedure in CONTRIBUTING.md file.
Perform what test?  Maybe @balopat can advise on current continuous integration advice.
Maybe I can issue a PR, and you can suggest me some changes if I have do something different. Also, I realized need to have my email signature in order to have my cla approved.
