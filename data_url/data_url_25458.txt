Sometimes, a duplicate entry of user_interface gets added to the Covalent config file ( inside .config/covalent/). The attributes in this new entry already exist under the original user_interface heading. Some attributes written re in-complete words. All this results in an error when Covalent is started.
This was observed when running covalent_ui/app.py a few times (ie stop, start, stop . . ) along with issuing new workflows and using the UI. An exact pattern of replication has not thus far been observed
No duplicate `user_interface entry should be added to the config file. If at all there are any updates to the config, the existing config should get updated
No response
@venkatBala / @FyzHsn this was the bug I was mentioning about config was being modified by the cli.
