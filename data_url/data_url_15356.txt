The part of the Operator class API reference page from qiskit.quantum_info in which the parameters are listed does not show properly. In particular, where the data argument is supposed to be the page reads:
Parameters
or (data (QuantumCircuit) â€“ Instruction or BaseOperator or matrix): data to initialize operator.
Instead of
Parameters
data (QuantumCircuit or Instruction or BaseOperator or matrix): data to initialize operator.
However I don't see any problem with the source code:
You should see the aforementioned error.
No response
Thank you for finding the bug!
As a follow up, could there be an issue with how the docstring is formatted? I am not very familiar with how the docstring is parsed using Napoleon (a Sphinx extension), but maybe the colon should be on the same line as data!? Maybe something like this:
Note also that due to some recent update in the operator.py file, the correct line that should appear in the API reference page is
data (QuantumCircuit or Operation or BaseOperator or matrix): data to initialize operator.
That is, Instruction has been replaced by Operation.
@dalin27: yeah, I would expect that Sphinx's parser is probably choking because it's not finding the colon.  Putting it on one line should help out.
The online documentation still says Instruction because the online documentation is for Terra 0.21.2, and the Operation interface is only on the main branch, and planned to be released in Terra 0.22.  We're not planning to release a 0.21.3 patch (unless something super critical happens very soon), so any documentation fix would go out with 0.22.
