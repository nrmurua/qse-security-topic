By convention (i.e., in PEC and ZNE), the return type should be just the zero-noise value.
In execute_with_cdr there is a notion of multiple observables, so the return type should be the error mitigated expectation value for each observable.
Any other returned values should be optional, e.g., with a "full_output" flag, omitted, or wrapped in a custom object which is returned along with the error mitigated expectation value(s).
