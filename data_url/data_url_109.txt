When initializing a kernel using kernel_builder, its name is automatically generated as __nvqpp__mlirgen____nvqppBuilderKernel followed by a 12-digit suffix:

This makes it hard to read the output quake code, and thus, debug it.
Would it be possible to support overriding the default name?
Since kernel names must be unique, a (random or counting) suffix could be added to differentiate duplicate names.
