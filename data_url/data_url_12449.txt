Does this tutorial create a quantum neural network model that can be deployed on an actual quantum computer ?
If not, what changes needs to be made to that model so that it can be deployed on an actual quantum computer ?
Yea you could deploy it on a QC. Depending on what QC you are using, might have to do a little converting, but nothing impossible.
Okay, thanks.
You are welcome. Feel free to close the issue if there is nothing else.
