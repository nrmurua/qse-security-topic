As described in Issue #531, the error message that occurs when nvq++ crashes says PLEASE submit a bug report to https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/ and include the crash backtrace. In cuda-quantum cases, it would be much better to ask the user to report it to https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues/ instead.
As of commit 26fe7e7, see the steps provided in Issue #531.
It would be much better to ask the user to report it to https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/issues/ instead, especially for __qpu__ functions, and perhaps for all nvq++ compiler crashes.
