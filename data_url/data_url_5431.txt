The Cirq bindings and python tests used python tempfile constructs incorrectly, causing exceptions when the deconstructor tries to use the os bindings after the global os object is freed, and one of the test modules simply leaked files.  Fixing this cleanly touches several files, though mostly with a simple substiution once the data_storage_interface fix is done.  Zipped patch file attached.

Thank you. Can you please create a pull request with the patch? Is the core of the solution to use a directory for the file?
No problem. Thank you again. I created #290 where I applied your patch.
#290 merge should have solved this issue
