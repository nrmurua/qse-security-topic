The roof duality functions rely on several boost graph objects. This makes installing from sdist problematic, also building on read the docs. We should determine if we can remove the boost dependency without significantly affecting performance or the clarity of the code.
Upon further inspection, the two boost functions strong_components and push_relabel_max_flow would be difficult to replace without significant additional code needed. With the changes added by #284 I am closing this issue as being infeasible.
