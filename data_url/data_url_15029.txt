When trying to use BooleanExpression.from_dimacs_file the optional dependency checker isn't correctly detecting that tweedledum isn't installed. This causes the wrong exception to be raised when the constructor tries to import tweedledum.
This should raise a MissingOptionalLibraryError instead of a ModuleNotFoundError
This seems to be coming from #9754 which changed the optional library check from a module level thing to using the decorator form with require_in_instance. I think the require_in_instance decorator doesn't know how to wrap classmethod constructors and is only work with __init__. The easiest way to fix this is probably to just add an explicit call to check before we import in the class method constructor.
Fixed by #10132.
