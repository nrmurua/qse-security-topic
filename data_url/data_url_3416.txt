Hi,
I would like to parallelize running of quantum circuits to get faster estimates of their gradients. One library that makes multiprocessing pretty painless is ray.
When I create the workers for running multiple circuits in parallel, I get the following error
pyquil.api._errors.QVMError: Unhandled memory fault at #x0
There is a useful debugging feature ray provides to serialize the computation, at which point the error no longer occurs. The QVM doesn't crash nor does it write any error messages that indicate some failure. I am wondering if there is perhaps simply an issue with throughput and maybe the request got dropped?
Thanks,
Vincent
Hi, thanks for reporting!  Would it be possible to post some example code that reproduces the issue?
Sure thing. Here is a stripped down version of the code that reproduces the issue:
Also in case it helps, here is the stack trace, which mostly points to files in the pyquil/api
I can reproduce this. Weird and unhelpful error messages yay!
This looks to be related to quil-lang/qvm#110.
I have a fix. PR coming soon.
Thanks for the quick turnaround!
How long does it take for the master branch to get packaged in the Forest SDK? I tried installing from scratch but have some weird error messages. I figured it might be easiest to install from the .dmg
@vipasu I'm doing some testing for these changes (making sure they fix the above) and then I'll update the packages. I'll post a message here when I've finished.
Your above code now runs to completion. If you have docker installed, you can test these changes by running the following command: docker run -p 5555:5555 -it rigetti/quilc:edge -R -p 5555 -Pjdrtf2 --compute-gate-volume --without-pretty-printing docker run -p 5000:5000 -it rigetti/qvm:edge -S and then your script above should run using this as the QVM.
