I think there's been some form of merge conflict in qutip.testing - for one, it looks like the tests are intended to run twice (once under pytest and once under nose), and secondly it refers to the name qset, which isn't defined.
I think you are right. According to this version and this one, before some of the latest and recent commits, the changes should be
Would you like to fix it?
I've sent a PR #1161 that fixes this, but a bigger worry is why this wasn't caught on Travis on other commits?  I'm not familiar with the CI system, but at a cursory glance it looks like it just tests that QuTiP builds, and not that the tests succeed.  Is that intentional?
I think that qutip.testing and the tests in CI are different. The former are in that file, the latter look at the instructions from .travis.yml, which basically call python setup.py install (or test). Also looking at the Travis CI reports, it seems that they work fine. Locally, I'm getting tests to fail on my machine, with malloc or abort trap 6 errors every other time, although some time they pass (hence I opened #1160). It may be that they fail on my machine due to some mess with the gcc compiler.
Yeah, that was what I was referring to - Travis just tests that the Cython parts compile.  I'm new to working on code in any kind of organisation, so I wasn't sure if it's normal to have the unit tests run as part of the CI process, or if that was only meant to test the installation path.
