I had this error some time ago with an application I wrote myself. Then it was due to not using the appropriate matplotlib backend corresponding to the Qt version, but this doesn't seem to be the problem here.
Maybe it is something internal in matplotlib, since you're only doing a simple plt.subplots call?
Looks like something related to matplotlib ! What is the output of pip freeze ?
This is indeed caused by mixing QT5 and QT4 internally in the matplotlib backend.
PYQT5 switched to cooperative inheritance for subclasses.
Can you check if you have the QT_API environmental variable set.
In windows that would be
in a cmd shell
The issue is related to Spyder using a different version of Qt then matplotlib in the ipython console. I can work around it by changing the Qt backend in the spyder preferences.
Should we close then ?
@Unga I'll close the issue. It is something that needs to be fixed upstream.
