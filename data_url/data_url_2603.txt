ControlledGate(Rx(pi)) produces a CNOT where it should be have an extra factor of -i in the lower part of the matrix. Here is some code:
Input:
Output:
An angle very close to pi appears to have the correct behavior:
Input:
Output:
Good catch. This is because the _apply_unitary_to_tensor_ method of XPowGate is failing to include the global phase.
This will be fixed at the same time as #1053
This is release blocking IMO, so I fixed it right away in #1136
