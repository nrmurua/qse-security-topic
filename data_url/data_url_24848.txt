Would be nice to be able to define branch parameters using the physical value of the circuit element. That is to say, inductance for inductors, capacitance for capacitors, and junction critical current for junctions.
Why?
I realize pretty much all of the literature refers to these circuit elements in the energy formalism, but day-to-day work often requires thinking in inductance, capacitance, and critical current units.
@QuantumWitness That's a fine suggestion and reminder that physics is not just what happens in a theorist's head.
I can see a solution to this with two components:
Internally, use of alternative units should be strictly limited to the yaml and the helper function. (No overloading of existing functions etc.)
I think that makes sense, and I believe that users should be OK with scqubits internals purely using frequency units, and it will be good for them to start thinking in this way, as well.
Some more options for units:
As a circuit designer who has to bounce back and forth between physical simulation (ANSYS, etc) and Hamiltonian simulations, I second this request. We think in capacitances and critical currents, and allowing physical units instead of energy units would be very useful.
Additionally, I would suggest sticking to standard SPICE netlist syntax as much as possible, rather than developing a new one. This could allow for compatibility with other simulator tools, and is also quite scalable as it allows for nesting of components through sub-circuits, which may be useful for composite and multi-qubit systems.
