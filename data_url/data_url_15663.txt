check before dividing by zero
Hi! I was able to reproduce this bug and was interested in resolving this issue. So I'm a little confused by the resolution, so we want to check before dividing by 0 but we don't want an error to be thrown?
@amyels To clarify a bit. The purpose of this code
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/a6cb1a37f52fd98f90d0685d1fdcba447a5345b7/qiskit/quantum_info/operators/symplectic/pauli_list.py#L193-L198
Is to set stop to a small number to avoid printing too much output.  Initially it is set here
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/a6cb1a37f52fd98f90d0685d1fdcba447a5345b7/qiskit/quantum_info/operators/symplectic/pauli_list.py#L194
And if you check the case at hand, an empty PauliList, you will see that self._num_paulis == 1. So stop is initially small enough. If you change line 195 to read:
then you avoid dividing by zero. And stop is already 1, so you don't need to do anything more. The bottom line is that it looks like the single change above is enough to fix the problem. You might also look through the code to convince yourself (I did not look just now) that the condition self.num_qubits == 0 and self._num_paulis > 2000 (the default truncate limit) does not happen.
