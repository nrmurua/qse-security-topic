Having manually compiled the changelog for v4.4.1 and v4.5.x today, I think that maybe we should try automating the release notes/changelogs with something like this : https://github.com/github-tools/github-release-notes
I'm attaching release notes generated by this for QuTiP.
RELEASE_NOTES.txt
We could also, in pursuit of having an automated release notes/changelog system start with making commits in more of a standard format, using some pre-decided keywords like [bugfix] or [improvement] in the commit message. I understand that this is a rather ambitious thing to say, but we can then use grep and git log itself to generate these in markdown. As a first step, I am proposing to use Pull request /Issue templates, something like this for instance : https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
This way, all our Pull Requests and Issues will be homogeneously formatted.
Superseded by #1894.
