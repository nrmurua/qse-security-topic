Some tests seem to fail arbitrarily, not very often, but it happens.
This is not pressing, re-running Travis mostly works, but we should address that sometime.
Tests:
These tests should not fail, or be allowed to fail.
Fix the random seeds such that it does not fail.
I didn't observe these issues anymore, probably most of them have been fixed by #967. Though I'm not so sure about the test_pauli_expectation. @manoelmarques have you been experiencing any CI failures lately?
@Cryoris yes, the random failures were addressed by that PR. Since we keep an eye on things in the build anyway on an ongoing basis for any areas like this, and since the build is running fine for now, I am going to close this.
