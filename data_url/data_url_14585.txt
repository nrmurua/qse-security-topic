Calling the inverse method of a conditional X gate returns an unconditional X gate.

I'd expect the inverse of a conditional gate to have the same condition.
That way, for instance, x.c_if(bit, 1) immediately followed by its inverse operation would produce the identity, as one would expect for an inverse.
Assuming it's the desired behavior, could have inverse copy the condition from the original gate to the inverse gate before returning it.
I'm just curious about when this situation comes up and why it might not just warn due to the presence of measurement?
