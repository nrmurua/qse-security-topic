Allow circuits to be passed to the pulse simulator - internally we will need to add a line detecting circuits and calling:
along with changing the signature of the run function and adding a kwarg for schedule options.
Here is a self-contained example from @taalexander that can be used for testing:
I.e. we should be able to call sim.run(qc) at the end without the schedule conversion.
This was already done with: ecb0819 but I don't know if calibrations work (I didn't test it). I assume it works fine since under the covers it just schedules the circuit but this just should be tested.
I think adding a kwarg for schedule options might not be right - in the proposal, there's already a way to manually control the scheduling, and that's to call schedule(qc, backend, **kwargs) yourself.  Adding more unrelated kwargs to sim.run possibly just makes the interface more complicated than having the manual call.
Would you still have transpile be needed to be called outside sim.run?   Presumably yes, since otherwise you'd be duplicating the transpilation pass?
I made this issue due to a bug pointed out by @Matt-Stypulkoski , however he has said that it turns out this isn't actually what the problem is :D (consistent with @mtreinish 's comment). Maybe we can keep this issue open for discussion while it gets tracked down, and then close and open another once it's sorted out.
Can we close as @mtreinish's PR handles this and the execution issues are a result of Qiskit/qiskit#6898
Yep makes sense.
