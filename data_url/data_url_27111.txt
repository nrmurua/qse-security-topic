Dear DCore developers,
first of all thank you for the great code and the nice examples. I would like to know, if it is possible to read in a spin-polarized LDA calculation into DCore (starting from the two hr.dat files from Wannier90 for the spin up and down components)?
Best regards,
Malte Sachs

Hello,
Yes, that's possible (although not described in the online manual).
Please set "spin_orbit = True".
When this option is on, the Green's functions and your tight-binding parameters in *_hr.dat can be spin dependent (and can have off diagonal elements).

This is about DCore 2.x.
Exactly!
