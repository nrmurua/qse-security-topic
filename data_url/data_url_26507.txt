I'm doing the "converging_cutoff" exercise in https://www.cp2k.org/howto:converging_cutoff , I find that changing the PRINT_LEVEL option from MEDIUM to HIGH, I get different multigrid analysis result, see the picture below. Do you know what's the reason?

Have you checked if you get the same/expected output for the same print-level again?  My suspicion is more about results not reproducible from run-to-run rather than from one print-level to another.
Any update?
