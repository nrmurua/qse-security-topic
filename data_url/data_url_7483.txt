The gradient at pi should be zero.
However, the Jacobian is wrong. Here, the second element should be approximate to zero.
Hmm, please definitely check your zygote version!
I checked my Zygote ver. which is 0.6.12.
The error is in Jacobian of loss not loss2.
It should be approximate to ([0, 0], ).
I updated Zygote to 0.6.19. And this issue is still there.
I just confirmed your issue. But I think it is probably an issue of Zygote's withjacobian function.
I tried the following order of computing gradients,
My theory is, during computing the first gradient, the cached data is destroyed. The quick fix for you is just compute column by column, each time re-compute cached states. We really need an expert to look into this.
BTW, do you have such issue when using the previous patch for zygote?
You can also try the following approach to fix your issue
then it should works
Just pushed a fix to this patch. Now the Jacobian should work. You need to update YaoBlocks to v0.11.5. to make it work. Now, the patch is implemented on apply and dispatch functions.
@GiggleLiu Thanks! It has been fixed.
