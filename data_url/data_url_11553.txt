When the convert method of CircuitSampler at aqua/operators/converters/circuit_sampler.py is called with such an operator which neither contains any CircuitStateFn, nor any of the contained operators can be converted to CircuitStateFn, the following error is raised
Currently, the only thing which has a non-implemented to_circuit_op() method is OperatorStateFn, so constructing a circuit entirely comprised of OperatorStateFn raises the exception:
Incidentally, you necessarily need to have some composition of OperatorStateFns to get the above error. If the operator to be converted contains only a single OperatorStateFn, you will get a NotImplementedError
The reason for this is that the to_circuit_op() function in ListOp explicitly checks for OperatorStateFn and does not call its not implemented to_circuit_op() function, while in the case of a single OperatorStateFn the function on it is called directly in CircuitSampler.convert().
Raise a more descriptive error, or just work siletly.
to_circuit_op() is defined for PrimitiveOp and ListOp, so maybe it can be defined straightforwardly for OperatorStateFn as well, something like
@molar-volume Thanks. I think using primitive.to_circuit() for to_circuit_op() is not a desired behavior for OperatorStateFn.
For this case, we should validate inPauliExpectation().convert(), whether the input operator can be converted into an operator with the Pauli measurements`.
Do you continue this issue?
Hi @ikkoham, I have not work on it since the pull request, you can go ahead, if you want to continue :)
OK, thanks
