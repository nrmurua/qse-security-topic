@rraymondhp use the local_statevector_simulator rather than shots and it will fix the warning.
@jaygambetta  This is not  a bug on my side because the algorithm is deterministic (it returns a correct answer with probability one). For this reason, I want it to have one shot, and the correct behaviour of the simulator is that it should not give me warning. I have raised this as an issue and @ajavadia  told me it will be fixed at the next release.
Here is the issue I raised. I cannot use statevector_simulator with measurement..

ok sorry and good point.
