If an RTIO input FIFO overflows, it is not reset by core.reset(), meaning every subsequent input will overflow until the Kasli is restarted.
The following file defines two experiments: TtlSample, which just calls ttl0.sample_get_nonrt, and TtlMakeInputs, which calls ttl0.sample_input in a loop:
Calling core.reset() would clear the overflow status and empty the RTIO buffer.
The overflow status persists across core resets.
Operating System: Linux
ARTIQ version (including firmware/gateware): 0bf57f4
Hardware involved: Standalone Kasli 2.0 built from the following core device JSON. Have also reproduced on a Kasli 1.1.
