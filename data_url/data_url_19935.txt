We anyway need a fresh pull to retrieve the license updates your colleagues are looking for in #1437 -- but for ease-of-doing, I'd recommend holding that to after #1470 landed.
@bhess #1470 has landed. Did I read the above right in that you volunteer(ed) to do the PR to close this issue?
Sure, I'll do a pull tomorrow and see if it fixes the issue.
@bhess Thanks in advance. And while you're at it, please also check clang operations: I'm now getting an error on M1 in AES, too (plain cmake -GNinja .. config): The code was introduced in 719a84e

Thanks for catching this @baentsch. I could reproduce the error but needed to compile with cmake -GNinja -DOQS_USE_AES_OPENSSL=OFF -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-Werror" ... Will add a fix with the PR!
