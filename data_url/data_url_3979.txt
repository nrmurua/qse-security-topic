When an instruction is specified that does not exist in the configuration the following exception is raised: TypeError: cc_light_instr not found . As can be seen from the traceback below it is impossible to reconstruct what operation is the offending one (e.g., contains a typo).
This error message could be improved in two ways
@imranashraf , this error also occurs when trying to compile the same openql program object multiple times. It took @slavoutich and me about an hour before we spotted out bug.
Improving error messages is quite important to us.
@AdriaanRol This is related to #171 as well. I am also debugging it on the same lines. For some reason second compile does not find the instructions (which are loaded from the configuration file). Solving this will solve #171 and once the reason is clear i will also update this error message.
closing because of lack of activity
