See the matching pqclean issue: PQClean/PQClean#415
Question to understand the request: Is the goal to (first generate a key pair, then) store away (persistently? using which format?) only the private key and at some later time "regenerate" the public key from this? Wouldn't it be a usual pattern to rather/also (or even, preferably :) store the public key (right after the generation step) for later use, maybe in a certificate? That's clearly possible already, so what speaks against this pattern?
This is what I am already doing, the only problem with this approach is a potentially decreased robustnessâ€¦implementations need to guard against a mismatch and there might be nontrivial attacks exploiting a mismatch.
As was pointed out in the pqclean issue, this simply isn't possible for some schemes (see PQClean/PQClean#415). I'm going to close this issue for that reason :)
