The release notes for version 0.14.0 do not suggest that this would be intended behavior.
The initialize() method from Qiskit Terra is not recognized as a supported Instruction with the unitary_simulator backend.
Upon usage, the following traceback is retrieved:
Install the following version of Qiskit:
Execute the following piece of code:
It would be expected to have the following output:
This was the case when using the previous version:
N/A
I moved this issue here because I thought it may be an Aer issue, but actually i just tried the code snippet and I'm not able to reproduce the error. It runs fine. I'm on master of terra and aer.
The previous two configurations were achieved with
and
I've just double-checked and the latter still produces the error pulling the latest versions from pypi. Just tried cloning and pip installing the master for qiskit, qiskit-terra and qiskit-aer as well and the error seems to persist. Which versions of the qiskit packages do you have installed this way?
Overall, the problem seems to be reproducible by going for the latest version from pypi, could you give that one a try please?
This is a bug, thanks for pointing it out @antalszava
"initialize" shouldn't be in the basis gates of UnitarySimulator, since for it to apply the initialize instruction it must be unrolled to gates
A work around for now would be to manually specify the basis gates to not include "initialize" when transpiling.
