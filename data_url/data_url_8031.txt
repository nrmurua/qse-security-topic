From version 5.0, the subpackage qutip.qip will be removed and replaced by a separate package qutip-qip. To make it easier for others to migrate from 4.7 to 5.0, we can set up qutip-qip as an optional plug-in for qutip, so that if qutip-qip is installed, the qutip.qip name space can be used as before.
E.g. the following should work if qutip-5.0 and qutip-qip are both installed
See #1500 for ideals on the implementation.
Note: The implementation should be done against the dev.major branch of qutip.
Hey! I'd like to help you out with this, is that okay @nathanshammah @hodgestar ? If there's a problem with me being a maintainer at Unitaryhack just let me know, no hard feelings of course
@HGSilveri @nathanshammah will have to be final arbitrator on the rules, but from my side there are no objections. Note that this would be a PR againt the dev.major branch.
@HGSilveri that's totally fine, no restrictions whatsoever! Actually that's very cool. I hope I can make some contributions too...
Awesome, I'll do my best!
Note that this would be a PR againt the dev.major branch.
Does this entail any extra steps not encompassed in the contributing guidelines, or is it just a matter of branching from and PRing to dev.major instead of master?

Just branching from and PRing to dev.major -- the contribution guidelines are the same.
Roger that. Feel free to assign this to me then ðŸ˜„
Thanks @HGSilveri!
