The description in the source code and documentation of the GaussianSquare class has
as part of the description of the curve shape.
Look at the documentation at https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.pulse.GaussianSquare.html?highlight=gaussiansquare#qiskit.pulse.GaussianSquare or find the GaussianSquare source code at https://qiskit.org/documentation/_modules/qiskit/pulse/library/parametric_pulses.html#GaussianSquare or on github or a local qiskit installation.
According to the gaussian_square and gaussian definitions and code at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/pulse/library/continuous.py , we want the mean of the starting gaussian to be the point at which the curve becomes constant which is at
risefall = (duration - width) / 2.
This makes sense because if the curve reaches its peak at risefall and then becomes constant for width and then decreases again, this will take
(duration - width) / 2 + width + (duration - width) / 2 = duration,
and we want the pulse to last for duration so this is consistent.
However in the code, we set the mean as risefall / 2, which divides (duration - width) by 2 twice. The code itself is correct but the documentation is incorrect.
Replace the curve description with
If still available, I would like to pick this up as my first contribution to qiskit.
Thanks! It seems to be still available. I'm not sure where exactly someone needs to go to change the value but all the links I can find are in the original comment.
