Normally, cython shouldn't be required in the run time.
I think there are some optimized Cython routines which for some of the solvers which need cython in run-time. Not completely sure about it. Let me check.
Once built, binaries aren't linked with anything related to cython.
The string type time-dependent solvers generate pyx files and compile them in runtime. Much of qutip will run without Cython. But not the string type time-dependent solvers, which are one of the main features of qutip.
@yurivict you could try removing Cython from your Python env and then run the tests - see how many fail
Ok, thanks. I believe you. -)
