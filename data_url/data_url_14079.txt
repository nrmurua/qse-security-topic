RZXCalibrationBuilder fails for qubit pairs with GaussianSquareDrag, because it can't identify the native ECR direction.
The following code
works if you set qubits=(4,7) and fails if you set qubits=(6,7).
The error originates here, and is caused by the filter counting comp tones which ignores anything but GaussianSquare or Waveform pulses. However, for some pairs (with the pair 6,7 being one of them) the pulses are reported as GaussianSqaureDrag. The pulses have beta=0 so they are identical to GaussianSquare, but they are not counted towards the comp tones, which leads to the failure.
The code should run for both qubit pairs.
I suspect changing the allowed types in the filter would solve the issue, but I am not familiar enough with this piece code, and what the backends might report for other qubits.
Counting GaussianSquareDrag with beta=0 is perhaps a safer option.
