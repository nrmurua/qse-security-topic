This would improve performance and avoid code duplication. Some code for reordering modes could even  be written in a unified way for both the foch and tf backend and moved into a base_ops.py. This could prepare SF for a more intelligent handling of the purity of the internal state representation.
Hi @cgogolin, this issue is a bit unclear to me. Can you provide some more specific points about what could be done here?
As the backends are designed to be fully independent and (by design) do not share any code, I am closing this issue for now.
