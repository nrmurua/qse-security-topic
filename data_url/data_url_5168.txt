I am trying to create a FreeBSD package for qvm. No downloads are allowed during the package build. So having a separate target that only downloads and a special target that only builds makes package creation much easier.
@yurivict I'm not sure what you mean. Are you saying you'd like to build the QVM without Quicklisp pulling in all of its dependencies?
We aren't going to vendor dependencies in the source repo here; that would be too complicated. Quicklisp, however, has a library bundling feature. Maybe that could be used?
CCing @rigettizach who might be able to shed more light.

There should be a separate step that pulls all dependencies before the build happens.
Otherwise the build begins to download files and fails.
make system-index.txt will pull down all dependencies for you.
