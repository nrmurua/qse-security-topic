More general example of loading and running a qasm file with command line arguments and options for qiskit-terra/examples/python
My suggestion attached.
Could be further enhanced by dealing with accounts and urls, currently  just does IBMQ.load_accounts()
I would be glad to work on this further and then submit a pull request.

Hi @jwoehr, thank you for raising the issue and the associated pull request.
If I am not mistaken, what you are suggesting here seems like a script or utility for running QASM code, with some options. So in effect, it is a wrapper around the components of Qiskit Terra.
This kind of thing has been brought up in the past as well (e.g. see #242). Our approach has been to keep this repository as an SDK with well defined APIs, and the examples/tutorials to show how one can leverage those interfaces to do many types of things.
So I think it is better if this script was included in a separate project for people who would like to use command line interfaces.
Ok, I certainly can publish that on my own, thanks.
