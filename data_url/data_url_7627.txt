An incoming feature is to allow computing hosts to compute expectation value directly and send back the expectation value. The value sent back is contained in the 'bits' field but this is misleading when the value is a decimal value.
Let's change 'bits' to 'val' or 'output' to accommodate this.
Fixed it, will link to the coming pull request
