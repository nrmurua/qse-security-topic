When trying to find the index of a qubit in a register one used to be able to use the index of a Qubit. This is deprecated, but there is no good alternative. A minimal example
Suggested improvement: either add a find_qubit method to the register, or expose the register._bits through a public interface.
This should be resolved by #6621 . Please feel free to re-open if not.
