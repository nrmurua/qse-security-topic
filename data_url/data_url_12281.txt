These are the steps I followed to get the error:
I got the following errors:
And this trace:
I found this other issue in qiskit-sdk-py that seems to be related: Unexpected result qasm simulator with coupling map (stable) #181
I get the same error
I get the same error
Hi,
Thank you for pointing this. I also got the same error when running the notebook. It is due to a bug in compiler that swap measurement to the middle of  the computation but the devices do not support such operation yet. I confirmed that I can avoid the error by inserting barrier before measurement, like:
I cannot run the real device now because it is under maintenance though.
Hi @rraymondhp, thanks a lot for your answer!!! Very helpful.
BTW, I just realised that this same problem was reported in IBM Q Experience Community too: Code not working on IBMQX5.
Thanks again for your help.
I get same error. Thank you @rraymondhp.
@rraymondhp  I added the barrier statement just like you mentioned in the quantum-emoticon sample.
It did run once without error.
But now i get the following error:
Hi,
It is likely because there are too many job queue for the ibmqx5. The last time I heard there were about 1000+ jobs waiting in line. Please wait and try to run your job again later.
I will try to see the workaround.
P.S. My colleagure run ibmqx5 just now and it completed just fine...
@rraymondhp the queues are fine right now, wouldn't it be because the time-out set is too short for the experiment?
Yes, it is because of the timeout=60 in the default notebook. I have just confirmed that by having the timeout=300 or larger, I could run in just fine. @tanweer-ali
Thanks @francabrera !
@rraymondhp  Thankyou for the timeout tip.
That worked!
Now the next section of the code which is supposed to draw the plots
i get the following output:
And i don't see any plots
You're welcome @tanweer-ali
This is an issue with permutation of qubit measurements that we are still working to fix.
This is the workaround as noted in my notebook below:
https://github.com/jaygambetta/qiskit-tutorial/blob/rr-quantum-emoticon-nopermutation/hello_world/quantum_emoticon-without_permutation.ipynb
We also had a discussion on the slack channel about this.
https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/C7SJ0PJ5A/p1519833287000006
Sorry for the inconvenience!
@rraymondhp Thank you!
How do i join the slack channel? my email is not signed up for it ?
I am still looking into your other link.
Closing this issue. Fixed in Qiskit/qiskit#347
#put barrier before measurement
qc.barrier(qr)
for j in range(16):
qc.measure(qr[j], cr[j])
results = qp.execute(["smiley_writer"], backend='ibmqx5', shots=1024, timeout=300)
stats = results.get_counts("smiley_writer")
Even after putting barrier before measurement . we are still getting error. please tell solution

Hi @amandeep1988
It's strange because clicking the links (https://...) at your post I can see the counts/outputs of your results. Let me see what is wrong. Have you updated your qiskit to the latest version of 0.5.6?
Please also change your token, as it has been revealed to public by your post.
@rraymondhp
Now, it gives timed out error.
Sometimes it gives Got a 400 code response........... or either timeout error  even after setting timeout to 600.
Hi @amandeep1988
600 secs are too short. please refer to the tutorial below for how to queue without setting timeout.
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/hello_world/quantum_world.ipynb
hi,
my point is to replace the timeout function as below:
If you don`t need to draw circuits you can just disable the drawer. or use the matplotlib drawer as detailed here:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/reference/tools/matplotlib_circuit_drawer.ipynb
I will look into it later and reopen the issue.
Is it possible to have your notebook so I can test it myself?
Hi,
I cannot recreate your problem in my environment. There is a possibility you do not import Qconfig.py appropriately. The lowest_pending_job() function requires you to register your APItoken first before running it.
Best regards
I am closing this issue. Please raise a new issue if you still have the problem.

Were you ever able to resolve this - I'm getting the same error "ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found."
