Should be able to take a set of independent discriminators and use those to build correlated results.
An instance of a discrimination filter currently has one discriminator. This discriminator is used to produce labels, for example, 010 for a three qubit system. These labels are converted to counts by the filter. Thus, a single discriminator is used to determine the state of all the qubits.
This enhancement would allow the filter to use different discriminators for different qubits. For instance, in a three-qubit system, qubits 0 and 1 may have a common discriminator while qubit 2 may have its own discriminator.
