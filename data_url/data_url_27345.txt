when adding an implementation (classical or quantum) it is only stored in the implementation table neither in the quantum_implementation nor in the classic_implementation table.
Should the specific tables be removed?
How should be decided whether an implementation is quantum (, hybrid) or classic?
I assume based on the computationModel of the implementedAlgortihm
