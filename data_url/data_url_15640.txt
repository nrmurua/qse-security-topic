I wrote a script for generating random Clifford circuit with respect to certain layout. Then I convert it to StabilizerState and compute the expectation value of its stabilizers with StabilizerState.expectation_value(), which should be one. The stabilizers are obtained with StabilizerState.clifford.to_dict(). But some expectation values are zero, instead of one.
The following code can be used to reproduce the issue.
The printed result of last line is
The values should all be one. Actually, if we run the following code
Then, the printed results are all {'expectation_value': 1.0}.

I think that the bug is when the Pauli operator has a negative sign, continuing the above example:

@AlaricCheng - thank you very much for finding this bug and opening an issue.
I fixed it in PR #7460 , and added a test based on your example above.
