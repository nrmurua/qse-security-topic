Hi,
Getting "ld: library not found for -lcrypto" during make.  Can you please let me know from where to get the crypto lib.  Thanks a bunch.

Hi Peter,
Thanks for the prompt response.  I am on a Mac with Mojave.  From StackOverflow, looks like Apple has its own libraries for openssl and libssl causing compilation problems (here).  There are several suggestions to fix but none of them are working for me.  If you have any advise, please share.  Thanks a bunch.
Best,
Vaidya.
Hi Peter,
Thank you very much for all your efforts; truly appreciate the time.  I did try with brew and the appropriate flags.  Anyhow will keep plugging at this and post if I find any solution.
Thanks a bunch.
Best,
