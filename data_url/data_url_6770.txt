In above circuit, when I uncomment the U3 gate, the states of other qubits changes, which is obviously wrong because U3 gate only apply to q[4].
I see you have fixed the U2 gate and I think the U3 gate may have the same issue with U2.
Fixed.
please also fix the U1 gate  ü§ù
@whu-dft u1 gate looks good. How to reproduce the issue?
I see that you fix the issue by replacing the pow with exp  so I guess U1 gate may be problematic. I don't have an evidence.
But I found the numeric results (amplitude) of u1 gate are different with that of my implementation. May be you can check it by comparing with other quantum simulator.
@whu-dft Amplitude should not change with u1 gate - only phase changes (u1 is rotation over Z axis, the same as rz gate). I tested the gate and it looks good.
I will close this issue, but if you find it is incorrect, please report.
Thank you!
