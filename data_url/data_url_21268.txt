In #795 (comment) @sbourdeauducq said
Sometimes (and rarely AFAICT) the DRTIO link appear to become corrupted with some bitstream
builds (visible symptom is a storm of broken aux packets); making a minor/unrelated change to the gateware code appears to "fix" it. I have never seen this on Kasli so this is probably GTH/Ultrascale specific.
I suppose Xilinx tech support might be able to shed some light into this. Do you have examples suitable for submission to Xilinx illustrating this behavior?
It is very hard to isolate the problem. Just changing the version string (i.e. a completely unrelated RAM initialization value) is sufficient to cause the issue or make it disappear. All I could send is a full ARTIQ bitstream that exhibits broken DRTIO. I don't know what Xilinx can make out of something like that.
Could be the same as #1424
I recently replicated this DRTIO breakage on Sayma with a piece of modified ARTIQ gateware. Such modification involved replacing the two TTL InOuts at the front-panel MCX connectors with a new TTL SERDES output driver that is hardcoded with a 9 MHz square wave, decimated at the 4 times the RTIO frequency (150 MHz * 4 = 600 MHz). When the square wave is at 9 MHz, no DRTIO breakage is observed with repeated power-cycling or FPGA reloads. However, when I halve the frequency to 4.5 MHz, DRTIO breakage usually doesn't occur at the first FPGA reload, but does occur on subsequent power-cycling.
Since m-labs/misoc#108 should have fixed the Ethernet breakage on GTH, I am going to test the same fix on DRTIO's GTHs as well, and see if this resolves the issue.
