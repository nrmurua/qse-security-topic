Hello,
https://stationq.github.io/Liquid/ is https availabe, but has Mixed Content error because contains reference to http.
Edge

Chrome

This causes CSS layout collapse.
I think that this problem can be solved by editing Jekyll _config.yml(git ignored file), site.github.url http to https.
Best regards,
I don't have anything to add to this. Please re-open if you need help.
I just cared, layout of website should be easy to see.
Thanks for your reply.
