Description of the issue
Certain cirq tests require the version number to be correct to pass. These tests were not corrected in the tagged source releases, so attempts to build cirq from source fail tests unless the source is patched.
I've been building cirq from source for several releases, and 0.14.0 is the first one requiring patches to pass tests.
Cirq version
0.14.0
Failing tests:
These can be seen in #5134:
I'm OK closing this b/c this was addressed for 0.14.1 (632396c), not sure if it will be an issue in future releases (e.g. 0.15.0).
