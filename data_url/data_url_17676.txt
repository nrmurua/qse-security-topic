import qiskit, or from qiskit import *, etc.
Qiskit should get imported.
Problem possibly related to #1455 ?
This should be fixed by #1480.
Yeah, this will be fixed by #1480 . Also fwiw I wanted to add this to our ci so we could catch failures like this some time ago with:  #1201
Although now that I think about it some more I'm not sure that #1201 will catch this because it's using editable mode which just sets a link for the package.
This should be fixed now that #1480 has merged.
