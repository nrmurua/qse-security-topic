Adding this issue as a possible enhancement for the future.
After a discussion with @stavros11, we thought that could be a good idea to have the possibility to plot density matrices or distributions automatically from Qibo, in a visually appealing manner.
It could be something similar as it is done, for instance, in Qiskit or QuTiP.
