Hi @jigar1859. Thanks for pointing this out.
This is an error and we are working on fixing the readme/documentation and a pip installation over the next couple of weeks.
We split the tutorials from the main SDK. To run the tutorials please go to https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial and make sure you have the sdk at version r0.3.
Thanks @jaygambetta... It's works fine now with the new r.03... appreciate your reply.
Regards,
Jigar Thakkar
