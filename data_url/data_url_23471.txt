Hi there,
I am encountering the following:
InstrumentModule keeps appending to name_parts at each call when Instrument is a Mock.
This does not happen when an actual Instrument is passed as parent (set use_mock=False).
I expected the name of the InstrumentModules to be "inst_im0" and "inst_im0"
What happens is that the "_im0" gets appended to the name each time name_parts of the InstrumentModule is called:
The .name_parts property of InstrumentModule is:
I think this is okay when self._parent.name_parts is a property and name_parts becomes a copy. If you put in an instrument whose .name_parts is not a property, name_parts becomes a reference and self.short_name is appended to the instrument's .name_parts at each call.
I propose to replace this function by:
Windows 10
qcodes 0.33.0
@haroldmeerwaldt thank you for describing and reporting! sounds fair! would you be willing to open a PR with this change?
we could also trick a bit and don't depends on _parent.name_parts being a list by doing:
The extra list sounds good, no need to depend on the static typing. I'll work on a PR.
@astafan8 do you also want a test to prevent this behaviour from re-occurring? Or is this such a special case, and you don't want to unit test properties? (If yes, it goes here?: https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/tests/test_channels.py#L72)
Hi @astafan8,
I am sorry, this issue has actually already been fixed:
03ccdc1
I thought I had the latest qcodes, but some other package required a lower version. Apologies.
No worries. I will go ahead and mark this as closed by #4257 then
