At one point we are going to work with other backends than simulaqron. So we should be able to work with cqc, without having to import anything with the name "simulaqron"
The Pythonpath of this project is one level above this repository. While ideally we want the pythonpath to be the repository.
I propose we split the structure of the repo dict as
That way when using the modules, we can use
instead of
when writing something for the cqc library, which might not use the simulaqron backend, so the name simulaqron shouldn't be there.
So simulaqron can import from cqc, but cqc should not be allowed to import from simulaqron
This requires a huge change, and should probably need some discussion.
There is one file that has to be split up for this, one part should go in cqc, the other in simulaqron;
cqcMessageHandler.py.
