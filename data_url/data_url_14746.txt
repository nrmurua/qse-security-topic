A recent issue raised the problem of how confusing a transpiled circuit layout is. In other words, the result of transpiling circuit gives you a result_circuit in which result_circuit._layout is in the domain of circuit.
Should the transpiled circuit make the change to the flat register q or be kept in the original naming (holding the layout)?
