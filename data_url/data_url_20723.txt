The current Dilithium aarch64 contains the service function poly_uniform_etax2. However, this function is currently not used.
Is there a reason for it not being used? Note, it works well for me with the patch [1] to my crypto library. Although its performance boost may not be as big as I thought, it at least helps a little bit.
