If I create a pulse using a Blackman waveform as amplitude, the boundaries seem to have negative samples, so it produces an error. Here's an example:

By the way, this is how I overrode it:
wf = ArbitraryWaveform(BlackmanWaveform(50,4).samples + 1e-8)
Ok, it seems to be just a Numpy rounding error, I'll just clip the values to 0 in the samples.
Try with the latest commit, it should work without the fix now.
Btw, you should avoid using the ArbitraryWaveform when possible, since it's memory inefficient. Of course, it made sense here.
Perfect, I'll close this one.
