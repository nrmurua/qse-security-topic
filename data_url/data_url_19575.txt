g++-10: error: unrecognized command-line option '-msse2'
How are you installing it? Did you use pip install pymatching or are you cloning the repo and building the CLI or Python package from source?
just doing pip install pymatching
These options are probably coming up when building libstim, which uses them to control what word sizes are used for the simd operations on big bit vectors. There have been ongoing changes to templatize all usage of these things, so they're not just controlled by compiler flags. When that's eventually done, it'll probably be possible to drop the -mno-avx2 flag at least..
so I cant do anything about it?
For now, you could see if pip install PyMatching==0.7.0 works? Version 0.7 doesn't depend on stim so won't have this same issue, though I've never tested compiling it on a raspberry pi. However v0.7 uses the old implementation of the MWPM decoder so will be 100-1000x slower. But it might suffice for what you need.
I'd like to add prebuilt linux arm wheels for raspberry pi (I just opened #67) once this issue is fixed.
