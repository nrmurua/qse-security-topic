Print of the error message from the Github CI:
Googling online it looks like a pip install with --no-cache-dir may help? Not sure.
This popped up once before (can't remember the PR), seems to happen randomly.
Any more information on this? Do we know how to reproduce it?
Does it always fail on the same packages?
I will close this for the moment.
