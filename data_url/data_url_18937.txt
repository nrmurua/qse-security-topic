Landing page for live document should be something like: https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/
or at least have the "current version" on the top, and a one level more in the Left index, for now.
Agree. I tried to do it quickly but the default generator for a single HTML site gets rid of the global content table. We can mimic what WebAssembly is doing quickly by splitting the site into several pages. Are we good with it?
Yes, the site should be several pages.
