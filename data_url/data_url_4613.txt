Hello,
I have tried to install from scratch everything that is needed to use the computer with GPU. I have found that, nowadays, there is some mismatch of versions between tensorflow and NVIDIA.
Tensorflow 2.1, 2.2 is working with cuda 10.1 (and not with 10.2 or 11.0) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50622525/which-tensorflow-and-cuda-version-combinations-are-compatible , so in order to make everything work, it is mandatory to download and install (what is not perfectly easy) the proper version of cuda.
However, CUDA is already in the 11.0 version, which is not supported by TF. Nvidia has this version 11.0 as the default download for cuda, and force the user to install specific nvidia drivers. In addition, in my case the drivers are not working.
How must we do in order to set everything and work with top performance?
thanks!
Has been considered the possibility of creating a Docker container to simplify the installation process?
TensorFlow also runs with cuda 10.2, but anyway, the logic is:
@JavierSerranoGarcia yes, this is a possibility or simply create conda packages as #105 .
@AdrianPerezSalinas I have merged #170 so you can follow the instructions from here. Let me know if you have issues.
