Something in the PARSE-QUIL -> PRINT-PARSED-PROGRAM cycle causes sequences of CONTROLLED DAGGER or DAGGER CONTROLLED to permute. For example:
This does not affect correctness, but is mildly annoying and does affect the "fixed-point" check of TEST-PRINT-PARSED-PROGRAM-GOLDEN-FILES.
We should either print these modifiers in the same order they appear in the input Quil program, or else pick some canonical ordering so they are always printed the same way.
Once implemented, be sure to re-enable the fixed-point check for the test in tests/printer-test-files/gold-standard/plundered-gold.quil which is reference in the following code review discussion thread:
#316 (comment)
This issue is (temporarily) undead. #319
I updated the issue title since this applies to FORKED modifiers as well. For example
This was fixed in #329
