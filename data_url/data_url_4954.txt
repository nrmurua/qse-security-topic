Hi,
Recently, I managed to run QuEST on a microcontroller with only several KB flash and memory.
https://github.com/wuhanstudio/QuEST

Running on MCU relies on RTC, RNG, and a POSIX C RTOS (RT-Thread is the RTOS I use).
Since RT-Thread supports over 150+ chips, QuEST should also be feasible on most of them (with RTC and RNG).
Though running on MCU offers little help for research due to the limited computational resourses on MCU, it maybe useful for some benchmark purposes. ;)
This project has a really good coding style, thus it takes very little efforts to port it.
Thank you, hope you will find it interesting, and this issue maybe a good place for QuEST on baremetal with RTOS.
Hi Wu,
Apologies for the delay - what a year huh :)
It's great to hear QuEST ran on a microcontroller; it's possibly a useful demonstration that the 'quantum volume' of today's quantum computers are outclassed by MCUs!
An RTOS-friendly QuEST adaptation could be very handy, thanks very much for your effort on this!
