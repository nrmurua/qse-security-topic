At least on Xilinx, an input-only pin have much wider IOStandard compatibility (you can have an LVDS_25 input on a VCCIO=3.3 bank but not an output).

Do the Xilinx tools complain when you use the regular I+O PHY?
Yes. They don't allow it.
Is that really necessary considering that sysref sampling will use a more precise and different IDELAY scan eventually?
It's not required for sysref. But it's a feature. And if somebody wants/needs it this is how to do it. Leave it around.
