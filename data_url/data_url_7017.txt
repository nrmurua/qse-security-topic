For some reason, controls "â€¢" were escaped as "%95" instead of "%E2%80%A2".

The 'export escaped url' provides a workaround for this issue on the sender side. On the receiver side I'm not comfortable mucking around with UTF8 encodings.
I'm going to close this issue, with the understanding that if I start getting a lot of reports of it then I will put more effort into recovering from single bad characters and trying to infer what was really meant.
