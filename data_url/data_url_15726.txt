Currenty, the Initialize class calls its method _define_synthesis when the desired state is not given by a label or integer. This method then applies the initialization method outlined in arXiv:quant-ph/0406176, with some additional optimizations.
However, arXiv:1003.5760 introduces a more efficient method based on the Schmidt decomposition of states. For example, theoretically, for four qubits the scheme introduced in this paper needs only 9 CNOTs, while Qiskit uses 22.
I understand that keeping up with the latest advancements in literature is not possible for all features of Qiskit, but I was just wondering if improving the initialization scheme is something that is planned to be done, as it is an important part of making circuits more efficient.
Thanks @epelaaez . It is important that you documented this issue to begin a discussion of how and when it can be addressed. (And of course, PRs are welcome! ;)  )
