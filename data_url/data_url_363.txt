When installing cuquantum via apt-get (e.g., sudo apt-get -y install cuquantum) as described here, with the latest cuQuantum SDK v23.03, the install location is different from the previous version:
This is incompatible with the CMake script of custatevec runtime backend.
No rule to make target '/usr/lib64/libcustatevec_static.a', needed by 'lib/libnvqir-custatevec.so'.  Stop. if set -DCUSTATEVEC_ROOT=/usr etc.
Cmake script to be compatible with the latest cuquantum SDK installed via apt-get.
Not a regression
CMake find_library seems to work fine in this case: looking into the default system lib paths, e.g., /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu, to search for the file.
For example, I guess this would work for both the old (/opt/nvidia/cuquantum) and new installation settings.
@1tnguyen Thank you for reporting this. Are you able to issue a PR to fix this? Seems like your workaround is probably the way to go, and we can iterate on it in the PR. No worries if you aren't, we'll take care of it over the next few days.
see comment on #88
indeed @1tnguyen /usr is the common root from which headers and libraries could be found for your case. Also CUSTATEVEC_ROOT is just CUQUANTUM_INSTALL_PREFIX passed from the build script build_cudaq.sh
