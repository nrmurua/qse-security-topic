I recently instally Anaconda and try to run pyrpl in Python 3.6.
I get a bug that is related to the pyQt version, which is not straightforward to solve imho. Any ideas?
w:\pyrpl\pyrpl_init_.py in ()
16 logger = logging.getLogger(name=name)
17 logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)  # only show errors until userdefine log level is set up
---> 18 from .global_config import global_config
19 from .pyrpl_utils import setloglevel
20 try:
w:\pyrpl\pyrpl\global_config.py in ()
----> 1 from .memory import MemoryTree
2 import os.path
3
4 default_config_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(file), 'config')
5 # global_config provides the MemoryTree associated with the global configuration file
w:\pyrpl\pyrpl\memory.py in ()
22 import numpy as np
23 import time
---> 24 from PyQt4 import QtCore
25
26 import logging
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt4'
mmh yes I had to install pyqt4 with
conda install PyQt==4
But I agree it doesn t look great, I am not sure how much efforts would be required to make it pyqt5 compatible
so the two important things are:
for now the migration to Qt5 would only create compatibility problems with older versions. We would even have to write our own code to try the different qt versions at startup. however, maybe we sould start foreseeing this issue and import Qt through a file pyrpl_qt.py which does all that just in case..
