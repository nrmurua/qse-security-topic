UserWarning: Multiplying superoperators with different representations
issued during tests.
@cgranade I think you implemented this part. Is this something to concern
I mainly raised it as I have spent my evening removing all the other warnings from the tests, so would be nice to clear them all
Sorry, caught me while I was travelling to Albuquerque. I'll take a look ASAP, then.
I would not by any means call it urgent. More like something to look at some time
All the same, I'd very much like to further reduce warnings. I've literally had Firefox crash trying to load the entire Travis logs.
