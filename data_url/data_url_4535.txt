Hi all,
I have been woking with the fSim gate and seen that it is not defined as any other gate. Essentially, it performs the operation
cos(theta), while all other gates compute cos(theta / 2).
What do you think about changing the definition?
As discussed, lets keep the definition as it is and observe if in future there are more evidence towards a definition update.
