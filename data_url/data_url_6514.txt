Also, I got the following errors due to utill_qsim.h:ComputeExpectationQsim() in TFQ:
@MichaelBroughton May I change the function names in QSim for TFQ, or should I add switching logic inside TFQ?
Feel free to update the names here. We probably want them to be the same between state vector and MPS.
Thank you @MichaelBroughton , let me open a new issue and corresponding PR. Thank you!
