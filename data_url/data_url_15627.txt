I apply X-gate to qubit-0
Then I measured it.
I simulate it on qasm_simulator with shots=1024
I plotted the histogram.
I printed counts
So, when I print  counts( ["1"] ), it gave me 1024
BUT when I printed counts counts( ["0"] ), it gave me "KEYERROR" instead of 0.
Kindly resolve this issue.

This is by design right now; storing explicit zeroes for all possible measurement outcomes scales exponentially in the number of qubits, and overriding __getitem__ makes lookups linear in the number of qubits at best.  If you want to manually wrap the output, see #6937 (comment).  If we do merge new behaviour for the class, it will probably be in #5205, but see the rest of the discussion there for why that's currently a bit stalled.
As a side note, if you want to report a bug, please actually follow the template.  It is not very helpful if you copy and paste the same message four times.
Closing as wont fix
