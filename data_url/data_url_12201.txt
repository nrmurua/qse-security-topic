The quantum emoticon tutorial (quantum_emoticon.ipynb) uses ibmqx5. https://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q/technology/devices/ shows it has been retired, and the closest comparable system is 14 qubits.
The good news is that ASCII is strictly 7 bits, not 8 bits, so the demo should work just as well in 14 qubits. I'll prepare a PR with an update to ibmq_16_melbourne.
PR #404
Closing this now that PR #404 has been merged.
