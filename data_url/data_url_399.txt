Since there are no prior measurements to change the initial state of c, the condition c==1 should be false and the cx gate should not be executed.
However, Staq optimizer removes the condition if (c==1). It should not be removed because:
I tracked this down, it was a bug with one of the visitor classes from qasmtools. Fixed now. Thanks for the bug report!
