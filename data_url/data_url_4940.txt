When I run: sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev I get the following:
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
libopenmpi-dev is already the newest version (4.0.3-0ubuntu1).
openmpi-bin is already the newest version (4.0.3-0ubuntu1).
0 to upgrade, 0 to newly install, 0 to remove and 1 not to upgrade.
But when I run: mpicc --version I get the following error:
$HOME/anaconda3/bin/mpicc: line 285: x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu-cc: command not found
I have anaconda running on my machine, but this seems like a weird output.
Thoughts?
From RcppCore/Rcpp#770, conda install gxx_linux-64 or something similar should do the work.
What does it have to do with QuEST? Please provide more details if you face installation problems.
That did the trick.
Perfect thanks.
I did not know what it had to do with QuEST, it occurred when I was installing the MPI on the QuEST downloads page.
