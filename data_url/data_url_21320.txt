Using build from latest master. Usually ping is < 1 ms. Lately ping has been much longer.
This seems to be the case for builds I've tested in the last week. It does not seem to be a function of switch (I've tried two). It's not due to other network traffic (one of the switches only has two devices).
net_trace slows down ping response. this makes sense now. closing. @sbourdeauducq
artiq_mkfs -s net_trace 1 -s panic_reset 1 -s mac 00:0a:35:03:1e:75 -s ip 192.168.1.75 -f startup_kernel startup_kernel.elf sayma.config
artiq_mkfs -s net_trace 0 -s panic_reset 1 -s mac 00:0a:35:03:1e:75 -s ip 192.168.1.75 -f startup_kernel startup_kernel.elf sayma.config
This was @jboulder. Just noticed that @trxw was logged into github. I'll log him out for further posts.
@sbourdeauducq net_trace is currently not documented, should we document it and add that caveat?
Sure, go ahead.
Great! Thank you @whitequark. :)
