Given a density matrix rho created in QuTiP, I'd like to apply a unitary operator to it, like in the following code:
However, it raises the following error:
I've fixed it temporarily by adding another if line 775 of qobj.py:
However, it's only a hack because it works only when the main object is a hermitian operator (observable or density matrix) and other is a unitary matrix.
What do you think would be a good solution to solve this issue?
Thank you @artix41 for opening this discussion.  But I think the current behavior protects the user from making the mistake of applying an operator to a density matrix thinking of it as a ket. So this should not work:
as you are making a mistake and instead should have explicitly done squeeze(10,0.25)*rho_coherent*squeeze(10,0.25).dag()
But I can understand how this might be a nice feature where QuTiP can automatically do it. I am not sure though if this need to be implemented as a separate feature since the proper way to do it is just a one liner.
@nathanshammah @ajgpitch Any comments?
I agree.
