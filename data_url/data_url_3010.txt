Not too surprising but
CZ(q0, q1) != CZ(q1, q0)
Not sure whether this is a problem or not and  I guess fixing this for more than 2 qubits could get expensive
The thing that worries me here isn't so much multi-qubit gates as matrix-defined gates, where the equality would presumably be related to how close the matrix was to itself after qubit transposition. Do we want to pass an epsilon to all the equality methods?
Or maybe it's okay to say "this is a special feature of CZ". If you want it for your gate, implement "SymmetricBlaBla". I think that's what I'll do.
