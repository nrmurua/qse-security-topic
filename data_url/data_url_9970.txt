For cleaner serialization of BQMs we should have as_file() on all BQM objects that support (or are supported by) the FileView.
Dimod's FileView implementation should be considered an implementation detail, not something users should know about (just like Cloud Client's implementation of FileView is an implementation detail).
Alternatively, to_serializable(.., binary=True) could return a file-like object.
Both variants can come as context managers as well.
