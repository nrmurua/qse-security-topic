Running multiprocessed codes on larger lattices (for both union-find and MWPM) results in a recursion depth error for the pickled input arguments, i.e. code and decoder objects. For faulty measurements, this error happens for lattices as small as 4x4.
This happens on Windows. While it works perfectly in the Unix environment.
