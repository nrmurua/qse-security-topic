Right now if you build a circuit with measurements and classical registers we unconditionally always draw those measurements and classical registers. But sometimes you only need/want to visualize the quantum section of the circuit, to show just the gates and quantum registers. It'd be useful to add a kwarg to qiskit.tools.visualization.circuit_drawer() that would do this and not draw the classical registers and measurements if present.
But do draw measurements if they appear in the middle of the circuit!
Closing this per the discussions with @jaygambetta
Can you guys tell me how did you do it?
