When I try to render the following state -
using  sv.draw('latex')
I get the following latext output containing - \rangleNone which is not the intended behaviour

Code to reproduce the issue -
Expected output should be like this : $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|000\rangle -  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|011\rangle$$
One can fix it by looking at this particular patch of code - In state_visualization.py, inside function _state_to_latex_ket

Hello, I'd love to work on this! Can you assign me to it, please? Thank you!
@jay-tau I think this issue is being resolved in pull #8273
Try looking at #8317. That's a follow up
