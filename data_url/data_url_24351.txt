Update: On branch #201-create_q3d_design, has the the changes in the 5.1 Ansys notebook and Q3DRenderer.  However in pyEPR, need to merge branch #Qiskit-Metal_201_create_q3d_design into master. Then the latest pyEPR needs to be part of Metal install so that method in Q3DRenderer will work.
FYI: The pull request in pyEPR is https://github.com/zlatko-minev/pyEPR/pull/69
