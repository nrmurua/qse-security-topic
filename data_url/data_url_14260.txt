#9796 added parameter support parameters and assign_parameters to SparsePauliOp. Given this is more exposed/public that before where it may get used more, and at present Estimator primitives do not support parameterized operators
#9796 (comment)
Maybe it would be good to do that in a separate PR as introducing the check is not the direct goal of this PR and the BaseEstimator is so fundamental
Supporting this is most likely a more extensive change. At least it may be useful in the near term to check and reject so things fail earlier and perhaps with a more meaningful end user message.
