Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
For debugging purposes, it would be useful for the operator selected in Channels and Mixtures to be exposed to the user.
Describe the solution you'd like
Allow Channels and Mixtures to specify a measurement key for which simulators can populate results. Among other things, this is consistent with the treatment of is_measurement as a method for checking whether an operator is deterministic.
Ideally, this could look like this bad pseudocode-y example:
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - needed for trajectory simulation, which is planned for end of Q1 2021
For context: the probabilities of each operator in a Channel are dependent on the state vector when the operator is applied, whereas the probability of applying each operator in a Mixture is hardcoded by the user.
Sadly, this naming is confounded by DepolarizingChannel and similar objects, which despite their names are actually Mixtures.
Duplicate of #1357.
Should we close this issue or #1357? This has a better description, so close #1357?
Keeping this issue, though #1357 has some good historical details around the measurement_key protocol.
I realized that this is basically part of the roadmap item: #3241
