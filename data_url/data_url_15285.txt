The TestBackendEstimator.test_with_shots_option test is flaky in CI; the tolerance of the test appears to be too low for the number of shots.  However, the test sets a seed and is still flaky.  This suggests that some part of the interface is not respecting the random seed.
CI has been occasionally failing with:
Reliable tests.
In the immediate term, we can raise the tolerance of the test.  I ran this same test until failure 3 times, and got three failures with rtols of (0.0504, 0.0532, 0.0503) in 116 total tests.  So that's a failure rate of ~0.026.  If we assume (very hand-wavy) that the relative difference is normally distributed about 0, then this is approximately consistent with a standard deviation of 0.023.  If so, setting an rtol of 0.1 should give a failure rate of ~1e-5.
