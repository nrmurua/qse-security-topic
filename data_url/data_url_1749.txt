Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
When users are running their experiment on hardware, there is times that they will need the ability to check if the qubits they are using has good performance. Typically, users will first use the calibration metrics to pick their qubits. But there are times that the qubits may go bad between the time the calibration metrics are captured and when the user runs the experiements.
Describe the solution you'd like
I would like a tutorial that shows how users can use parallel XEB on the qubits they are running their experiment on. The ideal user experience would look like :

After discussing with Matt H. and Ryan LaRose, the high-level plan is to leverage the work that is being committed as part of
#3760
and Balint's PR on 2D Visualization:
#3699
Plan is to do a clone "xeb_coherent_noise.ipynb" notebook, remove some of the theory, and add the nice visualizations.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
