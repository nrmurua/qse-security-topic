Whenever we search for Qiskit tutorials on Google, there is no sign of Qiskit tutorials page.

Qiskit tutorials (the documentation page) should be the first thing to appear.
The first link that I see is qiskit.org which has links to tutorials. I am not sure what is wrong with this. The tutorials are part of the docs, which includes the api, so that there is a single source of information on using Qiskit.
It is not that easily accessible through browser Searches as Qiskit Textbook. According to me, the first thing to pop up should be direct to Qiskit tutorials. It becomes harder to navigate for the person who doesn't know tutorials exist as they never show up directly in browser searches.
If we search "qiskit documentation" then it is working fine. Showing Documentation link as first link. I think searching documentation instead of tutorials solves the problem. what you say @rochisha0
Two updates:
So, this can be closed.
