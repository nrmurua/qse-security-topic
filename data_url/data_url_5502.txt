Are the grid layouts bristlecone48 and bristlecone70 the only supported for the moment? Will there be other grids like sycamore_48?
The current file format is restricted to 12x12 grids. Is this a hard limit? Can it be, for example, 7x7 or 15x15?
See issue #47 for other planned layouts.
The grid size should be controlled by user input - 12x12 is the only case we currently have examples for, but there's no reason we should reject smaller or larger grids.
For clarity, would renaming the fields I, J and K from QflexInput be an option?
I -> nr_rows_grid
J -> nr_cols_grid
K -> I am not sure what grid_of_groups_of_tensors does, but K is its len
...or something less verbose
For the argv in main.cpp, would it be fine if I and J are the first line in the grid file?
+1 to renaming I / J / K. My preferred names for these are "grid_height", "grid_width", and "super_cycles" respectively (K is the number of time we cycle through the set of eight 2-qubit gate orientations).
Regarding I and J as input: we have some conflicting requirements on where these should come from. @benjaminvillalonga, can you give some insight on this?
@benjaminvillalonga in the circuit files the line 3 cz 67 68 means at moment 3 execute cz between qubit 67 and 68?
For a circuit consisting of a single qubit and gate executed on Bristlecone70 I get the following error python: tensor.cpp:709: void qflex::Tensor::reorder(std::vector<std::__cxx11::basic_string<char> >, qflex::s_type*): Assertion new_ordering_in_indices && indices_in_new_ordering' failed.
How should I handle such errors in the Python interface? Or what should I do for such errors not to appear?
This suggests an internal error in determining tensor index order...could you paste the circuit and ordering files used for this test?

Currently we include std::cout logs with every assertion in the C++ code; all that's needed to handle these is for Python to respect the std::cout logging.
I see. My circuit had a single qubit and a single Hadamard. The ordering was bristlecone_70.  The error was because the ordering did not fit to the circuit.
