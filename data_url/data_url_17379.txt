Per the spec, the coupling_map is a required field.  It is currently optional in BackendConfigurationSchema.  This is not needed as simulator backends return None for the coupling map
This can not be changed in 0.8 as terra 0.7 cannot load the ibmq_qasm_simulator if it has a coupling_map due to marshmallow validation.
