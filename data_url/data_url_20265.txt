For SPHINCS+-SHA256-* using the OpenSSL hash there are memory leaks because the hash context created by PREFIX_initialize_hash_function callee sha256_inc_init is not cleaned up.
Ideally there'd be some hook that allows proper destruction of hash_state_seeded at the end of sign.c functions
I saw there's been some work over at PQClean related to this -- once that's finished on the PQClean side, do we need to do anything extra here, other than re-sync the code with PQClean?
In case we solve it as described above, it's only the OQS specific shims src/common/pqclean_shims that need to be extended, can take care of that.
See PQClean/PQClean#247
