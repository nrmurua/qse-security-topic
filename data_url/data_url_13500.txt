When it is time to make a release, there are always a fair few PRs that are not added to the changelog, so it would be nice to automate this with a GH action like https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter. There are some drawbacks in what it could impose in PR naming rules to make filters work but it is pretty configurable and can automatically also list contributors for a release which might be nice to do.
