For example:
http://docs.yaoquantum.org/stable/man/registers.html#YaoBase.nactive

It will jump to https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/46ce4d79337bdd257ee2e3d2f4bb1c55ff0a5030/base/#L0-L8 .
I guess it relates to the code here:
https://github.com/QuantumBFS/YaoBase.jl/blob/master/src/utils/interface.jl#L30
Any idea how to fix it?
I think this is because we are doing this in a meta package. The Documenter is not able to figure out non-local packages for now.
part of this is fixed now by building the docs using dev, but this is still not fixed yet.
