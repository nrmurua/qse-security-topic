Currently, the latex output has multiple aesthetic issues that would be really helpful if fixed. I am listing the issues as follows -
1.A leading space is prefixed with the latex output string.
2. If there are multiple None terms together - Currently, it looks like this (multiple ldots) $\ldots+ \ldots+ \ldots $ . But it can be clubbed together to a single ldot $+ \ldots$
3. The notation in various textbooks follows the following - <sign> <term><bra/ket> but currently, the signs stick to the previous ket.
4. Can the terms be de-rationalized? Rationalizing the terms doesn't seem to make any sense to me if we're looking at the latex output.
@1ucian0 - How do I put in a code for all the test cases? Need some help here.
The latex output should closely resemble the textbook output.
Take a look at state_visualization.py
Hey, can I try working on this? Looks like issue still persists.
Hey @rishacha @1ucian0 ,
Is this issue still open? I'd like to try my hand at it.
@rajaschari - I'm waiting for a response from @1ucian0. Can you try pinging him on Slack?
Assigning to both, as it probably will require more than one PR. Thanks!
