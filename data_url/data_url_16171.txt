Attempting to bind a Parameter not in the circuit correctly raises:
Likewise attempting to bind a different Parameter instance of the same name correctly raises:
But attempting to bind using a non-Parameter type (like a string) silently passes:
Likewise for assign_parameters:
Even the examples above which are correctly raising, are raising from the wrong place and with the wrong error type. It's expected we catch these cases here:

There are tests covering these cases, but they should updated to check the type of error raised and the message:

I can work on this.
