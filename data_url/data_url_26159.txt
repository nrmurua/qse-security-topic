Task: Generate a collection of "n" random states each of dimension "d".
Note that this would also require us to pin qiskit as a dependency.
I want to work on this issue, it would be great if anyone assign this to me!
Hi @ankit-pn. Thank you for your interest in toqito and this issue.
If you are interested in this, let me provide a bit more implementation-dependent information that may be helpful.
Let me know if you have any questions, and thank you again for your interest and contribution, @ankit-pn
rand_states.py and test_rand_states.py doesn't exist, i should create them right?
The function [ rand_states ] that you have mentioned in this issue is correct ?
I should include this function alongside with its test according to instructions that you have given about?
rand_states.py and test_rand_states.py doesn't exist, i should create them right?
Yes, this would be part of the task. And I would suggest random_states.py and test_random_states.py as names instead to match the function name.
