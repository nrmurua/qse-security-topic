@ismaelfaro as we discussed i think it would be nice to make a juypter composer. This would be much like the one we have online and you activate it  using
this would go under the wrapper/juypter folder and when you change gates it changes the circuit object you passed it.
so the idea here is to include the Circuit Composer we're building as a jupyter notebook widget, it's in the backlog to be released in the next quarter!
I think this can be closed now -- it will be its own extension which @francabrera will release when complete.
