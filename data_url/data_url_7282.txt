When solving Stochastic Schr√∂dinger or Master equations, it is often interesting to know the time-dependent noise that was generated by the solver. For instance when simulating homodyne or heterodyne detection, the measurement signal for the $n$-th stochastic jump operator $C_n$ reads
$$\mathrm{d}Y_n = \sqrt{\eta}\langle C_n + C_n^\dagger\rangle \mathrm{d}t + \xi_n(t)$$
(Using the same notations as the documentation.)
While it is possible to get $\langle C_n + C_n^\dagger\rangle$ from the stochastic.master and stochastic.schrodinger solvers, I was not able to return $\xi_n(t)$. Is this possible to implement this feature?
Below is a simple workaround for anyone interested.
