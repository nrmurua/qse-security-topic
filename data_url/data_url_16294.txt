The formula above does not seem to implement a Gaussian square pulse
After logging into the IBM Q experience account and selecting the 'ibmq_rome' backend, run (fixing indents):

Bugs in the code above aside, the two curves in the plot above should be identical. But they are not. Is the formula different?
Report the correct formula for the Gaussian square pulse, the way it's created in the backend
âœ… Issue reproducible and has interesting results on different backends! The formula indeed needs to be rechecked! Since ibmq_rome is retired, the next closest cousins I could find was ibmq_manila. All tests done taking ibmq_manila as reference
Updated fixed code with imports -

Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
I am able to recreate the waveform with

There are two problems with the current documentation.
Please let me know if you wish to make the documentation updates @mrvee-qC, otherwise, I can take this on.
Please go ahead with the updates @taalexander! :)
On inspecting the latest docs, problem 1. has already been corrected.

I will add a note about the pulse being lifted.
