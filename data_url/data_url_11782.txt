In the class Operator() the evaluation in 'Pauli' or 'Grouped-Pauli' modes seems to be restricted to quantum registers named 'q'. At the moment it doesn't seem possible to create different registers (with different names) and evaluate an operator on each of them.
thanks for pointing out the issue, I created a PR #519 to address this issue. Basically, you will be able to provide your quantum register which is associated with the input circuit as an argument.
please let me know your thought. Thanks.
yes that sounds great. thanks a lot !
