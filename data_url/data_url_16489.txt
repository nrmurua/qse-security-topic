Simulating a circuit containing a controlled circuit with the Statevector class yields all zero amplitudes.
This is the case for different circuits, not just with a single X gate. Not calling control on the gate works correctly.
This gives me the correct result. Using Python 3.8, qiskit 0.19.6 and qiskit-terra 0.14.2

Hm, maybe this worked earlier, now it doesn't give zero amplitudes but breaks. I think this is a know bug with the quantum info due to nested quantum registers.
Closing as resolved by #5286 .
