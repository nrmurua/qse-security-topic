That's the actual length specified in PEP8.
Obviously this will involve a lot of minor modifications to files.
Technically it also says that comments or long blocks should be 72.
I think we should keep 80, PEP8 just says if everyone agrees then it is fine.
SGTM; leaving it at 80.
I mean there is a certain appeal of a line spacing that is a prime number!
