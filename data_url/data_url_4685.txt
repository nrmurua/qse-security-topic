Hi @mvsg2, thank you for opening this issue. Could you please copy-paste your full error traceback? If you can paste it as text instead of an image we might be able to get additional details. Thank you!
In the meantime, you can use Strawberry Fields on Xanadu Cloud. We have hosted Jupyter notebooks with Strawberry Fields pre-installed.
