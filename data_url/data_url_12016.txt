I had to try the example of qiskitâ€™s Traveling Salesman Problem with 3 nodes and executing it at IBM backend called simulator_statevector.Can execute and get the result normally.
But when trying to solve the TSP problem with more than 3 nodes,I changed n = 3 to n = 4.
And I changed backend from Aer.get_backend ('statevector_simulator') running on my device to provider.backend.simulator_statevector running on the IBM backend.
But the result that comes out with an error.
How should I fix it? Please give me some advice.
I found the answer, my method is to increase the Ansat number of reps from 5 to 7.
