Adding support for unitary decomposition.
Input should be unitary_decomp(qubits,matrix), output should be QASM code of rz and ry gates and cnot operations.
Suggestion: look into the possibility of splitting the step into 2.
to allow reuse.
you can define a Unitary class which can be used to instantiate unitaries like:
u1 = Unitary("uname", <matrix>)
This class should also provide a function decompose so that the unitaries can be decomposed as:
u1.decompose( <decomposition method/option> )
other functionalities can be added later based on need. Now this unitary (list of decomposed gates) can be added to a kernel as:
k.gate(u1, <qubits>)
@anneriet If this is merged (at least to a tested workable level), shall @imranashraf resolve this?
This is not yet merged. we can merge it if:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "new.py", line 6, in 
u_unitary = Unitary("U_name",U)
NameError: name 'Unitary' is not defined

Hey, which version of OpenQL are you using? For me it works when building OpenQL from the current "develop" branch
Can you please describe how to install latest version of openql with all dependences.
I try to install it by command pip qutechopenql.
That's in the docs: https://openql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#compilation-from-sources
I already done this. It is not working for me.
Please describe all possible command sequence.
For me,
cd OpenQL
git submodule update --init --recursive
sudo python setup.py install --user
works (is basicaly the same as the docs), make sure to (manually) install all the necessary packages and update the submodules (git submodule update --init --recursive), but I cannot help you more than this, and this is on linux, I would have no clue for windows or macOS.
These command gives me this Error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

With the addition of the Eigen library and some other changes in the backed, the windows compilation got broken. It should be fixed now though with PR #327. Let me know if it works so we can close this issue.
