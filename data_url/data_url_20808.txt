As observed by @baentsch in open-quantum-safe/liboqs#709 (comment), LEDA and HQC both make use of NIST seedexpander. But they do so in different ways: LEDA has it internal to the implementation whereas HQC includes it from PQClean's common.  We should pick one way and just do that.  Which way to go?
I think you're right and we should refactor it out of the schemes; as it was part of the "NIST API" apparently
LEDA has been removed and that's the only one that doesn't use it from the API.
