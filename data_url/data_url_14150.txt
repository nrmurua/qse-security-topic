fails with
TranspilerError: 'Chosen layout is not valid for the target disjoint connectivity'
run above
It should work
I guess this is because the trivial layout is disjoint.  There should be some workaround like a graph search that equals the trivial layout in the usual case
This is expected behavior. At the time we added support for disjoint connectivity graphs to the transpiler in #9840 it was a discussion point around how to handle level 0. The consensus at the time was that expectation for level 0 is to always use a trivial layout by default as the expected use case is for characterization experiments or hardware aware circuits, and in the case that a circuit was not routable because it required connectivity between disjoint connected components we should just error. This was recently brought up again in #10731 and we changed the error message to be a bit more clear in #10733. To use level 0 which isn't hardware aware on a disjoint backend you can just do transpile(..., layout_method="sabre") to explicitly say you want to use a heuristic layout.
