The cx_direction pass should not be run if the device coupling_map is symmetric.  Currently it is always run.
Rather, it should not be run if the is_direction_mapped property is set. This should be done via the CheckCnotDirection pass which we have but do not currently use.
The difference here is that it is trivial to check symmetry of the map. The check direction traverses the dag to look for cx gates, and then does a check against the coupling map.
I suggest a solution in #2316
