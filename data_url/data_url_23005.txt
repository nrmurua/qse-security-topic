Almost never, we are using the bandpass filter option. I therefore suggest to remove it and change the module as follows:
-> benefits: save 1 sine generator and multiplier per module (-> 4 IQ modules will become possible)
-> save all the gain multipliers that are never used
-> allows PLL, ALL etc.
We should monitor FPGA resources as to whether this allows scaling up the number of DSP inputs and outputs.
