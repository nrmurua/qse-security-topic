Trying to install qiskit from instructions here: qiskit-tutorial/INSTALL.md
Qiskit requires Python 3.5 or later. See https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra#dependencies
Good catch. We need dependency info in the the INSTALL.md. I added some in a new PR: #257
that would be helpful to mention :)
Also, worth explaining how you make the commands work when you ALSO have python 2.7 installed, please.
I changed some things around in the guide to help those that run into problems: PR #260
Closing if there are still issues please reopen. Thanks @quantumjim for the fix.
