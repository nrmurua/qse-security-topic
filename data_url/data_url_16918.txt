Using scaling=0.2 causes a zoom-in when drawing commands, and a zoom-out when drawing schedules.


As an aside, I think this should be called scale instead of scaling, to match the circuit drawers.
Hi ajavadia!
I've noticed that updating the scaling parameter as shown in the screenshot below adjusts Schedule.draw to attain the desired consistency



Thanks @tobeyOguney
