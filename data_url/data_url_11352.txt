Before raising this issue, I have already checked that I am:
OpenQAOA cannot be installed currently due to conflicting package requirements. Most likely due to the usage of an older version of the pyquil package.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
pip install openqaoa
clone openqaoa locally and use make dev-install-all
The package should be installed correctly
The current OpenQAOA version makes use of pyquil 3.5.4 to ignore breaking changes occuring with 4.X
We are releasing a hotfix removing openqaoa-pyquil from the global package temporarily and will work to resolve the issue.
In the meantime, this bug can be ignored by:
Note that openqaoa-pyquil can still be installed as a "standalone" package (still requires core).
