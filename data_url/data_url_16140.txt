Generating the inverse of a circuit using circuit.inverse() does not yield the correct circuit.
A minimal example is this:
Given any circuit, applying the circuit and then the inverse should yield an identity circuit. This is not the case for the minimal example.
The bug seems to be triggered by the generation of the control gate in combination with the custom gate I generated. I tried generating this gate as
But that gives similar problems. Perhaps the UnitaryGate([[-1,0],[0,-1]]) is optimized to UnitaryGate([[1,0],[0,1]]) in the calculation of the inverse?
Hi @peendebak ,
I am running the latest terra version 0.16.3, sha 7710880,
and for your particular example, I obtain identity matrix:
It seems that the bug related to your example was already addressed.
@molar-volume Thanks for the feedback. With the updated the qiskit-terra the example above indeed works. But for a variation with the UnitaryGate I still get an error when running a circuit with the inverse.
A minimal example:

The problem arises from UnitaryGate.control() with a subsequent call to inverse. To fix your problem, you can just change your generate_conditional_gate function to:
And here's a more minimal example showing the issue. Probably this comes from using the Isometry class.
