Hello,
there was a work https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00026  which generated GTH pseudopotentials for actinides.
The current file https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/data/GTH_POTENTIALS is up to Rn, plus U. Would be good to extend this file with new  pseudopotentials.
Thanks for the link!
Yes, it would be nice to add them to our library. It seems the required lines could be copied verbatim from the supporting information.
However, I'm not sure about the licensing situation here? Maybe somebody knows one of the authors?
Ah, indeed, the file https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/data/AcPP1_POTENTIALS  is in the master version, not in the 8.2.0 version which I have. At least one can update the paper reference in https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/data/AcPP1_POTENTIALS#L4-L5 .
And after, this ticket can be closed.
