Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Simulating a circuit should give feedback resource statistics used during simulation.
Describe the solution you'd like
An object that can be populated by simulator interfaces and returned with simulator calls.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter) -- but this does not mean Cirq has to implement it
P3 - it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
Thanks for filing @alexandrupaler! This sounds interesting - what kind of resource statistics are you looking for specifically?
Discussed at Cirq Cynq:
Suggestion: consider using https://docs.python.org/3/library/resource.html , which provides information about system resources used by a program.
