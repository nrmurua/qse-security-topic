Hello!
When I try to build an MPO with specific two-site terms, the energy found by DMRG is always zero. For example:
The variable builder.var_two_site_terms is not empty:
But the resulting energy is zero. If I use the generic term builder += 1.0, 'Z', 'Z', the resulting energy is -2.25. What I want is to build hamiltonians with site-dependent interaction strength. Am I building MPOs the wrong way?
Thank you!
Thanks for the report, this certainly look's like a bug! I'll take a closer look shortly.
This should now be fixed by 36f3b3e. However I might leave this open until you can confirm / don't run into any further bugs!
It's working fine now, thank you!
Hi, I'm sorry for reviving this issue, but I've found some other problems:
When N=2, this error occurs:
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'i' referenced before assignment
If I add a term only to a single pair, this error occurs:
ValueError: Size of label 'b' for operand 3 (3) does not match previous terms (2).
I'm sorry for not testing so thoroughly before. Thank you!
No worries, thanks for finding these now. The first issue should be fixed by 0de0a00.
The second might require a bit more work - essentially the MPO builder expects to find the same number of interaction terms everywhere (and thus build a constant bond MPO).
b2874b9 allows variable bond dimensions/mixed site specific terms so your second example should work now!
Closing as I think this is fixed, but feel free to reopen if you encouter other related issues @arturml.
I haven't had the time to test the changes, but I'll let you know if I encounter something. Thank you! :)
