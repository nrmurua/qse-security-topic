When running covalent --version on ubuntu 20.04 it returns an ImportError: cannot import name 'version' from 'covalent' from covalent/init.py

Both are on Fedora 35.
Quick Q @cjao , is this using the pip installed version or is it from pip install -e . editable version? If i remember right, the editable version was able to capture the version number. Its something to do with proper packaging of wheels that we are messing things a tiny bit.

Here is the key line from covalent/init.py:
