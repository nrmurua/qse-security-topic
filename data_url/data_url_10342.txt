dwave solvers --list should list all solvers available, not just the selected on by the configuration (file and/or environment variables).
After looking into this, it actually makes more sense to show the config-constrained list of solvers by default, but to provide --all/-a options (and/or --list-all) to ignore the solver definition set in config file/env.
