There is an error in the install_fftw.sh script:

The call to prepend-path is incorrect because of "=", I believe it should be
prepend_path PKG_CONFIG_PATH "$pkg_install_dir/lib/pkgconfig"
This results in install_fftw.sh overriding PKG_CONFIG_PATH instead of prepending to it.
Thanks for reporting! Fixed via #824.
