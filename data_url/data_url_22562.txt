On Peter's machine, this code fails with ValueError: cannot create an OBJECT array from memory buffer on the set_dataset call when run by the master. The PYON unit tests pass, and decoding the string outside of the master also works. The problem is not present on my or Joe's machine.
@whitequark can you still reproduce this? I have seen that failure as well but in different context (complex numbers) and fixed it there. If yes, what is the failing pyon serialization?
Nope, doesn't fail anymore.
@jordens What was the fix? It's not obvious from your commits.
I don't know.
