Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Currently, when people enter the orqviz GitHub repository with the intent to contribute, there are no open Issues and not many PRs. They will not know what might be low-hanging fruit to contribute.
Describe the solution you'd like
We (orqviz developers) should open Issues which are connected to how people can concretely contribute.
For example, we could provide links to existing tutorials which we believe can be readily enhanced with our visualization techniques. In such cases, potential contributors could work on such enhancements and reach out to the authors of the original tutorials.
Similarly, we can elaborate on future visualization techniques which we could experiment with. This may be done by external contributors.
