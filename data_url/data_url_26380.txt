c_check in OpenBLAS requires File::Temp to be available do detect AVX512, which is for example missing in minimal Fedora Docker images. Currently we disable that support anyway in OpenBLAS, but since we use OpenBLAS' facilities to detect capabilities in general...
The perl in OpenBLAS is also unhappy about en_US.UTF-8:
This means that en_US.UTF-8 is missing on that system and unrelated to the original issue reported here. Note: some systems have by default the C.UTF-8 locale instead of the en_US.UTF-8 installed as a minimal unicode locale.
unrelated to the original issue reported here.
You're right. I've opened #1128. Sorry for the noise.
