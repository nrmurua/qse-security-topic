Right now, pulse gates are not parsed by the disassembler. To fix this, qobj.config.calibrations would have to be parsed per job, and every qobj.experiment would have to be checked for config.calibrations as well. Each circuit would need every job cal, and its own experiment cals. Experiment cals overwrite job cals. Pulse instructions in each calibration would have to be disassembled, with input from qobj.config.pulse_library.
All changes should be made in disassemble.py. Methods from qobj/converters/pulse_instruction.py will likely be useful.
Hi, I would like to try this. Is the goal to return a list of circuits similar to _experiments_to_circuits or something else?
Hi, I'm just seeing your message. Are you still interested?
I'd love to work on this issue as well!
@Ahasan20 Thank you! Although I did label it "good first issue", it'll be a bit challenging. Feel free to DM me on Qiskit slack if you need help.
Hi @Ahasan20 any progress?
hey @1ucian0 yup i've been working on it here: #5661, dev's been a bit slow with college but we're getting there!
I am new to contributing but I would like to contribute to this if its ok.
Closed by #5661.
