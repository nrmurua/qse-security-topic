When calling observe_async from Python, we have to construct a lambda that gets added to the current QPU execution queue. When this lambda is ultimately executed, it is on a thread that does not have access to the Python GIL. This leads to a bug where a pybind type is being deallocated and can't because it hasn't acquired the GIL.
