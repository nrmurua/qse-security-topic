Full message:
Master is no longer failing because this was reverted (#625) - updated name to reflect this. The issue is now to update #471 so this error doesn't happen on Windows and can be merged back into master.
I believe this should be fixed by adding the most recent version of cython to the requirement, i.e add the line cython~=0.29.21 to requirements.txt. It seems to run fine on my computer, maybe @nathanshammah or @rmlarose can test this solution?
@elmandouh tested, still failing with same error I think. See #646.
Here's what we decided (Origin #678 (comment)):
(i) keep using pip, (ii) handle the pymc3 install in CI on windows as a special case, (iii) tell people if they want to use pymc3 on windows, they have to install whatever needs to be installed.
There were some updates to pymc3 and its dependencies which may have resolved this issue. I tried with earlier updates 0c1eca3, ffa1319, ffa1319) to no avail, but there have been further updates since then.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
This is being addressed in #646
