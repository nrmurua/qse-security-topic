Hi,
qpp::measure causes the following Eigen assert:
I've reproduced it with the following test: antoine-bussy@b873e7e
and fixed it this way: antoine-bussy@36b0343
The bug is that outstates is being initialized with square matrices, even though it stores vectors in this use case.
Do you want me to submit a PR?
Thanks! Good catch. I'll incorporate the fix into the current dev branch (where I'm fixing the other issue), so no need for a PR for this one.
@antoine-bussy Fixed on dev branch. In fact, there's no need for that resize second argument, so simply defining std::vector<expr_t<Derived>> outstates(Ks.size()); suffices.
Thanks!
I uncovered another "bug" stemming from my PR #110.
Let's take the case of qpp::measure
Point 2 is fine as long as users stick to ket and cmat. It doesn't work anymore when the input is a fixed-size vector and destructive = true, since outstates don't have the same dimension as the input anymore. So it's more a possibility of misuse rather than a bug.
I can think of 3 possible "fixes":
@vsoftco What do you think?
@antoine-bussy Yes, I bumped into that (when testing your code). I think the latest solution is the most straightforward, and least intrusive.
