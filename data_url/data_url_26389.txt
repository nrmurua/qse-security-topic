Dear all
There might be a typo in the code to calculate the wall potential (of a quartic wall)
see efunc - what is written there is effectively diff_ss**5 instead of the expected diff_ss**4
the fact that the derivative of the energy efunc is correct i.e. diff_ss**3 supports this conclusion.
As far as I see only the post-processing would be affected by this typo - but also only in a very limited number of cases as for example graph.F does not even utilize wallpotential of the COLVAR-1.metadynLog file
SUBROUTINE meta_walls(meta_env) (metadynamics_utils.F)
...
CASE (do_wall_quartic)
diff_ss = colvars(ih)%ss0-colvars(ih)%walls(iwall)%pos0
...
efunc = colvars(ih)%walls(iwall)%k_quartic*diff_ss*diff_ss**4
dfunc = 4.0_dp*colvars(ih)%walls(iwall)%k_quartic*diff_ss**3
Further the definition of the quartic wall potential in the manual (https://manual.cp2k.org/trunk/CP2K_INPUT/MOTION/FREE_ENERGY/METADYN/METAVAR/WALL/QUARTIC.html)
Does not correspond to the code in
SUBROUTINE metavar_read(metavar, extended_lagrange, langevin, icol, metavar_section) (metadynamics_utils.F)
 metavar%walls(i)%pos0 = metavar%walls(i)%pos+(0.05_dp/metavar%walls(i)%k_quartic**(0.25_dp))
instead of 1/(K^0.25) as specified in the manual 0.05/(K^0.25) is calculated (which is unpleasant but not really critical just adjust the manual)
