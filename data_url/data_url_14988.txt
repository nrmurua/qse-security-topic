Once Expr values are valid in some .condition and .target attributes in QuantumCircuit instructions, they need to be supported through the circuit_to_dag and dag_to_circuit converters.  Especially in circuit_to_dag, we must ensure that any implied classical dependencies between instructions are represented in the wires in the DAGCircuit.
The work here will mostly be in ensuring that DAGCircuit.apply_operation_back has this handling.  We should also ensure that DAGCircuit.apply_operation_front has the same handling.
Depends on #10223 and #10224.
