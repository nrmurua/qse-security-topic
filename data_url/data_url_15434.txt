I can't find instructions for building documentation locally for qiskit-terra in https://qiskit.org/documentation/contributing_to_qiskit.html#contributing-to-documentation nor https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md I think it would to add something similar to qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning#413 for qiskit-terra so that community contributors can follow to make documentation related contributions
It's here, right now: https://qiskit.org/documentation/contributing_to_qiskit.html#documenting-your-code.  It could be made more prominent, such as in Terra's contributing.md, though.
Thanks!
To locally build the element-specific documentation, run tox -edocs to compile and build the documentation locally and save the output to docs/_build/html.
Yeah I think adding to contributing.md would be a good idea. I would expect the "Contributing to Documentation" section to mention how to build documentation locally too.
I will mark this as a good first issue.
Adding to this, tox is used for running tests, building docs, etc. However, tox itself is not listed in requirements-dev.txt. I feel that after installing the packages listed in requirements-dev.txt, my environment should be ready to work on development.
Should we consider adding it to the list?
tox is independent of the requirements-dev.txt as it's a tool for manage your development virtual environments, package installation, and execution of test commands. Tox builds a virtualenv with a development install of the package and any additional testing tools. If you insist developers need to install requirements-dev first to install tox you end up duplicating the install of everything in the requirements list because first you install it in your working python env and then tox will install everything again in it's isolated testing venvs (you'd also needlessly install tox in the tox venv, but that's not as big a deal).
You also don't need tox to run anything, it's just the recommended entry point since it automates all of those steps for you so you don't need to do any of it manually (it also matches what we run in CI with your local environment).
I think I understand your point, @mtreinish. However, this does make me wonder whether my current setup is "optimal". Should we use the venv that tox creates for development? (as the python interpreter for the project)
The "Contributing to Documentation" section was removed in https://qiskit.org/documentation/contributing_to_qiskit.html#contributing-to-documentation I would like to suggest to add it back and improve it with clearer instructions on installing the dependencies.
To create a local environment for the documentation of this repository, the instructions are the following:
I want to create the content of the broken link https://qiskit.org/documentation/contributing_to_qiskit.html#contributing-to-documentation , but I am hitting the following error (like this one):
@HuangJunye could you help me with this issue? I can generate locally documentation of qiskit-terra but not the qiskit documentation.
@Pablohn26 I am not sure about this error.
Can you try this?
Hello. if the documentation is still needed, I would love to volunteer to work on this issue.
Thanks!
Hello @HuangJunye , I would also love to contribute to this if it's still open.
Hello!  i would like to contribute to this issue,
@uchoi91 @ayukumar11 @Raghav-Bell You've all expressed interest previously but this issue fell through the cracks.  If any of you are still looking to contribute to this issue reply here and I'll assign to the first responder.
@AngeloDanducci I am looking and can contribute to this.
when you assign me to it, I'll get rolling!
Thannks!
@uchoi91 assigned, thanks!
hey all.
I have created a section in contribution.md that discuss making documentation locally using tox, sphinx-build and make with recommending users to use tox cmd.
Thanks!
