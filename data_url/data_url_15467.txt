QuantumInstance.execute can be passed either a circuit or a list of circuits.  If passed a circuit, calling get_counts() on the result returns a dict.  If passed a list of circuits, it returns a list of dicts -- that is unless the list contains just a single circuit.  I would expect that type would depend only on the type what is passed to execute, not the length of the list (if it is a list).
I've had to work around this quirk in the QRAO prototype.
I would expect the return type of get_counts to depend only on which type was passed to execute, not the length of the list.
I tried the following modification, but it led to a few hundred test failures.
I am also not certain that this issue is limited to QuantumInstance, but that's where I noticed it.
If this issue is still open, I would love to give it a go
QuantumInstance is deprecated and soon to be removed. Primitives are now used for circuit execution and they provide the result back. Since this is around QuantumInstance I am going to close this - it seems I already did for the PR that was started to address this i.e #8114 but for some reason I overlooked closing this issue at that time.
