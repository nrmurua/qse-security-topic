And install_fftw.sh, line39:
The above combination of tools and libraries should work without separate FFTW library. MKL was found and is perfectly sufficient. CP2K source code is enabled for FFTW3 interface with either FFTW library or MKL (for the latter -D__MKL -D__FFTW3 is set).
Further, the GNU tool chain is used above along with Intel MPI - to my knowledge this requires -D__HAS_NO_MPI_MOD. Perhaps the install script can consider this. In the past -D__INTEL had some use but this is cleaned up and now based on the preprocessor symbols defined automatically by the compiler (similar to __GNUC__, etc).
Regarding __HAS_NO_MPI_MOD, I am working on DBCSR to consider this (CMake).

I sincerely appreciate your help!
Can you please check the make.log in build/fftw-3.3.8? This should contain more details about the error.
It seems that this issue was solved somehow. To be able to figure what actually failed we would need the mentioned log file.
If someone thinks that one or another topic discussed here needs attention, please open a separate issue.
