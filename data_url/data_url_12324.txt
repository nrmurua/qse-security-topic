I am using google colab and where I am using python 3.8. So, where tensorflow quantum is installed but when I try to import tensorflow quantum then it doesn't work!!! how can I fix ...... and google tensorflow quantum and version compatibility is really a pain!!!!
I honestly stopped using Colab with TFQ, so many issues with compatibility. But if you must, this worked for me: #782 (comment)
tried but didn't worked!! ðŸ˜‘
Dang, unlucky. Colab is a real mess now.
Hello, I understand that this is an alternative solution, but on qBraid TFQ and Tensorflow + Cirq are properly versioned and installable.
One thing to double check after activating the environment is to make sure your kernel is Python [ Tensorflow ] @Rayhan740  See video below:

I've been there myself with all the compatibility issues, not to mention I couldn't find the TFQ distribution for python 3.8 on my Mac M1. ðŸ¥²
yes I am using qbraid as an alternative to colab.
