The transpiler relies on some basic simulations for certain optimizations (example: #2134).
In order to not introduce dependency on Aer, it has to use BasicAer, but that means the circuit has to be unrolled to the u1, u2, u3, cx basis first. This is not ideal, as the transpiler may lose some optimization opportunities, say with 3-qubit gates.
Instead, BasicAer should just be able to simulate all fundamental basic gates.
This is moot with #2198
