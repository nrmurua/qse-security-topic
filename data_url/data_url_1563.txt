Dataclasses are implemented with somewhat complex metaprogramming, and
tooling (PyCharm, mypy) have special cases for dealing with classes
decorated with @dataclass. There is very little support (and no plans for
support) for decorators that wrap @dataclass like this.
See #4391 for new suggested way of making dataclasses serializable
