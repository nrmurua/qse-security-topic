New packages and new versions of packages are added the General registry by pull requests against this GitHub repository. It is highly recommended that you use Registrator.jl to automate this process. Registrator can either be used as a GitHub App or through a web interface, as decribed in the Registrator README.
When Registrator is triggered a pull request is opened against this repository. Pull requests that meet certain guidelines is merged automatically, see Automatic merging of pull requests. Other pull requests need to be manually reviewed and merged by a human.
It is highly recommended to also use TagBot, which automatically tags a release in your repository after the new release of your package is merged into the registry.
Registered packages must have an Open Source Initiative approved license, clearly marked via a LICENSE.md, LICENSE, COPYING or similarly named file in the package repository. Packages that wrap proprietary libraries are acceptable if the licenses of those libraries permit open source distribution of the Julia wrapper code.

I used the JuliaHub website
https://juliahub.com/
and it made
JuliaRegistries/General#46145
I guess it's not hard to run the GitHub bot, by using "@ JuliaRegistrator register" (remove the space between @ and J)
This is the issue from automatic merge:

Registration pull request updated: JuliaRegistries/General/46145
After the above pull request is merged, it is recommended that a tag is created on this repository for the registered package version.
This will be done automatically if the Julia TagBot GitHub Action is installed, or can be done manually through the github interface, or via:
Also, note the warning: This looks like a new registration that registers version 0.2.0.
Ideally, you should register an initial release with 0.0.1, 0.1.0 or 1.0.0 version numbers
This can be safely ignored. However, if you want to fix this you can do so. Call register() again after making the fix. This will update the Pull request.
It passed. So it will merge in 3 days.
