I was trying out Grover's search algorithm when encountered this problem. The plot_state_qsphere() function gives an error because the calculated RGBA values are not between 0-1. The goal was to display each iteration of Grover's algorithm step-by-step to properly visualize what's happening within the algorithm.
The code gives this error:-
Resultant qsphere in the output:-

This is my code and circuit:-

The implementation of GroversSearch()function is not important for the purpose of this issue. Please follow the circuit provided in the above image.
It should display a qsphere with the proper state representations and phase angles.
None.
Here is the code to reproduce this error:
Thanks @1ucian0 for posting the code and the solution to the bug. üëç
