On 6/19 PHASE_MODE_CONTINUOUS was working but PHASE_MODE_TRACKING was broken.
On 6/20 PHASE_MODE_TRACKING was fixed but PHASE_MODE_CONTINUOUS was not retested.
On 6/21 PHASE_MODE_TRACKING works but PHASE_MODE_CONTINUOUS is broken.

Here's a clearer illustration.

Quick test to see if this behavior is related to the timing of the FTW.




Do you still have any issue with a board flashed with the latest runtime from the conda packages? I pushed the bugfixes only recently. Do you have this commit: 87ea143
I will try to two suggestions you made. It will be a day or two. We are
back running on the old DDS system at the moment. -Joe

OK. Resolved in today's conda build.

Good. Thanks for the quick re-test!
