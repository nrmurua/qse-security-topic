In memory/network-starved environment, with (multipart) upload failures occurring, aggressive retry strategy might actually contribute to resource exhaustion.
We should try increasing http_retry_backoff_factor, decreasing number of concurrent upload threads and increasing timeouts, most notably read timeout, as mentioned in #439 (comment).
