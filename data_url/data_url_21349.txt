Using 3.0 on windows, if you only have one group in the applet dock and click on it, is there any way of deselecting it? If not, trying to create applets or groups from the GUI it automatically creates it within that group and there's no way of going one level higher.
Explicitly, from an empty applet dock,
Edit: I guess you have this problem as long as there only groups in the top level. Any new applet then created would have to be in one of the groups.
You can drag the applet out of the group to the top-level.
And as often, better behavior cannot be obtained without wrangling with Qt:
http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qabstractitemview.html#SelectionMode-enum
"When the user selects an item, any already-selected item becomes unselected, and the user cannot unselect the selected item by clicking on it."
Okay. If we can just drag it out that's easy enough.
Let's keep this issue open - small UI improvements like this, even though they are a PITA to program, can save some frustration to the user.
