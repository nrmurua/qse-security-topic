To enable a test of OpenQL, a copy of the assembler is directly put inside the assembly directory, which is an old version 0.2.0.
In this old version, the qisa_opcode.qmap file cannot be read during every assembling process and it is read during building the assembler.
The latest version of qisa_as (2.2.0) can read the qisa_opcode.qmap file. Also, it enables installing the assembler on the computer, so you do not require a copy of it. This could remove some unnecessary test failures.
The assembler can be found at here.
@gtaifu done in d3f3372. Updated the tests and README.md file to instruct the change that qisa-as now needs to be separately installed.
@imranashraf just out of curiosity, I would expect some tests to break with such a low level change. Do all tests still pass?
@AdriaanRol yes, all the tests pass. I just had to make small changes in test_QISA_assembler_present.py.
