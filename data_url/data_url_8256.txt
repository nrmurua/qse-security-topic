I need mcsolve result in row and column matrix as mentioned below. How can i got this because this code is showing error.
I'm not entirely sure what's being asked here.  mcsolve evolves the state psi0 by the given Hamiltonian for the given times, and returns a qutip.solver.Result object that contains various quantities, such as how the state evolved for each of the trajectories at a given time, and values of expectation operators at those times if e_ops is given.
This looks like a question that's best answered by reading the user guide on solving system dynamics.
