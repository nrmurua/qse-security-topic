Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Both the string and repr operators of SingleQubitCliffrodGate fall to its parent class which gives a confusing representaiton e.g.
Describe the solution you'd like
the representation should be simpler. For example for cirq.ops.SingleQubitCliffordGate.X it should be
cirq.ops.SingleQubitCliffordGate(_clifford_tableau=cirq.CliffordTableau(1, xs=np.array([[True], [False]]), zs=np.array([[False], [True]])))
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
I'd like to take this one up
