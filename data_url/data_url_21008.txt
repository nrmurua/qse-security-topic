I followed the documentation to update my QRL client to the newest version:
The installation fails, with error message:
QRL Command Line Interface version: 0.61.3
pip3 version: 9.0.3
python3 version: 3.5.2
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Edit: gcc/g++ version is 5.4.0
Uninstalled qrl and then tried again, still have the same issue.
It seems to be related to the boost version you have
Boost version: 1.54.0
Detected version of Boost is too old.  Requested version was 1.58
It is strange we have not seen this is integration tests.
The issue is that I have two boost installed, one in usr/local/include and one in usr/include. Typing
dpkg -s libboost-dev | grep 'Version'
gives me version 1.58 (which is the usr/include version), and if I try to upgrade it is going to tell me I have the latest version. However, when installing qrl, cmake instead finds the /usr/local/include version and thus complains.
Setting the environmental variable BOOST_ROOT to a different path does not make a difference, I would probably need to pass a flag to cmake that sets the proper oost path, but since cmake is run by the pip3 install command I am not sure how to do that.
I solved the issue, although I am not sure this is the recommended method. I modified the FindBoost.cmake file, and added
set(ENV{BOOST_ROOT} "/usr/include")
This will make sure that cmake finds the correct version of boost.
This is actually a qryptonight issue. I will open an issue in qryptonight and reference this one.
