Certain quadratic Hamiltonians become block-diagonal if the fermionic modes are ordered so that spin-up modes come before spin-down modes. In this case the circuit depth for preparing Slater determinants and diagonalizing a quadratic Hamiltonian can be reduced by a factor of 2 by noting that Givens rotations only need to be performed between modes with the same spin and doing the two spin sectors in parallel, as noted in https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04789. We should take advantage of this symmetry in the routines for Slater determinant preparation.
This is also necessary if one wants to prepare Slater determinants with specific spin symmetries.
This was done in quantumlib/OpenFermion-Cirq#281.
