Initializing a circuit via circuit.initialize() with labels results in :
The statevector of the simulated circuit should be returned.
No response

If I'm not mistaken, this issue happens on or before the sim.run call. After that is called, I get a warning saying
"Simulation failed and returned the following error message:
ERROR: Failed to load qobj: Unable to cast Python instance to C++ type (compile in debug mode for details)"
This makes the results' data attribute not have the required properties.

Yeah, I somehow forgot to supply the whole error message. I updated it accordingly now.

Some of my students stumbled upon the same issue.
circ.initialize('+++') seems to create density matrices by default. I could make it run as follows:
I'll debug in more detail, if I find the time

A possible workaround is to decompose ahead circ.decompose().decompose()

One more workaround I found was this one:
Moving this to Aer. In particular, because the Failed to load qobj: Unable to cast Python instance to C++ type part.
