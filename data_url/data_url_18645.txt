Test failure when running make test. Backtrace below. Hoping I didn't just forget to git pull again!
Git bisect points to e66d847. It looks like compiler-rewrite-does-not-apply is still signaled a few places in the compressor code, namely in src/compressor/rewriting-rule-data-type.lisp and src/compressor/rewriting-rules.lisp.
Not sure if we want to revert e66d847, or nix the remaining uses of compiler-rewrite-does-not-apply.
Testing a revert now. PR coming soon, assuming tests pass.
Reinstating compiler-rewrite-does-not-apply fixes the above error, but make test still fails further down the line. Investigating.
oh, shit, that commit belongs on the annotated-compilers branch and not on master. my apologies to everyone! a case study in the dangers of having the ability to push to master from remote.
I can't fix this at the moment, but I'm happy to approve and merge a PR reverting this commit.
The second test failure I alluded to above appears to have cleared up with a make clean clean-cache. I'm going to run make test in a loop to make sure it wasn't just an intermittent failure.  Once it passes a handful of times in a row, I'll send the PR.

No worries. At least it's easy to revert :-)
I ran make test ~ 5 more times, and got no further failures.
