Im reading through acquisition module and related stuff to find the bugs in scope.
I found that acquisition module has a method kill_timers which is however never called. I have renamed it to _clear().
I have implemented all module cleanup stuff in the function _clear(), which is also defined by default in the Module class. I believe we should simply name everything that is related to cleanup to _clear().
everything should be called _clear now!
