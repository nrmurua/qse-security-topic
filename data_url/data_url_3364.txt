When having multricontrolled qubits, as far as I understand I have to multiple times apply .controlled modifier on the original gate. Is it possible to add a syntax sugar so that in the controlled method we simply put for example list of qubits?
@adamglos92 I think that's a useful addition, and likely easy to implement.  If you have the time, we would welcome a pull request :D
(You can probably piggy-back on the current implementation of Gate.controlled() by dispatching on the type of the input: if it's a number, do the normal thing; it it's a list of numbers, apply a control using the first number and then recursively call Gate.controlled() on the rest of the list.)
I guess this issue is going to be closed due to #1196. I am currently working on an introduction course to Forest SDK (https://gitlab.com/qkitchen/qpool2019/-/tree/forest_sdk), when I would use this syntax sugar a lot. Do You plan to make a new version of pyquil soon?
Indeed. Likely middle of next week.
