Ask workshop attendees, upon invitation, to communicate or bring their pet algorithm to the mitiq garage.
@rmlarose can you check how to use the IBM token to make the IBM Q tutorial work on the jupyterhub? I updated it and it gives me, predictably, this error:
If you find a way to make it work, we can add this bit of information in the notebook itself. "If you are running it from JupyterHub, ..."
I wonder if this issue is related, but I think not. On the JupyterHub, this is the mitiq.about() table
Ok, just by copying the token from my IBM Q account worked fine for the notebook on jupyterhub. So this seems solved. On my machine I saved my account.
@rmlarose, I was noticing: The notebook takes a bit to run, also on the hub. Could you change its workshop version a bit so that it takes less to run? Already in Part 1,
this cell takes a while.
Unfortunately the runtime is determined by the queue. That's the cell which takes the longest to run because the factory sends jobs sequentially. After that they are batched.
The only way to speed it up is to use a simulator, but that would involved adding noise to the circuit.
