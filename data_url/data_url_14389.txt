As part of the Qiskit documentation content restructuring efforts, we are going add how-to guides to Terra. This issue serves as a discussion thread for the content that needs to be added.
#7965 was to create an "example" only, while this issue is for discussing the overall content structure and topics for all how-to guides in Terra.
This is the initial draft. Most of the content will be converted from existing tutorials in qiskit-tutorials repo
Not sure about these topics
Any comments for existing topics and suggestions for new topics are welcome!
@mtreinish volunteered to write the how-to guides for transpilers section
