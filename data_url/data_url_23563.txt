For reference the output of the print commands is.
@thibaudruelle I took the liberty of modifying your example slightly so that is can be executed without any other imports. It it not trivially obvious that the output of get_data should be equivalent to the output of get_parameter_data. I assume that the issue are the additional None columns?
@jenshnielsen I have a different print output running the example:
I agree get_parameter_data and get_data should not necessarily return the same output. What I find misleading is that the first value of 'B' being array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]), ds.get_data('B', start=1,end=1) returns None, which seems wrong to me.
I went into the code and it looks like the sql query in get_parameter_data has an extra "WHERE {param} IS NOT NULL" which I believe might fix get_data.
Note that this issue was not present some time ago. The change in the behavior of get_data was likely caused by a change in how the data is saved in the database. Using commit 68d1246, the same code returns:
get_data has been replaced by get_paramter_data which does not have these issues
