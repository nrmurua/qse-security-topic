error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
MAC os Mojave, python 3.6.4. How to fix this?
Try conda install gcc.
Try conda install gcc.
Does that mean I should use gcc from the Anaconda directory?
I don’t know. It worked for me when I tried to install QuTiP from source —with-openmp. The error was a different and I am on a different MacOS (I also tried a conda install llvm, but what worked was gcc for me, with openmp). I understand that you trying to install QuTiP? If so, how? conda / source / pip? Consider doing it via conda if you are interested in the stable version release (4.3), by activating the conda-forge channel as detailed in the documentation. If QuTiP is installed and you receive this error while doing a specific task, can you copy paste the message of qutip.about() here?

I am installing QuTip from compiling the source code, because I want to use MKL. I didn't use the --with-openmp option as  MKL is already openmp threaded.
After "conda install gcc" the compilation is passed and QuTip can be so far used without problems. Thanks for your help.
Good. Leaving this issue open until we update (or evaluate updating) the documentation on Mac installation.
I had this issue as well, and conda install gcc was insufficient.
What appears to have worked for me is:
@Himorask can you please give details on your OS and QuTiP installation?
@nathanshammah
OSX High Sierra, qutip built from source locally. Built with GCC-8 through homebrew and gcc select. Was having this problem with the stock compiler and such as well, which is why I started trying alternatives.
I believe I did something similar. I installed GCC-8 through homebrew using:
brew install gcc
I then gave the path to that gcc install which is stored in the /usr/local/bin by default I believe.
CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-8 python setup.py develop --with-openmp
I did not have any problems.

Hi, I also faced this problem and I can't find qutiprc file in my home directory. Do you know where it could be? Thanks!
You can test with the 4.4.0 conda / pip release.
I think this is closed by v. 4.5.1.
