Currently, the implementation of CoherentResults.get_state() and CoherentResults.get_final_state() accepts options like ignore_global_phase and reduce_to_basis, but the implementation of these methods is assuming the state is a state vector.
When the state is a density matrix (eg after simulation with effective noise channels), calling CoherentResults.get_state() with these options fails.
At best, we should find a way to extend them for density matrices. At a minimum, a NotImplementedError should be raised.
