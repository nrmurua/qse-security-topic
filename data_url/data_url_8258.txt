I have some detail information for the GSoC 2020  project "Error mitigation in QuTiP". Unfortunately, I don't have writing access to the QuTiP GitHub Wiki page. I post it here so if anyone finding it nice could copy it to the Wiki page.
I add some details based on the original description:
From the QuTiP 4.5 release, the qutip.qip module now contains the noisy quantum circuit simulator (which was a GSoC project) providing enhanced features for a pulse-level description of quantum circuits and noise models. A new class Processor and several subclasses are added to represent different platforms for quantum computing. They can transfer a quantum circuit into the corresponding control sequence and simulate the dynamics with QuTiP solvers. Different noise models can be added to qutip.qip.noise to simulate noise in a quantum device.
This module is still young and many features can be improved, including new device models, new noise models and integration with the existing general framework for quantum circuits (qutip.qip.circuit). There are also possible applications such as error mitigation techniques [1-3].
The tutorial notebooks can be found at http://qutip.org/tutorials.html#nisq. A recent presentation on the FOSDEM conference may help you get an overview (https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/quantum_qutip/). See also the Github Project page for a collection of related issues and ongoing Pull Requests.
Also, the last outcomes have some overlap with the last project. Although I also find this circuit importation very important, I guess two projects should not have overlap if they are both selected.
