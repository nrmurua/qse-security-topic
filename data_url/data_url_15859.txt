When building a parameterized circuit where a large number of gates re-use a comparatively small number of parameters, QuantumCircuit._check_dup_param_spec becomes a performance bottleneck.
For example, circuit_construction.ParameterizedCircuitConstructionBench.time_build_parameterized_circuit takes 90s to build a 131k gate circuit with 8 distinct parameters, vs. <5s to build a 131k gate circuit with anything more than 128 parameters:

Since the structure of the ParameterTable is dict mapping Parameter instances to lists of Instructions, each call to _check_dup_param_spec must walk the entire Instruction list to look for a match. One option would be to convert the list to a dict, which could be efficiently checked for membership.
