The acquire_alignment configuration from the backend is being stored in the aquire_alignment property of Target
Since this is just a misspelling, there is nothing to reproduce.
aquire_alignment should be renamed acquire_alignment with an appropriate deprecation period for continued use of aquire_alignment.

Thank you for reporting this bug. We are aware of this but we have decided not to correct it because of the overhead of handling the deprecation cycle. #7734 (comment)
@mtreinish What do you think about this?
Hmm, #7734 was an immediate switch to the new spelling. In #8423 I provided backwards compatibility. Personally, I am more interested in being able to use the correct spelling than in forcing other users to stop using the incorrect spelling. We could possibly leave the misspelled alias indefinitely. On the other hand, I don't think BackendV2 adoption has spread that much yet, so there is still time to change without much disruption. A GitHub search just finds runtime, provider (no PyPI release yet), and experiments (where we alias it back to the correct spelling) as other repos using it (besides doc translations).
@wshanks We had a discussion in the Terra meeting and the the consensus was that we can correct the typo. I have assigned myself to review your PR. I will try to review it this week. Thanks!
