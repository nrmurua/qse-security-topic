Initializer should use at most 2^(n+1)-2n cnots (arXiv:quant-ph/0406176).
Cost to initialize a 4 qubits state uses
Number of cnots (optimization_level=0):  44
Number of cnots (optimization_level=3):  26
max number of cnots:  24
There's another implementation for arbitrary m x n isometries which can also be used for state preparation, which should be more efficient. In your example you can test it by using
When I'm running this I'm getting 11 CX gates, for both, optimization level 0 as well as 3. ðŸ™‚ We probably should make initialize use the isometry per default, if there's no other advantage to the initialize method.
@Cryoris, thanks for the reference. I'll take a look at arXiv:1501.06911 .
I tested using the isometry method and got a different result.
With this configuration initialize (in PR #4183) outputs the desired vector with 22 cnots
and isometry outputs a different vector with 11 cnots
@adjs Are those two states the same up to global phase?
If not this is a bug and should be filed.
