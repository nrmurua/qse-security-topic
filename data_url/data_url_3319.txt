Code block
ccnot_matrix is not a unitary matrix.
If you take the conjugate transpose (transpose then complex conjugate of the given matrix), then multiply we should get the identity.
Suppose for a matrix $U$, then the conjugate transpose $U^\dagger$, we should have
$UU^\dagger = U^\dagger U = UU^{-1} = I,$
$I$ being the identity matrix.
Also, check the identity matrix.

@fieldofnodes It looks like there is simply a typo in your definition of CCNOT. The bottom row should start with a 0 instead of a 1.
The typo is in the latest stable version, I copied and pasted that.
I'm not seeing it. The definition in simulation.matrices on the latest stable version (v3.2.1) looks correct: https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/blob/v3.2.1/pyquil/simulation/matrices.py#L140.
There's also a docstring in gates which is also correct: https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/blob/v3.2.1/pyquil/gates.py#L323.
Neither has been changed in the last three years or so.
Are you referring to something else?
