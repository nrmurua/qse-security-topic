Is there a way to disable Nightly Upload to Test PyPI in a fork and not have future pull requests affected ? I have Actions enabled in my fork and every night I get an error Nightly Upload to Test PyPI workflow run failed for master branch. I could edit the workflow file for my fork but I was thinking this would end up causing issues if I want to merge something with the Unitary Fund master.
Enable Actions in a fork.

Closing this for now because there's already an issue for this - #581
I noticed it after creating a new issue.
