Expected behavior: when calling states.all_fock_probs() on a pure Fock state, a 1D array of probabilities is returned.
Actual behavior: as per the docstring, the array should be N-dimensional, where N is the number of modes, and with each dimension having size cutoff_dim. This works for mixed states, but not pure states.
