The fake backends have different max_shots that makes usage difficult when switching between them. E.g.:
some are hard coded to 65536 like

while others are at 8192 as obtained from the actual device config.
A couple of fake backends, the 2 off the top of my head are poughkeepsie and melbourne, do not use the full configuration snapshots because they cause issues. In the case of melbourne it's because a large portion of terra's unittests are written using the fake melbourne backend back when it was 14 qubits. Switching it to 15 like in it's current configuration means we would have to update a very large number of tests which doesn't ever seem worth the effort.
For poughkeepsie (and probably any other ones not using the snapshots) the devices are retired and the current snapshots we can get from the api are incorrect or have other issues (see #4329 where we discussed this before).
That being said we can update the max shots in the hard coded configurations to be 8192 and consistent with the other devices, that's an easy change and how I would recommend resolving this.
I would like to work on this
