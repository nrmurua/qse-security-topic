Hi
I used the updated liboqs, but I get still the below install error. i.e. PICNIC related keys can not be created.
/usr/local/ssh_config already exists, install will not overwrite
/usr/local/sshd_config already exists, install will not overwrite
/usr/local/moduli already exists, install will not overwrite
ssh-keygen: generating new host keys: PICNIC_L1FULL PICNIC3_L1 RAINBOW_V_CLASSIC /bin/sh: line 2: 26256 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) ./ssh-keygen -A
make: *** [Makefile:391: host-key] Error 139

I can comment them out of ssh-keygen.c and can install the package/
.
Thank you
Markus
Hi Markus, is it only Picnic keys that fail or all PQ-signature algorithms (say, dilithium3, too)?
These 8 fail:
PICNIC_L1FULL
PICNIC3_L1
RAINBOW_V_CLASSIC
RSA3072_PICNIC_L1FULL
RSA3072_PICNIC3_L1
P256_PICNIC_L1FULL
P256_PICNIC3_L1
P521_RAINBOW_V_CLASSIC
Markus
Thanks for this information. Do you have urgent need for these algorithms or can you make do for now with the rest? We'd prefer to look into this issue in the new code base (after #91 is resolved): OK for you?
Hi Michael,
There is no urgency. It is just a feedback which might help improve it.
Markus
Thanks again. FYI, running on PR-branch mb-v8test the problem you describe does not seem to happen (activating some more algs for test purposes -- all using cygwin):
--> Will probably now create a cygwin-based CI environment for oqs-openssh (v8.4) to catch such things going forward. Sufficient for you? If so, you'll be notified when this has landed.
If you have time, could you please check branch OQS-v8 as to whether this "behaves better" wrt to this issue and your use case? We'll soon make it the new "main" branch, deprecating support for opensshv7. Thanks in advance for your feedback.
Hi Michael,
This branch worked w/o issues.
Markus
Thanks for this confirmation. So we'll close this issue when #92 closes.
