Could you please update the README file with a notice about the gcc version requirement?
I had recently failed to compile QuEST with gcc, only to realize that I needed to downgrade my gcc version from 9 to 8. (9 is now the default with ubuntu >= 19.10).
Hi Hongxiang,
gcc-9 (9.3.0) compiles fine for me on MacOS, so you'll have to give me more info (e.g. build log). While I appreciate your frustration, no, providing a list of all compatible compilers and versions is impractical. In any case, we try to make QuEST's compatibility as wide as possible.
You've possibly been bit by a change in syntax of gcc-9's default OpenMP version 5.0 (I assume you were compiling with MULTITHREADED=1). Though not documented (though I may misremember), variables not explicitly denoted in the OpenMP pragma are no longer assumed shared. We'll have to update QuEST's multithreading code to correct this. You'll appreciate this is a game of cat-and-mouse with new compilers.
Thank Tyson.
Yes I agree that providing the exact specification would be difficult.
I think you are right as the error message I had (attached) is related to
I will give it another try by tweaking the MULTITHREADED variable later.

will definitely allow gcc-9 to compile. I'll close this issue, since the culprit is #235
