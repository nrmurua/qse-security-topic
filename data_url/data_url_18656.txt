A user ran into this bug when running on the QPU. The program
causes the error (during the rewrite-arithmetic transform)
when targeting the lattice Aspen-4-4Q-A.
Exploring this locally, I find that a JUMP/LABEL is produced by the compiler:
Calling rewrite-arithmetic on the above causes the aforementioned error
However, I notice that the JUMP/LABEL only appear for some lattices. If I instead target a fully-connected device, the (seemingly superfluous) JUMP/LABEL goes away
And the above can enjoy a rewrite-arithmetic without error.
The error occurs because rewrite-arithmetic does not include a method for jump-target objects. Why this issue is coming up now, I don't know.
