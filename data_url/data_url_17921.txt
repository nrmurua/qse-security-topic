timeout setting only used for _wait_for_result but not _wait_for_submission.
So, Qiskit raises the Timeout error after 60 seconds regardless of the setting of timeout.
related codes:
_wait_for_result

_wait_for_submission
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/backends/ibmq/ibmqjob.py#L400
timeout setting should be passed to _wait_for_submission as well.
pass the timeout  in _wait_for_result to  _wait_for_submission.
@delapuente can we link this to the epic on the redo of backends.
I don't think this belongs to the authentication effort but we can discuss it in the next review if you want.
