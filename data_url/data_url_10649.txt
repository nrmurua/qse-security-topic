To support the principal idea behind client/solver decoupling in #288/#317, and after dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client#425 has been implemented (and released), we would like to select the best available QPU (from the samplers' code), but allow the solver to be overridden by user/environment.
See #313, #314, dwavesystems/dwave-hybrid#228, dwavesystems/dwave-hybrid#186.
