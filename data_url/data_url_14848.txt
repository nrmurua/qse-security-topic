First the pass manager is awesome I have not used it for a while and it is really powerful and improved a lot. I personally don't see why we need to use the transpile function anymore (we should seriously consider depreciating it). This being said the generate_preset_pass_manager passes I think we should make a bit more user friendly.
I would make it so that
should work and not need me to make an object CouplingMap to pass into the generate_preset_pass_manager function.
I would like to take this issue
Thanks, I've assigned you!
