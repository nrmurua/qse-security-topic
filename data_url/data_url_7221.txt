A pedagogical introduction to the core concepts in trapped ions (state preparation, single-ion operations, entanglement-operations).
We could have a section on "what does a trapped ion experimentalist do?"
This would go into a "Learn" section of examples.ionsim.org.
It would show that the Ion can be configured.
From Joe:
It would also be nice to have an example of something that involves continuously driving a short-lived state, like optical pumping or Doppler cooling. I think we'd have to use the QuantumOptics semiclassical solver in order to for this to be efficient, but I'm not sure -- never tried it before. Here's a related QuantumOptics example: https://docs.qojulia.org/examples/lasing-and-cooling/
