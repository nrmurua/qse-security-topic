I am able to transpile a cp gate into using ['u', 'cx'] as basis gates, but I am unable to transpile a cx gate using ['u', 'cp']. I want to be able to use ['u', 'cp'] as the transpilation target for more advanced circuits, but it does not work. Additionally, trying to transpile to ['u', 'crz'] also fails.
Transpilation  should work in both directions, and ['u', 'cp'] should be a complete gate set.
I believe this is an issue with the way the transpiler runs; I don't understand all of the details of the transpiler to offer any useful suggestions.
I'm hoping #6784 can be extended to cover this situation
This can be handled by adding a rule from cx to cphase+u and crz+u to the equivalence library for the standard gates: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/75e06dc915f764ea4e5c1a57097e980e9d01b119/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/equivalence_library.py#L620 .
@kdk if possible, I'd like to work on this!
As far as I understood, I would need to add a decomposition of CX into CP + U and CRZ + U in the file you linked. Is that right?

Hi @epelaaez , that's right. See #7007 for a similar fix.
