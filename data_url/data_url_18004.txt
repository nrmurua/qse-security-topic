Right now there is no centralized coverage collection and people have to generate coverage reports manually. It would be good to setup coveralls (or a similar service) to collect coverage data locally so we just have a central location to check the current status of test coverage.
We don't need to turn on coveralls commenting or add a coverage badge to the README. We don't really want people to read too much into the coverage numbers, just have a place where we can check the status.
