When copying a QuantumCircuit with deepcopy, the name of circuit will not be automatically updated.
Thus, the results are wrong trying to get results based on circuit object.
The results should be consistent with provided circuit object.
The results are still based on circuit name rather than circuit object.
No idea.
c and c2 will produce the same statevector.
A workaround is #389 .
