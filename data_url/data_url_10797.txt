Description

To Reproduce
Take a look
Expected behavior
In the past the Python interface was documented here
Environment:
Additional context
I'm hopeful unified docs in the SDK solves this
WORKAROUND: for now users can see Python IF in the SDK docs, https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/docs_minorminer/source/reference/pythondocs.html.
(Need to get the C interface working there still.)
We will also need to update minorminer to use a newer sphinx, blocks dwavesystems/dwave-ocean-sdk#43
