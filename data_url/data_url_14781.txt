When exporting QuantumCircuit to OpenQASM U gate exported as 'u' instead of 'U' this leads to error when importing generated OpenQASM code using qasm2.loads()
Step to reproduce:
Run program:
Output:
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[1];
u(0.3,0.2,0.1) q[0];
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:\work\1\python\tele2.py", line 12, in 
circuit = qasm2.loads( qq );
File "C:\work\quantum\qiskit\lib\site-packages\qiskit\qasm2_init_.py", line 604, in loads
return _parse.from_bytecode(
File "C:\work\quantum\qiskit\lib\site-packages\qiskit\qasm2\parse.py", line 214, in from_bytecode
for op in bc:
qiskit.qasm2.exceptions.QASM2ParseError: ":4,0: 'u' is not defined in this scope"
But if replace in generated code last line to "U(0.3,0.2,0.1) q[0];" then code imported correctly
Thanks for opening an issue, @sergeysalata! Can you provide a URL where the code appears?

Looks like this belongs in the Qiskit/qiskit repo rather than the qiskit/documentation repo. I'll transfer the issue. EDITED TO ADD: "transfer issue" isn't working for me!... @sergeysalata can you please open your issue here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/new/choose
