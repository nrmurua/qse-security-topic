We should see if we can get the circuit construction time down, perhaps by invoking a builder pattern.
Here is an example of the speed of circuit construction (variance will be quite high, just doing a single time), but this is good for order of magnitudes
which produces the following

If you create a list of the qubits and then create a circuit from the list, that should give much faster construction times than appending to the circuit one-by-one.

I believe this can be closed after #5898
