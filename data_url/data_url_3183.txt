This is a general list of issues that can be broken out into smaller issues, but I wanted to get them down.
Props to @ecpeterson for writing these. I'm just the messenger. In general, these center around how easy (or not easy) it is to use the QVM with pyQuil.
ValueError: PyQVM can only run run-and-measure style programs: Qubit 0's last operation is a gate
There are QVM and QVMConnection objects. Why? When is one preferred over the other? Why does QVM.run() say it returns bitstrings when actually it returns a QVM object.
Why doesn't PyQVM use Wavefunction to back its wavefunction amplitudes?
Some work on improving pyqvm here: https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/pull/874/files
Some notes from @joshcombes about connections with forest.benchmarking:
Point 6: There are some visualization routines implemented at https://github.com/rigetti/forest-benchmarking/blob/master/forest/benchmarking/plotting/ . Could be that other visualization routines belong here too.
Point 7: There are some things along these lines: https://github.com/rigetti/forest-benchmarking/blob/superoperator-cleanup/forest/benchmarking/superoperator_conversion.py .
Point 10: Also some related things: https://github.com/rigetti/forest-benchmarking/blob/master/forest/benchmarking/random_operators.py . It would be nice if whatever was envisioned for 10 at least made contact with this.
Point 12: have u considered PyQVM
Re: Point 6 & Point 7: Plot the Pauli Transfer Matrix representation for processes, using @joshcombes's code @ecpeterson pointed to.  States should be plotted in a similar manner using The Real Density Matrix™️  representation (Pauli basis representation of the density matrix put into a matrix format).  That is not in forest.benchmarking yet, but should be easy to add.
Re: Point 11: Batch mode for QPUs too, please @stylewarning . Let's make this happen.
Point 6: I just noticed there is also plot_pauli_transfer_matrix in https://github.com/rigetti/forest-benchmarking/blob/master/forest/benchmarking/tomography.py . I'm not saying either are great but we should probably make one great :) We should not forget the grove code too.
The one in forest-benchmarking is, I think, superior to mine.

@marcusps What does batch mode mean for a QPU if you can send it jobs as fast as it can process them with no competition?
There are still advantages to this (as evidenced by internal usage):
For example in Python you can do something like this:
