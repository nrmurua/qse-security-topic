We recently (#498) introduced a parametric compilation feature for gates described by time-independent Hamiltonians. The technique implemented there works for any number of qubits, but it has no guarantee on optimality of circuit depth. Indeed, in the two-qubit case of XX + YY it emits a circuit with 6 CZs, but a 2 CZ circuit exists:
There is room for an extension of the CZ-targeting techniques found in src/compilers/approx.lisp to give improved circuits in the 2Q case.
Note: I don't think this can be trampolined to from the n-qubit case.
