Currently the documentation PDF has to be built locally for each release.
Build the documentation in a GitHub action either for each push or when deploying a release.
Hi, I can work on this issue.
The HTML Documentation is uploaded to qutip_html_docs in the GitHub Action. Is there anything similar for the PDF docs?
