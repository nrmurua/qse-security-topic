Not sure if this is a Sphinx issue or an RTD issue.
But we want to allow all versions of Toqito's docs to be accessible. This would be similar to Mitiq's documentation.

Right now, only the latest and stable versions of Toqito's docs can be accessed.

Also, change the 'default' version of docs to be stable not latest.

Is fixed through setttings in RTD and branches discussed in #331.
Did not require a PR.
