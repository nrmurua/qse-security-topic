I am installing ScaffCC and it distributes gridsynth in binary. But it uses a newer LIBC version than I have. Source files are not available. Are they available from any other site?
Yes. Our rotation generation relies on the gridsynth package by P. Selinger et al. You can find the source files on their website, as cited in the compiler. We will update our documentation with instructions on installing gridsynth from source. Thank you @gomeztato for bring this up!
