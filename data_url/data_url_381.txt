Each CI run should also produce the CUDA Quantum docs as an artifact.
The pipeline should fail if there are any warnings or errors during the docs build.
Note that right now, we suppress the warning for missing documentation, so unfortunately, the pipeline will not yet detect this automatically - more updates are needed to reenable this warning.
Added in #66.
