It appears to define four functions which aren't used anywhere. Am I missing something?
The are used here https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/blob/master/mitiq/__init__.py . The intention is to raise a deprectation error when people try to use from mitiq import mitigate_executor/zne_decorator/execute_with_zne instead of from mitiq.zne import mitigate_executor/zne_decorator/execute_with_zne.
