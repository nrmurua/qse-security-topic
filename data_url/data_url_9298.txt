to make the optimizer benchmark easier, I build up a set of tools to run a MIS task with certain configuration automatically on a EC2 instance spawned via spot instance and then store the result data into S3.
This presumably provides the same pipeline for running general emulator jobs on AWS. one can find examples in the test folder of the following package
The implementation is extracted here: https://github.com/Happy-Diode/OptBenchmarkTools.jl
a few notes on tricky parts I spent a long time on:
the current pipeline works as following:
(remember to set the random seed for each process to make sure each process is identical)
I disabled the async progress counter for now since this only works on single node, we can count the progress manually by looking at uploaded data on AWS S3 later.
OK, lesson learned, don't use Julia distributed, ssh has a maximum connnection limit, and the process easily dies.
