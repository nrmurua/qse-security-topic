As discussed in the previous meeting, an error simulation that does not require more memory is a good alternative in order to test noise effects on larger quantum circuits.
This approach is not fast, as one will have to compute the noisy circuit every time a measurement is made, but might be the only alternative in cases where there is not enough memory to store the density matrices.
@stavros11 what is the status of this?
As of #276 this should be implemented for most noise channels. Noise is simulated without density matrices by executing state vector simulation multiple times with random choices for the noise gates.
