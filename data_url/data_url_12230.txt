Let’s make the folder community /games be a place where all the cool games people have come up with.
I think it can be linked to by the main index.ipynb but I let @quantumjim come up with how this folder should be arranged.  The goal should be how to learn qiskit and quantum computing though games.
Landing from the main file
3.2 Quantum Games with Qiskit¶
Learn quantum computing by having fun. How is there a better way!
@quantumjim should we close this now and then you can open another one later for changes or make a project for it if there is lots of planning remaining.
I agree that it is closable, so I'll do it.
