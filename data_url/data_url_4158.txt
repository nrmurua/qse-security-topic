I am experiencing a pip installation issue.  Please see below.  The main error appears to be a name issue: the filename has 'projectq', but metadata has 'unknown' part of the output below.  Version 0.8.0 has this issue, while version 0.7.3 installs fine.  Any help?
Hi,
In just tried a couple of things on my machine:
and did not experience that issue.
Could you give me the version information for the following things?
Also, which OS (and version) are you using? Are you using conda or pyenv?
BTW, here's the exact steps I did to test the installation.
Thanks for this quick note.  I was using python 3.10.6 with pip 22.0.2 in Ubuntu 22.04.  Apparently, the problem was with pip, since, prompted by your response, I updated my pip (which went to 22.3), and then problem went away.
