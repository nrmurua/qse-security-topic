Consider this transposed text diagram generated by openfermion-cirq:

There are two issues that I see. First, the exponents are unnecessarily long. This is the subject of #250 . The issue for this issue is that the exponents are placed on the qubits to the left, and so the exponent is placed over the wire instead of in the available free space to the right. This is certainly not a bug, but I think it would be visually preferable.
This only really matters when the diagram is transposed. But it's fine to also move the exponent when the diagram is not transposed (in which case the exponent will go from topmost to bottom-most). So the change can be unconditional.
