When we build the wheels package, the openblas.lib static library gets added to the Windows package as well as the compressed version openblas.7z. The openblas.lib is quite large and we don't really need it on Windows because the build system can deal withe the compressed version. The rest of platforms don't need this file at all, so it should not being included.
Create the wheels package. The Windows wheel has both files: openblas.7z (which is correct) and openblas.lib (which shouldn't be there).
openblas.lib shouldn't be there in the Windows wheel, and openblas.7z shouldn't be there in Linux/MacOS platforms.
Add openblas.lib as an exception in the MANFIEST.in file.
For not including openblas.7z in Linux/MacOS wheeks, we will require other changes.
pip installing qiskit-aer or 0.2.0 into our travis build/test of Aqua seems to be causing the following core dump that never happened with prior versions.
test_saving_and_loading_e2e (test_caching.TestCaching) ... /home/travis/.travis/functions: line 104:  6363 Floating point exception(core dumped) python test/custom_tests.py 0 -end 34 The command "python test/custom_tests.py 0 -end 34" exited with 136.
Since only a couple of our unit tests use Aer as part of the test, the failing one above is not one of them, we have removed it from the build for now and the above passes again as before.
@chriseclectic I believe we can remove blas dependency by re-writing matrix multiplication instead of calling BLAS in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/0.2.1/src/framework/matrix.hpp#L688-L844.
Currently following codes use them. They are not hotspot in simulator.

Fixed in this commit. It's part of the openpulse-sim branch, so it will land in master once merged.
