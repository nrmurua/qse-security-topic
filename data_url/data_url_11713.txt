Behavior of qiskit for Python 3.7 and 3.8, specifically the chemistry package, are different. It fails under 3.7 and works under 3.8.
Installing qiskit with Python 3.7 leads to:
File "..../python3.7/site-packages/qiskit/chemistry/fermionic_operator.py", line 24, in 
from qiskit.aqua import Operator, aqua_globals
ImportError: cannot import name 'Operator' from 'qiskit.aqua'
This error is not there for 3.8.
I would expect the same behavior in both packages. chemistry package in 3.7 wheel is outdated.
Easy solution would be switching to Python 3.8, however I have 3.7 packages I depend on.
You may have the old qiskit-chemistry package installed in your python 3.7 environment. Could you please check if it is there and uninstall it and then uninstall/reinstall qiskit-aqua? That package is not used anymore since it is part of qiskit-aqua.
Yes, that is probably because the old environment had the old qiskit-chemistry package installed.
