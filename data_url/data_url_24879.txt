Some of the functionality of scqubits can be easily explored via it's jupyter-widgets-based GUI, which is discussed here.
We would like to extend this GUI functionality to include plots of the estimated coherence times.
Coherence time calculations are already implemented for various qubits, as is explained in the documentation.
We envision for the updated GUI to, at the very least, for each qubit, show the effective coherence time plotted versus the parameter that is being scanned-over.
Using default coherence calculation parmaters would be a good start, although a more desirable outcome would allow users some flexibility. For example allowing users to select what noise channels should be included in the coherence time estimation, and/or allowing them to set some non-default options for each, would be welcome.
This has been incorporated with 605ad1c, thanks to @sujoju.
