It should work. There are no complex numbers here.
Debugging the most recent call in the stack trace:
This seems to be caused by the workaround we added for ParameterExpression.is_real if symengine is used. As you showed, forcing symengine to evaluate -1**2 creates a spurious imaginary part. While this has been fixed on symengine's end (symengine/symengine#1923) it's not yet released.
One hacky solution would be to consider a cutoff below which we discard the imaginary part, but that's not great.
