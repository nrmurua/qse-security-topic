The following paper was published a few week ago: Arnoldi-Lindblad time evolution: Faster-than-the-clock algorithm for the spectrum of time-independent and Floquet open quantum systems. The results show an speed-up in the diagonalisation of arbitrary Liouvillian operators.
It might be interesting to keep an eye on this and possibly implement it in the future.
The authors themselves (@DHuybrechts) have uploaded the code used for the paper at https://github.com/DHuybrechts/Arnoldi-Lindblad-time-evolution so. if they agree, it would just imply organizing and possibly optimizing their code.

It certainly look interesting. Fast diagonalisation of Liouvillian operators is certainly something we could make good use of.
However we should wait for v5 of qutip. Some of the new features we are working on match well with this algorithm and should have a visible impact on performance.
Hi @labay11 and @Ericgig, thank you for the interest in the method. We are of course more than willing to cooperate in implementing the code into QuTiP!
