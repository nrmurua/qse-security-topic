This test is taking almost 30s:
I think it is the single_qubit_randomized_benchmarking and two_qubit_randomized_benchamarking, which has default parameters that are pretty large.
Also:
for qubit_characterizations_test, I tried a little bit of reducing repetitions or number of circuits or clifford range but still slow.
All the slowness is in _two_qubit_clifford, which generates the Clifford group.
I think maybe one could speed this up using a canonical form https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.6813.pdf
