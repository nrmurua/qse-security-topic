The registers in the circuit are copied via reference. Modifying the registers in the copied circuit changes the original circuit.
Note that this causes Aqua algorithms such as the VQE to fail, if passed a quantum circuit and run on the QASM simulator. This happens because the Algorithm may add a classical register called 'c' to a copy of the Ansatz wavefunction multiple times, but since the original circuit is modified, the adding fails as a register called 'c' already exists.

Copy qregs and cregs.
