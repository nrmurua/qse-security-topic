Description of the issue
The latest and stable document link in README are all pointed to the main page of cirq. The raw code of README:
Documentation for the latest pre-release version of cirq (tracks the repository's master branch; what you get if you pip install --pre cirq), is available at cirq.readthedocs.io/latest <https://quantumai.google/cirq/>_.
Documentation for the latest stable version of cirq (what you get if you pip install cirq) is available at cirq.readthedocs.io/stable <https://quantumai.google/cirq/>_.
Should we update it into
https://quantumai.google/reference/python/cirq/all_symbols  for the stable
https://quantumai.google/reference/python/cirq/all_symbols?version=nightly for the latest?
Yes! Thanks for catching that!!!
