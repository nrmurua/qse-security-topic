Description of the issue
Our GitHub project can benefit from integration with https://codecov.io to provide test coverage reports for the master branch and pull requests.  The CI already checks for test coverage of the lines modified in the PR and blocks when changed lines are not tested.  codecov reports would in addition give us a color markup for covered/uncovered lines in PR diffs and also for all files on the master branch.
I would like to work on this
Thank you for taking this on!
The Codecov app might have to be installed and configured by an Admin in the Github organization https://codecov.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/43000593941-set-up-github-app-integration to add a repository token as repository secret as per this: CODECOV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
Is there a way to configure codecov to recognize coverage: ignore? Not a big issue though since we still have another coverage check today.
