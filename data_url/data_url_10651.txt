Current Problem
If the implicitly selected solver is not a QPU for DWaveCliqueSampler(), the current error message,
could be more helpful, if it showed users which solver was implicitly selected.
Proposed Solution
Also spit out selected solver's name.
Additional context
The current error message is okay, this is just a proposed improvement.
Should be closed by #317 in the sense that it should only pick up QPUs.
