With extremely large circuit simulation jobs / calls out to a QPU, too much parallelization can be a bad thing. For example: if we have 5 expectation ops in the graph, they might all have the possibility to run at the same time. If that is the case we multiply our memory overhead by 5. When we start dealing with 30+ qubit circuits, that could become a problem. Setting expensive (or something like it) from false to true at construction time could signal to TF that we want to execute the underlying code in "parallel", without anything else around it executing at the same time. Here we might be able to make use of https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/CriticalSection
It might also make sense to have things be located lower level in the op getter functions. See: #337
