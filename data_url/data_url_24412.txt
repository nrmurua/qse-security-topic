From @marcolincs
It would be good to not have to repeat the extraction code for position and direction from pins and have a universal method. For now there exists a seed_from_pin() method in the QRoute class, so that I could centralize this operation.
We could take the seed_from_pin() and make of it a method of base components, that accepts the pin name as input and returns position and direction. <- this is preferable, no need to transform pin into class.
Alternative we transform pin to class and get the method in it

There is an established convention with user community.
