Following Cirq Cync yesterday, I was looking at issue #2405 and saw that a PR by Matthew Neeley from 6 days ago already addresses it. Then, I was looking for another good first issue and found this.
To get started, I wondered whether there is a way to reproduce the Cirq documentation offline, so that I can check whether my changes actually fixed the bugs.
