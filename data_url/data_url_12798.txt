Hi,
I was fooling around with an approach slightly different from the one in the reference implementation and was able to come up with the following:
Feel free to include this as an alternative and to comment if this approach has any downsides.
I'm assuming you mean Superposition/Hardy State task, I don't think we have one about this state in Measurements :-)
Indeed, you can use H gate here instead of Ry with rotation by PI()/4 freely; those two gates differ only by the second column of their matrix representation (H gate has 1 in the first row and -1 in the second row, and Ry(PI()/4) has -1 in the first row and 1 in the second row), but since you only apply them to |0> state, this difference has no effect. Using Ry is more general approach, since it allows to split the |0> state into any superposition of |0> and |1>, as long as they both have real amplitudes.
It's probably not worth including it as a separate solution (since only 1 gate is different), but might be worthwhile to leave a comment in the solution itself, mentioning that you can use H instead of Ry here. Let me know if you'd like to do that!
(Sorry for the delay replying! I wanted to finish #282 first to reduce the number of threads about Superposition solutions)
Hi,
I agree that in this special case we could use a Controlled H instead of a Controlled Ry, but the maths I just added to this task are guiding the reader to the Controlled Ry gate.
This is why I changed the reference impl to use a Controlled Ry, and just left a comment that in this special case one could also use a Controlled h.
I hope you agree.

8c59741 added a comment to the solution mentioning that Controlled H is an option in this solution, so I think we can close this issue.
