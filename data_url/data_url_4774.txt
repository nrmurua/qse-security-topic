When using the LocalEngine, results are returned with shape [num_shots, num_modes]. For example, with a 4-mode, 2-shot program:
However, when using StarshipEngine, results are instead returned with shape [num_modes, num_shots]. This is the transpose of what is returned from LocalEngine. For example, with the same dummy program:
This is likely a bug, and the samples returned by StarshipEngine need to be transposed before being passed to the user.
Yep, we should be consistent. Since it is such a simple fix, we can do it right away.
However, we still need to nail down how we want to pass around and return measurement results in the library and make consistent (see related issue #107, which did not get resolved in time for latest release)
@josh146 @co9olguy I believe we are wrapping the result as is as returned by the API directly in a Result object, and there's no intentional transposing happening. Do we want to transpose the result before the API response, or after we get the response?
ideally the API response should be of the same format as a local backend, so if that's where the discrepency lies, that's where we should fix it (this is still a larger issue through the library tbh)
This was solved by #300
