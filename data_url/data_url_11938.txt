The contribution guidelines from the README are inconsistent with the PR template.
In particular, the PR template asks you to follow these steps:
✅ I have added the tests to cover my changes.
✅ I have updated the documentation accordingly.
However the README states that
In order for a tutorial to show up in the Qiskit documentation, after successful merging, an additional PR needs to be made in the Qiskit meta-repo to trigger the rebuilding of the documentation.
So you are not expected to update the documentation until AFTER your PR got approved but for the PR to be approved in the first place you are expected to have already updated the documentation.
And there is no mention of tests in the README or the contribution guidelines to which the README links you.
There isn't a test folder in the repo either. Which tests are we supposed to add?
Users can get confused when trying to do PRs so some of them may not upload valid and useful contributions to Qiskit.
Update PR template to reflect the qiskit-tutorials guidelines.
Thanks! This repo is being archived very soon so we can ignore this.
