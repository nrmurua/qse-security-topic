The "is_executed" flag in the AbstractCircuit class is defined here

@mlazzarin thanks for pointing this out.  I think we forgot to remove this attribute after some cleanup, nowadays we check this features in 
@stavros11 do you agree, right?
@mlazzarin thank you for checking the code. Indeed you may find some attributes around the code that are not used anymore because we forgot to remove them during a cleanup or refactoring. This particular attribute seems redundant to me as any if self.is_executed could be replaced by if self._final_state is not None since, if I am not mistaken, the final state attribute is assigned after a circuit execution.
I don't think such attributes would cause problems in every day usage but may confuse people that look at the code and should be removed. @mlazzarin you can remove this if you like.
