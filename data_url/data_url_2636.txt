There are currently numerous warnings being printed when pytest2 runs, looking like this:
The files for which that happens:
cirq/linalg/decompositions_test.py
cirq/ops/matrix_gates_test.py
cirq/sim/state_test.py
examples/examples_test.py
I've also noticed this happening, but couldn't find np.matrix being used anywhere in cirq. I assumed it was something internal to numpy, but yes someone should look at this a bit more closely.
