Broken packages:
CP2K, meep, octopus and molden build without errors on nixpkgs/master. For those I think we can just wait some time? Or do they break by something we are doing here?
There is also some error with the optStdenv, which complains upon an update to a more recent nixpkgs version, that NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE is set.
The NIX_CFLAGS_COMPILE problem is solved here: #263
The HDF5 related bugs can be fixed with the following patch (need to open an upstream PR for this).

Now we have a strange divergence: nix-build release.nix -A qchem.cp2k works just fine.
Not sure what's going on here.
But can you reproduce with nix flake check? I can confirm that nix-build release.nix works. I would just be surprised if flakes mess with the stdenv ðŸ˜®

Yes, I can reproduce the failure with flakes, but I have no idea why it behaves differently. I will dig into it.
release.nix hides some failures away. #264 solves the problem now. nix flake check proceeds, but now complains that allow-import-from-derivation is not activated (could be simply enabled in nixConfig).
Completed.
