Description of the issue
The ubuntu-16.04 environment is deprecated and will be removed on September 20, 2021. We need to migrate to ubuntu-latest instead. For more details see actions/runner-images#3287.
@balopat is there a reason you propose ubuntu-latest instead of ubuntu-18.04? I think specific version tags are generally preferable.
I just copy pasted the warning ;) I'm okay with 18.04!
@balopat alright!
I noticed there is even ubuntu-20.04 available. Please, have a look at #4148 where I made the change. I had to adapt the bazel install. Also set the 2019 version tag for windows instead of latest.
