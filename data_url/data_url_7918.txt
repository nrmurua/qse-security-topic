The spectrum of the Liouvillian obtained with qutip.piqs in the permutational symmetric basis from Dicke.liouvillian() or Dicke.lindbladian() is not to be used to look at spectral properties, such as the Liouvillian gap and overall spectrum. Working on a fix and possible disclaimer meanwhile.
The optional function prune_eigenstates needs to be removed.
Also, nonlinear functions, such as the Von Neumann entropy of the steadystate can be wrong.
Any test on expected values of collective spin operators the steadystate, compared with the steadystate calculated in the full basis, give correct results.
A quick patch at least for collective processes would be to change the piqs Liouvillian internal function calculating collective_emission, collective_dephasing, and collective_pumping properties of the Dicke.liouvillian() by using standard qutip.liouvillian() function on collective operators defined in the Dicke basis (qutip.piqs.jspin).
Nonlinear functions on the density matrix need to be evaluated on each block by factoring in its degeneracy, given by state_degeneracy(N,j) for each block j for an ensemble of N two-level systems. Working on efficient functions and a notebook to highlight this feature.
It was incorrect to close the issue, as only the nonlinear function part was resolved.
