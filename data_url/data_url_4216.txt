pybind11 is currently not compatible with the newest versions of pip (>=10.0.0) and the installation of projectq will fail during compilation of the c++ simulator, saying that pybind11/pybind11.h cannot be found. As a workaround until the newest version of pybind11 is released, one can downgrade pip
before installing projectq.
For more info, see PR #219 which contains a link to the issue on the pybind github.
The new version of pybind11 is out which means that one no longer has to downgrade pip. Instead, one can now do
and then install ProjectQ.
We will add the newest pybind11 version to requirements.txt in the next release of ProjectQ, which is coming soon!
