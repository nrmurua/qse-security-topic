Introduced in #252: every \newbox block in .tex file produces an Undefined control sequence error when generating the .pdf. The only exception is the first block which produces Missing $ inserted instead. Trial and error showed that the unrecognized sequence is \begin{bmatrix} ... \end{bmatrix}, but the matrices render as expected, so the errors look confusing.
Fixed in #272.
