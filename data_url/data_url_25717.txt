When following the how-to guide for constructing leptons here: https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/orchestration/construct_lepton.html, the following error was raised,
which I believe might be because of incorrect pathing.
@kessler-frost this is resolved by setting the pythonpath before starting the server
Setting the PYTHONPATH doesn't seem to work for me. I modified the python_wrapper to log the PYTHONPATH in the event of failure:
(test_module.pyis in the orchestration directory)
Besides setting PYTHONPATH, we also need to set library_name correctly in the notebook; we shouldn't prepend cwd to the module name.
For reference, PR #1042 modifies sys.path using a calldep.
