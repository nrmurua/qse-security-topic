The coupled cluster wave function can be written as following:
When we convert from fermionin to qubit using jordan wigner we obtain
Currently, if you check the UCCSD code (https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-quantum/blob/main/runtime/cudaq/domains/chemistry/uccsd.h) you will find that you only implemented the  X and Y operator but not thee Z operator. This leads to incorrect result.
Note that the UCCSD in the previous version 0.4.0 is correct.
You can use this H2 example in the tutorial.
cudaq.kernels.uccsd(kernel, qubits, params, nelec, qubits_num)
energy_of,data=cudaq.vqe(kernel,molecule,optimizer,tot_params)
Correcting it is essential to preserve the fermionic properties of the electrons.
Not a regression
You should add the missing "Z" as in the equations above.
