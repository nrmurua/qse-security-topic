Running the tests currently results in an extra line being printed directly to stdout using print():
and additionally the first element of the dict looks a bit suspicious ('': True).
@1ucian0, can you take a look at it, removing the print() statement or changing it to a log entry, in order to preserve the output of the testing tools as verbatim as possible? Additionally, it seems there are a bunch of docstrings in common.py where the types are not correctly set (most of them related to QISKIT_TESTS - they indicate a list but probably meant to be a dict).
The '': True is a bug I think. The print() was useful to remind the user which options are enabled. I'm happy to change it to a log (which is also included per test-suite, I think), but it turns out that controlling the general log-level for printing to the standard output is not as easy as I expected.
We really should avoid modifying the default stdout output if possible, as by doing so it becomes impossible to separate between the output of the tools vs. what output we chose to generate in most testing flows - if using logging, stderr will instead be used along with usual the fine-grain benefits, which is a more flexible approach. That is part of the reason why we did a removal of print() statements a while back, actually!
I'm fine with this particular change as soon as we have a standard way of inspecting log messages but I will raise my concerns in a different issue.
Shall I create a log handler just for this?
