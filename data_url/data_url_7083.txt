The code is going through three transformations (traceur, concat, uglify). Figuring out which file line 13473 is from by hand is annoying. Get each transformation step's sourcemap bits working.
This is hard. grunt-contrib-concat refuses to read the files generated by grunt-traceur unless I edit it to use ".js.map" instead of ".map" extensions. Even then, all the locations are simply wrong. I think it's grunt-traceur's fault. Switching away from that is a whole 'nother project. This is definitely not going to get done this month.
