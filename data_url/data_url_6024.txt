qiskit.providers.aer.utils.insert_noise only inserts default quantum errors, i.e. quantum errors stored in noise_model._default_quantum_errors. It should also insert the quantum errors stored in noise_model._local_quantum_errors, noise_model._nonlocal_quantum_errors. Furthermore it does not insert readout errors.
The above code should print False three times.
Update qiskit.providers.aer.utils.insert_noise to include the missing noise types.
I created a quick mockup of how to modify the function to include the local and nonlocal errors (I'm not quite sure though how to go about the readout errors). If it is fine by you I can put together some tests and submit a PR.
