Output:
This happens because MergeSingleQubitGates generates SingleQubitMatrixGates.  It doesn't look for special cases where the merged gates are equivalent to a single X, Y, or Z rotation.  cirq.google.MergeRotations probably does what you want.
Thanks, I missed that because it was hidden inside cirq.google. We should really resolve that issue soon.
