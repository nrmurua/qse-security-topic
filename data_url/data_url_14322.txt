The following errors:
with the error:
TranspilerError: "Unable to map source basis {('x', 1), ('if_else', 1)} to target basis {'reset', 'x', 'id', 'rz', 'measure', 'cx', 'barrier', 'snapshot', 'delay', 'sx'} over library <qiskit.circuit.equivalence.EquivalenceLibrary object at 0x10f5fd450>."
However it works when transpiling against the real version.
Run above
Ideally should be able to do noisy simulations of dynamic circuits.  Note that I cannot use AerSimulator.from_backend(backend) because Aer does not support V2 backends,
No response
This is because the snapshots used for the fake backends do not contain the control flow instructions so the compiler doesn't know that if_else is a valid operation on the fake backend. When backends start reporting if_else and other control flow ops we can update the snapshots in the fake backends to pull those new instructions in. In the meantime you can manually add the control flow operations to the target manually like:
that runs fine for me locally with aer installed (it printed {'0': 12, '1': 1012}).
