The doc string states that the unitary matrix of CZPowGate(exponent=t) is:
where g = exp(i·π·t/2).
When I try cirq.CZPowGate(exponent=1.)._unitary_(), it gives
It appears that the factor g should be g = exp(i·π·t) instead, which seems also consistent with the circuit generated from the gate.
PS: I am on cirq v0.4.0.
Fixed by #1453.
