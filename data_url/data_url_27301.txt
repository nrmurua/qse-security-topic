I have been trying uploading the package via Twine, but it gives the following error
HTTPError: 403 Client Error: Invalid or non-existent authentication information. for URL: https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
This issue seems to be unresolved as yet on twine's GitHub issues here. Did you guys face similar issues deploying QuTiP?
I recently followed the instructions in here and everything worked fine. However, at the moment I'd focus on code features, design, and algorithmic development as well as integration with QuTiP. This is low priority.
This can be closed and I can take care of such issues in the future. We have the qgrad project name on PyPi now so let us start coding.
