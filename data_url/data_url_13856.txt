I have an graph where
where t1 is not equal to t2. Is this a bug?
If not under what circumstances would this happen?
That would definitely be a bug. On which graph do you get this?
Do note that we do know that zh_simp is not yet scalar-accurate. So are the tensors actually different or do they only differ by a phase?
It is completely different. I am attaching a notebook demonstrating the issue
zh-simplify-bug.ipynb.zip
(.... Wish git hub would allow attaching notebooks to issues without having to zip first)
Thanks for the example, I'll look into it!
There was a bug in one of the rewrite rules. I fixed that, but then your diagram didn't simplify fully, so I've added another H-box rewrite rule (that was long overdue), and now your diagram simplifies correctly.
Thanks, John! I am not getting the fix
I did
in my env and restartarted my notebook kernel, but I still get the same behavior as before.
Restaring the whole Jupyter lab server did not change anything
Nevermind. It turns out pip install -U is not sufficient to update a git installed package. Need to uninstall and reinslall
