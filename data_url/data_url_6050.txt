Since Qiskit version 0.14, measurement in MPS is very slow.
Results:
The run-time depends on the number of shots.  When I run 1000 shots, time goes up to 300 sec!
Up to Qiskit 0.13.0, this circuit ran in less than 1 second.
Did anything in Aer change that could cause this problem?
Note that I disabled fusion, to make sure that is not causing the problem.
This appears to be a bug in parallelization. When I remove the #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) in the function MPS_Tensor::contract_2_dimensions, the performance on this tests goes down from 18 sec to 0.5 sec. @atilag , can you check what changed in the parallelization? adding also @yaelbh to this thread.
@merav-aharoni I would recommend adding OMP conditions like we use in the statevector and density matrix simulators.
The QubitVector class has the following on all its pragmas:
The omp_threshold_ parameter can be set using config options, and a default value should be set based on your profiling of when it is beneficial to use multithreading (at the moment use 14 qubits by default for qubitvector/statevector_state).
