A, B commute but commutes() method of PauliOp gives False.
Thanks. I think
or
is intuitive.
@t-imamichi
This will raise if
or
and this if
Current commutes() calculates a qubit-wise commutativity.
I am not sure why, but this is confusing. I think we need documents more.
Perhaps, it is for AbelianGrouper (which groups with a tensor product basis).
Recently I have implemented is_commutative for Pauli in Terra.

Oh I see, though documentation is somewhat misleading.
