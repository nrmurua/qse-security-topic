The user may have done this on purpose to filter outlier
If the purpose was to filter outliers we could consider implementing, this as a functionality. In my experience a really convenient way to automatically filter outliers is apply a percentile scale, eg setting the colorscale such that the upper and lower 1%  of the number of points are excluded.
