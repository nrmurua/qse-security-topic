When I just built on OSX for the first time in a long time, these warnings appeared - and they're also in CCI...
--> Possibly some cmake magic required?
Hi,
@drucker-nir Thanks for the assessment and suggestion.
Do I get you right that these 2 files should be compiled not only if OpenSSL is not used but also if OpenSSL is used and USE_OPENSSL_GF2Mis not set (i.e., the OpenSSL define OPENSSL_NO_EC2M is set as per this)? That'd be a bit more tricky and I'd suggest waiting with this for the return of our "CMake guru" @xvzcf -- as that would necessitate making an OpenSSL define visible as a CMake variable (to make compilation conditional on that)...
But then again, having looked through the OpenSSL source code I did not find any location which sets OPENSSL_NO_EC2M (which would be a prerequisite for any OpenSSL distribution/include to show it as set, if I'm not mistaken)....
Based on this, would you agree there's no real problem simply disabling compilation of these two files if OpenSSL is used?
Yes, you are right.
The reason we added this code in the first place is that BoringSSL sets the OPENSSL_NO_EC2M flag. The reason is that it does not support binary curves. Thus, in your suggestion the compilation should check whether they use OpenSSL, BoringSSL, LibreSSL etc.  I am not familiar with other libraries that may be used by LibOQS and if they set this flag or not.
OK - that then solved this part. Unfortunately, our CI system just taught me that there is (at least) one distro setting the define OPENSSL_NO_EC2M also for OpenSSL (Centos8). Also, there's a similar "compile-to-empty" file (cpu.c) in picnic. So I'll do a draft PR asking for input from @xvzcf (regarding define-dependent build in cmake) and @christianpaquin (regarding picnic).
