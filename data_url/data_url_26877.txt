The regtest logs accessible via the CP2K Dashboard) (for example, this one) do not indicate which DBCSR version was used in the build, and this information is cumbersome to retrieve a posteriori now that DBCSR is used via git submodules.
Could the regtests log be completed to include the DBCSR version (or perhaps even better: SHA) used in the CP2K build?
Well, this info is already printed by the regtest script. For instance,
https://www.cp2k.org/static/regtest/trunk/cscs-daint-xc50_gpu/CRAY_XC50-gfortran_gpu.psmp.out
you have the lines:
This can be done with the CP2K makefile target:
I think this should be enough for CP2K (note that CP2K will only have an official release).
Now, I see that there is a problem with some regtests, for instance, the PSI test gives the error:
My bad, I have to include FYPP path...
Oh, my bad, sorry, I didn't find the file you mention (https://www.cp2k.org/static/regtest/trunk/cscs-daint-xc50_gpu/CRAY_XC50-gfortran_gpu.psmp.out) while browsing around the performance Dashboard.
How do you navigate to it from the dashboard?
Still, since the regtest result files (like for instance the one I mentioned in the beginning of the issue contain the CP2K arch files as the CP2K git SHA, it would seem natural to add the version of the submodules.
Moreover, this could simplify the diagnosis of performance issues
To access the logs you have to click on https://dashboard.cp2k.org/ on the Status column. This valid for the regtests, not for the performance ones.
Concerning performance tests, you are right, the DBCSR version is not there...
@dev-zero and @alazzaro thanks a lot!
OK, now the performance tests report the DBCSR version, e.g.
https://www.cp2k.org/static/regtest/trunk/cscs-daint-xc50_gpu_perf/CRAY_XC50-gfortran_gpu.psmp.out
DCBSR Version: 1.0.0 (2019-01-03)
