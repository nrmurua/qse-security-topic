The initialize() in the tutorial does not produce the exact state as desired vector, but it only gives one that is equivalence up to global phase.

I think it is good to mention about the equivalence up to global phase here also (in addition to a single qubit case mentioned before).
@rraymondhp make a pr and suggest how you want to do it.
I am closing this but if you do come up with something that you think better describes global phase make a pr.
