Trying to upgrade artiq to 3.2 version using conda create -n artiq_32 artiq-kc705-nist_clock=3.2.
The installation is successful but then I tried artiq_flash -t kc705 -m nist_clock but got Binaries directory...... does not exist
I checked both nist_clock and nist_qc2 hardwares on windows. It seems the binaries files are lost after the installation.
#894 ?
@sbourdeauducq Please try installing 3.2 on a Windows 10 machine. You will see several hiccups in addition to those reported by @TheCakeIsAPi and @KaifengC.
What exactly? We do have Windows CI for many things so that's surprising.
Yes, it's the same with #894 . Sorry I didn't see that before.
I installed several versions on Windows. This bug firstly appears on 2.4. It works well on version 2.3
Yes, it's due to the switching to new-style conda noarch package that happened in 2.4, since after an update of conda the old-style noarch packages began to have various bugs and problems. Maintaining conda takes constant work...
For now, can you put the binaries manually where artiq_flash expects them?
