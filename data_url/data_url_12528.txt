I am working with a short qGANs project where a shorter version of my code which doesn't include all the terms required to calculate the loss function compiles and runs. The code is here:
Now that I scale up the problem to output more values from the circuit and train more parameters and include more terms in the loss function, the code ceases to work. The extended code for which is here:
The error I am getting is ValueError: No gradients provided for any variable: ['Variable:0'].
Any ideas? Thanks.
