Currently, when nodes are updated, a DB is retrieved from DispatchDB to persist node data. As we move towards a breaking DB enhancement, we need to have result.persist() also write to a DB. In order to prevent breaking core Covalent functions, this DB must not conflict with the DispatchDB and so needs some logic to ensure that path doesn't conflict.
