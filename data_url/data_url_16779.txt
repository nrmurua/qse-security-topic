In PR #3739, open controlled gates were implemented. With that PR a new keyword argument was added to specify the control state,
XGate().control(3, ctrl_state=6)
This creates a 4 qubit gate where the first three qubits are controls and the fourth qubit is the target where the x-gate may be applied. A ctrl_state may alternatively be expressed as an integer string,
XGate().control(3, ctrl_state='110')
where it is more apparent which qubits are open and closed. In this case when q[0] is open and q[1] and q[2] are closed the x-gate will be applied to q[4].
Is this the expected result?
q_0 should be open and q_2 and q_3 closed.
Gotcha
yeah left-most bit corresponds to lowest line in the drawing.
I find very confusing that
