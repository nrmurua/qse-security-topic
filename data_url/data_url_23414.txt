use a=np.arange(0, 1000, 1) to create an array of sweep values for, say the ivvi.dac1.
use ivvi.dac1(a[0]) to change the dac value
this should work without warnings
a warning is spit out:
This is because the following code gives an error (copied from StandardParameter):
the isinstance is probably not the correct way to check if something is a number,
(np.arange yields an array of int32's instead of int64's which is the root cause of the problem)

The simplest solution is probably to check against the numbers abstract base class http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3441358/python-most-pythonic-way-to-check-if-an-object-is-a-number alternatively we can add the relevant numpy types to the tuple (np.int32, np.int64 ...)
I think the return type of np.arange is platform acitecture dependent. At least I see
