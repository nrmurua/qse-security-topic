@paniash Which version of python are you using. QCoDeS 0.43 (and newer only supports 3.9+) this looks like you are using an older version of python
You're right, it's python 3.8. Running with a later version of python fixes the issue! Thanks.
Relevant to this issue, the docs need to be updated as there is a mention of the following:
You need a working python 3.7 installation, as the minimum Python version, to be able to use QCoDeS.
The minimum version is 3.9 now. I'd be happy to make a pull request to make the relevant changes in the docs and readme. :)
@paniash Thanks a pr to update the readme is very welcome. For reference we are likely to drop 3.9 support soon too.
@jenshnielsen Just opened #5646. :)
