As of #1584, AD9910 get/get_mu and set/set_mu behavior is not aligned.
At a minimum, the default profile used for the get methods should be updated to reflect set. But there are also some significant changes to set in the presence of the (new) ram_destination parameter that should perhaps also be reflected in get.
For simplicity, and to avoid this problem in the future (at least for default arguments), it might make sense to have some module/class variables for default profiles, e.g.:
@lriesebos
@occheung
@pmldrmota
#1818 made the default behavior consistent.
But there are also some significant changes to set in the presence of the (new) ram_destination parameter that should perhaps also be reflected in get.
Please open another issue if you want this change.
