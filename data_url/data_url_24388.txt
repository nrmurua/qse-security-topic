It should be straightforward to rewrite ElementTables without this global variable. It looks like what was intended was to just point out what types things should have, but instead it creates a dictionary of types, which doesn't seem very useful. Then it gets shared not only globally but by every ElementTables instance.
It seems like this might?? be a good candidate for moving to a database table, maybe removing the need for a lot of the code in this file. If not, I think refactoring to keep everything contained within ElementTables should be fairly easy.
There are two thoughts.  We are presently not planning to implement a database.  The columns of qgeomtry tables are expanded by renderers before an instance of design is made. For now, I would leave this flow as is.
