Copying code directly gives the following error
@ncrubin can you send me the link to the demo?
@nimaalidoust the code is listed in our documentation.
http://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/noise.html
There is also a notebook(https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyquil/blob/master/examples/NoiseInvestigation.ipynb) that I still need to check.
Just tested the "noise" demo code from the link above and also got the same error "QVMError: The value 0 is not of type (INTEGER 1 4294967295)" at the fifth Jupyter cell. Any idea about the error cause?
was this fixed @ryankarle ?
