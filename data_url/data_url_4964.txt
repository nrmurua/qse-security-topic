Per the documentation (https://quest-kit.github.io/QuEST/group__init.html#ga0379e21efca0767a22607fc0e26a5a22),  the ordering of states should be (for a 3 qubit system in this example) 0 = |000>, 1 = |001>, 2 = |010>, 3 = |011>, ..., 7 = |111>, as is conventional in QI. But the following code
Produces the output
Which is the completely wrong ordering. I guess the documentation should be fixed to accurately reflect this ordering, but I think a more appropriate change would be to fix the code to be consistent with the documentation and convention.
Hi David,
The ordering is consistent with the doc and the QI convention; you've just made a small mistake in your code.
Qubits, like their classical bit counterparts, are indexed from the right. That is, the first bit of sequence 011 is 1, or the least significant.
You write
and are iterating the bits right-to-left, but you print them left-to-right using <<.
To print the bits left-to-right (most to least significant) in the correct order, you need to reverse your loop to:
Hope this helps!
Thanks that sure clarifies this really well! I guess I was used to the undefined ordering in some Nielsen and Chuang problems, but evidently this is the way qubits are ordered in QI. Thanks!
