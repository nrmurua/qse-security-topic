Running the tutorial https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-machine-learning/machine-learning-qiskit-pytorch.html with a newer version of qiskit raises the following error: QiskitError: 'Data for experiment "circuit-xxx" could not be found.' I believe this occurs when the line job.result.get_count(self._circuit) is executed in the QuantumCircuit wrapper. The self._circuit.name attribute which is used as key in the get_count() method has value "circuit-xxx" and does not match the experiment names which have values "circuit-xxx-xxx"
Run the tutorial with the version of qiskit detailed above.
The tutorial should run.
