The paper arxiv.org/abs/1203.0722 provides an efficient method for decomposing members of SU(8) âˆ© O(8). We should look at implementing this and at extending it slightly: can we recognize when a generic member of SU(8) can be easily moved into this subgroup by left-/right-multiplication?
Sohaib has volunteered to implement the arXiv version of this, but we haven't looked at detecting the subset of PU(8) locally equivalent to PO(8). That part might still be on me.
