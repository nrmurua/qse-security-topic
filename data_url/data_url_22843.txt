Due to a configuration format change in numpy made in their most recent release 1.22 (which they decided to release on Dec 31 ) and that happened to break how qutip was parsing the numpy config.
There is a pull request to fix it.
qutip/qutip#1752
Temporarily, we will limit the version of numpy used for qutip.
This should not be an issue for Qiskit Metal, since Metal will put a limit in requirements.txt.
