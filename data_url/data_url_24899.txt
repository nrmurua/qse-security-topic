when calling scqubits.utils.plotting.matrix with the options to set the xlabel, ylabel and xticklabels, yticklabels, these are exchanged from one plot to the other. I believe the layout for the matrix plot on the right is correct, while the skyscraper plot is incorrect. See the attached figure for an illustration of the bug.

Any additional information you would like to provide to aid us.
@dkweiss31 Please provide:
Sure - here is a MWE
which should produce the below figure (I didn't notice that the first x_label and y_label element get cut off as well, which is not expected). If I'm not mistaken, looking at the two figures, the axes are incorrectly labeled on the skyscraper plot.

thanks for the example Danny. I fixed the labels offset (and also generalized the skyscraper plots to non-square matrices similarly to what can be done with matrix2d plots, in case that is useful for something in the future)
There is a minor subtlety as far as i can see, related to how we define the x and y axis. In the matrix2d type plots (on the right in your example), we define the horizontal direction as the x-axis that increase to the right, and the vertical direction as the y-axis that increase towards the bottom (as far as the xlabel, and ylabel keyword arguments are concerned). By the right-hand-rule, that defines the positive z axis as "into the page"... Of course that doesn't matter as far as a flat matrix2d plot is concerned, but it does matter in a skyscraper plot (on the left), which may seem inverted if one thinks that the positive direction in the matrix2d plot should be "out of page". As far as I can see what we're doing now is the right thing, but please reopen this if you think otherwise.
Closing for now.
