When compiling documentation with make html inside qibo/doc/, Sphinx compiles from the installed version of Qibo instead using the files in the cloned repository.
Is it supposed to be this way or is it a bug?
I would say yes, it is expected, ideally we should have a dev environment with qibo installed using pip install -e . so when sphinx imports qibo, it uses the development branch.
Thank you for the explanation.
