Right now on each release we're building a wheel for every python version. But cPython offers a stable abi: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html that provides a consistent interface across multiple python version. We should investigate switching our builds to use a single binary for all python versions as this will reduce our build times in wheel jobs and also significantly reduce the size of each release.
We also should verify there are no performance regressions when using the stable ABI with newer python versions.
I guess that we can reduce elapsed time of CI by using single binary for all python versions.
