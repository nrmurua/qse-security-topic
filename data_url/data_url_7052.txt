Currently, when dragging a large gate, the gate is out of the circuit if its bottom goes past the single extra wire. But the user is focusing on the cursor position, not the bottom of the gate, so that should be what determined whether or not the gate is discarded. Add more extra wires as necessary (but somehow faded out to indicate that they are in the 'throw away' area).
