I'm building ScaffCC for NixOS, only to hit several build issues.
It would be helpful if you could upload your Dockerfile to the repo.
We've provided the Docker image on docker hub. You can use the command to get the docker image, which contains the prebuilt ScaffCC.
docker pull epiqc/scaffcc
Sure I can. But I want to do some modification on ScaffCC and test how well it is. Thus it would be nice if I could figure out how to build ScaffCC via Dockerfile.
All the files are in the provided docker image. You should be able to get all files related to the ScaffCC building process in the container, which includes a ubuntu linux layer, compile toolchain, ScaffCC source code, and prebuilt binaries. Let me know if I misunderstand anything.
I'd like to know and reproduce the build procedure (written in Dockerfile) so that I can write a package description file for Nix, which means all Nix users can install ScaffCC via Nix package manager.
I'll try to play with ScaffCC inside the docker container for now (until I successfully build on my machine), thank you.
We didn't use Dockerfile reference to build the docker image. The build procedure is the same steps shown in README. Once we have the Dockerfile to specify the building procedure, we'll provide it. Thanks.
I see. Sorry for bothering you. Thank you so much!!!
Hi @ryanxw, would it be possible to update the docker files with the latest version?
Currently, the version is 4.1 and I am having a problem building the version 5. :(
Thank you :)
