X gate after the measure on qubit2 impacts the measure itself.   Output = {'00': 61, '01': 952, '11': 11}
Add a gate after the measure, and execute on a physical backend.
Would have expected "1" as value measured for qubit 2.
Gates after measurement are allowed in openQASM, but does not seem a normal behavior impacting the measure itself.
Hi @patdenim , thanks for reporting. Current generation backends only support measurements as the last operation on a qubit. We are tracking a bug on the backend that prevented an error message from being raised.
Thanks @kdk for the information.   I just wonder if the error message will prevent the circuit to execute when gates are added after a measure ? or will it be informational ?   Thanks

In this case, the error will prevent the circuit from executing. The error will be returned to the provider which will display it soon.
Thanks Thomas.

In the meanwhile, shall I write a pass to check if all the measure are final?
Yes, I think we need something like this. Although we will be relaxing this requirement soon on the backends.
I believe that the requirement mentioned here has been relaxed on IBM backends, and in any case, the bug in the original post no longer occurs - I just tested the circuit on Lima and for the expected result of 0b11 dominating.
