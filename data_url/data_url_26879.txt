We now state Fortran 2008 as our default standart in the conventions. Hence we should now replace our own implementions with Fortran intrinsics were possible. The __F2008 flag is also no longer needed.
See also cp2k/dbcsr#129 .
The __F2008 flag has been a work around for the transition to Fortran 2008 just to keep the CP2K internal legacy routines for erf and erfc in the module erf_fn. I also suggest to discard erf_fn and to rely on the corresponding intrinsics provided by the compiler. A regression tester run with gfortran showed no numerical issues.
