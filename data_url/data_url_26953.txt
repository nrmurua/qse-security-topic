At the moment the encryption engine is not signing packets, and this is absolutely required to fully enforce security.
The idea would be adding a new step in the incoming/outgoing pipelines that verifies/signs the packet with a new EC key pair. This should be relatively easy to get into the system as we should most definitely rely on the built in ECDSA libraries in the crytpo package.
The keys should be auto generated on startup just like the current keys used for generating the symetric key are generated.
So at this point the signing is setup but the performance impact is definitely noticable. Until I can fix that I will be holding off merging the code.
Looks like this was completely unnecessary, at the very least in the way that I was implementing it. The specification doesn't actually include signing the individual packets, but just the asymmetric keys. So that will be a separate issue and I am closing this one for now.
