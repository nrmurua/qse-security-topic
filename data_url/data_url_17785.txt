When I use Qiskit on Windows, I notice that Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015  vc_redist.x64.exe is necessary to run qasm_simulator. How about mentioning it in the installation instruction of the readme?
@chriseclectic can you confirm this and we should make sure it is mentioned.
My environment is as follows.
@atilag could you check how the qasm_simulator is packaged for windows and confirm if this is indeed a dependency. If so we should update the requirements as suggested.
@atilag and @chriseclectic what is the status of this?
Yep, Visual C++ Redistributable is indeed needed. Unfortunately the license doesn't allow us to redistribute it in our wheel package, so the user needs to install it manually. We do recommend installing Visual C++ Redistributable 2017, but 2015 will work though.
Thank you for confirming it. It is good to mention it in the installation manual.
@t-imamichi could you please make a pr so we can close this issue
I am removing the 0.7 this can be done after.
