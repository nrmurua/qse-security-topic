Describe the solution you'd like
Chip components should become a library with a more general name, e.g. quantum_elements, physical_elements, physical_components.
Tasks should also become two libraries: readout and initialization.
Devices can also become a library.
All elements of libraries should follow a single implementation, i.e. all be initialized and declared the same way (see issue #21).
All elements of libraries provided should be covered by a very basic test.
Describe alternatives you've considered
Additional context
Only elements of general interest should stay in libraries, all elements specific to a single use case should be added in local environment after import.
