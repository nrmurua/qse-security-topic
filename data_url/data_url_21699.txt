Starting with ARTIQ-5 I would like to see changes to the release process (which are already partially implemented):
Sounds reasonable to me.  I haven't followed the nix-scripts shift but it appears that this handles conda builds as well as nix builds, correct?
It also generates the conda packages, yes.
Add another oldstable channel so that the current stable builds do not disappear immediately when a new release is made.
It also generates the conda packages, yes.
FWIW, the M-Labs Conda channel hasn't been updated with new files in 6 months: https://anaconda.org/m-labs/artiq/files. Or is there a new place where these conda packages live now?

Though if you are looking for build information then check https://nixbld.m-labs.hk/
Also add a tag where stable rolling releases start.
