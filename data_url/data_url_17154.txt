Need to update Jupyter backend overview for new provider 0.3.
This will be converted into a Jupyter provider repr, along with other provider entitlements.
One workaround to not using IBMQ.providers() in backend_overview.py would be to pass the "provider" parameter to functions  backend_overview("provider") and get_unique_backends(provider)
and use backends = provider.backends() to get the list of backends
Indeed.  However, the Jupyter tools are being transitioned into object repr that are automatically called via the Jupyter kernel.  So the changes involve more than just transitioning from IBMQ to individual providers.
This is closed by #2828.  The jupyter kernel part will be done later
