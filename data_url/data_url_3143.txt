All this default annotation logic should be pulled out into a function or a method on ISAs.
I think get_isa() should just be a wrapped around self._isa, and that we should trust the ISA provided to Device() to be the One Trust ISA. @karalekas wouldst thou agree?
@notmgsk as long as this default annotation is then moved to the device generation workflow, then yes I wouldst agree
