When building applications one can't always use pyQuil easily. For example mobile apps in Java, C# in Unity :) etc. To make Forest more easily accessible the API itself should be separately documented.
The MVP of this would allow a user to use curl commands to run a quantum circuit on a QVM or QPU. Other endpoints optional.
This is now documented in the Rigetti SDK's manual pages. After installing the SDK, type man qvm or man quilc to get all of the hacker goodness.
