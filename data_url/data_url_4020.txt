@imranashraf , @gtaifu
I was wondering if there is a way to dynamically split up long QISA programs into different sub-programs.
The use case I have is roughly as follows.
I have a very long program (Gate Set Tomography http://www.pygsti.info/) containing ~tens of thousands to 100s of thousands of instructions. The memory limit of the CCLight is only 16k lines (or 32 @gtaifu ?) . The most natural workaround is to split the program up into several sub-programs/qisa files whenever a certain line count is passed and running them separately in the experiment.
Now for this splitting to work properly it would have to split at "allowed" points, the start of a new kernel would be a natural point for this. Furthermore I would need to know how many kernels there are in each of the splitted programs. I would like the OpenQL backend to do this (possibly only if you enable a certain flag) as I do not know beforehand how many lines the programs will fill, nor is the amount of lines per kernel constant.
@imranashraf could you comment to let me know if such a feature request is feasible? It seems pretty easy to implement and would help me a lot.
i am on vacation till Feb 11. Meanwhile, please contact @Nader-Khammassi.
Hi @AdriaanRol we are making a plan for the features we are going to add to our compiler. I have added this feature on the list too.
