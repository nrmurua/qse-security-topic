Phaser can spontaneously enter a locked-up state that requires a power cycle. This may occur on initial power-up or spontaneously lock-up at a later point.
When Phaser has entered a locked-up state, runnign Phaser.init() results in ValueError: DUC+oscillator phase/amplitude test failed. This state is irrecoverable short of a power cycle. Restarting via flashing is not sufficient. This seems very similar to #1597. However, no interrupted/failed experiments are involved.
Edit: There are no messages in the coredevice log.
I can't reproduce that with repeated init().
You don't say which version of the phaser gateware this is.
Please provide an MWE that reproduces this for you.
Apologies for not including the phaser gateware in my initial report. This is the most recent release at the time of opening the issue (v0.4).
Here the MWE:
I see that another release has been published today. I'll check if its still an issue there.
Well yes. We didn't get feedback on whether the changes fix quartiq/phaser#5 for you guys or not and were waiting with a release.
The release v0.5 seems to have fixed this üëç
