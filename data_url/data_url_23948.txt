When dispatched on a single pulse the repeat multimethod just sets the repeat field of the pulse. Aside from another annoying case of Python's mutable class dictionary, this is not an expected part of a Pulse and this is currently unhandled in the APS2 translator. Until we have better unrolling heuristics it seems we should just always use the repeat instruction and let the APS1 unroll_loops handle this for single pulses.
Pinging @blakejohnson  because you were most involved in this.
