I'd like to report some documentation errors. Well, I don't know if that is a doxygen problem or your problem.
A lot of images are missing. For example, I access the applyCTRL() API html doc and see the missing image pointing to qpp/doc/html/form_0.png, which does not exist.
Please see the attached screenshot.

Works fine for me, so I think it's a Doxygen problem. When you run Doxygen, are you getting any errors? Like "missing dot" or some other image processing tools? Here's how the page looks on my side, after running doxygen.

Thank you for solving my Doxygen problem.
For those running the Ubuntu 19.04, the "dot" tool required by the Doxygen may not reside under /usr/local/bin, which is specified by default in the Doxyfile of the Quantum++. In my case, the tool is under /usr/bin
So, I modify the Doxyfile like this:
DOT_PATH = /usr/bin
@DevelopDaily Thanks! I then should remove the hard link to dot from the Doxyfile and leave it blank, so the system will find it (in case it's installed).
