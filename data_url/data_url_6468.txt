from the logs
It tries to download an old version of the TF runtime that no longer exists https://storage.googleapis.com/mirror.tensorflow.org/github.com/tensorflow/runtime/archive/4ce3e4da2e21ae4dfcee9366415e55f408c884ec.tar.gz
the versions that are still hosted on storage.googleapis.com/mirror.tensorflow.org are in http://mirror.tensorflow.org/.  After that it tries to access ubuntu20.04-gcc9_manylinux2014-cuda11.2-cudnn8.1-tensorrt7.2_config_cuda
this a file for cuda11 but it looks for it in a directory for cuda12!!
fixed internally by pinning the cuda version to cuda11.2 for blaze build
