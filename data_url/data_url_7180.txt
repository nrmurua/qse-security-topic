Need to combine both definitions of circuits elements (BS,...), as well as build a proper type hierarchy for them
What do you mean by a proper type hierarchy? The ones already defined are subtypes of Interferometer.
Perhaps you think about a new subtype of Interferometer, something like BeamSplitter <: BuildinInterferometer <: Interferometer?
Sorry I meant more tools, in fact we can also have a type hierarchy with Linear and Gaussian stuff (as we'll do for measurements)
But I don't know if writing the stuff by ourselves is intelligent or if we should simply use https://github.com/qojulia/QuantumOpticsBase.jl
Btw this too could be a great inspiration for your gaussian stuff. Unsure if their framework is easily convertible to what you'd want to do.
