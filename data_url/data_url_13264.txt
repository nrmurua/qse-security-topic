We'd like to write a short blog post to spread the word that DDD is available.
This will technically be a PR in https://github.com/unitaryfund/unitary-fund, but because we'd like to track it in this milestone, it is being opened here.
Opened a PR here: unitaryfund/unitary.fund#232
Above PR is now merged. Thanks Nathan!
