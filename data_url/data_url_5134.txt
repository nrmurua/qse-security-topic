Currently, make qvm-sdk will kill ~/.cache/common-lisp/<sbcl-cache>.  Ideally, it would work with its own cache so that (1) it pulls fresh packages when building, and (2) doesn't affect the current cache, which might be unexpected behaviour.
From the sdk build's point of view, I think this is usually run inside a fresh docker container via the docker-sdk target. From the standpoint of testing things out without getting docker involved, it should be safe to blow the cache away. In theory it should just mean a potentially slower build the next time you build qvm.
