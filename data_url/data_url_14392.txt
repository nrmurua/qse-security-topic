Currently, the PadDynamicalDecoupling pass only supports inserting a single sequence per idle period. Sometimes it's better to add more sequences during longer idle times. @georgezhou20 contributed an implementation to the qiskit-research repository, and that could be ported to Qiskit Terra. See qiskit-community/qiskit-research#25
@nkanazawa1989 might be interested?
