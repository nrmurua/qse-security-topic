All the pull requests are failing the self tests.
@mtreinish contributed a fix for this bug to qutip last week after he saw it: qutip/qutip#1752
While waiting for his pull request to merge,   need to cap the numpy version at < 1.22
Using @DanPuzzuoli's work  for qiskit-dynamics: Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-dynamics#72 it should be an identical patch for qiskit-metal.
Hi @priti-ashvin-shah-ibm,
