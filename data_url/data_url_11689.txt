When using a Custom initial state that is constructed using a state vector, calling .construct_circuit(mode='circuit') fails.
To my knowledge, it should use StateVectorCircuit to construct a circuit that prepares the given statevector.
I'm not sure, but I gave this to someone using the following Qiskit versions, and the code above worked for them without error. (They are also using Windows, but I don't think that's the issue)
Thanks to @jsvandyke86 for letting me know about this @bgard1 for testing it on a different version.
Try upgrading to 0.18.1 (which has Aqua 0.6.6). This should fix the issue you are seeing if its related to the pass manager. The version before 0.17.0 was fine as the API change was done in Terra 0.13.0 but as you see between 0.17.0 and 0.18.0 Aqua remained at the same version and the incompatibility was not noticed when the newer qiskit was released. This has since been fixed.
Hi @georgesbarron having not heard back to the contrary I will assume the above noting that it been fixed is fine, so I will close this issue. If not feel free to re-open.
