[Makefile:3139: crypto/ec/oqs_meth.o] Error 1
When I tried to install liboqs and build teh fork to my openssl(version 1.1.1f), the error jumped out.
The steps is followed by ubantu parts on https://github.com/prchander/openssl#supported-algorithms.
It looks like this

Your liboqs and openssl projects do not seem to be in sync: We recently changed the Rainbow algorithm family which necessitated changes (to exactly the constants showing up above) in both repositories. Be sure to pull those over to your fork.

Thank you for replying. Does it mean I need to get the newest 'liboqs git' for the project, and repeat the following steps of install liboqs?
That -- and ensure that your own oqs-openssl fork has the most recent updates from open-quantum-safe/openssl.
Closing after more than a week inactivity.
