Example technical challenges:
@Strilanc This issue has a bunch of somewhat unrelated (and big) challenges in a very vague and unspecified way.  Some of it has been addressed (optimizers to transformers API with a proposed visualization and logging).
I generally think this issue is too broad and too vague to make progress on.  I propose closing it as stale and creating more concrete issues, unless you have strong objections.
