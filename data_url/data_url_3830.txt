Description
If I open a tool deep enough to take up some serious space, the D-Wave header is at the bottom of the nav bar and I cannot scroll to its links without closing the open tool:

To Reproduce
Open any tool quite a lot
Expected behavior
I should be able to scroll to the links
Environment:
Additional context
Chrome browser
What do people think about moving the D-Wave section above Tools section for the unified docs? We have three links under D-Wave and will have lots of tools. Of course the Tools section is more useful, but we don't want users to not see the D-Wave section links.
I think this is because you still have your cookie notice open
Nice & correct diagnosis. Thanks!
