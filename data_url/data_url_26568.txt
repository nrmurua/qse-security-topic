Since the latest update of the ELPA library, a call to elpa_obj%setup() results in an output of
In ELPA setup
MPI_COMM_PARENT is set
This output appears n times at each call to the setup routine, where n is > 1 and <= NCPU.
This causes a spamming of the CP2K output file.
I have recognized that too. We can switch back to 2021.05.002 for the CP2K release.
https://elpa.mpcdf.mpg.de/software/tarball-archive/ELPA_TARBALL_ARCHIVE.html lists a final 2021.11.001. As well as a 2021.05.002_bugfix (which might be a good alternative to 2021.05.002).
I believe there is some disagreement about printing and verbosity. It seems a similar issue was discovered for SIRIUS in the past. Perhaps it only helps to clarify the desired policy. IMHO, I believe libraries should not be printing anything or considering the console output as "NO NO" unless an API permits output (set_verbosity_level) or perhaps an API taking an "output unit" or (symbolic) stream/file descriptor like stdout or stderr. Similar issues are related to calling exit in library based code. Before relying on a dependency, it could be useful to ensure such policy upfront.

Thanks @dev-zero. With having the release 2021.11.001 now out, we should give a try to that latest release. It seems that print* statements are only used when an error occurs like in the previous release.
The release version 2021.11.001 seems to work and it does not spam the CP2K output with info messages.
