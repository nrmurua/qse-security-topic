Non-local noise should be deprecated as this does not work well within the circuit simulation. It is overly sensitive to the order of instructions in a circuit and these sorts of errors should be applied to scheduled circuits via a transpiler pass before being passed to the simulator. It also prevents or complicates certain optimizations we would like to implement in the simulator that depend on sampled noise being local to the corresponding gates.
