After installing qutip via conda (conda install qutip) on Mac 10.15.1 High Sierra, I ran the testing script using:
import qutip.testing as qt
qt.run()
I am getting the following error:
Qobj subtraction ... python(4259,0x119a26dc0) malloc: Incorrect checksum for freed object 0x7fdbb05c5910: probably modified after being freed.
Corrupt value: 0x3ff0000000000000
python(4259,0x119a26dc0) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
Abort trap: 6
Does anyone know what is causing this, how to fix it, or what kinds of problems it might cause later? Thank you!

Can you post the output of qutip.about()
I see this issue as well but with a different test (error came up with ptrace test). I think this is a larger py3.7 issue, some comments have come up in the mailing list too.
In a py3.7 env I see malloc errors occasionally with the es solver in correlation_2op_1t calls as used here: https://github.com/gsteele13/gary-exploring-qutip/blob/master/Correlations.ipynb

This also appears to be inconsistent in terms of when the issue comes up. I tried a quick use of tracemalloc to begin poking around, and that seems to change the occurrence too (like a true quantum system, measuring it disturbs it :)

Malloc.py listed below:
I am reasonably sure that this is the same cause as #1160, and I'll just put the info I have now over there to keep it in one place.
This was a crazy numpy bug that is now resolved. See #1160 for links to the crazy debugging trail.
