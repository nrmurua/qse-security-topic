The following code is technically against the OpenQASM spec, as you can only close over global const variables (https://openqasm.com/language/scope.html#subroutine-and-gate-scope)
We may want to choose to interpret this as inputs allowed, since it's ambiguous whether those can change at runtime (be overwritten)
