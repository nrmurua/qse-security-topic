https://scan.coverity.com/ offers free service for open-source projects. For improved security, it may makes sense to enable coverity for libOQS
Hi Henry,
We did have Coverity set up over a year ago on the coverity_scan branch, but haven't maintained it.  I've synced our current master branch with the coverity_scan branch.
But apparently Coverity is not working right now: https://community.synopsys.com/s/article/Coverity-Scan-Update
So we'll not get results until they're back up, which looks like it could be weeks.
thanks, I wasn't aware.
In such case I'll close this ticket as it is already done.
