Sayma produces spikes on RF output under several circumstances. Some circumstances where this is reproducibly seen are.
See attached screen shot. AC coupled looking at SMPs. DAC outputs:

Another consequence of the HMC7043 noise?

@jboulder during booting the AFE RF switches will be closed, so that's not an issue.
Agreed! That would cover bases during boot but not for kernel panic or flashing.
If you really want to get rid of this, we'd probably have to in a hardware AND with a JESD link up symbol or something like that.
Generally though, I have to say that it's almost impossible to guarantee that this kind of glitch can never happen on the outputs. It's much better to rely on good design to ensure that no DAC outputs can cause damage to the experiment (e.g. by setting the step attenuators correctly). More generally, anyone with very stringent interlocking requirements should consider using some extra hw outside Sayma to interlock it (cf booster).
Is that happening with a freshly powered system, with RTM FPGA loaded to open the RF switches, with:
And with the current code, the RF switches are open as long as the RTM FPGA is loaded - it's just hardcoded like this.
This could be handled in some circumstances by using the DAC power limiter/blanking. Guaranteeing well defined behavior during random bitstream loads, crashes (i.e. guaranteeding well defined outputs during ill-defined situations) is up for sponsoring.
