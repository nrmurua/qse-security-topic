Hi,
I'm running qutip on the latest Ubuntu LTS version in 64 bit. All required packages (gfortran etc.) are installed from the repository. No matter if I use the qutip package from the repository or compile it from source, the testing results into 3 errors:

I can reproduce this on 2 different systems (both 64 bit and 14.04).
Which version of QuTiP and which version of Cython do you have? I think this is an issue with a Cython version number parsing error in QuTiP, but if I am not mistaken it has been fixed in the development version of qutip that you find here on github,
It's "Cython version 0.20.1post0" and the official release of QuTiP (2.2.0) I'm using.
Could you try with the development version of QuTiP?
https://github.com/qutip/qutip/archive/master.zip
Now it gives me one other error and a failure (and I have the impression the I can deal with the prior errors better than with the new one):

This error is because of a conflict between versions. Remove the old qutip installation in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qutip and reinstall the development version.
Hi, the failure is gone, though the error is still there

I removed my installation with apt-get remove python-qutip before installing the development version.
Cheers

The error comes from the file /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qutip/tests/test_Qobj.py. This file is no longer part of qutip (development version), so it must come from the old installation. Make sure you delete that file before installing the development version.
It was my mistake; I removed the old install manually and compiled it again, now everything's fine. Thanks.
Good to hear that it works now. Thanks for reporting the problem. It's a bit unfortunate that the 2.2 version of qutip doesn't work smoothly with 14.04 out of the box, but we hope to have a new release out this summer which would amend this problem,
