When measurements are all last thing that happens to a qubit, the simulator should be smart enough to not repeat the full simulation.
I think we can perform this optimization for every measurement, not just ones at the end. Measurements are the only thing that need to be repeated, ever, right?
This is going to be important for me soon so I am willing to help contribute; some pointers on how to do this would be helpful.
It would be most accurate to say that only the first measurements can have this optimization applied. Later measurements can't be sampled repeatedly because we are only looking at a subset of all possible wave functions (i.e. we are not doing a density matrix simulation).
Good point. I suspect the most common use case is that all measurements are at the end, anyway.
I'll be satisfied with optimizing this assuming all measurements are at the end, which I believe #308 will resolve.
Fixed in #533
