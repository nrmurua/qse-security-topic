Problem:
pid.setpint=-1 causes overflows with large p-gains
So far this bug was undetected, but it that it has always been there. I will attempt a fix in the FPGA, if that does not help we have to constrain the setpoint minimum to be above -0.999 instead of the default -1.0.
at this occasion, also the saturation logic should be checked for offsets of the order of 1/2^13
The first part is fixed by 8501a55, the remaining problem is only the small offsets between saturation values and actual values from sampler (likely a sampler problem).
