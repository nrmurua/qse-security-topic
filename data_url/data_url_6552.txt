NOTE: as this affects the deprecated circuit-from-file parser, it is considered low-priority.
Currently, the following gate structure is accepted by the circuit parser:
This would cause qubit 1 to be in two gates at the same time, which has undefined behavior. We should reject circuits of this form in the parser.
