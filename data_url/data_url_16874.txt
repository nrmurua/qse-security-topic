Controlled composite gates appear with the wrong number of controls.
results in,
The number of controls should be num_ctrl_qubits. The exception might be if the gate being controlled is itself a controlled gate. For instance a gate like x.control().control() would show two control qubits.
The expected result is this (see #3199)?
That looks better.
