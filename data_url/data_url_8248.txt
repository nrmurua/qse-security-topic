QuTiP qip module currently supports six different single-qubits gate, including rx, ry, yz, http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide-qip.html. However, the commonly used Pauli X, Y, Z  gates, T gate and S gate are not there. Although in principle they can all be realized by the existing gate set. It would still be good to have them supported in qutip.qip.QubitCircuit.
Hello,
I am trying to work on this enhancement. Do you think it's also a good idea to add the controlled version of the above gates? This can be done by defining a custom gate as well as given in the example (for rx) in the docs.  Also, is it better if we name the gates "X" or "XGATE". I am not sure what convention the naming follows, if any. I can issue a pull request as soon as this is clarified.
Best,
Sidhant.
Hi @sarsid, Thanks for working on this.
In qutip.qip.QubitCircuit, I think "X" "Y" "Z" "S", "T" is good enough as a gate name. No need to let the user repeat GATE every time. In qutip.qip.operations, I find it's better to name the function x_gate because x seems too short and unclear. Feel free to argue if you are of a different mind.
Sure you can add the controlled version like "CZ" etc if you'd like to. There is a function called controlled_gate in qutip.qip.operations.gates, might be useful.
Solved by #1209 and #1224.
