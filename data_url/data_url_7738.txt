In recent years people have strong interests in random circuit/TN dynamics -- usually they use Clifford gates as a numerical tool due to its high efficiency. I think it'd be really cool to implement that with quimb!
I think quimb already supports Clifford+T gates for circuits: H, X, Y, Z, S, T, CNOT, CX, CY, CZ.  Maybe you can try it üëç
Hi @yuxuanzhang1995 - quimb is very much a tensor network tool so I don't think it would make sense to implement a separate simulator within it, i.e. the usual stabilizer formalism which there are already highly optimized libraries for like stim.
Having said that, I'm not super familiar with the various clifford methods, if there was a neat way to frame one as a tensor problem that could benefit from contraction optimization etc. I'd be happy to accept an implementation!
quimb has some quite powerful TN 'simplification' tools - (full_simplify and compress_simplify) that perform local complexity reducing transformations prior to contraction. In practice these have a huge effect for Clifford gates, though maybe not as powerful as the fully 'symbolic' equivalent ZX-calculus. Very much experimental but in this way there are computational savings that come from the type of gates not just the geometry.
