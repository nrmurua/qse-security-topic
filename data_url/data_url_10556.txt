I'm interested in using all the functionality of the clique sampler (range-scaled uniform torque compensation, per-qubit coupling checks), but I would like the option of passing my own embedding instead of generating it on the fly:

This allows reproducibility, graph-isomorphic transformations, testing new embeddings, etc.
Definitely a feature we could (easily) add. But in the mean time you could get the same effect with just using the same set of composites
