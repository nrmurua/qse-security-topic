For example, at the time moment, zero-noise extrapolation is never tested with Braket circuits (see  #767).
A good way to automatically test all (current and future) supported circuit types is to loop over mitiq._types.SUPPORTED_PROGRAM_TYPES when writing important tests.  For example this was done here:

Great. Maybe we could add something about it in the developers' guide?
This could use more detail / clarification.
Initially only execute_with_cdr was tested with all SUPPORTED_PROGRAM_TYPES.
A recent PR #769 , added a similar test for execute_with_zne.
I just opened #779, which does the same for execute_with_pec. So, if #779 will be merged, tI think his issue can be closed.
My proposal was to just add some tests with a loop over SUPPORTED_PROGRAM_TYPES. In this way, if in the future we add a new circuit type, such tests will be automatically up to date. I didn't have any advanced infrastructure in mind.
Thanks Andrea, sounds good.

It might not be a bad idea to have a test like the following:
It could probably use a design document - e.g., we probably want to be able to ignore modules in development - but that's the basic idea.
Or we could just be more careful on reviews in the future. But I tend to like automating things.
