An exception is thrown while evaluating aux_ops:
No exception.
if all the coeff of SnapshotExpectationValue is 0, the current Aer fails simulation because
Aer may need to accept any coeff, but Aqua should not run simulation if all the coeff is 0.
#1096 mentioned the same issue.
This error, due to partial completion of the expectation value as computed by Aer snapshot, was address by a change to Aer Qiskit/qiskit-aer#826  This computation should now complete correctly, but you would need to build/install Aer from repo master branch at present to try yourself.
As noted in the prior comment this was fixed in master. In the absence of any feedback to the contrary I am closing this. If for some reason it did/does not work for you still then feel free to re-open.
