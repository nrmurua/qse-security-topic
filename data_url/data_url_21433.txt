On release-7, the Phaser board initialization routine reproducibly triggers a RTIO underflow in some, but not all, scenarios.
Consider the following experiments:
All three experiments above run without errors.
Only the Basic experiment runs without errors. Both DeviceArray and PhaserAndUrukul fail with an RTIO underflow in the Phaser.init() method. The location reported in the coredevice traceback is the same in both failing cases.
Traceback for DeviceArray (RTIO channel 48 is that of the Phaser device):
Traceback for PhaserAndUrukul:
These experiments work as expected against ARTIQ v7.0.06ad76b.beta.
@nkrackow @jordens did you see something similar while working on #1933 or other Phaser-related changes? Or is the issue specific to release-7 (unlikely given the divergence to the main branch)? Or to pre-servo Phaser gateware? (also looks very unlikely).
@sbourdeauducq have there been specific changes between 06ad76b and the release-7 cut that would qualify to trigger such behavior? As-is, Phaser is only usable in isolation in release-7. It seems likely that the issue also exists on f312794 (is not release-7-specific) but it's hard for me to test because of #1930.
We haven't seen this. But it may well be related to newer changes re numpy arrays and or the new CPU.
I presume the artiq_sinara_tester with more than a phaser also fails?
It does not. But it's compiling kernels one by one for each tested device.
Rebuilding the gateware/firmware against 97cba3f solved the issue. But I also couldn't reproduce the issue with an independent build against eba143a. Although I had built twice yesterday, this was probably an inconsistency in the build or in the dependencies.
I also understand from @jordens's comment that this has not been reproduced elsewhere.
I'll therefore close this issue. Thanks for the feedback and sorry for the noise.
