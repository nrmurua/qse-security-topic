Hi,
in page 11 of openqasm specification:
a is used for control the rotation of b, so a should not be changed.
However, in the implementation, a is updated in the first statement.
gate cu1(lambda) a,b
{
u1(lambda/2) a;
cx a,b;
u1(-lambda/2) b;
Peng
Yes the specification is correct just not explained clearly in the document and we are fixing this. The cu1 we give is the gate Diag(1,1,1,exp(ilambda)) not control-rz(theta) = Diag(1,1,exp(-ilambda/2), exp(i lambda/2)).
@lpxz We have closed this issue.  Please have a look at the document and updated qelib1.inc. If there is still any confusion please open another issue.
