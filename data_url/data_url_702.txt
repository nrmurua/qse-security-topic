I am not sure if this should be filed against qpp or staq. Anyway, here is a simple test case.
That cannot be run by qpp because the h is declared as a gate and a register. The trouble is that the script can be parsed by the staq perfectly.
I think they should succeed or fail consistently.
Thanks! We'll investigate. Currently the parser in staq and qpp are not identical. We should probably converge to a single point of entry. Adding @meamy to the thread.
both staq and qpp now use the same parser
