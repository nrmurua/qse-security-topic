Named return-value optimization (NRVO) is a form of copy elision. In C++17 this optimization is mandatory, allowing sections like the following to return types with a deleted copy constructor:

However, prior to C++17 this was not the case. In order to compile successfully on C++11, we must update the snippet above to avoid NRVO. Given that this section is I/O-only (i.e. not in the hot path), some performance reduction is acceptable.
Further clarification reveals that C++11 is not the culprit here - instead, the issue is with older compiler versions. gcc-4.8.x has no move-constructor for streams, which causes an error.
Given that TFQ only requires backwards-compatibility to gcc-7.2.1+, we have decided not to support compiler versions older than this.
