I am using spyder 4.1.1 on Anaconda and any time I try to plot data it does not show up. The code runs with no errors but the plot it self does not appear anywhere.
Running the code listed below which is from the IBMQ website:
for the plot state city plot to show up in the console or somewhere else
I tried using both matplotlib.pylot.show() and matplotlib.pyplot.draw()
I'm pretty sure that only ascii based displays can be shown on the console window on  spyder. Just to make sure, I tried displaying a bloch sphere and it didn't show up either.

Maybe, though it seems a bit odd given that it looks like it is based on matplotlib, which works fine usually with spyder but maybe something is different.

Actually was able to solve it using this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61568297/qiskit-plots-not-showing-up-in-spyder-console/62319001#62319001
Though I may have to try what you said if it acts up again.
