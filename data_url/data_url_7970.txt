When printing a Qobj in Jupyter Notebooks of the VSCode IDE, the output is rendered as raw text rather than as Latex equation.
The output should instead look like:
Quantum object: dims=[[2], [1]], shape=(2, 1), type='ket'

I see already there are some errors in the latex code output.
Seeing this on 5.0.0.dev with VSCode Insiders. Calling
yields "Quantum object: dims=[[2], [1]], shape=(2, 1), type='ket'\\begin{equation*}\\left(\\begin{array}{*{11}c}1\\\\0\\end{array}\\right)\\end{equation*}". So the missing "equation" asterisk is being interpreted as markdown when displayed I think, and matching an asterisk in the column alignment argument *{11}c.
results in ParseError: KaTeX parse error: {equation*} can be used only in display mode.
