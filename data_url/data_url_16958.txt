As seen in this image, the plane at z=0 is drawn in front of some of the positive columns. Surprisingly most, but not all, of the columns are drawn this way.

Other examples:

Plot a state vector with positive amplitudes.
Positive columns (z>0) should be drawn in front of the plane, negative columns behind it (this second part seems to work already).
Don't know what is causing this.
âœ… Issue still reproducible as per original author. Any plot with positive and negative columns should reproduce the issue. Example code to reproduce first image:

Not sure if the right section but it seems to completely mess up for different states! (State vectors are on top of the ss)


Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed.
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
I'm already working on the other mentioned issue. I could easily tack this on to my work changes. Would someone please assign this task to me?
