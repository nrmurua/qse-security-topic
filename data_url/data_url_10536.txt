It seems like draw_chimera requires numpy and matplotlib, but these dependencies are not listed in requirements.txt.  That said, both are fairly heavy dependencies for a simply graph layout.  It might make sense for this package to provide the chimera_layout function, which then can be combined with any viz tool (e.g. matplotlib) to provide the drawing dependencies.
This is consistent with Networkx's approach which (for this package) we are trying to match as closely as possible. However when I tried to cite somewhere in Networkx's documentation that makes this clear I couldn't find anything. This is the closest (https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/drawing.html) I'll make sure we update our documentation accordingly.
Updated RtD. I'll assign back to you so you can add extra requirements on numpy & matplotlib. Here's what NetworkX has:
networkx/requirements/extras.txt
numpy>=1.12.0
scipy>=0.19.0
pandas>=0.20.1
matplotlib>=2.0.2
pygraphviz>=1.3.1
