When running parametrized circuits on qasm_simulator and statevector_simulator the results are very different. It seems that the statevector_simulator always return a computational basis.
Run the tutorial of parametrized circuit https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/circuits_advanced/1_advanced_circuits.ipynb
The output is:
HOWEVER changing the simulator, we now have:
with output:
Or, you can refer to the image below:

The simulators must return consistent results.
No idea.
