Hi,
I've noticed that the pytket version used in this repository is version 0.6.0. This version was released almost two years ago.
It would be great to see benchmarking results for the latest pytket version 1.3 if possible. To rerun the benchmarks with the latest version would require a couple changes to the compilation pipline as pytket's passes have changed since 0.6.0. There may also be some dependency issues to resolve. @ferbetanzo and I would be willing to help with this if needed.
Having an up to date comparison would certainly be very informative for us.
Thanks!
Thank you for your message. It would be nice!
