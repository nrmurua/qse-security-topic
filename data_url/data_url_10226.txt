If BQM supports streaming, Solver.upload_bqm(bqm) should be identical to Solver.upload_bqm(FileView(bqm)).
One issue is that there is no way (at the moment) to tell whether a bqm can be used with a FileView other than to try. An obvious solution would be to add BQM.to_fileview(), or to just try it once FileView supports all bqm types.
Also the preferred syntax for the file views is with a context manager.
See dwavesystems/dimod#580
@arcondello, I believe the right approach would be something like this dwavesystems/dimod#599.
