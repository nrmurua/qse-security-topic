artiq_sinara_tester on the master branch currently underflows during the Zotino test.
This works around it:
Increasing the second delay (below write_dac) does NOT make the underflow disappear, which suggests a possible compiler issue.
Just looking at the snippet you posted, couldn't it also be the first iteration?
No underflow on current version of ARTIQ-7 and NAC3. Also tested on a mid-November version and could not reproduce.
