We are going to remove the option format='json' from the transpiler (see #1129). For that, we need to move the visualizers into the function get_instractions introduced in PR #1187.
The file qiskit/tools/visualization//_matplotlib.py calls transpiler.transpile_dag(dag_circuit, basis_gates=self._basis, format='json'). This needs to be removed in favor of _utils.get_instructions.
