OK, I wrote this and really didn't like it as it just duplicates a lot of code and you end up having to either create multiple functions for multiple parameters or not, or to add return types that depend on input types (which is a disaster).  So I'm going to close, but if someone really feels strongly about this we can reopen to discuss.
