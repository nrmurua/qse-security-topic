Hi,
Is it possible to install stim through anaconda? I tried it but it showed that the package is not found.
I think you can install pip via conda and then install pypi packages (such as stim) via pip. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41060382/using-pip-to-install-packages-to-anaconda-environment/43729857#43729857
Let me know if that works.
Yes, it works. I have successfully installed Stim. Thanks
