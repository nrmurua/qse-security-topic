ion.Service  has a def run_sweep but the  def run is in service.py. What are your thoughts @dabacon?
Sorry missing the question here.  ion.Service has run but no run_sweep.  ion.Sampler implements run_sweep but is a work.Sampler so other methods are implemented by calling this.   Is the question why there is no run_sweep in ion.Service?  We could add that.  The IonQ API doesn't have a notion of sweep, so I was keeping the service close to the api.
I should should have phrased this question better: Why isn't  the run function: 
So we can change the body of the run function in Service to be
I see that if we did do that, we'd be overriding the default work.Sampler.run, which calls run_sweep:

Answers my question. Thanks.
