This issue should probably be to put that in the README.
Nah, we don't need more clutter in the README. I might just go in myself and link everybody who hasn't added a link to their GitHub page.
Ok consider making a contributing.md and linking that from the README. An added benefit is that when someone files a pull request, github automatically shows them a link to contributing.md!
This is a good idea.
