Locally, Command API cross references are not working.
With the Azure docs artifact, neither Channels nor Commands works, but Channels works for me locally! :(
Build this locally #3849
Clicking Command and commands should lead to another API page
Just need to update :mod:~qiskit.pulse.commands probably. It should work though, so unclear!
@SooluThomas has been helping me with this
The code (in #3849) is correct but the corresponding .rst files aren't generated in the stubs/ folder during the build, which is why Channels and command are not hyperlinked when the html is generated. I'll look into the details and will open a PR if I find a solution.
Thank you @SooluThomas !!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
:mod:foo.x will only add a hyperlink, if the file exists. Currently, the stub files for the modules aren't generated during the build, which is why the hyperlink isn't working.
The stub files for the modules qiskit.pulse.channels and qiskit.pulse.commands.command can be created during the build by adding
to the end of the docstrings so that the stub files will be generated and that particular directive will be hidden.
@nonhermitian Any Ideas?
Update: Paul agrees to the proposed idea. I'll be opening a PR for this üéâ :
