Does it really make sense to have do_regtest update the repository and therefore possibly itself?
Especially in cases where we're running do_regtest multiple times for different configurations on one host, it is definitely better to have one shared repository for the different builds and not update them in-between.
I would at least disable the update by default, especially now with Git where there is the possibility that there is no remote to pull from.
maybe also @alazzaro your opinion?
Indeed, indeed. Actually, I don't do that. i.e. I always use -nogit...
I agree, that git pull should be independent from git log. The later should, if possible, always be executed.
I wouldn't mind changing the default behavior, but we should consult with @mkrack first.
The PSI regtester run also do_regest with the -nogit -nosvn flags. The git pull is done as the svn update before in the local wrapper script. So, I would also not mind, if the default behavior of do_regtest is changed to -nogit.
Well, if nobody uses the feature then maybe we should remove it altogether?
Agreed. There is also an easy way to pull out the SHA if a .git is present without Git. Will do tomorrow.
