Here's what I get when building quick.cuda with GNU 5.5 and cuda 10.1:
It's not clear where you are expecting to BLAS from; probably something simple I did wrong, but if it happened to me, it's likely to happen to others.
Hi Dave, Thank you for reporting this issue. We still have to work on making the installation process user friendly. It seems like linker is trying to link scf object file compiled for cpu version. BLAS is not required for GPU version since we use CUBLAS. Is it possible that you ran "make quick" before running "make quick.cuda"?
I did indeed run make quick prior to running make quick.cuda.   Did I mess a step, like make clean in beween?
Yes Dave, please run make clean in between. But before doing so, make sure to backup existing quick executable or delete $(exefolder)/quick* from line 230 of Makefile (https://github.com/merzlab/QUICK/blob/QUICK-2.1.1.11/Makefile#L230).  Otherwise it will delete any existing quick executables from bin folder.
Got it; built the quick.cuda executable, which passes all the HF and MP2 tests, but fails on the B3LYP tests:
This is on a V100.  I know nothing about the expected outputs, but I don't see anything that is obviously wrong (other than lack of convergence).  I can set output or log files if that would help.
Can you please send me output files of these tests? I just ran the same tests on a V100 (QUICK compiled with GNU/4.8.5 and CUDA 10.1.168) and I dont see any convergence issue. When you have time, can you also run BLYP and B3LYP examples located inside examples folder? Thanks!
Hi @dacase, we have fixed these issues in QUICK-21.03. Please give it a try whenever you have time. I am closing this PR.
