Hello Sir,
I am finding problem in executing the vqe code.
The error I am getting is below:

I tried installing these packages but the error is still not resolved.
Need your help.
I only see a snapshot of the top of the .py file, there is no error message to review.  Can you send error message.
Note: there are no additional packages to install.  the "opflow"  functions are all part of the general qiskit install.
I don't believe anything special is needed to execute the vqe ansatz benchmark.
Since I cannot see the error message yet, I cannot comment on what you are running into ...
The error I am getting is:

I think, there is some problem with the packages. I think, it needs some edit in the codes.
Thank you in advance.
As of Qiskit verion 0.26, the qiskit.opflow module is a part of the standard Qiskit install.  It used to be part of qiskit_aqua I believe, but for at least a year it has been moved to the primary qiskit install, so you don't need any other installs.
And you shouldn't need to edit anything in the code for the benchmarks.
It is possible you have an older installation of qiskit.  If you put the following into a python file and execute it you can see all your latest versions of several qiskit modules:
import qiskit
qiskit.qiskit_version
I have the latest, and the output I get is:
{'qiskit-terra': '0.20.2', 'qiskit-aer': '0.10.4', 'qiskit-ignis': '0.7.1', 'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.19.1', 'qiskit-aqua': None, 'qiskit': '0.36.2', 'qiskit-nature': '0.4.1', 'qiskit-finance': None, 'qiskit-optimization': None, 'qiskit-machine-learning': None}
'qiskit' itself is up to 0.36.2 (or maybe even greater by now)
If yours is less than 0.26, that would the the issue.  You will need to upgrade your qiskit installation.

Yes, my qiskit version is old. Thank you for this great help.
Do you know how to upgrade the qiskit installation?
Thank you for the great help. Problem resolved.
Great!
