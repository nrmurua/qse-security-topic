Clicking just causes mirrors to be dragged again. Works fine in Firefox.
I just wanted to report the same issue. To add additional information: Rotating the mirror works in Microsoft Edge.
On my Chrome it works (Desktop, Chrome 58.0.3029.110, OSX 10.10.5).
Could you write which version you use?
Interestingly it now works on Google Chrome 58.0.3029.110 (64-bit) [Windows 10].
Indeed, I can't reproduce this now either :) Weird. Clsoing.
On Chrome 62.0.3202.94, I can't rotate the mirrors either.

I was able to reproduce this by prematurely stopping the simulation, here are the steps:
Unfortunately now I can't seem to get it to rotate pieces again, even after a cache-clearing hard reset   :(
EDIT: after posting this it started working again  üëç, but now my steps to reproduce the issue aren't reproducing it
I also have Chrome, but never experienced this problem. Maybe it is about MacBook Pro touchpad, which I have.
Created a work-around (b5bde33).
Now small drags (ending in the same tile) do rotate.
Does it help?
