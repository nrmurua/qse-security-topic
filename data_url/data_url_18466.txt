Per review comments in #212, it would be nice to reduce the number of special variables in app/src/entry-point.lisp wherever that is possible and makes sense.
Most of the bindings occur in quilc::process-options.
Can we close this now?
No, this is a (perhaps poorly worded) separate issue to the one addressed in #212. This is about getting rid of the special vars altogether wherever possible, whereas #212 was about moving away from global mutation via setf and friends to dynamic let bindings.
