We have Iodine in the def2-SV(P) and def2-SVP basis sets. These have to be used with the corresponding 28-electron def2-ECPs. We do have ECP routines but I am not sure if those work. I have not tested. I also do not see ECP info in the basis set files. If we don't support ECPs, then we need to take out elements that require ECPs.
@agoetz I will check all basis sets today. We should remove elements that require ECPs from def2 basis sets and throw appropriate errors if users try to use them. In the documentation, we must explicitly mention what basis sets are available and what elements are supported.
