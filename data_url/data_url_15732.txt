All the routing passes StochasticSwap, SabreSwap (after #7111 ), LookaheadSwap, and BasicSwap all enable you to initialize the pass with coupling_map=None but when you call run() on the pass they all fail with the same attribute error:
This doesn't come up in the preset pass managers because they skip the execution of routing passes if the coupling_map is not set.
Either the pass fails with a TranspilerError describing that routing can't be run without a coupling map, or we simply return the dag because without a coupling map there is no routing to be done so it should be a no-op.
Fix the logic in the routing passes to handle coupling_map=None
Hi,
I would like to attempt to resolve this issue.
Best,
Chandler
@mcbennet: in case you didn't see, the issue was assigned to you (I don't think you get notified).
Thank you @jakelishman . I fortunately did get the notification -- it said I received it because I was assigned.
I hope to submit my fix within a day or two, if that is an okay timeline for this.
Ah cool, no worries then.  There's no need to feel timeline pressure on our behalf here.  We'll be very happy if you get a fix within two days, but this particular fix isn't urgent, so there's no need to rush if you're busy.  If it were to become urgent in the future and we'd not heard from you for several days, one of us might ping you to ask if you were still on it, but that's about it.  If it became super urgent, we'd let you know, and assign someone internal.
Closed by #7141
