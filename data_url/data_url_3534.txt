Not sure if this is a bug or normal behavior, but here is what I found:
If I execute any program without MEASURE instruction, it produces KeyError: 'ro'. If I add MEASURE instruction then it executes normally.
The same happens with pyquil 2.0.0b1 and with pyquil 2.0.0b6. Running Python 3.7.0 on MacOSX 10.13.6.
For example, this code produces error:
And this code executes normally:
I know there is no much sense to execute program without measuring/reading output, but at least error message should be more descriptive (or maybe better: print empty array as an result which is behavior I expected).
Thank you for submitting this issue! The error message should indeed be more clear, or an empty array should be returned. I will work on that soon.
For now, just to give you an idea of what is going on, the qc.run method is a convenience wrapper around several calls to qvm.qam (QAM is a quantum abstract machine, in your case, the QVM): first, qam.load(program), then .run(), then .wait(), and finally, .read_from_memory_region(region_name="ro"). That last part is where qc.run is making the faulty assumption that you'll always want to read measurement results.
One tip: If you don't want to bother thinking about any of the above, you can use qvm.run_and_measure(p). This will also compile your program for you (which you can include in your program with compiled_program = qvm.compile(program), and then qvm.run(compiled_program)).
@lcapelluto thank you very much for prompt response üëç
