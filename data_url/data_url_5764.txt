I suggest these two modifications to the NoiseModel class:
and
This would allow a user to query different noise parameters using timestamps, which can improve analysis of local simulations of noise models.
I've done these modifications in my local install and they work fine, but I couldn't figure out how to PR them here
We discussed datetime argument in #1474. We suggested to create a new API from_backend_properties() in the PR. backend.properties() cannot take arguments.
Related issue in Terra: Qiskit/qiskit#7834
backend.properties() cannot take arguments.
But here says it does take refresh and datetime. I have code running locally using these arguments on backend.properties().
I guess I'm failing to understand why NoiseModel.from_backend() would refer to something that is not one of the IBMQ's backends
The backend interface is vendor agnostic and provides an general interface for any hardware or simulator to interface with qiskit's compiler and provides a abstract interface that authors of applications can leverage to reliably and uniformly execute circuits on a variety of hardware. The BackendV1 class defines this interface here: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.BackendV1.properties.html#qiskit.providers.BackendV1.properties and as you can see it doesn't take any arguments. (you can also see a guide on how to write a provider here: https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/providers.html#writing-a-new-provider but it is using a newer version of the interface which doesn't even have a properties() method). The qiskit-ibmq-provider's backend class documentation you linked to is one implementation of this abstract interface and in that implementation they add the extra keyword arguments for refresh and datetime to the properties() method. But that is a custom feature for only the ibmq provider and not something that can be used generally as only backends from the ibmq provider will support it. qiskit-aer's NoiseModel.from_backend() constructor is designed to work with any backend object from any provider and we can't have it only work with IBM's backends. So if you wanted to build a noise model from a different provider (for example: https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-honeywell-provider, https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners/qiskit-aqt-provider,  https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners/qiskit-ionq, or terra's fake backend provider) these kwargs aren't valid and would raise an exception if they're passed to the properties() method.
I see now, thank you for the explanation
This is not an issue of Aer. We hope a provider supports to set a specific datetime for backend.properties().
