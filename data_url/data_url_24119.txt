Move the custom fillet functions written for Gmsh, to a separate toolbox so that GDS renderer can use it too!
Use the fillet functions written for Gmsh, to render fillets in GDS. Additional features included in the new fillet functions:
GDS renderer already has an in-built fillet functionality and there's no need of shifting this code to a toolbox. This change is not planned. Closing this issue.
