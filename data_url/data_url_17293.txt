There should exist a set of methods to search through and filter a pulse schedule by certain characteristics such as channels, intervals, and instruction types and return a new pulse schedule containing only the filtered schedules.
Any idea for how this might be implemented is a generic private filter method
schedule._filter(*filter_funcs)
that takes a set of filter functions (its also possible that _instructions could be augmented with this capability as well). This method would then traverse the tree of schedules/instructions and only return valid entries.
Finally, a public filtering method could be exposed with often used builtins such as
schedule.filter(*filter_funcs, channels=None, instructions=None, Intervals=None)
