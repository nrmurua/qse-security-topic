Unlike other less-urgent software packages, supporting the latest versions of quantum libraries (Qiskit, PyQuil, PennyLane, Braket, etc.) is quite important for the usability of Mitiq.
The scope of this issue is to support the latest version of Qiskit in our dev_requirements.txt file.
In practice one should find a way to fix the tests that are failing in #1126.
This I think should be handled by #1164, we can close this when that's merged
Closed by #1195
