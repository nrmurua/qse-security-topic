The DSP processing routine with two channels enabled can keep up on its own until about 3kHz. Higher ADC ODR settings will lead to the processing routine missing samples every now and then.
High processing rates (>1kHz) in combination with high telemetry rates (>10Hz) lead to failure. (Maybe even at lower rates, just less likely. To be investigated)
Debug information using the serial port have negligible time penalty.
The telemetry task just pushes the next dsp process a bit into the future:

The settings_update task pushes all future DSP processes further therefore slightly breaking the DSP processing. Additionally an ADC sample might be skipped if the relative timing is unfavorable:
