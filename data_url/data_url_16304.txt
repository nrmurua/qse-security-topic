Original Issue Post:
#1053
The note on the documentation page for the CHGate displays an equation where a 1/sqrt(2) is incorrectly factored out the final matrix representation.
The problem can be observed here:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CHGate.html#qiskit.circuit.library.CHGate

I looked into this issue and I believe I fixed the code in the docs to match the suggested solution. This is my first time submitting an issue fix so I want to make sure I have done everything correctly. Could someone help me properly test and submit the pull request?
Hope this helps and I'm excited to continue contributing!
