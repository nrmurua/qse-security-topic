Can you give a bit more details, about your environment (OS, version, etc.), and how you invoked the tests?
Hi christian,
Please refer below OS, Version
OS Version is Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS.
OpenSSL 1.1.1f  31 Mar 2020
I follow the steps according the instruction
Please kindly advise.
@Yamin88 We happen to have an AWS Development VM with exactly those OS specs -- All steps you list above are running just fine -- however the tests seem to take hours -- but still the errors you list above didn't occur (yet -- tests still running...).
Can you pinpoint the specific test that fails so we can try to reproduce? Can you also confirm the test passes on a "stock" (non-OQS-) openssh (v8.9)? Particularly the last error message makes me wonder whether this really is an OQS error as a non-OQS algorithm (ed25519) is found failing in an openssh test...
PS: After a long time, the errors reported above also appeared in my setup. However, they were preceded by
which again points to a more general error in the test case: ed25519 is not an OQS algorithm. But then again, I'm no expert on openssh (incl. its testing)., Maybe @xvzcf or @christianpaquin could comment more?
FYI (answering my own question above): The error gets triggered right away by running PATH=pwd/..:$PATH:. TEST_SHELL=/bin/sh sh test-exec.sh pwd hostkey-rotate.sh in regress.
I'm no expert either on the OpenSSH internals, but indeed checking if the non-OQS version of OpenSSH fails would be very instructive.

Done. It doesn't (fail). So this is an OQS-issue.
But then again, further tests fail beyond the ones labelled "investigate further". I'm in the process of extending that list, checking it in and adding the test to CI such that this a) doesn't happen again and b) we can decide how/when to tackle #89.
Hi Everyone,
Thanks for giving advise.
It solved because I install classic OpenSSH and generate the keys for testing.
I uninstall openssh server , client and re-run again everything from scratch then it works.
Best Regards,
Yamin
