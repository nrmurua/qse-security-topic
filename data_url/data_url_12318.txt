I initially tried to follow this colab notebook tutorial from a youtube video from three years ago. I am using a M1 Macbook Pro. I also have tried on HP Envy with Windows 10. I have tried following these instructions as well, especially for my Mac of course. #655 Every single time, regardless of device or with using Google Colab, I get this error,
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow_quantum (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow_quantum
I have not found a single solution that works. I am not sure what to try next.
M1 can be a pain sometimes, the only solution that I know of (that doesn't work for 100% of people) is: #655. Windows is unsupported (past very early versions). Colab recently changed its default python version, so you might be able to roll that back to an older (supported) version, but I have found that to be extremely finicky (see #794 for more info). When I need to do local work(i.e. non-cloud solutions), I have a windows machine that I have WSL on and that I have found to be the most reliable solution.

Unable to install this package with command: pip install tensorflow-quantum==0.7.2 , under a Linux conda environment using Python 3.11. Any progress on this issue?
