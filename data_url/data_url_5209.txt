There appear to be a handful of places in qvm-app and dqvm that are still calling MAKE-INSTANCE directly to create QVMs and passing the old :AMPLITUDES initarg rather than using the new :STATE API.
To reproduce, run the pyquil tests against qvm built from master. An example of the pytest error output:
For instance, in qvm/app/src/configure-qvm.lisp, there are several make-appropriate-qvm methods that wind up allocating the amplitudes themselves and passing them along to make-instance.
Likewise in the run-qvm function defined in qvm/dqvm/tests/program-tests.lisp.
