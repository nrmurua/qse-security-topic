Not sure if this issue belongs here or in Aqua.
While working on VQE, I encountered a circuit that looked large, after transpilation with linear connectivity.
The circuit contains Evolution components. It turns out that if we first perform a full connectivity transpilation, to convert Evolutions to basis gates; then transpile again, this time with linear connectivity: this process significantly cuts the number of 2-qubit gates.
Note that performance of VQE is affected, since VQE runs the large circuit.
In the following code, many values of num_orbitals and num_particles demonstrate the issue.
Output is:
Transpilation is not guaranteed to be optimal. Moreover, one can expect to obtain some benefit from retranspiling an already transpiled circuit, at the cost of doubling the transpilation run time. However here the gap is large, and looks like a bug. In fact, the transpiled circuit is so large, that it is better to replace the linear connectivity transpilation by swapping on demand, without even trying to minimize the number of 2-qubit gates: this naive on-the-fly transpilation yields a smaller number of 2-qubit gates.
With a lot of help from @mrossinek , here is the way to reproduce this issue with 'qiskit-terra': '0.21.0.dev0+ce4f94d', 'qiskit-aer': '0.10.4',  'qiskit-nature': '0.3.2'. Thanks!
