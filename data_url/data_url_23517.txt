Currently, Station.load_config_file can only load a single YAML file. Even when running said method a second time on a different yaml file, it does not append the data from the new file and keeps the original yaml file in memory. For systems with many instruments and parameters it would be very useful if instead of a single file, Station.load_config_file would be able to load multiple yaml files and combine them.
Example usage as proposed by @samantha-ho:
CC @jenshnielsen, as discussed in our meeting last week.

Thank you for openning this issue.
We will add the suggested feature to qcodes :)
