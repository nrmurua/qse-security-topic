I attach a non-trivial circuit (grover.qasm) to illustrate another problem.
grover.zip
It is a simple 3-qubit Grover's algorithm that renders a final state with the winner 6, as shown here:
As you can see, the 6 with a probability 95% stands out. That is perfect.
Now, run this:
./staq -S   -m   -O1   -d   square   -M   steiner   -l   bestfit   -f   qasm   -o   grover_staq.qasm   grover.qasm
The grover_staq.qasm produces a final state like this:
That is wrong because no clear winner stands out.
That's interesting. It looks like the error originates in the mapping phase. It seems to happen even with the fully connected architecture which leads me to believe it's an issue with the translation from rz and ry to the native U gates. I'm away for a few days but I'll try to further pinpoint this and fix it ASAP.
It turns out this problem was with the openQASM parser in Quantum++. It's fixed in the master branch now.
