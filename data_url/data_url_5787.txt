As far as I see, the API docs (starting from https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/aer_noise.html) don't contain documentation about depolarizing and flip errors/
I don't follow what specifically you think is missing?
The API docs you linked list all the the noise generating classes and functions like depolarizing_error, pauli_errors etc. If you are talking about noise models from backend, that is described in the documentation for that method:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.aer.noise.NoiseModel.from_backend.html#qiskit.providers.aer.noise.NoiseModel.from_backend
I don't know. I didn't see the depolarizing before but I see it now. Must be my mistake. Closing.
