Additional tests for existing features.
Always add proper tests to new features.
detailed look into coverage with py test as why it is not being reported. may be because fo symlink issue as mentioned by Adrian or because of improper coverage compilation flags for underlying C++ code !
@imranashraf I ran into this stackoverflow post on testing SWIG wrapped code using python.
Tests should be fine but coverage doesn't seem to be working, there are no proposed answers.

I also ran into this interesting article on testing this morning, worth the read IMO http://pythontesting.net/strategy/why-most-unit-testing-is-waste/
Thanks @AdriaanRol for sharing the article. will give it a read.
I consider testing on par as of #30
