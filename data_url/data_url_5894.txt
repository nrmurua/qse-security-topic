For the future release using chunk based state management, calling qreg()  from outside of State class causes problem.
Because there will be multiple qregs for multi-chunk implementation.
For example, in unitary_controller.hpp
  state.save_data_single(result, "unitary", state.qreg().move_to_matrix());
can not return whole matrix if the matrix is distributed on chunks.
So, it will be implemented as
  state.save_data_single(result, "unitary", state.move_to_matrix());
then state can collect whole matrix inside state classes.
#1025 is the implementation.
#1025 is related to this
Closing as #1025 is already merged.
