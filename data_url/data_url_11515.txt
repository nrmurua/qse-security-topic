The same example of QGAN training works well with an old version of Qiskit Aqua (0.7.3) but gives very bad results with Qiskit Aqua 0.8.1
In fact, when run on Aqua 0.8.1, the code below achieves relative entropy equal to 0.1567 while the same code reaches relative entropy equal to 0.0034 with Aqua 0.7.3 (I tried this in two different computers with that olde version of Aqua)
This is the graph of the relative entropy with Aqua 0.8.1

This is the graph of the relative entropy with Aqua 0.7.3

Run this code:
The results should be similar (and with decreasing entropy, as in Aqua 0.7.3) in both versions of the library
Maybe there is some change in the default parameters from one version to another?
@Cryoris Can you check the uncertainty models?
@Cryoris were the uncertainty models investigated - I assume this issue is still present in the code?
That's actually a bug in TwoLocal where using circular entanglement on a 2 qubit circuit produces this
instead of
Since the QuantumGenerator uses TwoLocal(.., entanglement='circular') if no generator circuit is given this breaks the QGANs in the two qubit case. Explicitly using the second one with only one CZ produces the right convergence:

I'll open a PR in Terra to fix the TwoLocal there.
The reported problem has been corrected by the Nlocal fix in Terra, thanks @Cryoris, so I am closing this.
