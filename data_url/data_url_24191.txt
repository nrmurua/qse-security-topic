After installing Qiskit_metal in a separate conda environment while trying to import it the below error occurs.
I would request you to once try to open jupyter notebook and see if it is working. Kindly write the following commands in Anaconda prompt or preferably Miniconda prompt:
1.) conda env create -n <env_name> environment.yml
2.) conda activate <env_name>
3.) python -m pip install -ve .
4.) cd C:\Users\manan_narang\Documents\GitHub\qiskit-metal
5.) jupyter notebook
6.) Open Tutorials Folder and try to run the .ipynb file
Another alternate would be to try and open it in VSCode by activating the kernel in it and running the files.
Hope this helps!
Solved by running
$ pip uninstall PySide2 to remove conflicting versions from pip/pip3
Then reinstalling from conda-forge
$ conda uninstall pyside2
$ conda install -c conda-forge pyside2
No idea why the initial install did not work, things look okay in environment.yml
Same error even in jupyter notebook.
As far I understand there is no compatible version of PySide with python 3.9.4. While I try to install using pip install pyside it shows errors. It checks for Pyside 1.2.4,1.2.2,1.2.1,1.2.0,1.1.2,1.1.1 and no matching distribution is found.

I think the problem lies with the installation. I would suggest you re-install qiskit metal. I faced some issues while installing and it took me three tries to get it up and running. If it is possible, try to install it in miniconda as it is much simpler.
Hi,
I did not notice this case. This issue is addressed in the FAQ. it is a common issue due to upgrading PySide2 to a newer version (that goes with the newest python). Creating a new environment will sometime not help because the environment picks on shared libraries or residues that still points to the other API.
Also note that youa re using 3.9, but you are not using the --no-deps flag for the installation, so you end up with two versions of some libraries, including PySide2
