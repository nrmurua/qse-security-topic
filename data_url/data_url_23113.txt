I am surprised, it is unittested
first I thought the issue was related to #60, but its the test checks output_direct=='off' (not intput=='off').
2 points:
looked in the NA gui definition: it looks like module.pause or stop is indeed called when the corresponding buttons are pressed. but I would not put my hand into the fire that the logic is flawless, because it extends over more than 50 lines of code with repeated stuff. Isnt it simpler to define the 'running_state' as a selectproperty, and to use a more condensed way of writing it, and to clearly display the current running state in the gui to avoid problems?
and I also believe that the right NA logic should set amplitude=0 instead of output_direct='off', since it happens that one measures transfer functions internally...
so the unittest should rather test for that I think..
now (after cleaning out the attribute logic, including attribute constructors and especially selectattribute behavior, unit test indeed shows that na does not stop when paused). so there is nothing surprising about what I observed, its just a bug
@SamuelDeleglise: Are you on this bug or do you want me to find it (I risk cleaning the AcquisitionModule then, though, which I guess will take another half-day)
Which unittest is failing ? all the test.test_na tests are OK on both python 2 and python 3 here ...
closing this for now
