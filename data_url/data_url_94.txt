In LinkedLibraryHolder.cpp, we load (dlopen) all the nvqir simulator libs on construction.
This could potentially create issues like what we saw here (the linker switches between simulator libs at will)
Note: this is the same issue as what we've fixed for OpenBLAS: #186
One potential fix is to make LinkedLibraryHolder.cpp to do proper load/unload of polymorphic plugin libs (e.g., backend simulators) as requested.
