Currently the calibration is in a tutorial, let's move it to ignis
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-iqx-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/advanced/ignis/1_calibrating_a_qubit.ipynb
@dcmckayibm I plan to add fitters and schedules for this. Main question is do you want this under ignis/characterization/calibration, or under ignis/pulse/characterization/calibration?. In other words, do you want pulse and circuit versions where relevant in the same low-level dir, or better two different trees for pulses and circuits from the top level?
