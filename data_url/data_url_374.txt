CUDA Quantum has a runtime dependency on the C++ standard library. Right now, this is libstdc++-11-dev.
Outside the docker image that is distributed, this will cause issues when e.g. a newer gcc 12 is present and the standard library resolves to version 12 on the system. While this isn't fully addressing a broader issue, it would be good to update this dependency to libstdc++-12.
The broader issue to address is that we update CUDA Quantum to use a specific version of the standard library rather than relying on the system setup. This work will be tracked separately and is not covered by this work item.
Do we want to stop testing gcc 11? Could be good to test both gcc 12 and gcc 11 to make sure we don't introduce gcc 12 dependencies.
Done with #84.
