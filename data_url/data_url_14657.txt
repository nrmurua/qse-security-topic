Symmetric gates that have a name and a parameter printed to the right of the gate (side text) do not display properly in either the old or the new latex drawer. There are 2 issues with this.
The first is that when using @!R in setting up qcircuit, the library will then evenly space the rows based on the size of the largest vertical gate. Here are 3 examples of where the side text will display.



The side text should adjust vertically so it is evenly spaced between the rows.
The second problem is that with qcircuit, it is only possible to have one command for each row/column intersection. The side text is displayed using \dstick which places the side text below the top bullet of the symmetric gate. To get it to the right it is placed in the next column over. So this can happen,

And with a very wide gate name, the side text can seem lost way out to the right.
There doesn't appear to be any solution to this using qcircuit commands only. A \newcommand using xy-pic and/or Latex commands should probably be written to specifically address the side text situation.
I've taken a look at this and it doesn't seem necessary to define new commands. As explained in qcircuit's FAQ site, using \raisebox instead of \dstick seems to be helpful. Also, modifying the value of \hspace according to the column width instead of having it constant can help with drawing the name as close to the gate as possible. It's not trivial, though, since we need to find a reliable way to take into account the 'extra' columns needed to write the names of the gates.
I'd like to give this a try, but it will take me a few days to see if I make any progress.
