This works correctly for Acquires which take a list of acquire channels and memory slots, but this has been deprecated since the function was written. Now, every acquire takes only one channel and a memory slot or register slot.
Try to use the transform with Acquire(acq0, mem0) + Acquire(acq1, mem1)
It will output a set of acquires for each instruction
Only one set of Acquire instructions
Only add_implicit_acquires needs to be updated
I suspect this to have been obsoleted or fixed during #5854 or one of its surrounding PRs, so I'll close this as "stale" now.  If I'm wrong or there's more to say, please feel free to re-open.
