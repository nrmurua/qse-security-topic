(#563)
Are we programming the FTDI chip? I recommend we don't, or only with existing software that is already proven to "work" with their buggy silicon.
Right. But IIRC there needs to be some programming to tell the chip how to use and expose the four ports. Maybe that's also something that the manufacturer can do.
Doesn't OpenOCD reconfigure them dynamically? IIRC the only benefits of EEPROM programming are 1) the JTAG port won't appear as a ttyUSB device before OpenOCD claims it 2) fancy USB identifiers.
IIRC the serial port doesn't appear at all. That needs eeprom programming. Nothing in the current openocd code even touches that. Maybe the JTAG port doesn't need an EEPROM. But that kills one way of distinguishing Saymas.
In the likely event that there is a problem with ftdi_eeprom other than getting an EEPROM binary, I suggest simply using the official Windows tool. ftdi_eeprom/libftdi usually has very puzzling behavior if we're not doing something that everyone else is already doing, due to the abundant FTDI silicon bugs and quirks.
As a side note, I'd be happier if there were a good alternative to FTDI JTAG+UART. FTDI are not worth our time, buggy silicon and nasty company.
Done.
Since serial assignment and initial configuration (EXAR, MMC...) should be done by the manufacturer, they should do the FTDI EEPROM writing as well.
Since the XCKU040 bitstream is 128 MBit and we will put the RTM-XC7A15T bitstream, and (definitely for Sayma standalone) the bios, and the runtime, and configuration after it, we need to support 4 byte SPI flash addresses in openocd, and in the misoc spi flash driver as well.
With current https://github.com/m-labs/openocd
and https://github.com/jordens/bscan_spi_bitstreams both SPI flashes and the multi-TAP chain with the RTM-FPGA works fine.
Cannot get it to work with the RTM disconnected:
Works fine when RTM is there. Greg wants to check if this is a hardware issue.
Well. Strangely enough I cannot reproduce the issue after disconnecting the RTM again...
@jordens Can the script above be put into an OpenOCD target file for Sayma? Can it be submitted upstream?
A lot of the openocd wrapper functions need rewriting to support multiple TAPs and multiple flashes. Then yes.
pld device virtex2
This also should be cleaned up, it's not a virtex2.
Sure. File a bug with openocd.
