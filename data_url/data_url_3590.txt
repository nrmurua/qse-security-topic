It would be nice to have a minimal example of how to edit the ISA manually and for each 2Q edge that is not "1-6", replace the "type" entry by "CPHASE".
The current explanation here
https://github.com/rigetticomputing/pyquil/blob/master/docs/source/qpu.rst
is great but could be more informative.
I use a function
that may be useful to people
Someone who may or many not want to be named sent me this code:
`acorn.isa
def modify_edge(e):
if sorted(e.targets) != [1, 6]:
return e._replace(type='CPHASE')
return e
acorn_cphase_isa = acorn.isa._replace(edges=[modify_edge(e) for e in acorn.isa.edges])
acorn_cphase_isa`
@joshcombes: is there anything else to be done on this? (e.g., adding this code to the documentation?)
