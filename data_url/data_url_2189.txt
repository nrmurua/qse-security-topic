You can do some pretty crazy things using public attributes. I recommend prefixing operations and qubits with underscores and exposing via a @property
Agreed.
do you want to restrict the attribute assignment with the property descriptor?
Yes
Please assign it to me @Strilanc
Thanks @kevinsung
@Strilanc do you want me to code setter function as well for qubits?
After looking at code in moment.py. There is a problem with variable qubits. It has been holding assignment value in the constructor.
It will throw attribute error if you don't write the setter method. other easiest solution would be creating new function for setting affected_qubits. Let me know what you think
Having a setter would defeat the purpose. In the constructor you should use the private attributes instead of the properties.
Please close this PR as requested code changes merged into master from PR #2391
@kevinsung Thanks.
