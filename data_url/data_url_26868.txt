Have you considered adding an interface to the MAGMA library? It may help to utilize a GPU more effectively particularly when a task is saturated with calls to lapack routines.
We have investigated MAGMA in the past, without any real benefit. Note that the GPU part is driven by DBCSR, which is also used for DGEMM calls. Please provide a PR if you have any specific suggestion.
