Right now mirror circuits only have CNOTs. We want to support other two-qubit gates motivated by hardware providers with other gate sets, e.g., CZ instead of CNOT.
Add a two_qubit_gate parameter to generate_mirror_circuit. This should be front-end agnostic (e.g., not a cirq.Gate or pyquil.Gate).
Every two-qubit gate in the circuit is then an instance of the provided argument, e.g. CZ instead of CNOT, and the rest of the behavior of mirror circuits is the same.
@DSamuel1 can you take this one?
