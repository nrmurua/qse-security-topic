Each section in the tutorial page has its own index page showing up as an icon similar to the tutorials itself which is confusing.
Go to https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials.html#quantum-circuits, click the last icon "circuit tutorials".

It will lead to this page https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/index.html which contain the same tutorials in the section but in its own page.
Remove index page of each section in https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials.html
Either remove index.rst in each folders of qiskit-tutorials repo or update the glob rule in tutorials.rst in qiskit meta package
The index pages are required for building the tutorials in standalone docs builds. Without the index files for each section the tutorials will not be included in the toctree for the build. This will cause warnings which will be fatal in downstream builds (such as in qiskit component CI) and a docs build output where you can't navigate to the tutorials (assuming it builds them).
I suspected that. Is it possible to exclude index.rst in the glob rules under each section in qiskit meta package repo?
This PR #1234 tried to address this issue but it was put on hold. Let me investigate a bit further.
