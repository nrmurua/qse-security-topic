Dear All,
I tried to install cirq on windows as described here: https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/docs/install.html#installing-on-windows
And the library succefully installed but I cannot import cirq. When I tried "import cirq"  I am getting "DLL not found" error
How can I solve my problem?
Best regards
Thanks for filing @apassenger - can you please provide more details? I could not reproduce the issue:

It would be great to know
Thanks!
Hello,
Thanks for your answer and sorry for my late answer.
I am using Windows 8
Python version is 3.7
Here are my all messages:


@apassenger Looks that error is in matplotlib. Try downgrading your version of matplotlib and try again like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24251102/from-matplotlib-import-ft2font-importerror-dll-load-failed-the-specified-pro.
Hello,
Thanks a lot :)
I needed to upgrade matplotlib, after that I have 3-4 similar error and I did the same thing for the other libraries and now it is working
Thanks again and I am closing to issue :)
