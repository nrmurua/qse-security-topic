I noticed there's quite a lot of API docstrings that are not formatted properly by Sphinx.
As a random example, pyEPR.calcs.convert has improperly formatted Python code and LaTeX typesetting w/o the Sphinx math directive. Another example is pyEPR.calcs.back_box_numeric.black_box_hamiltonian with in-line math.
