Upstream Kyber768_META.yml is missing a "common_dep: common_ref" line, which results in  OQS_ENABLE_KEM_kyber_768 being omitted from this if statement: 
This can be reproduced using my feat.minimal-build branch (jschanck/liboqs@4feed617).

This is a really nice new build switch: hope you intend to do a PR for this: Fast(er) build, (comparatively) small lib, (nearly) fully functioning. Nearly: tests/example_kem|sig fail due to "alg hardcoding" - logical as it's an example; but probably needs to be skipped in testing if this option is set.
