Solver (client init / solver fetch / config / env) can be defined in multiple ways:
Currently, parsing is done in Client.__init__, but other parts of Ocean might benefit from exposing it (e.g. DWaveCliqueSampler when trying to add order_by to solver).
Exposing it as **config-rewriting decorator might also make sense.
