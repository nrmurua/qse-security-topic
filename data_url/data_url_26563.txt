Calling the regtest script with TESTOPTS="--restrictdir QS/regtest-ri-mp2" also checks the regtest directory QS/regtest-ri-mp2-opt .
The behavior of --restrictdir has slightly changed with the new do_regtest.py script.
Maybe we should call re.fullmatch instead?
I am in favor of re.fullmatch to reflect the former behavior. At least, the new behavior is not documented for the user. In my case, I am just interested in testing regtest-ri-mp2, not in the other directory.
