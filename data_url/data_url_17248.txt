I added a circuit print to each stage in the passmanager (which might be a handy debug flag to add in the future) to see where this is being moved, it looks like one of the consolidate blocks passes is where it moves while doing the fixed depth loop. It goes from:
(which remains unchanged from the cxdirection pass earlier in that loop iteration)
to:
So for the actual devices, the measurements have to occur at the end.  So, while there is a bug here, depending on how literally you take "transpiling targets a given device", this example should throw an exception to begin with since the input circuit is invalid for the target backend.
Running this again it now returns
Which I think is the expected output with the measure at the front. This was fixed by #2764
^ Yeah that looks right -- closing.
