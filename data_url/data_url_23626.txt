The current Tektronix 5208 driver has a few quirks.
Also, there should be a run state (AWGCONTROL:RSTATE?) parameter.
@WilliamHPNielsen would it be possible to add a Wait_For_Run function (maybe with a better name) that waits until the AWG is running:
@ThorvaldLarsen roger that. I'll do a little bit of testing to see how far one can get with *OPC?, but it seems like a good and useful function (although I'd add a timeout).
