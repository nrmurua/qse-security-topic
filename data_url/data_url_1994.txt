From the doc string:
Operations marked with this tag are presumed to have zero duration of their own, although they may have a non-zero duration if run in the same Moment as a non-virtual operation.
This is very confusing because noise certainly has "duration".  Of course we only support "noise" in simulation (well on the quantum computers too haha).
Do we have an example of a noise composition that is useful?  Right now noise composition feels dangerous since noise does not commute and the new model is highly dependent on this ordering.
Discussed at Cirq Cync.  Decision was to remove automatic tagging but allow optional tagging for noise models.
@dabacon Can we close this issue?  It does not seem very relevant anymore.
I believe noise models still do this, we should convert that to optional.
I think the main code has been changed but I believe the code in contrib and experiment noise_models does this
Thinking more about this, I actually think the virtual tag is OK for the noise models.  Submitted a PR to clarify the tag docstring which I think will close this.
