Hello,
I am trying to package pyquil 2.22.0 for openSUSE Linux.
I ran testing on pyquil with Python 3.8.5 and Pytest 5.4.3 which give me an error found below.
The test session was ran in headless server with no network connection, there for any test that need network connection was ignore with a command
%pytest --ignore pyquil/api/_qvm.py --ignore pyquil/tests/test_quantum_computer.py
as such.
However, pyquil/api/tests/test_compiler.py does not seems to need network connection but fail with error shown below.
The install dependencies are as follows:
The full error log can be found here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/home:andythe_great/python-pyquil/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/x86_64
Thanks you.
I can reproduce this if the compiler is not reachable (doesn't depend on the network being up, however). Going to close this for now, but if you think the compiler is running and reachable in your system, then please re-open.

Thanks, when compiling package for openSUSE, there is no network connection. I will just ignore these specific tests.
