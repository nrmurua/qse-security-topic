The tests test_long_name and test_plot_barriers can never pass locally on OSX.  I can update the reference images to those returned by my setup, but the tests still fail saying that the images are different by >0.1%.  I have no idea why this is since they should be exactly the same.
This was blocking #2505, until I skipped the tests given that I can never satisfy them.


I think this is an issue with the python version. It seems to pass with 3.5 but fail with 3.6 for me running on OSX. This is an issue we seem to run into a lot around different python versions adding very slightly different amounts of whitespace around images. A possible solution would be to skip the tests based on the python version, I don't think this is ideal but it is preferential to always skipping them.
