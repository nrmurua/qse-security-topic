What ARTIQ version?
You need to manually install openocd-0.10.0-1 or wait for 3.5 to do that for you.

@jordens That's in 3.4 already, and 3.4 is fixable on Windows by updating the binutils package. Doing that now...
@mingshenli try updating ARTIQ to 3.4. If the problem persists, check that it installed the OpenOCD version that @jordens recommended.
