Measurement results differ in compiling with/without coupling_map.
With this QASM (coupling_map=None), expected measurement results are {'1001', '0001'}
{'0000', '1000'} are obtained with coupling_map = {0: [2], 1: [2], 2: [3], 3: []}
I cannot assign myself this issue. But I would like to have a shot to see if I can fix it... just FYI
The attached patch fixes this issue.
If the first layer is trivial, it should not be ignored. Fixes #81

@itoko  Can you check the patch fix?
@lbello  thanks for the fixing. Is it possible to create a branch and work and that branch so that it is easier to merge later?
@rraymondhp not sure what do you mean? create a branch in QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py? I dont have privilege for that. I created the PR #105 with the fix.
Thanks. I meant your fix is important and should be pulled asap.
And, you have already made a PR to fix the issue! Thanks again.
My colleague has confirmed that it worked on his instances.
