Add ElmerFEM to qiskit-metal renderers.
Details:
Currently, Elmer Renderer is available for use only on a separate branch of the qiskit-metal repository (for details, see installation instructions here).
Furthermore, the version of elmer_renderer available therein only supports the PlanarDesign class, which needs to be updated to support MultiPlanar objects instead.
In combination with Gmsh Renderer, ElmerFEM will provide an open source alternative to ANSYS. This allows users without access to ANSYS (which is a paid tool) to run analyses on qiskit-metal designs.
