Cross-post from NixOS/nixpkgs#95527
Parallel tests fail on AMD Threadripper 3990X system with 128 cores, e.g.:

All failing tests:

On 128 core system:
Current build config: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/08df77da32b8adb91f45cbf0dd978fb9d46feaa7/pkgs/development/python-modules/qiskit-aer/default.nix
Tests don't fail.
Not sure if this is due to an issue with OpenMP or qiskit-aer's dispatching algorithm.
@drewrisinger
Could you tell me if your issue is resolved with #918?
@hhorii I don't have access to the machine that raised this issue, pinging @jonringer. I know that he resolved the issue externally by limiting the number of cores used to build packages to ~4.
@jonringer, I know you're busy, but if you have time to test, this should be able to be tested with the existing qiskit-aer derivation & checking out master (ef7fd43)
LGTM
although, it did take 22 mins to run the tests for nixpkgs, the rule of thumb is <5 mins. Maybe we could have a --fast version? or opt into a --slow version.
not sure if self.override will actually work, but you could make it into a "point" then override it:
Thanks @jonringer. Closing based on tests passing on master build.
Thanks @drewrisinger and @jonringer !!
