Moments are, or should be, immutable.  However currently the return type of _measurement_key_objs_ returns a set and not a frozenset.  This means one could change this set and modify the Moment.
This is, however, a breaking change in terms of types, i.e. we would change the return type for _measurement_key_objs_ to FrozenSet.  I'm not sure we have a great way to deprecate return types?
We can leave the return type as AbstractSet but return FrozenSet, which is a subtype. I would not consider this a backward-incompatible change.
They're copied before the public protocol returns 
So this only affects the private method. (Ideally we should have specified the dunder to return a frozenset, then avoid the extra allocation in the public protocol implementation, though that might have created its own issues).
