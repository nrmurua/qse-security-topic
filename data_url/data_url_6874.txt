I have used Quirk before but after a recent upgrade of Chrome on Linux (64 bit) any circuit gives NaNs for any measurement (mine or the demo ones). I am not sure if the culprit is Chrome or a change in the simulator. Firefox on Linux works as does Chrome under Windows.
Both recent Chrome production and beta are affected. This also occurs in a private window, so I do not think it is extension related.
Hmm, sounds serious. Though Quirk definitely isn't giving NaNs in updated/preview Chrome instances on two machines I have.
When you try this it just shows NaN results? There's no other indication of error, like the big yellow report-error box thing showing up at the bottom of the page?
Is there any error or warning output to the console? (Hit ctrl+shift+J to see Chrome's console.)
Does the same thing happen in firefox?
Did you also upgrade other things at the same time (e.g. GPU drivers)?
Working now. By the way, Quirk was featured today on Hackaday ;-)
Whaaaaaaaaat, that's awesome!
