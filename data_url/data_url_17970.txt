Test it in staging.
Temporarily added it to the 0.6 milestone, as it's the only item left in the checklist at #649 . I believe this is really a "tracking" issue and can be safely postponed to after 0.6, but prefer to wait for confirmation.
Please see #950. All tests pass when environment variables are set for staging ibmq_qasm_simulator which verifies that staging accepts new Qobj. I believe this also points to them returning new results, could someone verify?
Waiting for merging #997
Gonna close the Issue, as seems like everything is already set up.
