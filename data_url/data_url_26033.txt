In your notebook compare_gate(braket).ipynb you noted 22 Braket gates that raise an exception when passed through the transpiler.
Right now, we aren't as concerned about the Pulse gates or noisey gates. So for braket.circuits.gates.PulseGate, we want to output a custom error message when the CircuitConversionError exception is raised that says that we don't support pulse gates yet. For any of the gates in the braket.circuits.noises module, we want give a similar error message that says we don't support noisey gates yet. Each of these should have an associated test case in test_from_braket.py that makes sure the correct error message is given when one of these gates is passed.
Finally we want to add support for the remaining two gates, braket.circuits.angled_gate.AngledGate and braket.circuits.angled_gate.DoubleAngledGate in convert_from_braket.py and add test cases for each in test_from_braket.py.
