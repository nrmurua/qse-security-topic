When I create a Bloch or Q-Sphere, the drawing displayed is horizontally stretched.
I would expect the spheres to be shaped like spheres instead of ellipsoids.
Is it possible the backend (matplotlib?) needs to be updated?
What's your matplotlib version? Cause mine is  3.2.2 and Bloch shpere is fine for me.
Additionally, did you try adding %matplotlib inline or infact, try adding figsize param: plot_bloch_multivector([1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)], figsize=(10,10))?
@obliviateandsurrender I'm running matplotlib version 3.3.0 (so this might be a version issue?) and neither figsize=(10,10) nor %matplotlib inline fixed the drawing.

I can also replicate the issue with matplotlib 3.3.0 but not with 3.2.2.
Likely due to https://matplotlib.org/3.3.0/users/whats_new.html#axes3d-no-longer-distorts-the-3d-plot-to-match-the-2d-aspect-ratio
@gschaffner Do you think creating a default argument for set_box_aspect would fix the distortion?
Hey, looks like this has not been fixed yet. Mind if I take a look at this?
@e-eight yes please do! i hope you can figure it out but let me know if i can help with anything
Cool. I'll let you know what I find.
