Description of the issue
CirqBot added both the size: XS and size: XL tags to some PRs when it should have either kept one tag or removed the old tag when adding the second.
How to reproduce the issue
My guess:
Note: #4467 doesn't look big enough to be categorized as XL.
Cirq version
N/A
Might just be a case of Cirqbot failing to update on a PR (see also: stuck automerge states) - we'll need to reproduce the issue to confirm. Either way, this seems low priority to me unless we have users or automation depending heavily on these labels.
