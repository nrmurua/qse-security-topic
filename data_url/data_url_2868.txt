e.g. under simulator we have "Results", but that could easily clash with other Results from other packages. So we should call it "SimulatorResults" or similar.
One thing to think about is that it might be useful to not have everything at top level.  For example stuff in contrib shouldn't.  What about stuff that is in google?  I'd prefer that to stay only accessible via cirq.google.
Correct. Company-specific stuff stays at an inner level, and similarly for contrib (though contrib will be more of a wild west).
Do we have other examples besides the simulator code?  I think that one is fixed.  Going to close unless there was another.  Please reopen if we see others.
