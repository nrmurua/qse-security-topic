In #5219 I've started seeing test failures in analytic decomposition tests, see https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/runs/6913023342?check_suite_focus=true.
Possibly related to recent change in default precision (#5426).
This doesn't seem to be fixed yet.

Another one
Is this fixed now that 128 has been rolled back?
yes fixed.
