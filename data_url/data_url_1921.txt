Can cirq  work on Large-scale distributed platformï¼ŸSuch as several machines each with one cpu, or several machines each with one gpu, or several gpus on one machine?
Hi @amandalqy - thank you for your question.
Yes, Cirq can work on a large scale distributed platform using qsim. More specifically you would need to use qsimh via qsimcirq.
Please note: Usage related questions usually go to Quantum Stack Exchange with the cirq tag. Closing, as this is not an issue per se.
