PauliTrotterEvolution doesn't work with 'qdrift', only with 'trotter' and 'suzuki'
Error message:
PauliTrotterEvolution should work with qdrift, as stated by the documentation:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.opflow.evolutions.PauliTrotterEvolution.html
It works with 'trotter' and 'suzuki'
Unsure. I've tried using
instead, but that gives the same error message.
Can someone with permission transfer this over to qiskit-terra as it relates to the opflow code there
