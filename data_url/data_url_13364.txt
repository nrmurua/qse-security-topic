As a part of #908, and as specified by the RFC we want to add a general concepts section to the docs about how ZNE works in Mitiq.
@crazy4pi314 I could attempt the theory based portion for this. I'll prepare a rough outline for the community call this week to make sure my contribution will describe what's outlined in the doc.

Sweet @purva-thakre! I will try to get a PR open for the rest of the new ZNE section so you can PR to that :)
@crazy4pi314 I can help with sections 1 and 2 (basic usage and simple example) for ZNE.
Shall we try to meet next week (@crazy4pi314 @purva-thakre @Misty-W) to try to split up existing content and work on it in a way that tries to harmonize the work of many authors? Even just knowing what existing text may be split up in which of the 5 sections will help.
It's not much at the moment but I have a very brief outline. We can discuss more and make changes on Tuesday. Here's a link to the Google Doc.
