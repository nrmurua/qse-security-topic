What should happen is that the current range is returned.
What happens instead is a value error:
('Cannot get/set CURR settings while in VOLT mode', 'getting yoko_current_range')
This is because the driver checks the mode of the command (a command like current_range can only be used in the 'CURR' mode) not against the actual source mode (gotten from yoko.source_mode()) but against a cached value yoko._cached_mode. However, in the init yoko._cached_mode is always set to 'VOLT', even when yoko.source_mode is 'CURR'.
This is probably fixed by changing line 198 in the driver to self._cached_mode = self.source_mode(), but I was not 100% sure that this is the desired solution?

@abargerbos i think indeed the fix that you are suggesting is a step in the right direction - could you submit a PR and then we can take it from there?
@Akshita07 or @FarBo, this might be an issue for you to look into?

Definitely.
@abargerbos
I am working on some fixes. I will test those fixes and make a PR. But, the fix is something like what you proposed.
@abargerbos
Have you seen this notebook:
https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/driver_examples/Qcodes%20example%20with%20Yokogawa%20GS2xx.html?highlight=source_mode
With the current driver, you should be able to switch between modes as shown in the notebook. Could you try to follow the notebook to see if you can successfully switch to the current mode and run yoko.current_range() without any issue?
The driver can be improved, but I would like to know if the current driver is capable of switching between modes.
Edit: I tested yokogawa with the current driver. It can switch between modes as shown in the example notebook. If you reconnect the instrument, you should switch off and on it to be able to switch between modes. Therefore, there is small bug in the driver that needs to be fixed if you don't want to turn off and on the instrument when you want to reconnect it. I am working on the fix.
