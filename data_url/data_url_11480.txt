nakanishi_fujii_todo() optimizer fail to return OptimizeResult except in the case of args = ().
I tried to run the following code
and then I got the following error
nakanishi_fujii_todo() should return OptimizeResult without errors.
OptimizeResult(fun=fun(np.copy(x0)), x=x0, nit=niter, nfev=funcalls, success=(niter > 1)) should be OptimizeResult(fun=fun(np.copy(x0), *args), x=x0, nit=niter, nfev=funcalls, success=(niter > 1))
Thank you. Aqua was deprecated from the previous release, so the fix in Terra is enough. Qiskit/qiskit#6525
As per above - I don't think this is critical bug that needs fixing, which is the policy now Aqua has been deprecated. We are encouraging people to move off Aqua and use the code from where it now been relocated, so if anyone comes across this then it has been fixed already in the relocated code in Terra thanks to your reported issue there.
