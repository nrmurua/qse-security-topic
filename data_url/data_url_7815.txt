Using the HarmonicOscillatorWaveFunction class one can compute and plot the position wave function.
However, for relatively low Fock states the routine used by Qutip begins to fail. This makes it hard to plot e.g. the GKP position wavefunction which requires a lot of Fock states to converge.
The bug starts to appear for Fock state n=43. Below I have only plotted n = 47 because that's the first time it becomes very noticeable.
The (crappy) code snippet I provided seems to fail around n = 151.

Thank you for reporting.
Everything in qutip.distribution is experimental: not tested and little documentation.
We probably won't have time to look at it soon, but we will keep the issue open until we do.
