When an instruction has a label, the label should be used. If a no-boxing instruction has a label, a box should be used.

Something like the text drawer:
Should the label replace the gate text or should it be used as a second line like parameters? I was thinking we'd do this as a second line not replacing the gate text
Should the label replace the gate text or should it be used as a second line like parameters?
No strong opinion there... If does not look too cluttered, why not...
