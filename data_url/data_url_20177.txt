Rather than leaving them to fail in wrappers
Isn't this already doing this? (added when the wrappers last failed)
I missed that, I guess so, yes.  But we are still getting a 'wrong ciphertext' related failure in liboqs-go. https://travis-ci.com/github/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go/jobs/375154216#L6234

Maybe our approach isn't complete. Once we figure out what is wrong with the go error we can improve our test.
@vsoftco From your recent look at liboqs-go, do you have any ideas on what additional type of test beyond what we have now would be appropriate here in liboqs to detect that previous wrong ciphertext bug?
@dstebila will take a look and get back to you
Discussed in today's status meeting.  Conclusion is that it's something to do with how Go manages the stack, and that the tests in liboqs are sufficient.
