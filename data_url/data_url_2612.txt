I traced this issue: the test_controlled_op_to_gates_concrete_case test is failing on equality comparison due to numerical instabilities. The instability is introduced by cmath.phase() method call here https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/google/decompositions.py#L125.
In failing case global_phase value is (0.7071067811865476+0.7071067811865475j),
which results in cmath.phase(global_phase) to be 0.7853981633974483 on my linux machine and 0.7853981633974482 on my mac.
I don't think we should rely on numerical instabilities of the python library methods? Maybe it would be best to introduce an analogy to isclose() method, as is present in numpy or math python packages? In case of this test, comparison is performed on List[Operation] type but it would trigger a chain of isclose() implementations (I traced the error to equality operator of EigenGate).
