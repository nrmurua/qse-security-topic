Right now we use only float* objects for our gates. It would probably be better if we used Eigen3 matrices and then when it came to state simulation just returned the matrices row-major .data() property. This would make our matrices far more extensible than anything we have now.
This will be an issue to tackle later on once we have qsim and src more organized and well tested.
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
This has been cut. Qsim operations get away without it just fine.
