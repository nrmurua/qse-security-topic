It might be a issue of triggering when using a channel pair consists 2 channels in 2 HDAWGs.
Attached is the seqc_prorgram by calling program_manager.to_seqc_program()
OK. there's a syntax error in seqc_program line 30. A semicolon was missing.
Another compilation error after a quick fix:
new seqc_program:
The actual problem is that 1 HDAWG has only 2 digital triggers, thus the argument of waitDigTrigger() can be either 1 or 2. One needs to map firstly the physical connection on the front panel to the digital trigger 1 or 2 at LabONE web-interface - Sequencer tab - Trigger tab.
Alternatively a software setup can be implemented as well:
For example, to map the 2nd physical trigger input on the front panel to the diggital trigger 2:
ziDAQ('setInt', '/devxxxx/awgs/0/auxtriggers/1/channel', 1); should be sent to HDAWG, where the index after auxtriggers and that of physical trigger input are both 0 based indexing in the API!
I was not aware of the auxtriggers thing as I did not use it yet. We should add an interface for configuring the trigger to the channel group.
I like the mixing between zero-based and one-based indexing they do.
Now my suspicious is that 2 HDAWGs have different versions of firmware (66615 & 66605). Should that be the problem?
Fixed by manually make a TTL pulse to start the program.
eg. raising edge for HDAWG1 Mark 1
ziDAQ('setInt', '/dev####/triggers/out/0/source', 18);
ziDAQ('setInt', '/dev####/triggers/out/0/source', 17);
where 18 corresponds to the LOW level and 17 stands for the high level which are identical to HIGH/LOW in DIO - Marker Out - Signal - HIGH/LOW.
