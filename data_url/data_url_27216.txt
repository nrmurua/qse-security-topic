These macros are defined in P610_internal.h
I wonder why SECRETKEY_A_BYTES = (OALICE_BITS + 7) / 8 but SECRETKEY_B_BYTES = (OBOB_BITS + 6) / 8. What's more, ORDER_B_ENCODED_BYTES is defined as SECRETKEY_B_BYTES + 1 in P610_internal.h but in other Pxxx_internal.h ORDER_B_ENCODED_BYTES is just SECRETKEY_B_BYTES. According to my understanding, SECRETKEY_B_BYTES should be defined as (OBOB_BITS + 7) / 8 so that the ORDER_B_ENCODED_BYTES in P610_internal.h does not need to be especially defined.
