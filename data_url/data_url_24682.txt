The following tests are suddenly failing on travis across all branches without an apparent change to the tested functionality in question. Problems with sympy dependency?
This seems to be related with a new version of sympy (1.2) becoming available and being automatically pulled by travis during tests. The issues do not occur with sympy 1.1.1. Current solution is to fix the required sympy version to 1.1.1 in setup.py. However, for the future, these issues should probably be resolved for newer sympy versions (from 1.2 and up).
