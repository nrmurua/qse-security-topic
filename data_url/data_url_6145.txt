Add the ability to start in an initial thermal states (i.e. a mixed state with e^{-hw/kT} excited)
This could be done using a noise model or the quantum error instructions directly.
eg.
Then to initialize directly
Or to use an errror model
In the latter case you would have to make sure that the compiler doesn't remove the initial reset instructions.
@dcmckayibm closing this issue unless you have nay further questions?
