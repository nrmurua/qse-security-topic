Thank you for the great repo!
I can see many other are interested in surface code (from parity check matrix).
In the documentation https://pymatching.readthedocs.io/en/stable/toric-code-example.html#Simulating-circuit-level-noise , you propose to test surface code with circuit noise.
Do you know if it is possible to extract the corresponding parity check matrix from the stim circuit or from the pymatching decoder instantiated with the stim circuit?
Thanks!
