We should do two things to facilitate new users getting started (especially those using the .exe distribution):
That would be really cool. I like the MAC-address better. Or at least a prefiltering with mac-address and then try to ssh the good candidates... Of course this is a problem if ssh-ing to a redpitaya automatically disconnects other connected instances, but I believe it is not the case ?
posted a question here:
http://forum.redpitaya.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=2037
nmap does the job, but dont know how to integrate it in python:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/406792/list-all-mac-addresses-and-their-associated-ip-addresses-in-my-local-network-la
by the way, making an exe file with pyinstaller works like a charm if you use python3.4
Ok, there is this package, which would however add another dependency:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-nmap
Maybe we can cherry-pick the few relevant lines of code from them and work only with sockets.
looked into this, and the code is just a wrapper of linux nmap, so not suitable for windows or mac
@SamuelDeleglise : you are interested in doing the startup window?
I have in mind the following procedure:
OK, I will try to do that over the week-end
Scan for open ssh ports (works on both my computer and the experiment - and with these settings, correctly identifies all devices (superset of redpitayas for now)):

the hard part is to find the mac address in python without using os-dependent programs or external c-libraries.

current master version is quite acceptable in terms of usability
