I tried to put some function names in a list and let the kernel to call those functions by traversing this list. And get some weird behavior.
Run the following code:
run_static function works nicely but run_dynamic does not work for some functions. and the debug information can't give me any help:
I guess it has something to do with the compiler?
run_dynamic should have the same behavior with run_static.
Yep, by legacy code in the compiler that should be removed (we don't do compile-time delay analysis anymore).
