Error indicates that 'jobId' key is not found in self.result dictionary. My beta key for the api works, as I've tested and ran several programs using api.SyncConnection() Here's the traceback:
File "test.py", line 17, in main
while not res.is_done():
File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyquil/job_results.py", line 47, in is_done
self.get()
File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyquil/job_results.py", line 63, in get
return self.qpu.get_job(self)
File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyquil/api.py", line 296, in get_job
url = self.endpoint + ("/job/%s" % (job_result.job_id()))
File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyquil/job_results.py", line 55, in job_id
return self.result['jobId']
KeyError: 'jobId'
My source code was basically copied from the tutorial for testing purposes:
import pyquil.quil as pq
from pyquil.quil import Program
import pyquil.api as api
from pyquil.gates import *
from numpy import *
import sys
sys.path.append('/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages')
import nlopt
from pyquil.api import JobConnection
import time
job_qvm = JobConnection(endpoint="https://job.rigetti.com/beta")
#qvm = api.SyncConnection()
def main():
        res = job_qvm.run(Program(X(0)).measure(0, 0), [0])
        while not res.is_done():
                time.sleep(1)
         print(res.get())
        return 0
main()
Hi @schuylerfried , is this still broken for you? If so I will look into it
Unfortunately, it is.
My python2 and gcc versions are:
Python 2.7.13 (v2.7.13:a06454b1afa1, Dec 17 2016, 12:39:47)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
I think I know what's happening: we recently changed to require a user_id for the job.rigetti.com endpoint. That means your .pyquil_config file should look like this:
[Rigetti Forest]
url: https://job.rigetti.com/beta
key: 
user_id: 
If you don't have a user_id you will have to sign up again at http://www.rigetti.com/index.php/forest . Signing up only takes a few seconds now in our new system.
We will work on improving the error message.
Worked - thank you! And yeah, a better error message would definitely be helpful.
