Currently the cswap and ccx gates check that the size of ctrl and tgt are the same (if passed as list). This is not necessary, since we could broadcast a control to multiple targets or vice versa (as a shorthand). For example:
CX already allows one control to many targets.
I suppose any single element argument can be broadcast to the non-single argument size(s).
e.g. for ctl-ctl-tgt:
n1n -> nnn
11n -> nnn
nn1 -> nnn
@ajavadia Although I have one more PR under discussion, could I deal with this as well? Or, @ewinston, you would love to take it? Thanks!
Thanks @Exferro! I already started something for this.
