Description of the issue
It seems that gate decompositions ignore global phase (global_shift). Normally this is OK since global phases are not physically observable, but it has to be accounted for to properly decompose controlled gates, where the global phase turns into an observable relative phase.

From Cirq Sync:
We should update the decompositions that still ignore the Global Phase.
