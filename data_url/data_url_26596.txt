With the current sirius version from the toolchail (v7.2.5):
I don't have the output ready, but from earlier tests I remember there were also more, like the evp_solver_type.

@mtaillefumier, has this issue been resolved by the latest SIRIUS upgrade (#1627)?
It is most probably. We are working on the api to make it more robust. Passing the options is one of the areas that were modified. I have the patch ready but we are finishing work on the api on the sirius side.
Thanks! Then I'll close this issue as you still have electronic-structure/SIRIUS#662 for tracking it on the SIRIUS side.
