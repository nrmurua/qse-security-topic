I'm getting a TypeError when trying to get a backend by name using FakeProviderForBackendV2.get_backend
TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
Code:
Output:
TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
The provider should return the corresponding fake backend.
No response
Thanks for reporting this bug. @mberna Would you like to submit a PR to fix the issue?
This issue is caused by this line
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/f37dcf9d9c879867140b3072483a3dbd36cb5c1f/qiskit/providers/fake_provider/fake_provider.py#L78
backend.name is no longer a method but an attribute in BackendV2. Removing the () after backend.name should fix the issue.
It would be great to add tests for checking FakeProvider.get_backend() and FakeProviderForBackendV2.get_backend() as well.
