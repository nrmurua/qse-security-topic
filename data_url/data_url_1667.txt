Description of the issue
module 'cirq' has no attribute 'work' or 'version'
How to reproduce the issue
AttributeError: module 'cirq' has no attribute 'version'
tensorflow_quantum v0.5.0 depends on cirq v0.11.0 I am also unable to import tensorflow_quantum as I get the error
AttributeError: module 'cirq' has no attribute 'work'
Cirq version
You can get the cirq version by printing cirq.__version__. From the command line:
All earlier versions work very fine. I need this version(0.11.0) as the latest release of tfq depends on this.
Can you please clarify if this is the issue only with me? If true can you please help in rectifying this issue. Thank you in advance
It is working in a fresh environment
xref quantumlib/OpenFermion-FQE#90 (comment). I think in any environment that already has an earlier Cirq version, pip install cirq==0.11.0 leads to a broken installation.

Alternatively, pip uninstall cirq before installing 0.11.0 should work.
