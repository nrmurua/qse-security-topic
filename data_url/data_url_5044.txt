The passed array of (e.g.) control qubits is 'shifted' when applied to density matrices.
Though the change to the array is undone before returning, this still means a C++ temporary array cannot be passed to these functions - that's annoying!
Refactor to clone the array before shifting (if this can be done elegantly in a C vs C++ agnostic way)
Oops, nothing to do with immutability - C++ temporary arrays cannot be addressed at all. There's no elegant way to support passing array literals in C++, so w/e
