Dear Qiskit team,
Could we make torch an optional requirement for qiskit-aqua?
Given that only a few parts of aqua depend on torch, and that torch is a heavy (about 600 MB) dependency, I think it is fair to make it an optional dependency, which could be installed via pip install qiskit-aqua[torch] or pip install qiskit-aqua[neuralnetwork].
