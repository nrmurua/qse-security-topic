The automatic on-chip VCO selection is performed before the requisite configuration data has been written.
The trf performs automatic calibration of it VCO when the EN_CAL bit is set. The core device driver currently writes all settings in order of register address order. This results in the EN_CAL bit being set before all registers defining the VCO frequency have been set. For example both EN_FRAC and NFRAC are set after EN_CAL. The data-sheet explicitly states that EN_CAL must be set after the frequencies have been configured.

If the register values have not been set the VCO calibration will be performed for the wrong frequency.
Currently configuration of the trf is performed in  Phaser.init(), code below.

EN_CAL should be written only once the relevant values have been configured. From my current understanding of the data-sheet setting EN_CAL last should be acceptable.
In addition to the above, the data-sheet specifies that the RF and LO outputs should be off until calibration has completed. This is not done in the current coredevice-driver. This limits the achievable LO phase comparison rate (see sinara-hw/Phaser#129).

The outputs should only be enabled after the lock has been aquired

The current design follows the eval board software. That doesn't do any non-trivial setup logic and just writes all registers in sequence. The rest is left to the user. The complete configuration/tuning/calibration/setup sequence of the TRF is very much application-dependent and it's likely that there is no robust and simple universal setup.
