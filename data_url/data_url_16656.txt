The command given in jupyter notebook using qiskit not working, while it works in qiskit notebook.

@HimanshuBansal112 the qiskit_textbook package is separate from qiskit. You can install it by downloading this folder: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-textbook/tree/master/qiskit-textbook-src and running: pip install ./qiskit-textbook-src from the directory you downloaded the folder to.
Alternatively, the package is installed in the IQX Jupyterhub: example, so you can try it out without having to install anything on your own machine.
