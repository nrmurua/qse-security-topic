As shown in the attached excel and notebook QAOA is giving wrong results as the QUBOs and qubits start increasing with varying p. Slightly better results are obtained when p is larger. Benchmark is done compared to Cplex.
Run the notebook
Cplex and QAOA results should match

I did more extensive comparative study across the modes and attached the excel ("Final" tab) to #1434. Attaching it here as well for QASM behavior without MPS.
Cplex vs QAOA on simulators.xlsx
Please let me know if anything else like code I am using will be helpful to look at the problem on either #1433 or #1434
@yaelbh @woodsp-ibm I am attaching another zip with code and latest excel which I have attached in the new raised RQAOA issue as well https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/issues/1453.
