Hi,
According to the mesolve doc,
For problems with time-dependent problems H and c_ops can be callback functions that takes two arguments, time and args, and returns the Hamiltonian or Liouvillian for the system at that point in time (callback format).
Then, I would have expected something very basic such as
to be working.
Instead, it gives (full traceback)
Is it expected? (in this case the doc may be misleading)
I tried to trace it down, but could not get any luck for the moment.
EDIT: Actually, it seems that in such a case, one has to pass a density matrix and not a state as initial state, and that the liouvillian callback should return a .data item.
Will take a look next week.
Fixed in pull #537.
