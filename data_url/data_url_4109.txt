Both "Kernel" and "Program" do not have any attributes but a lot of methods to set things which one would expect to be attributes.
To give an example. The program has a set_sweep_points method but no way to see what the current sweep_points are.
This makes it hard to debug and see if everything works.
Hi @AdriaanRol I have added set/get methods to inspect various program/kernel etc attributes on inspection branch. Also have a look at tests/test_inspection.py for how to use these.
This was solved in #30
