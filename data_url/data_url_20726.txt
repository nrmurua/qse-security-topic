The aarch64 implementations of Kyber768 and Kyber1024 seem to be incorrect and don't pass KAT tests.
The cause is in indcpa.c, which for all three Kyber variants appear to implement the same case for K=2:

https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/blob/master/crypto_kem/kyber1024/aarch64/indcpa.c
Another issue are symbol name mismatches between assembly code and C code, which causes linking to fail.
Example:

This is also an issue in the dilithium/aarch64 code:

The issues were noticed while integrating the latest pqclean code to liboqs (open-quantum-safe/liboqs#1512). The liboqs-PR contains a few temporary patches with fixes for them.
A related question: While #488 added license headers to individual source files of Kyber/Dilithium/aarch64, the main LICENSE files mention only CC0. Was this an oversight or intentional?
