The .decompose() method for Circuit needs to be updated.
It expects a free parameter that will be the same for all gates in the circuit, where different gates will need to choose their own free parameter accordingly depending on the free qubits at each time instance.
It also appears to be the case that gates that don't have a specific decompose methods return the same single qubit gate even when it is being controlled by other qubits.
