It could be helpful to add a backend based on something like the simulator described in 'Fast simulation of stabilizer circuits using a graph state representation' (to my knowledge, that is the best known algorithm)'
I saw that there was previously a stabilizer simulator based on the tableau in Terra.
We are working on it and it will be an update
This is WIP in PR #13
