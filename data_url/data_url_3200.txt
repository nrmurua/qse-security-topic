The PauliTerm class has an inconsistent ordering for tuples formed out of pairs of qubits and operations on qubits. Consider the following code snippet:
raises an AssertionError with no clear reason why it's failing. The reason is that list(pt_ops) creates a list of tuples of the form (qubit, operation) whereas PauliTerm.from_list(..) demands a list of tuples of the form (operation, qubit). The fix for the above code snippet is then the rather ugly looking
