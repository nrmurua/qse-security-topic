Add tutorials section in the docs guide and include jupyter notebooks
Requires adding package:   nbsphinx (https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.1/)
As in
Once your conf.py is in place, edit the file named index.rst and add the file names of your notebooks (without the .ipynb extension) to the toctree directive.
Control of figure sizes:
@zlatko-minev metal docs are not currently hosted, they are built by each user.  Since each user builds there own copy of the docs, and views them by simply opening the index.html file (either directly or through the command in metal that does it) the docs can't execute a kernel themselves to actually run the guide notebooks.
The screen shot you attached above is from a separate qiskit project that contains tutorials hosted on the qiskit website, (note, they are also not executable from the website) - but a link is provided that shows how to run the tutorial in IBM Quantum lab.  See https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/1_getting_started_with_qiskit.html
Summary: We can compile into our docs readonly 'notebooks', but not executable ones.  We can also provide instructions explaining how to execute them.
If you agree to the above, the next question is which tutorial notebooks do we want to include?  All (including Deep Dive) or just some?  I can't think of any reason to exclude any of the tutorials we have in the guide directory.
