I think I may have fond a bug in:

Running the very simple example code:
returns the result [-3.0, -1.0, -1.0].
In my understanding of the documentation is that InteractionRDM(np.diag([1, 1, 1, 1]), np.zeros((4, 4, 4, 4))) should correspond to an RDM of a four (spin) orbital system (fully) occupied by four (uncorrelated) fermions, i.e., in state |1111>. This is consistent with the expectation values of Z0 and Z1 being -1.0 but Z0 Z1 should equally have expectation value -1.0, shouldn't it?
I fooled myself when cooking up the minimal example (of course my RDM is non-representable and thus the strange return value exceeding the operator norm of the observable is possible). I still think there is a problem but I will have to get back to you with a better example.
ah..representability...
@cvjjm do you still think there is a problem?
Sorry, I forgot to close this. All fine.
