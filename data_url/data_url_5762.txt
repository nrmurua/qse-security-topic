Running multiple instances of a noisy circuit results in the same counts dictionary for each instance of the circuit. They should be simulated as independent runs of a circuit so should not have identical outcomes.
This bug happens if backend.run() is called with the parameter_binds argument, where backend is a noisy AerSimulator.
It does not happen if the circuit instances are instead bound in advance and submitted to backend.run() without the parameter_binds argument.
The bug is also avoided if seed_simulator is passed to run along with parameter_binds. For the moment this is a temporary workaround to get the speed benefit of using parameter_binds while avoiding the bug.
Output:

The counts from each circuit instance should be independent of those from each other circuit instance. Otherwise this causes serious and hard-to-notice problems for users running simulations.
Thank you for your reports. I fixed this issue with #1512.
