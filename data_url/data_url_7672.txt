Hello,
When running through this example, I get the following error when trying to run pool = qu.linalg.mpi_launcher.get_mpi_pool()

What would be the solution to this? I believe this might potentially affect other examples using the get_mpi_pool() function. Currently I am using quimb verision 1.4.3.dev73+g5b3c7c1.
The mpi spawning behavior of quimb is due to be removed at some point. Which means running the get_mpi_pool examples in a notebook rather than under quimb-mpi-python is currently not supported. Apologies for the confusion.
