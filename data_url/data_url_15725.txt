A circuit that contains a C3SX gate can be translated to qasm, but the generated qasm cannot be translated back to a quantum circuit.
The error stems from a mismatch in the name of this gate between qelib1.inc ("c3sqrtx"):

and qiskit's python code ("c3sx"):

I would like the gate names to concur and the qasm to be convertible to a quantum circuit.
(This issue probably relates to #4943.)

Good catch! I think renaming the qasm definition to c3sx is the way to go so we stay consistent in our naming policy.
Thanks, if this solution is accepted I would like to submit a PR that replaces all the occurrences of c3sqrtx with c3sx - please let me know.
Yeah please go ahead!
