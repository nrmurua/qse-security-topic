Hello,
I am trying to build quimb for openSUSE Linux.
I use Open Build Service which allow me to build linux package for many microarchitecture from source.
RIght now, x86 pass but i586 failed.
From the look of the error, could this be because quimb does not support of 32 bit arch therefore failed on i586?
Below are some of the errors, for full errors, follow the link below.
Full error log for i586 here: https://build.opensuse.org/package/live_build_log/home:andythe_great/python-quimb/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/i586
Hmm yes (among other things) look's like numba and its parallel mode is not supported. You can try setting
to see if that mostly resolves things. numba is unfortunately still pretty temperamental.

I have attempted to export like you mention, it seems to cause more errors. I think it is better to disable build for 32-bit then?
Sounds like that might be easiest - I'm not sure what's going on here with the other errors I'm afraid! They look like some other numerical functions (I guess also numba) are silently failing and producing the wrong results.
Alright, thanks.
