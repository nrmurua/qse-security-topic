Hi,
I am trying to build a docker container for CP2k which will suit podman builds later on. Currently I am trying to build the following recipe with docker
While the compilation is sucessful, when I pull the image on NERSC Perlmutter and run the cp2k executable, I end with 'illegal instruction' output. When running the following example, I get no prompt/error messages on the screen other than 'illegal instruction'. May I please request your help with this?
Thank you!
You compiled with --target-cpu=native. Did you check, if your host system is binary compatible to Perlmutter, i.e. if Perlmutter supports the full instruction set of your system?
Thank you! That did fix the issue. However, a user is trying to run libxc with the above install and is getting the following error:
"unknown subsection LIBXC of section XC_FUNCTIONAL"
However, I have set "--with-libxc=install ".  Is this issue input file related or is something still incorrect with the build instructions?
Thank you!
Hi @juerghutter,
Thank you for your help!
I am closing this issue as it is now resolved.
