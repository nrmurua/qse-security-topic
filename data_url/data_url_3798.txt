Hi everyone,
I'm trying to run this code
sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler(solver={'topology__type__eq':'pegasus'}))
sampleset = sampler.sample_qubo(Q,num_reads=myreads,chain_strength=mychain,annealing_time=mytime)
rawoutput = sampleset.aggregate()
where it says
ValueError: API token not defined
I don't have such file: ~/.config/dwave/dwave.conf
I found this file: 
but sill I don't know what I have to add to dwave.conf
Hi @Hadeelmqs,
The easiest way to configure Ocean to access Leap solvers is by running dwave setup:
For more details, check Ocean's Initial Set Up docs.
