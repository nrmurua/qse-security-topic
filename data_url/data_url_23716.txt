@nataliejpg  most likely you have an old config file in your home or working dir ðŸ¦„ can you check if that's the case?
I think it is because it works on my mac
Best way to resolve? Delete and redo all the config? :( would be good if updates didn't break because you have previously added a config file (or if we could have some warning).
yup works after that but can we fix it or put a warning/instructions if something is not backward compatible? Think this is still an issue until that is addressed. Maybe worth renaming though
@nataliejpg  that's a good point. I will think about this ! thanks!
