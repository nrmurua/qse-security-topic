In trying to implement the new grover's fidelity calculation in braket, I noticed that the fidelity wasn't 100% in the grover's braket benchmark when running a noiseless simulation, as shown in the below image.

These results are also reproducible by using the current qiskit grover's benchmark setting use_mcx_shim=True, as seen in the below image.

I am not sure exactly what happened, because I ran the initial braket code, as in the commit which added the mcx shim, and the results were the same. I would think that potentially an update broke the functionality, but it seems weird that the results are the same in both braket and qiskit with the use_mcx_shim=True.
We could follow something similar to this reference to implement the mcx iteratively using Gray codes. Then again, this is the same issue pretty much as #10, which we decided we weren't going to fix until braket is updated to include these features.
