Requested by @mhramani #1307 (review).
Something like
which would be interpreted as a linear constraint $x_0 + 2x_1 + 3x_5 = 5$.
Like so?
Yes, something like that. Though the performance benefits of such a thing would come from implementing it at the Cython level, likely as a sibling method to cyConstrainedQuadraticModel.add_constraint_from_iterable() and cyConstrainedQuadraticModel.add_constraint_from_model().
Understood, I'll try to make a PR on this soon.
