As noted here #3866 (review), we should have some way of validating that our mock backends are configured in a somewhat correct manner. I propose we create a generic test for our mock backends that looks something like:
The construction of a worldline can be used as an initialization technique where the worldline represents a set of all states in our quantum system of interest. To say that the wavefunction can be anywhere on our worldline is to say that the no cloning theorem applies here. we can construct a chain of 10 C atoms as our mock qubits for an instance and thus computation involves the use of quantum principles(superposition, interference, entanglement) to associate the mock qubits to the computational(NV centre) qubit, creating a novel quantum chemistry interface with pulses.
I'm closing this as implemented these tests exist in: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/test/python/providers/test_fake_backends.py
