The toolbox is starting to overflow with a bunch of variants of the same gate, one for each possible number of qubits.
A workaround for this problem would be to allow the gates to be resized. The problem is that it's not clear how to indicate to the user that these gates can be resized, and how that action can be performed without it being confused with dragging.
My current candidate idea is to have an invisible 'resize tab' below the gate. So basically you tap the slot just below a gate to make it expand to fill that slot, but can also drag the gate up and down from there.
The obvious problem with this idea is that the resizing action is invisible. The user never sees it. Also I can't add any indicator for it, because that makes the circuits look bad when screen-shotted and pasted into a paper or whatever.
My solution to that problem is to show the resize tab when dragging, holding, and hovering the gate. Then I will fade it out after the gate is dropped. Users will automatically discover the resize action via actions they were going to perform anyways.
Hopefully that works without being terrible.
Initial work done in 9891f2f , but it's super-rough. Needs polishing and polishing and polishing.
