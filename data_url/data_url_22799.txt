Similarly to #103, I think junctions should be possible to give in ProjectInfo initialisation as arguments.
Doing
feels similarly hacky to #102 (though maybe not as much).
A syntax with dictionary of dictionaries could be supported
In this case pinfo.validate_junction_info() could be called automatically and an Exception raised
This would be backwards compatible?
