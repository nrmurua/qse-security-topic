Hi all quick question: after running an aqua algorithm on a qasmsimulator, is there a quick way to print the whole circuit so that I can view what has been done?
Hi @jason-jk-kang ,
Great question!
Currently there is no method supported by the QuantumAlgorithm class that allows you to do that, so there isn't one method is is guaranteed to work for all the different kinds of algorithms you run.
For VQAlgorithm instances you can call get_optimal_circuit(), but for other algorithms, like the QGAN (for which you can construct the final circuit using the generator used and the parameters returned by the QGAN.run() method), you'll need to do a little work.
For faster answers to questions like this, I would suggest the Qiskit Slack or a look through the docs!
In general the algorithms have a construct_circuit() that allows you to build/see the circuit that would be run and potentially run it yourself. When its an interative or variational algorithm then many circuits may be run under different parameters. Construct circuit may then require additional parameters to build it out, and for that you would need to look at the specific algorithm you wanted to do this with.
Question has been answered so closing.
