I am trying to learn to use qutip and I made a local environment. As per the instruction guide, I ran the qutip testing environment and got the following:
I'm unsure what is going on here. I tried reinstalling qutip without any change. Prior I had a lot of errors referring to xcrun but I fixed that by installing xcode. Is there something else I need to get this working?
I am with the same problem. Note that the QuTiP version and the python version is different. I have installed the python via macports, but I have also tested in anaconda system. The problem is the same in the anaconda.
Probable duplicate of #1197
This particular segfault was fixed by #1288.
