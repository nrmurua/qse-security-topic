The README just lists all algorithms at the same level.  We should clarify which algorithms have been selected for NIST standardization, which are in Round 4 or at other standards bodies like ISO, which algorithms are highly experimental (once we start adding signature on-ramp submissions); which build options will enable which algorithms, etc.
