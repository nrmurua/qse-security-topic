Text drawer incorrectly draws composite gates that contain both qubits and classical bits. This error seems to arise only when appending the composite gate and the qreg_list or the creg_list provided to the qc.append() is not in ascending order.
For instance consider the following code:
The text circuit drawn is as below:

Also, the numbering of the active wires is incorrect.
The error seems to be caused due to drawing the gate components in the incorrect ordering. Have a look at the following function will help.
