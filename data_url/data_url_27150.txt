Some recent Nixpkgs commit broke Turbomole. Now, patchelf throws multiple segfaults and the derivation crashes. I am a little bit lost. The last update to patchelf happened in August and does not seem to be the cause of the problem. @markuskowa Do you have any idea if something important has changed in patchelf or stdenv, that breaks this build? I have attached the build log.
