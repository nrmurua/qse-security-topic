The phase is bounded in [0, 2pi).
Probably just phase % 2*np.pi
Hi @nonhermitian  can I give a try on this. I would like to work on this.
Sure, go for it.
@shashwat-1234 - Just in case you are not working on this one, can I pick it up?
@nonhermitian
This issue has already been addressed, I checked the files global_phase has already been done equal to phase % 2*np.pi and I am getting the correct results for all values of global_phase given as an input.
@nonhermitian
I think is issue is sorted already.
Ok then will close. Thanks.
