On an unrelated change I saw this failure on the coverage tests.
https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/3738/checks?check_run_id=1857693314
see logs_3596.zip
confirmed - just a simple rerun made it pass: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/3738/checks?check_run_id=1858461253
anyone know if this is still an issue @MichaelBroughton ?
presumably fixed; feel free to re-open
