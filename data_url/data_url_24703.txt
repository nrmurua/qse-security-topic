pulses.SequencePT() raises
Exception: Identifier '<...>' assigned twice.
if subplustemplates consist of same subpulstemplates.
The problem occurs because the serializer deserializes the same pulse/file twice. This means there are two distinct objects with the same identifier which leads to an error when one wants to save them again.
Changed priority as this is partially fixed now.
