ENR states and operators produce an error when used with v5 solvers (mesolve and mcsolve at least, sesolve seems ok).
Key feature of ENR states is that dims and shape do not match, which can cause issues if dims and not shape are used in various operations.  Chatted with @hodgestar and in this case we think we pinned it down to iadd in QobjEvo creating an identity matrix based on the dims and not the shape.

though perhaps other issues could arise.
should work!

#1996 should fix it, or at least make the fix trivial.
It allows dims to know it's in ENR basis and it's real shape.
Somewhat related -- I'd like to have qeye_like(op) that takes an operator and produces the appropriate identity. One might naively think that qeye(dims[0]) does the right thing, but this issue shows that the situation is more complex than that.
We can already solve this without #1996 by just constructing a data object identity with the right shape and passing that to Qobj with the correct dims (but #1996 will make the situation a lot clearer).
The qeye_like would be great. potential good first issue?
Presently I think enr is the only exception to qeye(dims[0]) working.
I think ENR dims are wrong here: dims should contain the information about the space of the states and operators and with enr important information is missing.
Re qeye_like: It sounds like a great first issue.
Re ENR: Agreed information is missing.
