Short example of two subsystems;
LazySum of LazyTensor of sparse have memory allocations that scale with integration time, whereas LazySum of sparse has a constant number of allocations.
Integration takes about 6 times as long for this 225 sized Hilbert space.
Profiler showed some GC in _strides, but other than that all boxes are bluish.
Seems we allocate shape and strides vectors every time we do a lazytensor sparse gemm. This is a holdover from the old lazytensor code. We can probably replace these vectors with tuples?
