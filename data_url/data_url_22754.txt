that would reduce code size for experiments needing large tables of data (e.g. randomized benchmarking).
Done in new-py2llvm (although only truly immutable data, such as strings, currently goes to .rodata).
We are going to need to upload other types as rodata, though this is a low-priority feature.
The new compiler uploads embedded lists and such as .data.
