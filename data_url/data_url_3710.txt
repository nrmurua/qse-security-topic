The purpose of run_and_measure is for optimization.
The second argument allows you to specify the qubits you want to measure. But if you want to do that, you might as well use MEASURE.
Instead, delete the second argument backwards-incompatibly and just measure all of the qubits and return a list of your qubit measurements, where the list L is one such that L[q] is the measurement of qubit q.
this is done
