gives:

The figure instance needs to be closed before returning.
Same is true for schedule drawer.
Can you look at this @nkanazawa1989?
I can recreate the behavior in Jupyter Notebook by adding %matplotlib inline after the import statements, but I can't get the figure to pop up in a new window when I run the code from the console. However, it works as expected from the console if I add a filename as an argument to draw(), and the file contains only one copy of the plot.
I'm running this through Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10.
@taalexander Ok, I'll check.
