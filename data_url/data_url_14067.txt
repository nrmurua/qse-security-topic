I am very new to open source, so if I do something that is bad form, please let me know.
The function qiskit.qpy.load(f), where f a file object pointing to a serialized circuit, throws IndexError: list assignment index out of range if the circuit contains an AncillaRegister, but not if it contains a QuantumRegister.
The function qiskit.qpy.load() should correctly deserialize a serialized circuit if it contains an AncillaRegister.
qiskit.qpy.load() calls qiskit.qpy.binary_io.read_circuit(). This function only accounts for QuantumRegister and ClassicalRegister but not for AncillaRegister. This issue is also present in qiskit.qpy.binary_io._read_registers_v4(), which is called by qiskit.qpy.binary_io.read_circuit().
In qiskit.qpy.binary_io._read_registers_v4(), the lines
place an AncillaRegister under the key "c", because there is no specific check for "a" for an AncillaRegister.
