Executing a QNSPSA optimization with the same random seed gives different results.
We checked that the same optimization gives reproducible results with other optimizers such as ADAM.
Run an arbitrary optimization, e.g., VQE with QNSPSA, and compare the results.
The same results for the same seed.
Could you post a minimal reproducer?
The documentation for SPSA (from which QNSPSA derives) says
This component has some function that is normally random. If you want to reproduce behavior then you should set the random number generator seed in the algorithm_globals (qiskit.utils.algorithm_globals.random_seed = seed).
Could that have anything to do with it?
When I run the following VQE with QNSPSA I get consistent results, as @jakelishman said if you're not setting your seed using the algorithm_globals.random_seed that could be the cause.
2 example results:


We should make sure that the documentation for the QNSPSA class also includes the same note about setting the global seed, since users probably won't see it with it just being on a parent class.  Hopefully this is the issue here.
Great! That resolved the problem. I was not aware of the global setting. Thanks for pointing this out.
Great to hear!  I'll just leave this open for now as a reminder to ourselves to update the documentation in the class.
