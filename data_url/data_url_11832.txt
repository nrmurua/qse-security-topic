First of all, sorry for not following the complete bug report guidance. This is a really simple bug, more info will make it unnecessarily complex.
It is just a missing of str() in line 94 of qiskit_aqua.algorithms.classical.svm._svm_classical_binary.py. As a result, when the label is an integer, 1 e.g., will crush.
Sorry again,

We should use format to add value into str, will issue a PR to fix that. Thanks.
Thank you, chunfuchen. It is amazing how fast your team response to such a minor issue.
I also have to apologize for not leaving more information, such as the source code and how to reproduce the problem, which could have saved your team some time to debug.
Thanks again,
