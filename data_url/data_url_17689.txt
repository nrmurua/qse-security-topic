The from_qasm_str() method of QuantumCircuit does not seem to work.
As far as I can tell
Should print the qasm string as defined in this snippet. Instead it just gives
along with the error
The same occurs for the input qasm string in the form
As described above.
It works with
So I took a look at this and the issue is actually in the example script. The from_qasm_str() method is a static constructor, it operates off the class to return a circuit object based on the input qasm. In the example you're creating a blank circuit with qc = QuantumCircuit(), then creating a new circuit based on the qasm with qc.from_qasm_str(qasm) but never doing anything with it so it's not saved. Then you go back and try to use qc which is the blank circuit you created.
The normal pattern for using the function is something like: qc = QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_str(qasm) With this you only ever create 1 circuit object. While being able to create a new circuit using the method on an instantiated circuit object is a side effect of being a static method defined on the class. Using it doesn't effect that object and will only return a new circuit object independent of the existing object.
Thanks. So if I use qc = qc.from_qasm_str(qasm) then it would have worked (despite being a terrible way to do it!)
In that case, I guess there's no issue. It's not even that I found a method that leads to a fatal error, for which we could do something to prevent it, because it is possible to use this method to get the job done.
