As is visible for example here the speed_kem and speed_sig test programs are failing for all algorithms with "Illegal Instruction" when running on armhf (emulated at least -- real HW not at hand).
@baentsch :  unfortunately, the logs for the test run you linked to have expired and are no longer visible.
I took a look at a few of the recent test runs that failed on armhf but I did not see an "Illegal Instruction" failure.
Can you provide an updated pointer?
Thanks for taking a look!

Unfortunately, I can't: The "speed" tests have been disabled on armhf. Changing this, please see the results of #1535 as and when they become available (and/or run such tests repeatedly locally to check whether the problem still exists).
the checks for #1535 all completed successfully.
I looked through the output and test_speed.py does not report any problems.  It seems normal, although the tests for BIKE and SPHINCS+ are skipped.
It is looking like this issue has gone away (maybe due to a newer container image??).

Indeed. Thanks for reviewing this.
Documented as no longer an issue via #1535
