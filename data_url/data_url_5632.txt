When running a simulation of a pulse Schedule, the measurements are not done properly. In the example below, the state of qubit 1 is not measured correctly\not measured at all.
The state of qubit 1 should be measured correctly\as well, leaving a balanced distribution across all 4 states.
Everything about this bug report is deprecated\heading for deprecation, from Terra's Schedule to Aer's Pulse Simulator (#1809). Just wanted to put it here to make sure there isn't any non-deprecated cause for the bug.
(For what it's worth, we see no problem with Terra's Schedule [Terra issue 10324])
Could you try to use https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-dynamics?
Pulse simulator in Aer was deprecated and its successor is qiskit-dynamics.
