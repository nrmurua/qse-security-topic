On some system configurations, when following the installation instructions, I am getting the following error upon executing pip install cirq:
A virtual environment was set up using:
mkvirtualenv cirq-py3 --python=/usr/bin/python3
System 1:
System 2:
This is because the package declares that it supports 2.7 and 3.5.3+.
In the next release, we are loosening the 3.5.3 to 3.5.2.
Should this be documented somewhere? It only says 3.5 in the docs.
I'm actually doing a presentation/tutorial on Cirq this week and need the participants to install Cirq on their systems.
Updated documentation and next release should be 3.5.2.  Closing for now
