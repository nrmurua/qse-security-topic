AutodiffTester and QuantumNaturalGradientTester fail when operator()() is called only once prior to the loop over measured circuits (https://github.com/danclaudino/xacc/blob/vqe_composite_operator/quantum/plugins/algorithms/vqe/vqe.cpp#L113).

The reason is that the PauliOperator reverses the list of params when it is observing a kernel with variables.
See: https://github.com/eclipse/xacc/blob/master/quantum/observable/pauli/PauliOperator.cpp#L215
(inserting at 0 will reverse the list)
Looks like we're traditionally only doing observe() then operator()(), hence everything is consistent.
Now, when doing operator()() before observe(), the list of double is actually mapped in reverse order.
