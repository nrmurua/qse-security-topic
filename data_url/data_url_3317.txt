Hello Rigetti team, I encountered the following errors while I am casting jobs to Aspen-M-2 machine.
I am sure that I have successfully booked the time slot of Aspen-M-2 machine and run the program in that period.
I would appreciate it if you could look at and resolve this problem.
If the usage of the machine is not correct in my attached jupyter notebook, please kindly point the wrong part out.
Many thanks in advance for your help!
Code Snippet: I attached the notebook which can reproduce the same error.
test_m2.ipynb.zip
I used the "QCS Jupyter Notebook US Server" accessed around 2 pm BST on 27 August.
Operating System:
Python Version (python -V): Python 3.9.7
Quilc Version (quilc --version): 1.26.0 [cfd8748]
QVM Version (qvm --version): 1.17.2 [266c11e]
Python Environment Details (pip freeze or conda list):
Hey @BOBO1997 , please submit issues like this (which may or may not be issues with pyQuil itself) to the support team at support@rigetti.com. I've forwarded a link to this issue in the meantime.
Thank you for forwarding this issue to the support team. I also suspect that the problem is likely to be in the Aspen-M-2 device, though it might also be likely that the bug is in the provider system of the Aspen-M-2 machine in PyQuil. (since it seems that the jobs created by qiskit-rigetti library ran successfully on the device. )
Anyway, I will first submit the issue like this to the support team next time.
This issue will be closed in favor of the support ticket.
