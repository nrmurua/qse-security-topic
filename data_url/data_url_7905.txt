The default scaling factor of \sqrt(2) used by wigner() and plot_wigner() is confusing
produced a plot with coherent state that is NOT centered at alpha = 3 (mega confusing)
Does anyone know where this default scaling of $\sqrt{2}$ comes from?
In particular, I would suggest that the default be changed to g = 1  to make the above code segment not internally self-inconsisitent
I can easily submit a patch if needed
(also, although wigner() allow you to override the scaling factor, plot_wigner() does not...)
minor correction: the parameter g in the function call should actually be set to g=2 to get the correct scaling
(also confusing...)
It was originally for compatibility with the qotoolbox.
Hi, since it've been intended for compatibility, just changing the default could cause compatibility issues.
I also frequently use plot_wigner but g=2 is proper for me, so if it can be changed, I'm happy.
Thus I added argumens for plotter functions to specify a desired g value instead of changing the default.
