Several energy calculation functions in utilities.py will fail if Hamiltonian object contains terms that are not in the range [0, ..., n], returning an out-of-bounds error. Reason: in these functions, the terms of the Hamiltonian (which may be more than n) is used directly as indices for the bitstring (which has length n). A simple fix is to 're-zero' the terms in the Hamiltonian object so that they range from [0, ...., n].
Affected functions in utilities:
bitstring_energy, energy_expectation, energy_spectrum_hamiltonian
Example solution:
What's the status of this issue? I believe it's already fixed, right?
I believe Shao Hen decided to take care of it by adding it to another bug fix he was working on!
This remapping of qubits from 0 to n-1 has already been implemented for the Hamiltonian object. Closing this issue now!
