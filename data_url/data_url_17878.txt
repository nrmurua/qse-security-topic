I think it is important to be able to view the backend status. I find myself writing this code lots
and even this is not enough. I would like to be able to have a terminal or a section of my Juypiter (or even app) telling me continually the backend status.
I would like to write something like
and this makes an output for me like
I think we need to add 'provider': 'IBMQ' (also add this to the spec) and "status_msg": "This is a status message" where the status_msg is set by the backend controller (down for maintence, retireded)...
I think this should continue until I quit it, but this we can discuss more. Like the job_monitor it should live in wrapper or tools. I still need @delapuente to convince me what the difference is
This will need to also have for IBMQ hub, group and project
@nonhermitian can we link this to the other issue
#994
@nonhermitian can we make sure there is also a script that is called backend_monitor that calls the jypter and also the script
