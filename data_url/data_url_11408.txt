When attempting to run the pyzfs command line on python2 I get a SyntaxError.
This is because exec is a statement in python2, having more rules about it's use which are not present in python3, where it works fine.
A fix would be changing the name of the exec module.
It is a bit strange: I can correctly execute the pyzfs command for the examples after I used the pip in Anaconda2 (Python 2.7) to install the package. But indeed the exec name should be avoided. In commit f3aaa69 I have moved the pyzfs/exec/runzfs.py to pyzfs/run.py and changed the documents accordingly.
I got the error when running pip install . but not pip install -e . so yeah a little unusual. Also thanks for being so quick to respond and fix things.
