Currently, the Expectation layer requires a cirq.SimulatesFinalState, see this line.  Instead, it should be updated to directly call the methods in the new Cirq class cirq.SimulatesExpectationValues.
Do you have any more information on the errors they are seeing or an example that reproduces things ?
