This issues seems pretty outdated. One thing I did wonder as a follow on is do we have a notebook or guide on all the different simulation techniques one can use in Cirq (each of which can produce their own ***TrialResult objects) ?
I vote that we close this issue since this is quite outdated.  We can open a new issue if there are specific things that we want to document.
