Running testnet qrl 0.2.0
Call to Public API GetAddressState for Q0104004d40a781b697e69f7e806d0158acb9e8e0566a05dc06744756d81fc08b256ca4cbf7f0e3
returns an exception:

grpc._channel._Rendezvous: <_Rendezvous of RPC that terminated with (StatusCode.UNKNOWN, 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'balance')>
On my server node I see the following error at the time of the query:

I believe it is related to txhash 4fb7afe2f59ebc121321f8e8296879f8a7e59db99c57e320d0266fe166c85908
Curiously, I cannot query this address on the testnet explorer website either. The web page keeps spinning.
Thanks for reporting. Issue has been fixed in PR #1670
Fix will be available on next release.
