"The easiest way to avoid exit crashes is to call os._exit() before python starts collecting Qt objects" ...
@jordens Do you still see those exit crashes after 1193022?
No. But reverting (1193022) doesn't reproduce them. Nor does the original (109aa73) crash here. Let's close. I'll reopen if I see them again.
