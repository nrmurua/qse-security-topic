i have a function which i can encode data with it.

i want to design a controlled unitary gate with control is 0 qubit and my quantum state(statepreparation function) is my unitary gate.
simply speaking, i  want to have a unitary of statepreparation circuit.

U is my statepreparation.
here is my statepreparation function:
def statepreparation(circuit, angle, wire):
Hi @sassan72 , this should be possible by using the .control(1) method on your circuit. For example:

thanks. it worked.
