There is a small problem with some polarizers in this level.
The polarizers on (i=5, j=7) and (i=8, j=5) have names that do not match their images. Especially for the 5,7 polarizer this can be confusing because it would suggest no polarization adaptation is needed.

@sjvrijn I am not sure if I understand what do you mean. Could you attach a screenshot?
Checked this level and seem to look fine:

I've annotated the polarizers in the level based on their image (arrows) and name (text) in the following screenshot:

As you can see, the two polarizers towards the top-left are correct: arrows match the name. For the other two (outlined in red), the arrows don't match the name. For the right-most polarizer, the behavior matches that of the image (a 90 turn is needed), but for the bottom-most, the image suggests that no further polarization change is needed after the top-most filter.
Also in the encyclopedia, the polarization images do not match their names in half the cases (outlined in red)

I think I understand the confusion. It is due to projection of 3D object on the 2D board.
They can be rotated on board.
If you have an idea to draw them in a less confusing way, let me know.
Ah, now it makes sense.
I'll try to think about it and be sure to let you know if I think of something.
