Aer depends on qiskit-terra. As qiskit 1.0 is approaching, removal of deprecated code is getting more aggressive, consider running qiskit-aer tests with the the code in qiskit main branch. You can do that running this command in your environment and running tests with it.
If any of the test fail or find DeprecatedWarning, proactively fix that code (by deprecation policy, you should have a clear alternative for the removed code). Otherwise, your code will stop working in coming releases.
Ideally, it would be great if a regular (say, weekly?) CI job makes this check for you. Similar to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/blame/main/.github/workflows/unit-tests-terra-main.yml
