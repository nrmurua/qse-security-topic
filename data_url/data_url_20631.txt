Add CI tests on Windows
Just noting down so I don't forget: The project already has an appveyor.yml that runs a bunch of Windows tests. These tests don't work in our fork, and we have to figure out why.

Yes, because our fork as a bunch of OQS stuff that doesn't compile. My strategy in PR #237 was to keep the original appveyor config as close to the original as possible, adding the OQS build, and our PQ tests, keeping the other tests as well.
Finally managed to get an AppVeyor job through to build and test liboqs and oqs-openssl; openssl tests all pass but oqs-test/test_tls_basic.py fails on these algs:
--> Bike seems to be "expected" as per this; is the RainbowVclassic failure also expected? If so, I'd then disable both for Win32 in the PR to close this issue.
Second issue: When executing all oqs-tests, this error message appeared:
Build execution time has reached the maximum allowed time for your plan (60 minutes).
--> Any objections to only run the basic TLS connection requests on Windows? Or shall we change to another plan to do full testing?

No objections from me.
