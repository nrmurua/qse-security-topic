If a noise model is passed along to a target that doesn't support noise, we run it sans noise without telling the user. We should either throw an error here (e.g, "RuntimeError: A NoiseModel was detected for an incompatible target: BackendName."), or a warning (e.g, "Warning: A NoiseModel was detected for an incompatible target: BackendName. Running the simulation without noise.")
Compile and run the following example with
Then run it without the target
and notice that the output counts is noiseless and no error/warning was given to the user.
Expect some warning or error to be given to the user
Not a regression
No response
