Is QASM.g4 and other source files used to generate quantum-circuit.js available to public?
Hi @wh5a
Here you can find QASM.g4 grammar: https://www.phoiyb.online/libtangle/QASM-Grammar/
No other files - parser is generated from that grammar and is included into quantum-circuit source code (parser code is super ugly - I know, but works :) ).
@perak Thanks for the explanation. Is the GUI of Quantum Programming Studio open sourced too? Especially the Drag & Drop feature?
@wh5a GUI is not open sourced.
