There doesn't seem to be an easy way to get the matrix of a PauliSum. It has no matrix method, nor do we have a matrix protocol. Typically one actually wants the matrix as a Scipy sparse matrix rather than a Numpy array. We should make this easy. Should it be a method or a protocol?
At Cirq sync we decided to first add a matrix and/or sparse_matrix method to PauliSum, and only consider making these protocols if there are more use cases. The methods added to PauliSum should take qubit_order as argument.
OpenFermion has an analogous method but it gets quite slow and memory intensive for large matrices and I suspect it can be implemented more efficiently.
