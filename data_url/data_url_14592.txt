This follows #6574 . When a QuantumCircuit is initialized with isolates qubits there are some issues as follows
I'd be happy to work on this if no one else is.
@apcarrik Yeah sure please go ahead and please feel free to leave a message if you need some help.ðŸ˜ƒ
Thanks @TharrmashasthaPV! For clarification, is the intent of passing a list of Qubits as an argument to QuantumCircuit() to create a QuantumRegister implicitly with them? Currently, it updates the QuantumCircuit._qubits and QuantumCircuit._qubits_set properties, but does not create a quantum register in the quantum circuit, which causes the issues in QuantumCircuit.reverse_bits() method that we're seeing.

@apcarrik Not exactly. The input to the circuit is a set of registerless qubits. And so we would like to keep the qubits that way without creating a quantumregister. I think currently reverse_bits() returns a circuit that only contains reversed registers. However, we need to fix it to also contain the reversed registerless qubits and registerless clbits without creating registers for them.

Ok, thanks for clarifying that.
@apcarrik Is the issue fixed? Or else, I would like to give it a try.

There was a lengthy discussion on what exactly the desired behavior is for this, which never really came to a consensus (see PR #6762.
@apcarrik Ok. Sorry, I didn't know about all this progress regarding fixing this issue. Thanks for updating that you are continuing on fixing it.
@Gaya3-mv No need to apologize! I just wanted to let you know what was discussed on the PR. I'm going to close the PR since it's stale, and it seems like #7628 addresses the broader issue of treating isolated qubits and qregs similarly. Feel free to pick this issue or #7628 up!
Ok. Thanks again for the details regarding the status of the issue!
Hi, is this issue open and not assigned, could I work on this issue?
