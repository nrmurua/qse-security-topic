After copying the original circuit, when executing the copy, the original circuit is altered somehow.
The pickle error
occurs after the copy is executed. That indicates that a module was added to the original circuit, even though it was not touched.
This bug makes it not possible to execute the copy of a circuit, retrieve the results and then store the original circuit (which was not execute but its deep copy). In qibocal this is necessary for some protocols to post process the execution result via qq.
