I can't re-open #8794 and i don't know if the procedure is to create an new issue. If it's not, please close this and re-open #8794.
The reason I'm opening this is because the fix for the other issue didn't cover all the cases.
This will throw an error
Should run with no errors.
No response
Reopening #8794 and closing this one.
