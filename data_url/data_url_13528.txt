It's useful to be able to reproduce the same circuit from rb_circuits.
Our rb_circuits function is based on Cirq functions which don't have a seed option.
This means that we should:
Ah, thanks @andreamari, I thought these Cirq functions already had a seed argument and we just weren't using it. Still looks like an easy change (starting here and here) but is in the Cirq domain, so I will close this for now.
