There is a case where a parameter expression is_real method returns True yet it raises error when casting it into a float number.
I would expect that if a Parameter expression is real, it should be possible to do float(parameter).

This is kind of expected behaviour, and there's equivalents in Python too.  The object x = (1 + 0j) has x.imag == 0, but float(x) will fail because it's badly typed.  For an immediate workaround, you can do x = complex(expr), test x.imag == 0 and then take x.real if so.  That said, I think we're open to changing ParameterExpression.__float__ to have better behaviour in these situations; we can make it return a float if the output is actually fully bound and real (and improve the error message while we're at it).
Fwiw, I think this is a behaviour of symengine only and not sympy, but I could be wrong.
Whoops, I meant to link to #9187, where some of the previous discussion was.
Thanks for the quick reply @jakelishman! Indeed, I am now using complex(expr).real as a workaround but perhaps, as you explain with the complex(float) case, this is the desired behavior. A better error message, maybe even suggesting the use of complex(float).real, may be useful but this is already discussed in the issue you linked.
Thanks again for the quick reply and given that a very similar issue is already open feel free to close this one ðŸ˜„.
Thanks Asier.  I'll close this in favour of #9187 - I don't know what way we'll go on that yet, but I would like to see it improved.
