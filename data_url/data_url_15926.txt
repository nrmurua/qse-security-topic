When we try to use qc.num_connected_components() on a circuit involving c_if(), in some cases, the function outputs 0 as the number of connected components. However, this is not possible since there has to be at least one component, the whole circuit itself.
The error comes up when the circuit involves two or more gates with c_if(). For instance the following code gives an output 0 which is incorrect
while for the circuit in the code below the function outputs 2 which is correct.
The function seems to have passed the test because there is just a single test in which the test circuit contains just a single gate that is classical conditioned while the error shows up in circuits with more than one classically conditioned gates.
