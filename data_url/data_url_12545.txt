Python 3.8 is out now and we might want to look into making wheel files internally for our next major release. It might also make sense to revive the old tf 2.2 upgrade PR #181 and convert it to a 2.3 upgrade, since tf 2.1.0 is no longer supported on python 3.8. What do you think @jaeyoo ?
In order to tackle this we would need to:
For 1, now TF is 2.3.0-rc1 and the 2.3.0 release will come out soon. Let's wait for it.
For 2, yes, we need to add internal build for nightly and release. Let's do it after 1?
Ok yes, we do have to do 2 after 1 since tf 2.1.0 isnâ€™t available for python 3.8. Would you be interested in taking this on in a week or two ?
Please let me take 1 & 2. after July 29. I am busy until July 28. Thanks.
Any plans for TF 2.3.0 support? I need tensor_scatter_nd_max (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/tensor_scatter_nd_max) available then.
We are hoping to get upgraded to 2.3 in the nightly within a week or two.
@theRoughCode Nightly builds should now depend on tf 2.3.0 (On Mac and Linux at least. The windows is upgrade is being...... difficult).
Thanks for the update @MichaelBroughton! I'm using Google Colab, so I don't think Windows will be a problem! :)
Closing now since we have 3.8 on nightly and support will be in the next release.
