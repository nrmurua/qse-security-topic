Looking at the implementation of the needs_compilation flag in the family of run* methods in the qvm, there is an issue with the needs_compilation flag not being actually respected when noise models are specified.
This is presumably done because we only know the noise parameters for the gates that are actually implemented on the QPU, hence the compilation requirement.
However, the user might have a program that does not need compilation (only uses gates available on the QPU) and to save the time, might want to avoid that step.
Workaround suggested by @ntezak:
As a fix, I was thinking about making the default in the QVM needs_compilation=None
which would be interpreted as the current "use compilation if noise model is present"
and actually respecting the needs_compilation=False if explicitly passed by the user
