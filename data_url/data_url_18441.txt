running the installation with
./forest-sdk-2.10.0-linux-rpm.run` --accept --quiet
one still need to go and push the space bar because of lines
MS_PrintLicense()
{
if test x"$licensetxt" != x; then
echo "$licensetxt" | more
more requires command line input in order to go through the licence. Essentially defeating the purpose of the --accept option
Ah. Interesting. The tools we use to produce the SDK packages are not publicly available, and so I will make a note to fix this before the next SDK release. Thanks for your input, @vlimant :)
This appears to be fixed in the latest version of makeself
Here is the commit. Unfortunately, doesn't appear to have made it into a released version yet:
megastep/makeself@6c852b0
thanks for considering this. I notice megastep/makeself#100 and megastep/makeself#150 but the latest forest sdk under https://qcs.rigetti.com/sdk-downloads , namely forest-sdk-2.22.0-linux-rpm still require a human intervention in the installation.
this is because more does ask for "next page or quit"
