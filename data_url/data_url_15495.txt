When exporting parametrized QuantumCircuits with custom gates to a QASM3 string, the exporter wrongly places the circuit's input declaration after the gate declarations, which is not according to the OpenQASM3.0 grammar - IO declarations should appear in the header.
Run the following:
The resulting OpenQASM3.0 code is then:
The expected output according to the grammar is:
No response
Thanks for the report!  I'll fix this in the Terra exporter, though we've just missed the window to get it into Terra 0.20.1 that should release later today.  I'll target it for 0.20.2 in 2-3 weeks' time.
It's a bit questionable why the current reference grammar forbids this ordering of input and gate statements (I'm not sure any actual implementations have the same restriction), but it's a bug that Terra doesn't use the order that currently works in the reference grammar.
Thanks for the quick reply and fix!
Indeed I don't know why the current grammar cares about the ordering.
In any case, the openqasm3 parser also conforms to the current grammar, namely it expects the IO declarations to come before the gate declarations.
