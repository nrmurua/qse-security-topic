It doesn't provide wheels for the mentioned CPU architectures.
Not sure why it stopped building the wheels, because in 0.11.2 it still build & uploaded wheels to pypi
Build wheels for ppc64le & s390x :)
Currently, storage of qiskit-aer in PyPI is over the limit and uploading binary for some architecture were failing. We are now waiting for the limit is increased.
Unfortunately the non-x86 wheel uploads to PyPI failed because of project quota limits: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/actions/runs/4378395897/jobs/7663086771#step:9:33 which is preventing us from uploading any new package files (either for the missing files in 0.12.0 or any future releases)
We've requested a larger quota here: pypi/support#2677 but we're still waiting for a response from the pypi team.
In the meantime you can download the wheels from the failed CI job's artifact at the bottom of: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/actions/runs/4378395897 which will be a zip file containing all the release artifacts.
Thanks for clarification - that helps!
