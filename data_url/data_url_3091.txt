Calculation of expectation values via WavefunctionSimulator.expectation for a particular qubit mentioned in the pauli_terms argument should output an error when the qubit mentioned is not part of the defined program.
Currently, if I define an 8 qubit program and request the expectation value of qubit 9 then the output is just 1. This may lead to unwanted bugs later on.
