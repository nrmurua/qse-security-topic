When I
My AE output qubits are not returned to their initial state.
Because the ancilla is in the |0> state, there should be no phase kick-back, so I expect all qubits to return to the initial state, aside from the (un-measured) ancilla.
This issue seems to depend in severity on whether the qasm_simulator or statevector_simulator is being used. As shown below.
The following code reproduces the issue:
This gives the output:
I suspect global phases may again be the issue, as was the case for #5914.
