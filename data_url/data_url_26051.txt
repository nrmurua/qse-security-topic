Let's say, as a qBraid Lab user, I used my own IBMQ credentials to submit x number of jobs. These jobs would each have a corresponding MongoDB document listed under my email. Now, let's say I used the qBraid CLI to activate quantum jobs in the qBraid SDK environment. When I now call qbraid.get_jobs(), and try to recreate the IBMQ job object to retrieve the status, I am unable to do so because of a mismatch of credentials. We need a way to recognize this mismatch, either by having a proxy flag on the job document or using some other mechanism.
