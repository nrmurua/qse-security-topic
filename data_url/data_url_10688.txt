The documentation for dwave.embedding.embed_ising contains a code example that doesn't work anymore. The code references dimod.embed_ising instead of dwave.embedding.embed_ising.
Found here: https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/system/en/latest/reference/generated/dwave.embedding.embed_ising.html#dwave.embedding.embed_ising
Possibly outdated for other embedding documentation too.
See #177
