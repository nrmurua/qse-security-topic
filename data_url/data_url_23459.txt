Observed in CI. Windows python 3.9
Looks like an instrument from a pre existing test was not cleaned up? Which is strange since the new autocontext manger should close all instruments at test exit
maybe gc gests collected at a not-expected moment?
maybe the test could be rewritten to make sure the connect message is among the messages instead of expecting it to be the last message? alternatively, the test could be rewritten to use instrument's log instance explicitly with a well-defined message, and then perhaps it would be more stable against changes to what is being logged in various places in qcodes
I don't think the problem is that other messages are injected. Looking at the detailed output the message is just not there. In the attached pr I reworked it to use caplog and reworked the hander reset fixture to not modify pytest handlers
