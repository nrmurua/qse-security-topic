Can we write the code like below?
This is a sample code required if we want to insert X-Y-X-Y sequences (shown in Fig. 9) as many times as possible within the length of the long gate.
If we want to resolve stretch mid at (pre)compilation time, we need to partially evaluate while-loop in compiler to know how many mids are summed up in total. Is it ok for compilers in general?
Should we restrict to allow only constants in control flows in a scape of a stretch instead?
@ajavadia do you have thoughts on this?
