Using an RYYGate in a subcircuit and then exporting it to qasm gives an invalid qasm code, which raise an error in case it is reimported. This happens only if the subcircuit and the subcircuit's inverse are both added to the larger circuit.
Run this snippets:
Output:
Reimport the qasm code:
Output
The QASMexporter should generate a valid qasm.
This is probably related to the issue #7749 , but I fear they might be different since this case involves a subcircuit and an call to the inverse.
Looking forward to listening to your feedback. Thanks in advance
