Maybe by including a dropdown menu for all measured datasets? Showing the metadata would also be a nice feature...
@peendebak what are the chances the of the qcodes data management changing completely in the near future? should we even bother?
@lpetitTUD @NicoHendrickx
@dpfranke @lucblom  The future of the dataset is here: microsoft/Qcodes#664. Or might be, it has been quiet from the core devs. A GUI is also in the works, but I am not sure whether the GUI will provide the functionality that the DataViewer has.
I would not bother too much, just change what you can do easily and you really need.
