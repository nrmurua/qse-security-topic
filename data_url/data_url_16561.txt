For a quantum circuit, qc, when you run qc.draw(output='mpl', fold=-1) the circuit is drawn in one line but the horizontal lines and registers are gone. Works with output='text'.
q = QuantumRegister(2, 'q')
c = ClassicalRegister(2, 'c')
qc = QuantumCircuit(q,c)
for _ in range(40):
qc.h(q[0])
qc.h(q[1])
qc.measure(q,c)
qc.draw(output='mpl',fold=-1)
Should have proper figure
