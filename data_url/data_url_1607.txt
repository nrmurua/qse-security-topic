Is your design idea/issue related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Device.can_add_operation_into_moment should be the "online" version of at least a subset of the constraints that Device.validate_circuit validates. However, one can implement a Device inconsistently.
Describe your design idea/issue
E.g. this imaginary device, that only allows for X gates to be executed in separation from other gates implements this constraint inconsistently. The test below should pass but it fails - as validate_circuit shares zero behavior / logic with can_add_operation_into_moment. This seems to me like a design flaw.
Related to: #3295, #3244.
This can be closed as part of the new Devices API which no longer has can_add moment in the interface.
