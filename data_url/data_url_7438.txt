For this circuit:
How do I run it on such this input with ArrayReg?

Thanks,
@Roger-luo gives the simplest way.
And there are two ways I could figure out.
By the way, I suggest to use put(5, 3=>H) instead of kron(I2, I2, H, I2, I2) because it is not only convenient but also faster for simulation.
I think an additional X gate is still needed here because what he want is |01>+|10> instead of |00>+|11>.
Thank you both for your fast responses. I shall test your suggestions.
