Would you know if the "native" Windows 10 version of openssh build with MSVC ?  Would it be possible to have oqs-openssh also build with MSVC ?
Thank you
Markus
Hi Markus, courtesy @christianpaquin here's a pointer as to how to build openssh for "native Windows" (using Powershell and MSVC): https://github.com/PowerShell/openssh-portable/tree/latestw_all/contrib/win32/openssh
We have not tried this ourselves but would be glad to hear about your experiences (as well as possible adaptations needed).
Assuming issue to be closed courtesy the link above.
