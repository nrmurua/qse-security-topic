Current Problem
dimod provides several different chain break methods, but EmbeddingComposite and FixedEmbeddingComposite are hard-coded to use the default 'majority vote'.
Proposed Solution
Related to #101 because they both propagate unembedding arguments.
This could be made simpler if the methods were all of the same class, instead of just methods.
I'm wondering about this because different embedding methods would hopefully be created in a similar way.
Closed by #183
