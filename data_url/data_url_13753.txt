I'll proceed.
I had to modify a bit the setup.py and struggle a bit but now it's on: https://test.pypi.org/project/mitiq/ (the build badge I think doesn't render as the repo is private.) I'll add also on pypi main channel.
By installing with
in an empty python 3.8 miniconda environment,  I get this error message
although I just updated miniconda. I changed the requirements from numpy==1.18.2 to numpy>=1.18.2, but that should not be an issue.
I don't get it with the pip install ., done locally. However, after installing separately pip install numpy>=1.18.2 (and uninstalling mitiq), re-installing mitiq from test-pypi works.
Numpy v1.18.2 is not bleeding edge, but very very recent (anaconda hosts only v1.18.1, updated 11 days ago). Maybe, if everything works fine, we could downgrade to lower versions if we do not need so recent versions. Still I don't get why the package is not collected, as it should use pip.
By the way, I saw that another way to set requirements is numpy~=1.18.2, which will install an updated micro, but not a new macro, for backward compatibility.
We need to add scipy to dependencies, as it's now called in factories.py
Anyways, this is just to have a placeholder.
It's also registered on pypi, you can check with pip install mitiq==0.0.0.
@nathanshammah Is there anything left to do on this issue? I'm going to close it but otherwise please do reopen.
It could be nice to do a private Github release as we close milestone 2, cc @willzeng. This way we can also add to the internal report and pre-alpha users that we have a release (albeit not public).
