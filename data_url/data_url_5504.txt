In order for the linker to work I had to change lines 18 and 19 from the Makefile
Otherwise it complained that in tensor.cpp the cblas_*** methods were not found
I can send a PR with this if necessary.
Edit: My compiler is c++ (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1) 7.4.0
That sounds reasonable. In general, we've been using Docker and docker-compose to build and run qFlex; Salvatore wrote up instruction on how to use it in qflex/docs/docker.md. That should (mostly) eliminate build-environment headaches :)
I have seen the docker.md only after I typed make for the first time.
If the C++ code is to be shipped with Cirq, should docker be used for compilation?

Sounds good to me. I see that Cirq also has a Dockerfile, so there shouldn't be any problems with this.
