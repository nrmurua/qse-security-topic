The filelock package is required for cython-compiling coefficient functions. However, QuTiP currently does not warn if filelock is missing, and the dependency does not seem to be documented anywhere. Instead, QuTiP silently defaults to a StrFunctionCoefficient, i.e., to using eval. This behavior comes from here:

The default value of use_cython is therefore set to False if filelock is missing. The result is the following:
Since cython is installed and there was no warning or error, I think it would be reasonable for the user to assume that the coefficient would be compiled, but it is not. Only when use_cython is explicitly enabled, we get an error:
However, I would expect it to be rare that users call qutip.coefficient directly including compilation options. The only indication that something might be wrong then comes from two failing tests, but it is very hard to deduce the actual problem from the pytest output:
(Note that the second failing test only fails because without cython, there is no cimport.)
If we install filelock, everything works as expected:
I suggest documenting this dependence in the documentation.
Regarding the tests, the concerned tests should probably be skipped if there is a dependency missing? (Just like they already are if cython is missing.)
In case they are not skipped, the reason for the failure should somehow become more clear.
Regarding the actual behavior, qutip could print a warning if cython is installed and filelock is not, but I am not sure whether that would be a good idea.
For completeness, my qutip.about() output:
Thank you for informing us.
