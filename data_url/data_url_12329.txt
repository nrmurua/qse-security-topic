when I trying to do import tensorflow_quantum as tfq
I got error like:
NotFoundError: /home/miniconda3/envs/municipal/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tensorflow_quantum/core/ops/_tfq_simulate_ops.so: undefined symbol: _ZNK10tensorflow8OpKernel11TraceStringERKNS_15OpKernelContextEb
What should I do? My package lists are: python=3.9.0  tensorflow=2.7.0  cirq=0.13.1 tensorflow-quantum=0.6.1
Usually, my go to advice is just to do a fresh environment with a fresh install. I have encountered a myriad of installation issues (as have others: #602, #714, #180, #711, #571), almost all of which have been solved by completely starting from scratch in a new environment. If the issues persists even in this environment, you can post more details on your setup (OS, other package versions, other TF installations, etc.) and it can progress from there.
How did you install tensorflow 2.7.0? I receive "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow==2.7.0 (from versions: 2.8.0rc0, 2.8.0rc1, 2.8.0, 2.8.1, 2.8.2, 2.8.3, 2.8.4, 2.9.0rc0, 2.9.0rc1, 2.9.0rc2, 2.9.0, 2.9.1, 2.9.2, 2.9.3, 2.10.0rc0, 2.10.0rc1, 2.10.0rc2, 2.10.0rc3, 2.10.0, 2.10.1, 2.11.0rc0, 2.11.0rc1, 2.11.0rc2, 2.11.0, 2.11.1, 2.12.0rc0, 2.12.0rc1, 2.12.0, 2.13.0rc0, 2.13.0rc1)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow==2.7.0" every time I try to install that version on MacOS, Linux, and Windows on Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.
That's odd, it just worked by default for me. I use Python 3.8 but 3.9 should be supported, and I've done this on Mac and Linux. I would make an issue on tensorflow repo page about this issue, since they probably know a lot more than I do about these issues relating to TF.
