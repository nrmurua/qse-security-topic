execute(...).result().data() throws an error, the following is the Result Object for execute(...).result()
To print "job.data()['unitary']" (expected to print a matrix) when uncommented
When uncommented it errors out on both job.data()['unitary'] and job.data()
I am unaware of how the library works sorry, however this might be related Qiskit/qiskit#1374
@plutoniumm I'm sorry that our response is lazy.
Though error message is odd, above error is because your circuit has measurement though unitary simulator runs. By setting measure=False, your code will work.
