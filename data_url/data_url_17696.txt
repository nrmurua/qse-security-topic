After the big DAG refactor, there were a couple test cases where the mapper failed. Those were disabled temporarily in the interest of merging that PR. Now they must be resolved and re-enabled.
The bug is that the mapper complains that the DAG registers get fragmented during mapping.
Looked into this briefly and it looks like this is caused by the way we construct the identity_wire_map up to a size of layout_max_index, but elsewhere construct an output dag with size of the physical qubits in coupling_map. Since not all physical qubits are included in the layout, some physical qubits end up missing from the generated wire map. I've got a WIP PR that fixes at least some of the tests that I'll attach.
Fixed via #1464
