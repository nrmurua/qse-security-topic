There are 3 notebooks that fail to open. @rraymondhp could you look into why

Hello. Updated version of all my notebooks is still here https://github.com/qubeat/quchain/tree/qiskit_fix/IBM-QE/qiskit-simulator
three days ago I tested three notebooks you mentioned with Qiskit 0.6.1. It worked.
@qubeat is it possible that you can contribute them to the folder here or work out with @rraymondhp how to link to that repo
@jaygambetta it is up to you and @rraymondhp  I just mean, my notebooks for Qiskit-0.6 are ready and may be used instead of earlier version. Should I do a pull request or wait some time?
@qubeat can you make sure the Quantum Sphere mode works in qubit_chain_mod.ipynb? I get KeyError: 'quantum_state' when I set:
let me know if i'm missing something.
@qubeat I would prefer you to do the Pr that way we get your original contributions added. I would also add to the readme in the teach_me_qiskit_2018 folder a note like @qubeat made this version of the tutorial 0.6 compatible under the link to your tutorial.
@muneerqu  I just checked, the hidden option indeed does not work more. I also reread newer documentation and tried to use 'statevector' instead of 'quantum_state', but it does not work either. Maybe I missed something. Maybe trick with shot=1 does not work more and I should delete the commented option and `hist'.
@jaygambetta Maybe I should correct problem just mentioned by @muneerqu before submit PR and I also not quite understand that happens with readme you mentioned - it is displayed in my browser as raw text instead of formatted.
@muneerqu I fixed the notebook. The hist = False option should work now and draw quantum sphere
@qubeat Yes, it works.
Don’t use the shots equals one. Use the state vector backend.
Good point about the raw text I should change the file from readme.ipynb to index.ipynb or something.
@jaygambetta Yes, fixed notebook now uses statevector_simulator backend if user changes an option to see quantum sphere instead of counts bars.
Earlier version also had readme.md in the same directory as the notebook.
Yeah but the readme.md could not link from the master ipynb. I see now that github does not render readme.ipynb which is strange. I don’t want to have two files that have same content so I make a new name.
I changed it to index.ipynb and now it does not display which I think is better but you need to click on it.
When you do you pr iI would take the line form
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/258c5c1ec725f981ab366fcfc26ef60090ba7b72/community/teach_me_qiskit_2018/index.ipynb
and add it to the qiskit 0.6 section.
Hope that helps.
@jaygambetta I created the pull request
