In the GBS preset on Strawberry Fields Interactive the first beam-splitter has a factor 2*pi error in the parameters.
I am pretty sure it's the case by comparing to the circuit in ("https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/tutorial_boson_sampling.html#boson-tutorial") and because I ran simulations to calculate the marginal probabilities outputs and they agree with the Interactive results when I either multiply by 2pi the parameters in the python tutorial or divide by 2pi the parameters in the preset.


Hi @Luca-Ca, thanks so much for letting us know about this! ðŸ˜Š We'll look into it and let you know about further details.
Hi @Luca-Ca, thank you again for pointing this out! ðŸ˜Š
We have updated the Boson sampling preset algorithm where the issue occurred (one thing to note is that this is different from the Gaussian Boson sampling preset algorithm).
Now, this circuit should match the one found in the tutorial.
