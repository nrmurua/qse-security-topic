Basic installation problem on my Mac--I attempted to install Pyquil using pip, and everything appears to have been correctly saved to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pyquil. The ~/.pyquil_config file was also successfully created as well.
I was unable to find the examples/ folder (would it only be available if I pulled from Github?), so I created copies of the run_quil.py and hello_world.quil files in a new local folder. However, when I tried the python run_quil.py hello_world.quil command, ImportError: No module named pyquil.quil was returned. Any idea why this would be happening?
In site-packages/pyquil, is there a quil.py file? Plus, do you have the latest version of pyquil? (1.3.2)
Thanks for the reply! Can confirm this is the case:


The most likely case is that you're using a different version of Python than the one you installed pyquil onto. Feel free to join us at https://slack.rigetti.com if you're still having trouble installing.
