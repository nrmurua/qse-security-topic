CCI contains support for testing alpine-based images. Those fail for some algorithms with core dumps (list below). Initial investigations show identical (algorithm) failures regardless of alpine or gcc version used (8.2+9.3) or CPU features being used or not. If build type is switched to Debug, more algorithms fail in the same way.
