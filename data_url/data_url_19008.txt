AWG returns a signal of shape (n, n) instead of (n, ). This causes error during computing the propagator.
Steps to reproduce the behavior. This can be in the form of a code snippet or some config files or a notebook to produce a minimum viable example of the bug.
AWG should return an (1D) array for the signal.

I think this issue occurs as the shape of the pulse (from pwc_shape in envelopes.py) has shape (n, 1). And shape of mask (in _get_shape_values_just in pulse.py) is (n, ). Multiplying the mask to the pulse gives a shape of (n, n).
Changing [len(t), 1]  (line 65, pwc_shape in envelop.py) to [len(t)] seems to work.
Please add a config or script that produces the error.
Can you add it in test form, so that #202 fails?
