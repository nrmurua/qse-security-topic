open-quantum-safe/liboqs#835 encounters build failures with the current (383874f) version of PQClean's HQC.  I've observed at least the following problems:
This can be fixed on liboqs by adding -mpclmul to the build scripts.  But presumably this should be in HQC's META.yml files as well?
Once the pclmul issue is fixed, I get
This seems to be because code.c in the various HQC variants each includes its respective gen_matrix.h, which includes a non-namespaced global variable gen_matrix.  This should be namespaced.  (Does this indicate a failure in the PQClean tests for globally namespaced symbols?)
@jschanck
Does this indicate a failure in the PQClean tests for globally namespaced symbols?
The test does ignore symbols defined in the data segment. In general it makes a bit of a weird selection...
Making progress!  Still not quite there though.  Now we're getting build failures about shadowed declarations; see e.g. https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/1079/workflows/5a0b66b7-69a2-4b60-9099-ae0273547ec7/jobs/10897.  As far as I can tell, the PQClean test/Makefile has -Wshadow, but the Makefiles in the individual crypto_kem and crypto_sign folders do not.
