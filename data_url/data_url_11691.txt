Hi I am using HHL function in Aqua. Here are two examples I tested:

For the second example, HHL failed giving me correct answer.
It gives me [4,4] instead of [-4 -4]
And also I tried these two cases:

The second case here are much less accurate comparing to the first one.
Thanks!
The codes are the same and borrowed from qiskit textbook:

Explain why HHL failed.
Thanks!
This is being investigated - just so you know the issue is being looked at.
Hi, thanks for pointing out to this! It seems that the problem is in the QPE part of the algorithm, so I've raised another issue .
As for your second question, the two matrices have different eigenvalues, and the accuracy of the solution depends on how well you can represent these in binary with 'n' digits - where 'n' is the size of the register you use for the eigenvalues. So if you don't change the time for the simulation or the size of this register it is expected that for different examples the accuracy varies. However, it has probably something to do as well with the problem regarding QPE.
HHL is being reworked under this PR Qiskit/qiskit#5698 where core algorithms have been moved to Terra repo and are being maintained there. The code here will be deprecated and as such is frozen - hence I am closing this issue.
