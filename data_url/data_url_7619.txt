With its current implementation, non-gradient based optimisation techniques are the only ones that can work with variational circuits. This is due to the encoding of the data structures into packets which is incompatible with autodiff libraries such as Jax.
The goal of this issue is to come up with a way to make such techniques possible. An approach can be adapting ideas from federated learning.
