Can anyone explain "Liquid did not have to be installed on any of the other machines. When the ensemble command is given to Liquid  , it will install itself as a Windows Service on all of the other machines, start them up, run the simulations, and then shut down the services. All of this is invisible to the user."?
I want to run Liquid on a cluster(the cluster consists of four computers),how to do? Should I install Liquid on all the computers?how can they communicate?
