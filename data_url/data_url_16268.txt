Consider a CCZ gate made by controlling a Z gate:
This has a decomposition of

that uses P, U, and CX gates, where as writing the same expression written in terms of predefined gates yields:

that is decomposed into an combination of U2(0,pi) (which is an H), H, T, and CX.  Importantly, there are only 6 CX gates in this latter decomposition and 8 in the former.  These gates cannot be transpiled away at any optimization level.  So in this very simple case there are 33% more CX gates when implementing the exact same thing using custom controlled gates, and a 40% increase in the final transpiled depth (14 vs 10).
I believe this could be fixed by adding 'z' to the basis list https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/2d11db2/qiskit/circuit/add_control.py#L114 and a corresponding rule below for the case where gate.name == 'z'.
