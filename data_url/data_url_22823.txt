The function get_Qseam is currently bugged, but here is a fixe that works for me:
One must add the following lines at the beggining of the function:
And since yseam hase been removed from config.dissipation, I think line 792 becomes:
str(config.dissipation.gseam/yseam))
(it is currently: str(config.dissipation.gseam/config.dissipation.yseam)))
