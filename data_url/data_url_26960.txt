There seems to be a subtle issue with how Basis interacts with multipartite systems that affects how Chi/Choi and Super represent two-qubit operators. In particular, Basis → "Pauli" and Basis → Basis["Pauli", 2] lead different re-orderings of the Pauli basis when used as options to Choi and Super:
Digging into the issue, it seems as though it originates with BasisMatrixCol, but I'm not sure how to fix it:
Looks like this is due to the Unravel, Reravel operation getting applied for channels vs just dealing with normal matrices. The Reravel operation changes the labelling of the basis.
Using the option Basis->"Pauli" the diagonal elements of the Chi-matrix correspond to unitaries:
II,IX,XI,XX,IY,IZ, XY,XZ,YI,YX,ZI,ZX,YY,YZ,ZY,ZZ
When for Basis->Basis["Pauli",2] its the usual composite matrix ordering II,IX,IY,IZ,XI,XX,.. etc.
The reason for this is that in the first case, 2 single system basis transformation matrices are constructed, and then re-ravelled together to make the composite system superoperator (same way superoperators are stitched together by tensor products in the code). As it is the composite indexing of the basis getting mapped: [[i_1, j_1, i_2, j_2]] -> [[i_1, i_2, j_1, j_2]].
Eg: for XX 0101 --> 0011 where 0011 is the 4th element in binary basis ("Pauli" case), and 0101 is the 6th (Basis["Pauli,2] case). Since your explicitly inputing a 16 dimensional basis in the second case it doesn't do this re-labelling.
The way it is currently implemented is consistent with
As it stands if you don't use First, the code should all sort itself out when it converts everything back to col basis:
Ah, that makes a lot of sense, thanks for explaining. It might be worth adding your explanation as a note to the documentation notebooks explaining the difference between Basis → "Pauli" and Basis → Basis["Pauli", 2], as it's not immediately clear that the two options differ semantically when used for two-qubit channels.
Yeah thats a good idea, it's confused me before as well. It would also be handy to point out how you can use Basis["Pauli",2] as a trick to sort the diagonals in the "usual" way we think about ordering the composite basis.
