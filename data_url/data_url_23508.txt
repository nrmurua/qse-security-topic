Connect to the instrument and print the identity of the instrument
Wait for ~ 15 s and print :
Connected to : None current_source (serial:None, firmware:None) in 16.95s
The connection should be way faster and the identity of the instrument is not found.

How did you find this driver? As far as I can see it is not part of any qcodes release nor a release of qcodes contrib drivers
I did this driver, but I put an issue since I think this bug is not necessarily coming from the driver itself (I can control the current source) but most likely from the initialization of the VisaInstrument base class ? It seems that in the end it connects to the instrument but can't read the infos of the intrument (name,...) and loose a lot of time trying to query it.
Ah ok.
With respect to the identification of the instrument. The instrument base clas driver implements get_idn. This however, requires the instrument to return a standard formatted string when you ask with *IDN? not all instruments does this.
If the HP3245A does not do this you will need to overwrite get_idn to implement a way that matches this instrument.
With respect to the slowdown. Does this happen when you instantiate the instrument class e.g. this line  I_source = HP3245A('current_source', 'GPIB::24') or when adding it to the station. Adding an instrument to the station will get all parameters that are not marked as snapshot_get =  false  so depending on the instrument that can take some time
Hey,
I owerwrote the get_idn function and it's now working fine. Thanks for your help :)
