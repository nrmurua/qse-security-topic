Some IBM Q devices have pulse parameters in their config files but pulse=False.  This causes dt and dtm to be formatted differently depending on if pulse is on for that provider.  Namely because the conversion is done here only: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/f38b617748d855e98f682d259b7cf597ef16b2a8/qiskit/providers/models/backendconfiguration.py#L461
and not for the QasmBackendConfiguration.  For example, I see 0.22 vs the correct 2.22e-10 on some devices depending on provider.
This is a result of user-facing objects also being a representation of the transport object. @mtreinish v2.0 provider should hopefully help fix this?
Can it just be patched in the meantime?
One other thing is I don't understand why a backend with open_pulse=False has dt? Which one is showing this?
Because pulse may be on for other providers that an user is not a part of.
Then this parameter shouldn't make it to the user? This may be a cloud issue.
