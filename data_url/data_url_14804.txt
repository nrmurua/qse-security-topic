For the last months, the Qiskit project is transition to "terra-only", sometime called qiskit == qiskit-terra.
In previous years, qiskit was a collection of packages and, as such, the metapackage structure was appropriate. However, now it only represents a package, qiskit-terra. A metapackage with a single dependency is unnatural and even error prune sometimes.
So, let's remove the metapackage and make pip install qiskit install the current qiskit-terra. This is probably the final blow for the terra concept.
This has been completed since: #11271 merged
