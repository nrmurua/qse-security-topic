If -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON is used when cross-compiling for Windows, liboqs.dll gets built in the bin subdirectory in the build tree, and liboqs.dll.a gets created in lib for development purposes. ninja install installs the latter, but does not install the former. It should similarly create a $(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX)/bin in this case, and install liboqs.dll there.
If this gets done, the OpenSSL Makefile template should be similarly updated to place oqs/bin/liboqs.dll in $(DESTDIR)$(INSTALLTOP)/bin alongside libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll and libssl-1_1-x64.dll when OpenSSL is configured to build shared library outputs. See open-quantum-safe/openssl#217.
@kevinmkane, I think PR #792 does the trick on the OQS side; right? If that works for you, I can modify the OpenSSL project accordingly.
@christianpaquin, I can't test this right away, but it looks like the right idea. I'll take your word for it if you say that's what it does. :)
Believed to be fixed by #792.  If not, please reopen.
