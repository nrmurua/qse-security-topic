@anedumla noticed that theorem 5 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06911 bounds the amount of CNOTs needed to decompose a SU(2) gate when (n-1)-controlled.

The bound of resulting CNOTs in the decomposition grows linearly with respect to the amount of controlled qubits. However, the decomposition of MCX groups exponentially:

A non-ancilla decomposition of QuantumCircuit.mcx() should result in a linear amount of CNOTs. https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06911 refers to https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9503016 for calculating A-B-C, that can be precomputed.

In it's generic form, Theorem 5 can be applied any multi-controlled-W, where W \in SU(2). Therefore, I assume is can be generalised to fix the example #5840 by creating a possible decomposition.
How to decompose a gate in SU(2) into A, B, C : https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9503016
From Lemma 4.1., every element of SU(2) can be expressed as

Then, from the proof of Lemma 4.3.:

For a general unitary, not in SU(2), (i.e X gate) Theorem 4[1] seems to be applicable that gives a CNOT count that scales quadratic. According to the upper bound they give, it's beneficial to use their scheme only when n > 10. (however the bound they give seems not to be tight and i can think it can be improved).
Even ancilla decompositions of mcx can be proved (according to section 1 of the appendix A[1]) when:

Can i work on this?
Sure!
Hi @georgios-ts ! Any news?
I'm cleaning the assignees so it can be back to the pool of available short projects.
Hi @1ucian0 ,
Can I work on this?
Sounds good! @mtreinish should a synthesis interface be used for this?
Hi @1ucian0 ,
We have been working on this issue. Instead of using theorem 5 in https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06911 , this issue motivated us to develop a new decomposition that requires a smaller number of gates for SU(2) multi-controlled gates https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06377. PR #8710  is the first step to solve this issue and reduces the number of gates in the MCXRecursive (that now is not recursive).
@AlexisRalli: this issue and all the PRs that link to it above are what I was trying to find when you asked me about them the other day.  For others' reference: Alexis had also had some ideas about the generalised MCU constructions (see #9574 for one part, but I think he had more in the works as well), who I then told @alexanderivrii and @ShellyGarion about.
I don't have much to contribute myself to the discussion, just trying to link up all the folks I know about working on this, or things adjacent to this.
Thanks @jakelishman,
We intend to contribute with an n-qubit multi-controlled su(2) decomposition that requires ~16n cx if the gate has one real diagonal and ~20n for any other su2 gate.
Hi everyone,
I am reporting what we have done up until now about this issue.
We found some problems that need a fix concerning multi-controlled gates: multi-controlled rotations grow exponentially #9741; MCXVChain with dirty ancilla not optimal #9740; and MCXRecursive not optimal #9743.
We fixed the MCXVChain with dirty auxiliary qubits #9687 and the MCXRecursive #8710. We also fixed mcry and mcrx #9688. There is a conflict PR about multi-controlled rotations #9574. However, #9688 produces circuits with fewer cx gates because it implements our recent work about su(2) multi-controlled gates.
We did not fix mcrz because the actual implementation of mcrz applies an mcp gate (not su(2)) #9202. I do not know if we should open a PR with a fix to mcrz because this will impact several test cases and other users.
We would also like to contribute to #7505.
@adjs On the mcrz implementation, I think your approach demonstrated in #9688 is probably preferable since it seems to scale better. Could you make another PR for that? That PR may need to go through a deprecation cycle in case other users are already working around the issue.
@ewinston. PR #9836 fix the mcrz. However it breaks backward compatibility tests. It is also necessary to include the multiplexer with a small number of control qubits as in #9574.
