The Bell state prepared by this circuit should have a (0,0,0) bloch sphere on each qubits. But the plots of the simulated results shows a pure state on each qubits.
@we-taper thank you for reporting, but I think this is not a bug: state displayed is local state of each qubit. I know it doesnâ€™t show correct state of the system, but entangled state cannot be properly shown graphically in a bloch sphere (at least not in 3 dimensions). I believe 0,0,0 on each qubit is equally correct and equally wrong representation.
@peak Thanks for the reply. You are quite right the entangled state cannot be shown faithfully on one qubit Bloch sphere. But I think it might be more useful to show the Bloch sphere of the reduced density matrix on the corresponding one qubit system, like here in quirk.
Or actually what state is shown on the Bloch sphere in this case?
Maybe to implement both: switch on/off between two representations would be the best?
@we-taper almost a year later - it is fixed now.
Also, bloch spheres are shown directly in the circuit editor (and auto-updates as gates are added/removed).

Wonderful!
