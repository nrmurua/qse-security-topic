In the documentation, the first example is:
Aside from the fact that this quantum program doesn't do anything particularly interesting, it also uses local_qvm (which is deprecated) and run_and_measure (which is harder to understand than run).
In addition to fixing this example, we should scour the documentation for other example programs and funnel people to using run instead of run_and_measure, because when people read "run and measure" they think it is just "run" and we're handling the measurement part. In fact, it is quite different -- instead of running the program the number of times specified by the "shots" variable, "run and measure" runs the program ONCE and samples the resulting wavefunction "shots" number of times. This results in vastly different outcomes if, for example, control flow is involved. This should be made very clear -- "run and measure" is a special way to run on the QVM, not the standard.
