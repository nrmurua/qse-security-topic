Good afternoon,
We are @LauraRgz (Github user) and I, Andrés Bravo, PhD students from Spain. Our research is focused on Quantum Computing. 
We want to use the Arline Benchmark tool to try it with new circuits, applications, quantum gates, etc. We are writing to you because we could not install it. We managed to solve some errors related to non compatible releases, but after trying for some days we could not install it correctly. 
I got in touch with @alinaivanovaoff because we wrote to info@arline.io and we got a reply that the inbox was full.
For this reason, we want to know if you can help us to solve the errors that you can see in the attached image, when we execute ./run_and_plot.sh

Thank you for your support and your time
Laura y Andrés
Hi @andresbravom! Thank you for your feedback. Am I right that you tried to execute these lines:
$ cd arline_benchmarks/configs/compression/
$ bash run_and_plot.sh
Hello @SurrealMind indeed those were the commands that I executed and got the error that I attach.

Hi,
I am very insterested in this library but i am facing similar problems with installation...
pip install arline-benchmarks does not work. I tried installing it by changing the dependencies but i get many errors when trying to execute
