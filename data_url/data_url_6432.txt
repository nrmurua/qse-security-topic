Trying to run a circuit that contains an identity operation on the simulator:
Outputs:
Further testing suggests that the circuit must contain only identity gates to trigger the segfault - for example, X(q0), I(q1) will run successfully.
qsim_circuit is conspicuously lacking in translators for identity gates - it's possible they got lost in recent optimizations. I'll take a closer look.
It looks like the translation is fine - cirq.decompose converts to an empty circuit - but compute_amplitudes is misbehaving due to all qubits having been abstracted away. qsim ought to preserve the identity qubits for use in amplitude retrieval.
Some similar tests for comparison:
