Currently, classicalDeclaration allows variable initialization only for "all" variables in a statement. Therefore, int[32] i = 10, j; is not accepted though C accepts it.
Have you tested this? The ( identifierList | equalsAssignmentList ) is meant to serve this purpose.
@zachschoenfeld33 I tested it with the following QASM and encountered an error with a message line 4:17 no viable alternative at input 'j;'.
Following singleDesignatorDeclaration can parse this QASM.
Yes you are right. That is the solution. Might be good to define a new list with that rule you list above.
My bad. Apparently this is not meant to be valid in the language. We only allow no initialization or all variables initialized, so
I believe we should close the issue. If you feel adamantly, we should open up the discussion to others.
