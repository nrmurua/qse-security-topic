This also happens for more complex examples, the above is just a minimal example.
PyZX Version: 0.7.3
I couldn't reproduce this issue at the latest commit. The circuit is successfully extracted with the output Circuit(1 qubits, 0 bits, 0 gates).
Can you install the current state of pyzx from GitHub and try again?
pip install git+https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx
Please report back whether it still reproduces for you or not. Thanks!
