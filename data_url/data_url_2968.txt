As we recently made colab publicly available (https://colab.research.google.com/), I thought it is a good idea to make examples we are building also available in colab.
@Strilanc : Do you think it is a good idea ?
Seems like a great idea to me. We've been messing around with collab a bit internally, but if it's publicly available that's even better.
@dabacon thoughts?
Pardon my ignorance on Colab, but isn't it a Jupyter notebook that runs on the cloud? If so, what does "making it publicly available" mean? Evaluating !pip install cirq would get you ready to go.
This issue is from before cirq was a public repository, and before it existed as a pip package, when we wanted external collaborators to be able to try it. It's obsolete now, or at least trivial (as you note @vtomole ; just !pip install cirq).
