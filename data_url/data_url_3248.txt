When parsing a valid Quil program, pyQuil v3 fails.
Operating System: Ubuntu
Python Version (python -V): 3.8.16
Quilc Version (quilc --version): 1.26
QVM Version (qvm --version): 1.17.2
Pyquil Version: 3.5.4
I think this is a bug in the quil spec itself, which should disallow the %name syntax in DEFCAL.
