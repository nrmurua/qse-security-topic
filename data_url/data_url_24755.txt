compile_sequence of InstructionBlock relies on each block storing its offset in its parent block which is a somewhat volatile information. Instruction pointers are changed every time lengths of blocks change and are included in the returned InstructionSequence. As a consequence, an InstructionSequence obtained from a call to compile_sequence will likely be corrupt after subsequent calls to compile_sequence. Fix!
