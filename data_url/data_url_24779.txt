Handle qc-toolkit as a package and 'pulses','utils' etc as subpackages.
While working on making the package install work and making the tests use the actually installed package and not the src dir, I ran into a few problems.
To solve these we need some conventions for imports. For the namespace cleanup I see two options: import with underscore or delete classes/modules at the end of the file.
I'm in favour of variant 1.
I prefer specifying external symbols using all to importing everyhing qualified with some manually wrangled name. We can also collect all the classes we want to expose in the module all, so we don't have to manage overly large source code files.
