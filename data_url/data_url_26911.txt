Thank you for the report, Matthias. I see the problem and will correct it.
See report of the regtester Linux-x86-64-gfortran.pdbg in the CP2k dashboard:
https://www.cp2k.org/static/regtest/trunk/Linux-x86-64-gfortran-regtest/pdbg/regtest-0
I think it needs just an if clause for non-zero unit number
Thanks, done.
