The code should follow a major open source C++ style guide. The most obvious one would be Google's, unless there are good reasons to use another one?
We should use clang-tidy to automatically lint any new code which is submitted.
There's a bunch of places where that's inappropriate because 2-D data structures are visually laid out. Those can be exempted from clang-tidy. But also, maybe they should be represented in data rather than in code.
As of #28 this is resolved for the cpp_only branch; future CLs should run clang-tidy on modified files prior to submit.
#48 provides a script for this and integrates it with Travis CI. Since CI is still not enabled, for now developers will need to run check_format.sh (and any commands it recommends) before merging PRs.
