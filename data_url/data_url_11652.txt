The feature of random seed specification is expected in generation of dataset in qsvm.
While it is important to reproduce result in machine learning typically by fixing random seed, the current module ad_hoc.py does not have feature to fix random seed of generating data.
It will be nice to be able to specify the seed when one call ad_hoc_data
I propose as following
Hi, the datasets in Aqua ML use the aqua_globals random generator instance which is seeded via aqua globals. Seeding this https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/616cd80b0526c872760c0c6392e8976478cabbc5/qiskit/aqua/aqua_globals.py#L45 will thus seed the random generation in the ML dataset.
Since the seed can be set as described as above, in the absence of any further feedback I am closing this.
