I tried to add assignees based on the git blame. Probably a good idea to make an issue with the items above that you are responsible for, and then remove them from this list.
some are in this PR #3190
_parse_basis_gates with a str basis_gates arg is overdue to be removed (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blame/master/qiskit/compiler/transpile.py#L289)
querying or creating a layout with a tuple was deprecated 6 months ago (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blame/master/qiskit/transpiler/layout.py)
bit register indexing was deprecated 6 months ago (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/circuit/bit.py#L50)
(register, int) tuples rather than register[int] was deprecated 6 months ago https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blame/master/qiskit/circuit/quantumcircuit.py#L42
These were address by #3190
