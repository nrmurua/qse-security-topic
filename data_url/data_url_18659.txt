Steps to reproduce
The current Forest SDK for Linux (bare bones, downloaded from rigetti.com) also has this issue:
(Creating the path and symlinking libtweedledum.so is a workaround.)
Is it admissible to rely on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable during build and when running quilc? In that case, the solution is mostly straight-forward but we lose the ability of invoking quilc directly without any other frills (alternatively, we could substitute quilc by a shell script that invokes the actual program by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH appropriately beforehand).
Without resorting to LD_LIBRARY_PATH, the full path name is stored inside the SBCL image in sb-sys:*shared-objects* and the shared libraries are opened before our top-level function is run.
@jmbr I expect that the folk who choose to install the barebones package are the type of folk who would not be averse to managing their LD_LIBRARY_PATH. As long as this does not affect users of the other distributions, I would be on board. We would of course have to explicity state this in documentation / READMEs where appropriate.
Tweedledum has kicked the bucket.
