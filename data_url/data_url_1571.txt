Description of the issue
We are using auth through query param in a bunch of places, and it is being deprecated:
https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-10-deprecating-auth-through-query-param/
Today we ran into one of their last "brown out warnings".
We should do this before September 8 2021 at 14:00 UTC to avoid further automerge bot outages.
Fixed in #4407.
