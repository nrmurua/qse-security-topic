Someone please add the def2-SV(P) basis set. Available on https://www.basissetexchange.org
As an FYI, basis set equivalents are approximately
6-31G* = def2-SV(P)
6-31G** = def2-SVP
6-31G++G(d,p) = def2-SVPD
Only that def2 basis sets are much better (closer to basis set limit for same size).
Hi. What format should I pick for the basis set? Is that just GAUSSIAN?
@Altaimorin Yes, but please check after adding it.
I see. I have to remove all lines after the ending **** of Rn.
Yes.
I added def2-SV(P) basis set.
