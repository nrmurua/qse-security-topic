Specifically this test test_interpolate.test_interpolate_brevolve3() followed by test_mcsolve.test_MCCollapseTimesOperators generates an error or the form
The rhs... file in generated by the brevolve3 test. The test appears to finish fine. But somehow it looks like some process is hanging around. Why this is triggered by the MCCollapseTimesOperators test is a bit of a mystery.
The issue occurs when running tests on Windows. Both p35 and py36 behave the same. Both tests work fine when run separately
This will repeat the issue quite quickly and always reliability
The main function is necessary on windows for scripts that use multiprocessing somewhere
I am guessing that there is some issue removing td files in config. The test that you do should not be looking for a RHS file as the test is time-independent.  Why this only happens on Win is an interesting question.  I put up a fork that may work here:
https://github.com/nonhermitian/qutip/tree/config_reset_test
Let me know how it goes.  It seemed to work on my Win7 VM.  It basically removes the old td files from config every time it is not needed anymore.  I am not sure why we did not do this before.  It still needs to be checked that the rhs_reuse setting in the Options class still works.
