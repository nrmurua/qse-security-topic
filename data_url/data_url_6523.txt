Some multi-qubit circuits with empty moments cause an error when simulating:
Changing the circuit to have gates on both qubits either before or after the empty moment currently works:
Not quite sure why gates on both qubits fixes the issue, but the root cause is a bad max expression in the circuit translator. Shouldn't be too hard to fix.
