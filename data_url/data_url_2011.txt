Seconded - but you only need to downgrade to google-api-python-client==1.8.0
What version of python3 are you using?
What version of python3 are you using?
3.7.6
What version of python3 are you using?
3.7.6
Looks like this is due to a new release of googleapis/google-api-python-client#870.
This issue has already been fixed in the latest version.  You can either downgrade google-api-python-client as mentioned or install cirq-unstable (the latest version).  This will be fixed in the cirq stable version (pip install cirq) once we release a new version.
Assume this is now fixed in move to cirq version 0.8.0. Closing, please reopen if I'm wrong
