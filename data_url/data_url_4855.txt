Add a function on AbstractCircuit as c.prune(threshold) which can delete the gate nearly identity (up to threshold) and save quantum reousrces
Go through the c._qir, and check whether each gate matrix is close to identity enough, if so, dont put the gate in the new qir for the new circuit.
Difficulty: ★★
Be caution on possible corner case of MPS gate.
already implemented in the compiler infras as circuit = tc.compiler.simple_compiler.prune(circuit)
