Please be as descriptive as possible, including: what is expected, why is this feature needed, what is the objective, etc.
The Josephson Junctions in the concentric transmon and interdigitated transmons qcomponents are currently drawn and rendered as polys. Modify the qcomponents so that the JJs are drawn as linestrings instead of shapely objects, and add them to the qgeometry as "junction" instead of "poly."
When rendering these qcomponents, the JJ should be rendered as a lighter shade than the other polys in the design, similar to the current way the transmon pocket qcomponent is rendered.
