I would like to point out that identifiers like “__P503_INTERNAL_H__” and “__P751_API_H__” do eventually not fit to the expected naming convention of the C++ language standard.
Would you like to adjust your selection for unique names?
Not at this point. But I'll have it in mind for a future update. Thanks for the recommendation.
How do you think about to avoid that this software depends on undefined behaviour?
