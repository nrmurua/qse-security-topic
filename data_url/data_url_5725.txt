Passing cuStateVec_enable=True as a parameter to AerSimulator and executing the simulation results into the following error.
On Google Colab:
Program should execute without any errors and should give the following output (as per Qiskit's medium post)
We are sorry but there is no binary distribution supporting cuQuantum APIs. qiskit-aer-gpu does not support cuStateVec_enable option.
To enable cuQuantum on Qiskit Aer, please build from the source code by referring to the following document.

Hi @doichanj, thanks you for the link. I followed the steps but got an error
I am using the following command (cuquantum files are moved to /usr/loca/cuquantum).
Here is the link of Google Colab code for more details.
CMake logs its errors. @Gopal-Dahale what are the 10 errors?
Okay, I was able to build it successfully, but the code snippet is not working and gives the following error
could you try uninstall older Qiskit Aer and install built one
pip uninstall qiskit-aer-gpu
pip uninstall qiskit-aer
pip install -U dist/*
@doichanj thanks, it worked. I performed the benchmarking with thrust and custatevec with 1000 shots and found this strange peak with a single qubit. Any explanation for this?

I think there is relatively large overhead for small number of qubits, so the simulation time will be unstable.
I think the issue was solved, I close this one.
Hi everyone,
I am running this on AWS server with a Tesla V100 and I am stuck while building, I ran the following command:
python ./setup.py bdist_wheel -- -DAER_THRUST_BACKEND=CUDA -DCUSTATEVEC_ROOT=/local/ubuntu/cuquantum-archive
/local/ubuntu/cuquantum-archive is where the cuQuantum file exists. Its the same error as "please check the install target".
I can't figure out how to successfully build this, can somebody please help?

Hey, can you please provide how did you get past this issue and build successfully? Thanks in advance.
could you try uninstall older Qiskit Aer and install built one pip uninstall qiskit-aer-gpu pip uninstall qiskit-aer pip install -U dist/*
This should work. Also please read the contributing.md for latest instructions.

@Gopal-Dahale Thanks for the reply. I did uninstall all the existing packages, created a new environment and followed the instructions from contributing.md as you mentioned. I still have this issue while building the GPU with cuquantum support. I am able to successfully build with MPI support one.
The error is exactly like you got with the wrappers bindings, 2 errors in cmake. Not sure how to fix it as I am unable to interpret what the error is about
