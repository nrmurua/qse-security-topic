The cheese holes are 3um in both x and y.
The x and y placement of holes is 40 um.
When using smaller holes and higher density for cheesing, it noticeable time; about 30 seconds.
When a gds file is exported, want to generate the file as fast as possible.
If you use the option fabricate = True,
That will reduce the size of GDS file and you will generate it faster.
There is a workaround to turn off cheesing. Also, an alternate solution is to rewrite the gds renderer to use gdstk.  This provides python wrapper around C++ code. That would be a very different effort.
