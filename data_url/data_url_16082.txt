The circuit drawers will have some indication whether or not a gate has been replaced with a custom pulse gate ("calibration")/.
In drawer terms, this means that the content of the box should be replaced-by/annotated-with "calibration" (or "cal", for short)?
For example, given the following situation from https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits_advanced/05_pulse_gates.html, is this the expected output?

I think this is a good start. In an ideal world this would be an interactive diagram that could be moused over to show the schedule.
Ask the composer widget people.

While that might be possible on MPL (more exploration needed here), for sure it wont be possible for 'latex' and 'text'.
Hello, I am interested in this issue, could I work on it?
It is possible in MPL using interactive mode in a notebook.  I had a demo of this functionality that I gave to @nkanazawa1989 some time ago (years?) that looked much like the current timeline plot, but then the actual pulse shapes would appear on mouseover.  Do it in JS would be a better solution though.
