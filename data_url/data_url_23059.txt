I had to increase the NA benchmark time (time per point without/with gui) on travis to 7/14 times the average communication time to make all tests pass. This is quite slow and we can wonder whether there is not a bug that slows down the code somewhere. I suggest we solve this by making a read/write instruction counter and check therefore that one NA point really only requires one write and one read operation. All the remaining delay can then be attributed to our python code / graphics stuff being too slow.
