n-qubit state tomography returns incorrect density matrices on some inputs, notably on asymmetric circuits with qubits re-ordered, e.g.: when you pass (LineQubit(0), LineQubit(1)) and simple circuit with identity and the X gate you get:
which is close enough, but when you pass the qubits in reverse order (LineQubit(1), LineQubit(0)) you get
Incidentally, the other implementation of state tomography (see #2737) does not exhibit the same issue.
Fixed in #2739.
