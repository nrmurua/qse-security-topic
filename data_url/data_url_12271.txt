There are many issues with tutorials cannot be run due to failure in importing Qconfig.
We need to make sure the Qconfig is installed on the path that is searched by the PYTHONPATH.
@nonhermitian @diego-plan9 i know we are thinking of a better way of doing the qconfig. I think it is very important we work this out for the tutorials
This will be part of qiskit-core 0.6. I am putting this on hold until we have qiskit 0.6 is release.
@nonhermitian and @diego-plan9 will this be fixed in qiskit 0.6
It is on my todo list to modify the tutorials for the new registration system and other Jupyter specific functionality, next week.
This is now done with the IBMQ.load_accounts() etc. There should be no more Qconfig in the tutorials. Some of the old ones have it but moving forward there is no need.
