See title.
The results should be correct (ideal probabilities in the absence of shot noise). In the above reproduction, the Sampler from Terra returns the correct result.
This is a documentation error. Are's Sampler does not support shots=None because Aer Sampler supports mid circuit measurements unlike Terra's reference implementation.
I'll fix it.
@ikkoham Simulating circuits without mid-circuit measurements is an extremely common use case. I think Aer's Sampler should behave the same as the reference implementation in this case. It can raise an error if shots=None and the circuit has mid-circuit measurements.
@kevinsung Yes, we can support such cases if we can make them error. I understand that some users need it as an enhancement request, so I will support it. #1588
