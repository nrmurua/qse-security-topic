Optimization_level=3 gives a more complex circuit than Optimization_level=1
When I follow the tutorial on https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits_advanced/04_transpiler_passes_and_passmanager.html, I try my circuit with the coupling map and basis_gate. I find Optimization_level=3 gives a more complex circuit than Optimization_level=1. But Optimization_level=3 does a heavy-weight optimization, right?
Here is my code:
Opt_level=1 gives 3 gates but Opt_level=3 gives 5.
Opt_level=3:
Opt_level=1:
Optimization_level=3 should give at least same complex circuit as Optimization_level=1
Still valid in current release of Qiskit.
