Right now, it's only qiskit.org.
To fix this, go to the "Code"/home page of the repo. Then click the wheel on the "about" section on the right.

Thanks!
I am in favor of the link remaining as it is, to https://qiskit.org.  That is the web page for Qiskit, after all.
EDIT: but I don't feel strongly, and could be convinced.  I just don't think it's self evident that the suggestion here is better.
Yeah, I could be convinced either way. cc @javabster @HuangJunye @1ucian0 any opinion?
sorry I'm confused, when did it get changed away from the docs guide link? I like the docs-guide link being in the about section
@javabster this is qiskit-terra. I took a screenshot of qiskit_sphinx_theme as an example of where you find the "About" section and the little wheel icon. I don't have permission to edit Terra's About, so I added that screenshot to give more clear instructions.
(This issue is one of ~15 I opened today across the ecosystem)
I'm with Jim here, especially since we're about to make this repo the de facto "qiskit" repo.  That link slot is for the repository's "website", rather than specifically its documentation, and we've got links from qiskit.org to the Terra documentation plus the first paragraph of the readme has a big link to the docs.
