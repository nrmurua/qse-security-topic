Looks relatively normal:

Then change the amplitude to 0.2:

Might be a duplicate of #1022 indeed - I am not sure.
Also not fixed by JESD update to m-labs/jesd204b@25fd79d
Reproduced:

Artiq: c28fe47, Misoc: 86c6fcb, Migen: 6425844, jesd204b: 25fd79d
Thanks.
@marmeladapk Thanks for reproducing! @jordens Do you think this could be SAWG (vs JESD)?
Does this work for all sawgs? e.g. can I use sawg0?
@hartytp any channel
Flashed this to the startup kernel:
Hooked up microscope probes to Sayma https://github.com/hartytp/artiq/tree/sawg_probes
Edit: dac output looks very distorted.
amplitude to 0.5 gives a good sine and
@jordens Is this still open? cf https://irclog.whitequark.org/m-labs/2018-06-09#22299432; Closed status following commit implies to me that I can reproduce fix by rebuilding.
@jbqubit Please try it, the Sayma in HK is currently broken. https://irclog.whitequark.org/m-labs/2018-06-09#1528542903-1528545687;
This bug seems fixed now.
