Modifying the .electron_object.executor field of an imported electron does not always carry over in select circumstances.
Alright, bear with me for a moment! This is a pretty niche issue report.
Take the following example code:
This works perfectly. The increment job runs with the local executor rather than the Dask executor.
However, if you move the electron and sublattice into a Python package and import them, the executor is not updated appropriately:
Here, the increment job will run via the Dask executor. This was as minimal of an example as I could make to reproduce the issue (see below).
The modified .executor field should be retained.
The following alternative approach works fine:
Note that simpler examples do work. For instance, the following example works fine:
Maybe this has something to do with the mutability of increment... could very well be me.
Thanks for this @Andrew-S-Rosen ideally it should be so that all kwargs of electrons are properties as well that can be set post creation. I will update the issue as a bug/feature-enhancement as well.

CC: @cjao , any quick idea on why this would be the case for packages?
