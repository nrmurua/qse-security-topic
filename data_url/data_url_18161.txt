Currently the simulator is built like this:
mkdir out; cd out; cmake ..; make
On some versions of Apple Clang, the above fails due to problems with static linking. A workaround exists:
mkdir out; cd out; cmake -DSTATIC_LINKING=False ..; make
A fix will be available soon. This is just to track, and to offer a temporary fix.
Fixed by #468
