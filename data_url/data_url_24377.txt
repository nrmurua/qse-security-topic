RoutePathfinder creation hangs if anchor is inside a component
Make some transmons
Try to route a CPW but make the anchor be inside a pre-existing component
Metal will hang infinitely
Perhaps error if an anchor is inside a component?
Ah, this is good. Yes, @ThomasGM4  had some comments that the lengths are also not right all the time (fillet aside)?
That was an outdated comment. Lengths are fine (checked with Thomas).
This case is only about the hanging, which is caused by a "bad input". This is low priority fix (early-adoption code focuses on functionalities and ignored input validation), yet good to keep track of it in a case
This was solved by #158
