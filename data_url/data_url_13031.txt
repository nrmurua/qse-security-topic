We should proxy this protocol so that we can pass UnitaryMatrix wherever you can pass a numpy array

Do you know if this is considered composition or inheritance? It doesn't say in the documentation how this will be handled by type annotations and mypy. Would we inherit from np.ndarray for this?
This would be composition. Handling this in the type checker would be tricky, it would be better to just inherit from an ndarray like I originally suggested, but to implement this it wouldn't be required.
To be clear: if we inherit from ndarray then we do not need to worry about this.
If we do not we are just proxying the inner numpy array.
What is required to inherit from ndarray? Can we still lock the number of dimensions?
The numpy docs also cover what is required to subclass an ndarray. https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.subclassing.html
