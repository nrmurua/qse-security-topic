I got an error and terminated while using the basic toolchain.sh with ./toolchain.sh.
Here is my configure.log in the build folder:
Here is the CMake.log
My OS is wsl2 with ubuntu20, using the GNU tools with sudo apt install build-essential. I have searched the error and found that other people with different software also encountered the same problem, ie jabcode/jabcode#44
I dont know how to fix it because I am not familiar with compilation. Could you help me with this?
Thanks in advanced!
