Central dispatch is not yet properly reporting out-of-sync situations for ParameterSweep. Looks like initialization missed proper registration of instances with CENTRAL_DISPATCH. In addition ParameterSweep.receive was not properly set up.
Fix will require some testing, and should include revisiting the matter of weak referencing to allow for garbage collection (which had intermittently been disabled due to pathos pickling issues on Windows).
pytests checking proper CENTRAL_DISPATCH behavior would be a good addition as well.
Should all be addressed with 0fe180d
