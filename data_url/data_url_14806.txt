How do I create a Parameterised Gate from unitary matrix
We do not support symbolic manipulation of dense matrices in Qiskit and have no plans to add such support.  You can look at community-driven packages such as qiskit-symb for that kind of capability.
I would note that the gate you're trying to add is a controlled X rotation, which is (in theory) supported by the RXGate(theta).control() object or the QuantumCircuit.crx method.  I think at the moment that there's a potential bug in that (see #10311 and linked issues).  Your code is also using several low-level internal objects, and using them incorrectly:
Thanks a lot for the suggestion and the explanation
I'll close this issue as "solved" now, since I don't think there's anything more to do from the Qiskit side.  Please feel free to re-open if there's more to discuss.
