Using (2.0.dev+485.gc0d5914) on windows and our linux VM, I tried the following script

But ran into underflow errors. Making a similar script,
It seems like the delay is necessary even for one pulse, otherwise the slack in the reset is insufficient to avoid an underflow. In this example, the delay needed to be about 600*ms on Windows and about 100*ms on Linux. Probably related to #407.
If self.core.reset() is called within the kernel, this delay is not required.
