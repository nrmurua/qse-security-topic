The compressor sets up a bunch of queues based on qubit utilization and manually tracks the resource utilization of APPLICATION-type instructions to decide which queue to insert them into. This breaks the treatment of "classical" (e.g., NOT) and "hybrid" (e.g., MEASURE 0 [0]) sorts of instructions, which interact with more than just quantum resources. The compressor's structure should be reworked to permit the sorting of these sorts of instructions as well.
