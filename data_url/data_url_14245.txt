I would like to use the SolovayKitaev algorithm which was recently added to Qiskit.
I took the minimal example from the Qiskit docs 
I tried different settings for the SK algo, but it can't approximate a single gate even to a reletevely large error.
Try running this code (taken from the docs). The approximation error is always 2.8 even if the parameters depth > 11 and recursion_degree > 3.
It is expected that the approximation error decreases as we increase the size of the gate library generated by generate_basic_approximations and increase recursion_degree.
It is necessary to understand why change of the parameters does not improve the results. Also, I think the code example in the docs should recommend meaningful range of parameters that would improve the approximation error.
