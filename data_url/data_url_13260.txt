Folding functions with Qiskit circuits with barriers and measurements have unexpected behaviors.
It is actually quite hard to reproduce.  I couldn't find a simple example. So I need to copy and paste a long example.
The bug is that, in folded_circuit_wrong, the operations applied to qubit q[7] are erroneously moved to q[6].
For some reason the problem doesn't happen if barriers are manually removed.
So there could be some problem with how Mitiq remove barriers.
So, until this bug is fixed, a workaround is to apply circuit_without_barriers = RemoveBarriers()(circuit) before folding.
A simpler example of the unexpected behavior was found in #1369 (comment), copied below.
