Similar to how sinter supports custom decoders, it should support custom samplers.
Use cases for this include someone lightly wrapping the flip or tableau simulator, or using a more complex tool like a cirq or numerical simulator to produce the measurement or detector outcomes.
This should allow people to avoid re-implementing sinter's nice multiprocessing approach to sampling when they want to make a change to how the sampler works.
