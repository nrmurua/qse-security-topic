Since qbsolv is performing a minimisation of x'Qx, a trivial solution is one with all elements of x=0 .
Is it feasible for there to be a command-line option that forces the algorithm to avoid this trivial solution?
One way I suggest  is to add a large penalty term to the objective function, eg for a 4 element x vector, add the term K*(1-x1)(1-x2)(1-x3)*(1-x4) to the objective function, and default K to 0 (the user overrides this from the command line to set K).  I don't know whether this maps to the way D-wave hardware works though.
This is actually a small misunderstanding of the objective function; if Q has negative values then we can't a priori know that zero is going to be a minimal value.
Take an objective like:
We can see that x will actually minimize the function as [1 1], with the energy -1 = 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 * -3. I hope this helps.
Yes I see.
But look at a problem such as finding the lowest cost item out of a selection of 3:
minimise x1cost(item1) + x2cost(item2) + x3*cost(item3)
Indeed 0 is a solution but it would not really be very interesting...
