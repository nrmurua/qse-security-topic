The Covalent API is a Python module containing a small collection of classes that implement server-based workflow management. The key elements are two decorators that wrap functions to create managed tasks and workflows.
The task decorator is called an electron. The @electron decorator simply turns the function into a dispatchable task. The workflow decorator is called a lattice. The @lattice decorator turns a function composed of electrons into a manageable workflow.
