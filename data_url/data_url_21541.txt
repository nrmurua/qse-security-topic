I'm working on the specifications for the compiler improvement project and would like your feedback.
Please reply before April 7th.
I found #1468 paticularly insideous/tricky to track down. I've also seen silent data-corruption from the lack of uint support (cc #1628). Implementing #1524 would avoid such issues in future.
