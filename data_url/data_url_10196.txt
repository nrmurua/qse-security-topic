In Python >= 3.9, it should be rewritten as follows.

Hi, @29rou! Thanks for bringing our attention to this issue.
My understanding is this is an actual issue only on a "FIPS-compilant" system with a non-standard Python build. Is that correct?
Well, regardless of that, we do plan to stop using md5/checksum for problem chunk upload anyway. Can't comment on the timeline, but that should close this issue automatically.
Yes, that is the correct perception.
This problem is solved by eliminating md5/checksum, so I think it is ok.
But until then, could a monkey patch be the solution on our environment?
Sure, feel free to monkey-patch it locally. I'm just reluctant to make that change in the cloud-client.
Thank you very much. I will patch it to my local environment and use it until a revised release is available.
