I was wondering if we wanted test coverage in CI with pytest-cov + eventually a GH Action plugin like coveralls or codeclimate, or codecov.
While I find pytest-cov  definitely useful, I have mixed feelings about the plugins, as they can be sometimes annoying, as well as giving nice insight: for example codeclimate can help reduce cognitive complexity but also be too stiff about it.
