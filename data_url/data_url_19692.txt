I'm doing noise mitigation, but what happened to my code?



Could you please share the code that runs the measurement mitigation protocol and creates meas_fitter?  Note that the mitigation circuits creation has a parameter of state label, if you override it in the circuits creation then you need to override it again when you apply the filter.
Closing this issue, since there does not seem to be a bug in the measurement mitigation code, only a question of how to use it properly.
