I am running a IPython/Jupyter Notebook via supervisor which does not export the $HOME environment variable (this is of course easily fixable). When importing qutip, I get the following warning message:
Since this is just a warning, does it mean that there are no problems, or will it have some effects?
This is an interesting bug, thanks for raising it! Roughly, QuTiP looks at $HOME to find where the qutiprcconfiguration file. If QuTiP can't find it, it will raise a warning and proceed with defaults, so that shouldn't adversely affect you unless you've set some flags like debug=True. That said, we should definitely raise a less intimidating warning when $HOME is unset.
With #366 merged in, I think this issue has been addressed. Thanks!
