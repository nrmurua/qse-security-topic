Unable to compile with MPI support, due to an undeclared identifier compilation error. Error thrown in state_chunk.hpp.
qiskit-aer/src/simulators/state_chunk.hpp:1263:7: error: use of undeclared identifier 'nLarge'
Compile from source with AER_MPI enabled.
python ./setup.py bdist_wheel -- -DAER_MPI=True
Compile successfully with no errors.
Add uint_t nLarge; somewhere between line 1256 and 1261 in state_chunk.hpp. qiskir-aer compiles successfully for me with this fix.
@doichanj can you check this
@chriseclectic Sorry about this, this was my fault. I've opened #1241 with a suggestion to fix this.
nLarge in apply_chunk_x function is not used so we can remove this variable (sorry I copied codes from apply_chunk_swap function and forgot removing this variable)
Thanks for the prompt fix :)
