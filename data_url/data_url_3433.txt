test_exhaustive_symmetrization_1q failed when run by semaphoreci for PR #925.
Here is a Python repl session replicating the above np.isclose calculation, according to the numpy docs. The last line is meant to show how close/far the test was from passing.

Do you see this failure locally, @appleby? Unfortunately semaphoreci does not give me an option to retry the tests. If you don't see this test locally (I do not) then I suggest you make a fake commit to the branch so that the tests are run again.
I can rerun the semaphore tests, and this is what I saw on a re-run:
You'd think as people who swim in probabilities we'd be better at establishing these confidence intervals in the test suiteâ€”but, here we are.
Ooooh, so close.
I'm re-running the pyquil tests locally now, but had to manually start quilc and qvm servers in the background to get this test to run.
My laptop is ancient, so this might take a while :)
Whoohoo! Local test passed. The rest of the tests are still running, but test_exhaustive_symmetrization_1q completed successfully.
The remote test runner also just passed.
Addressed in #928
