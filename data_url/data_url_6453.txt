Due to the quarterly release cadence of Cirq, features which would be convenient for use in qsim are occasionally unavailable in qsim. The features introduced in #306 are a recent example of this. One potential solution for this issue is to pin the cirq version in requirements.txt to a Cirq nightly release (e.g. cirq == 0.11.0.dev20210429195408).
If we go forward with this change, all subsequent "full" qsim releases (i.e. non-dev releases) would need to align with Cirq releases. For easy version-alignment checking, we should also bump the "full" qsim version forward to match the Cirq version.
