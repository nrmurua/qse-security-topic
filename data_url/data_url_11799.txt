Circuit caching has been enabled by default in Aqua now but this is causing several unit tests (and notebooks) to fail so for now in the units test the circuit caching has been explicitly disabled to pass build. These include tests in files test_vqe, test_ae, test_bernsteinvazirani, test_deutschjozsa, test_simon, test_grover and test_hhl. Even if the cache has no specific performance benefit its use should not cause such a failure.
