Currently periodic pulses can have their phase reference set to absolute or relative.
However, which one means that the phase is set w.r.t. t=0 versus the start of the pulse is unclear.
We should think of a better naming scheme and implement that

Perhaps a timestamp is the way to go, i.e. P = amplitude*sin(2*pi*(frequency*(t - t_reference) + phase/360))

Thoughts?
Mark's option has probably the widest application area, but for now we could just also double check and correct all phase reference definitions and default values for each available pulse and maybe rename directly to: phase_reference='pulse' or 'sequence', meaning respectively pulse.t_start or t=0.
