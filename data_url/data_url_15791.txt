Since #6487 merged there has been a small import time regression as seen here: https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit/#import.QiskitImport.time_qiskit_import?commits=9d0dd041
Skimming the code it appears this is caused by calling subprocess.run() at import time to determine if pdflatex can be found. We shouldn't be doing this at import time and only checking it at runtime if we're using a latex drawer.
import qiskit
No external call on import.
Move it to runtime
Ah, it looks like this will be fixed by #6930
The fun thing is that the current behaviour doesn't even run pdflatex - it actually tries to run "pdflatex -v" as one executable (i.e. without splitting argv), which universally fails, unless someone's got a super messed up system.  #6930 should fix that as well.
