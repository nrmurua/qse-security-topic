The Bloch-Messiah decomposition should return two orthogonal symplectic matrices O1 and O2. In some cases, for instance when the squeezing values are degenerate, the bloch_messiah function returns the correct orthogonal symplectic matrices, up to a permutation of rows and columns.
Minimal non-working example:
A possible solution would be to check whether the returned matrices from bloch_messiah are symplectic, and if not, calculate the required row and column permutations.
