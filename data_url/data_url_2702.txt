I've read the licence, but I've noticed some files in Cirq/examples/ like quantum_fourier_transform.py have the licence at the top of the file while files like grover.py don't.
@Strilanc  to comment but I think that the examples really serve as documentation more than code and we wanted them to be directly readable without the extra biolerplate.  Technically the copyright is not always needed, so I think this is fine.
Not a lawyer, but I feel pretty strongly that the example code shouldn't be bogged down with license notifications. Why would we care if people copy-and-modify example code? That's what it's for.
We should maybe add a README about this in examples?
That sounds reasonable. We could also mention things like "must run unconverted", "not included in the packaged library", etc.
