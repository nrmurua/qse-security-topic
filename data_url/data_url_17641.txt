When using the backend ibmq_qasm_simulator for a qaoa script, two different errors are encountered.
The first one is just ignored and the script continues running, the second causes it to stop.
I have only encountered this a few times, but it seems sort of random as to when it occurs.
I am testing some QAOA scripts using both IBM Quantum Experience and Rigetti Simulator, all of the current code is on this directory - https://github.com/epelofske/quantum_optimization/blob/master. To reproduce, running combined_qaoa_test.py will likely get the error eventually. I have only tested using the backend ibmq_qasm_simulator, but it might occur when using other backends.
The following two errors are encountered:

I am not familiar enough with network error handling to know what solution could work. In the meantime, I am trying just using local simulators, and also eventually an IBMQ NISQ device to see if the same error occurs.
I have only encountered this a few times, but it seems sort of random as to when it occurs.
Unfortunately it seems to be indeed due to network issues - could it be that you are running several jobs against IBMQ  (ie. against an online device or simulator) concurrently, or in a short time span? There are some network limits and availability constraints that might be in play in your current scenario.
Closing in the hopes it has been solved - please reopen if not!
