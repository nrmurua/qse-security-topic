CP2K crashes with core dump when using QMMM/LINK/MOVE_MM_CHARGE on large systems.
It crashes at the following line when accessing mm_particles array:

I tried to track the problem. As far as I understand the algorithm, there can be typos in parameters lists when calling qmmm_elec_with_gaussian_low here:

Maybe there shall be qmmm_env%added_charges%per_potentials instead of qmmm_env%per_potentials. Could you comment on this?
Which version are you using? Maybe this was introduced when we recently added OpenMP to those code paths (#939)?
I'm using 6.1 and 7.1 versions (not the development one).
Here is relatively small input to reproduce the error.
cp2k-movemm.zip

I think you are right. However, when I apply those changes then your reproducer crashes in a different place:
Maybe you could have another look and ideally prepare a pull request?
I didn't expect this test input is so good at failing! It is definitely missing FORCE_EVAL -> DFT -> MGRID -> COMMENSURATE T.
After applying the proposed changes, my real QMMM system stopped crashing. I will submit PR later today.
Oh, I didn't know that QM/MM requires COMMENSURATE. This certainly deserves a proper error message.
Thanks for the PR!
