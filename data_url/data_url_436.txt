Given the following simple OpenQasm
running staq to output Cirq code results in a source string that will throw an error upon execution
The fix is pretty simple, update https://github.com/softwareQinc/staq/blob/master/include/output/cirq.hpp#L272 to evaluate the index var i.
q = [cirq.NamedQubit("q[{}]".format(i)) for i in range(2)]
