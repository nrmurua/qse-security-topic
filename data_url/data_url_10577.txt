Current Problem
When using the EmbeddingComposite, the BQM is always converted to Ising and the chain strength is calculated with Ising biases. This chain strength is then saved in sampleset.info['embedding_context']['chain_strength'].
If the user calls uniform_torque_compensation (or any of the chain strength functions), with a QUBO problem, the chain strength they get will be different from the one that is saved (because it now uses QUBO biases). This could be confusing for the user.
Proposed Solution
One possible solution would be to save the smear_vartype onto embedding_context as well, so that the user can see whether the chain strength was calculated with Ising or QUBO biases in mind.
