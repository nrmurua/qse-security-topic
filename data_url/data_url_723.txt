I run the Quantum++ example qasm2 on this QASM file:
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[1];
rz(0) q[0];
The output is like this:
The final state is not valid, is it?
@DevelopDaily Thanks, certainly not valid, will look into asap.
Another test case:
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[1];
ry(pi/2) q;
rz(pi/2) q;
The output:
The final state is not valid either.
@DevelopDaily fixed now and pushed back to v2.4. Issue was related to https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicLazyEvaluation.html
Amazing!
I need Quantum++ to verify a few issues on the staq. Now, I've got it. Thanks!
