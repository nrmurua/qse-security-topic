Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
As of now it is not possible to create custom gates as described here that can be
parametrized with a sympy.Symbol as described for example for QAOA.
To me this feature would be really useful for any application of VQE, since most of the time I don't think in terms of
parameterizing Rz or Rx gates, but in terms of paremeterizing bigger blocks / layers.
Describe the solution you'd like
Here is the code that would like to work:
which prints
instead of the final wavefunction.
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
My current workaround is adding the whole decomposition of my layers manually, like so:
This works as expected, but has the drawback that printing the circuit gets much more cluttered and it feels less elegant.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
Thank you for opening the issue and explaining your use case!
For parameters to work, you have to add resolve_parameters protocol to the gate:
Should do the trick.
=============
If you are willing to try it, we are introducing a new concept to handle subcircuits: CircuitOperation - this will have a more structure and will allow for nesting circuits and looping (via the repetitions parameter).
which prints:
Thank you for the hint to the parameter_resolve protocol. Since my desired functionality is indeed there and I just didn't find it, it seems to be more a documentation Issue.
If you want, I can add a paragraph to the "With parameters" section in docs/custom_gates.ipynb and open a PR about it.
