A Z conditional gate results in a weird decomposition consisting of Rz and SX gates after a transpiler pass with basis gates from the mock IBM Paris gate set (image attached). The decomposition of an unconditional Z gate with the same basis gates yields a simple RZ(pi) gate as expected.

A Z gate is just a special case of an RZ(pi) gate, this decomposition adds two SX gates which can't be executed virtually. Is this the expected decomposition?
I confirmed this behavior with terra 0.17.0. This appears to produce the expected decomposition in the current version of terra (0.18.0.dev0+2eee566).
