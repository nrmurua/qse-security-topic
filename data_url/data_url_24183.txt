Add a procedure to fit for a scattering curve S21 (complex), as discussed say here  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06173.pdf

Hello! I'm a new contributor but I'd like to try this one if that's ok.
Khalil et.al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.3117 have a kind of similar discussion on microwave resonators, and lmfit uses their equation in a tutorial on fitting a complex resonator model https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/examples/example_complex_resonator_model.html.
We could adapt that approach to fit eq 45?
Hi Josh,
This is great to hear. Yes, happy to have you contribute and you can even because an author on Metal with contributions.
Feel free to reach out on Slack in #metal channel if you run into issues.

Hi @JoshDumo , how is this one going? Did you have any bandwidth to work on it?
Hi @marcolincs
I have a done a little bit but so far not so good.
Please have a look at some notebooks I have worked on so far, here in my github repository
As you'll see, the fitting doesn't work great just yet.
If you have any insights, I am very happy to hear them.
Hi @JoshDumo
Do you mind if I also try my hand at this? I have done this thing in C (https://github.com/SamarthH/phiRM-DCM). I think that I might be able to help here. If you want to work on this, you might want to look at appendix E of Jiansong Gao's thesis (the person who in my knowledge first described the phiRM)
Yes, need a hand. Please go ahead.
Awesome, you can post questions and updates here
@zlatko-minev : I have implemented the methodology in pull request #737 . I have tested it with the output of Tutorial 4.16. Please let me know if any changes are necessary
Great work!! We will look it over and commnet!
Hi. Is there any further work left on this?
Looks like work has merged.  Will close this issue.
