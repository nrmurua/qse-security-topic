Instead (or in addition) of BQM.to_networkx_graph() I would prefer for networkx.from_dict_of_dicts() to work.
Right now, this is what we get (dimod==0.8.2):
In general, I can't overstate the value of having a common, interchangeable, representation format for BQM/SampleSet. That could save us from implementing of (too) many from/to converter methods.
Nevermind, we can't have this without the Bias object. Or without polluting the adjacency matrix.
