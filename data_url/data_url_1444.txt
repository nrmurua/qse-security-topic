Description of the issue
The docstring summaries for cirq.Circuit.next_moment_operating_on and cirq.Circuit.prev_moment_operating_on  are identical: both say "Finds the index of the next moment that touches the given qubits."
The docstring for cirq.Circuit.prev_moment_operating_on should either say "Finds the index of the previous moment that touches the given qubits.", or else somehow specify that "next" means "next in a search backwards through the circuit".
How to reproduce the issue
