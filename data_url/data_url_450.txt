The QAOA tests take the most time when running ctest (>30 mins). I am not a QAOA expert, but noticed those long tests come from simulating the deuteron Hamiltonian, which is not the most natural choice for the algorithm. I wonder if we could come up with better tests that test all the important pieces of the algorithm and are reasonably fast.
