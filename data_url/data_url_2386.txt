When using cirq, you'll typically want to create a circuit. As far as I can tell, the most common way of doing that is with cirq.Circuit.from_ops. Since this is so common, it might be nice to have a shorter alias. Maybe cirq.ascircuit(...) by analogy to np.asarray. What do you think?
Why don't we just allow arbitrary op_trees in the Circuit constructor?
Now that we have the convention about moments going in without being reflowed, from_ops is in fact a strict superset of the constructor. Allowing cirq.Circuit(OP_TREE) could be reasonable.
