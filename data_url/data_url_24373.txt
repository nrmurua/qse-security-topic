### What is the feature being requested?
A Hamiltonian model which will numerically compute the properties of the transmon beyond the Duffing oscillator approximation. It will return based on either setting the Ej, Ec, of the Cooper pair box Hamiltonian the Eigenenergies, eigenstates, number operators, etc... or when given a f01 transition and an anharmonicity spit back the expected Ej, Ec (as well as the other static properties). See attached images for numerical accuracy of the Duffing Hamiltonian
