The algorithms+oracles need to be correspondingly documented in docs/algorithms.rst and docs/oracles.rst.
We will need to restructure docs/oracles.rst, which currently assumes only Grover oracles, which I have started to do.
Where would you like me to put these algorithms in docs/algorithms.rst, after Grover and before the QSVM ones?

Both sound great, thanks!
