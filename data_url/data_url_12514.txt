Hi,
it would be nice if you could add a notebook tutorial concerning graph networks. I'm thinking specifically about the quantum graph convolutional neural networks discussed in the paper arXiv:1909.12264, but anything simple enough to get started would be enough.
Cheers,

Hi @rdisipio ,
A minimal working example can already be found here (linked from both the TensorFlow Quantum arxiv paper and TensorFlow Quantum website): https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/research/qgrnn_ising/qgrnn_ising.ipynb . I will say that we don't pay as close attention to the research branch, so feel free to give it a try and if anything breaks we can address the breakage in this issue.

Any updates on this ?
