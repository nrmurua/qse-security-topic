For automated cp2k builds and runs of the test suite it would be useful, if make test would only return exit code 0 if all tests pass (and otherwise return a nonzero exit code).
See e.g. these logs from the conda-forge build where we explicitly ask for set -e in the build script.
ifI checked correctly, this is an issue of tools/regtesting/do_regtest not emitting the right error code (which is 0 unless compilation fails or something in the script itself went wrong)
might be fixed by implementing #770
Fix via #1702.
