There is some race condition that intermittently causes a complete freeze of the comms CPU when doing lots of RPC over TCP. The rpc_timing.py benchmark is good at causing the problem. Things work fine with serial.
Fix this bug properly and revert commit 37ac6c4.
watchdog_set in ksupport.c sometimes crashes in a similar manner.
That was LASMIcon-related memory corruption when both CPUs were accessing SDRAM at the same time. New minicon+shared L2 arch is stable.
