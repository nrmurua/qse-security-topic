Hi Ben!
Maybe it would be beneficial to add the phase shift gate to the provided gates!
Such as:
Or even an interface that allows for easily programmable gates!
If you are too busy to add them I'd be happy to add these
Thanks
I've actually already added PHASE and CPHASE gates to the next version; I'll be committing that shortly before I finish the whitepaper. Thanks for the suggestion though!
Oh good to hear!
