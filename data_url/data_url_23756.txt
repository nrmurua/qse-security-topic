The IVVI driver internally converts any set value to a integer number for setting (12 or 16 bit I think). For example -800 is converted to -800.0305180.
When a validator is set to range [-800, 400] a set with value -800 works fine, but then a set to -700 fails because -800.0305180 is not in the valid range.
I am not sure where to solve this one. The actual error is generated in self.validate(start_value) (see code snippet below. We could argue that the current value of a parameter is always allowed, but there might be exceptions when multiple parameters use the same instrument.

@peendebak  does #529  close this ?
