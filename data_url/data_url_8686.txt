During PR #11 it came up that we might want to test that bloch.py produces the correct figures. Personally I have no idea how to test for correct plotting in a unit test kind of way. Any ideas?
matplotlib have some unit tests that include image comparison using PIL. might be something to look into
http://matplotlib.org/devel/testing.html
but in our case it might be sufficient to have a set of script files that generate test figures that we can inspecct visually to see if something broke?
