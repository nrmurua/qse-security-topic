Master is failing because this test passed on the PR but then failed in the next run.
Always make sure to output the thing that was randomly generated, so it is possible to reproduce the run that failed.
Repeat randomized tests multiple times (e.g. using parameterizing) so that the odds of the PR getting through when flaky are lower.
See #694.
