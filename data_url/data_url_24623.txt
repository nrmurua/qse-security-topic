A minimal example is:
which generates the error:
The problem is that TimeType._InternalType which is a type, is used as a constructor via qupulse_numeric.approximate_double(value, absolute_error, fraction_type=cls._InternalType)
@terrorfisch
This seems to be an error introduced in gmpy2 2.0.8. Does not occur in gmpy 2.1.0b1
I got the version order wrong.
@peendebak #541 should fix this bug
Please reopen if there are still errors
