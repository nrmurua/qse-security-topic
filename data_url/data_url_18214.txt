I have tried drawing gates with the latex_drawer function. It draws familiar gates (H, X, Y, Z) etc with u3 gates instead of the familiar gate symbols.
The QASM is written as below, but the figure obtained uses u3 as attached.

When adding circuits like below, the corresponding gates drawn should use the symbols corresponding to the command.
hi @rraymondhp the signature of the drawing method is:
def latex_drawer(circuit, filename=None, basis="u1,u2,u3,cx")
I think you can change the optional "basis" parameter. Does that work?
Thanks! Yes, it works that way.
But I think the basis should be determined automatically. Perhaps, when the basis is None, it should scan the qasm file (before being converted) and set the basis.
I think this should be closed cause can be handled by passing the argument as pointed out.
