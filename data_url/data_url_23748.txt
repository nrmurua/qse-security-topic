Location formatter is lacking documentation and very not user friendly, as testing with an user here in qdev has shown.
also it's broken.
Had some discussions on this with @CJvanDiepen last Friday. He experienced that the {name} part of location formatter is assigned somewhere deep in the group_arrays a function that my hdf5formatter never calls but does get called in GNU_plot format and Loop.
I'd say it works in it's basic way (I use it in hdf5 formatter) but is indeed not very user friendly (just adding this to have extra info in this issue)
@AdriaanRol it's broken atm, I guess pr #315  broke some st
@AdriaanRol there will always be surprises from inside the core (maybe some magic **kwarg?) ! @alexcjohnson  made sure we won't ever get bored working on qcodes  ðŸ™Š ðŸŒµ
@AdriaanRol @CJvanDiepen can you elaborate? GNUPlotFormat generates an extra name that's not part of the location at all, for each individual file it creates. But I don't see it using the name from the location formatter at all.
@alexcjohnson @AdriaanRol this sounds exactly like I have experienced it.
When using the GNUPlotFormat the default seemed to be such that the location formatter made a folder with a date and a subfolder with a time and a file with a name based on the name of the setpoint arrays via the group_arrays as mentioned above.
The HDF5 formatter does not have this functionality. The subfolder and the file both use the same string as set by the location formatter. I would like it if it would also allow for different names of files and subfolders.
Closing this as old and obsolete. #918 introduced documentation.
