Certain simple circuits fail raising a ValueError in _multigate_opt when trying to remove a node from its self.gatecache.
I came across this when running random circuits through the pass and failures seem to occur when there are repeated gates at the beginning or end of the circuit.
Shouldn't get an exception.

@ewinston I found the problem. Basically, the H gate in the middle is deleted twice. See my PR for more details.
There could be multiple solutions. I have chosen an obvious one, by recording the deleted gates during the iteration. Alternatively, the function should check whether the node still exists in the DAGCircuit. This way does not need to add an additional set (like I did), but I did not find such an API. Maybe it is not very easy to check the existence of a node in a circuit. Maybe we can stop generating all the sequences before the optimization. However, this will make the code complex and probably not worth it.
