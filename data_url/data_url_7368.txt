The following lines in the tracenorm function change the given dense operator rho:

This definitely should not happen. Also just making the diagonal real might be the wrong approach. Maybe we should rethink how we want to treat non-hermitian and nearly hermitian operators. Any thoughts?
The change of the operator can be easily avoided by copying, i.e. data = copy(rho.data).
As for the real diagonal, we could sacrifice some efficiency by implementing a check for the Hermiticity of rho and then call tracenorm_general if it is not. Or we simply always compute the eigenvalues of the product dagger(rho)*rho which is guaranteed to be Hermitian and then take the sum over the square root of them (so basically always use tracenorm_general).
I have to admit, though, that I am not too much of a fan of either of these approaches. Do you have a better idea?
