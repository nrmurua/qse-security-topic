Consider the following circuit:
If a pass wants to remove the "control", it needs substitute_node_with_dag to replace the controlled node with a temporary 4-qubit DAG (the base gate and an idle qubit):
However, the results is the following:
Agree the behavior here is confusing, and should be documented more clearly. substitute_node_with_dag (unlike extend_back/compose_back) expects the input dag to be indexed relative to the qargs/cargs/conditions of the node to be replaced (and not the dag which contains it).
To get the behavior you're looking for, you could do
Thanks a lot for you clarification @kdk I fixed it with dag.qubits()[node.op.num_ctrl_qubits:]. Closing.
