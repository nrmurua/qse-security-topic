Currently, we wrap FPEs in an Identifier node (code). Ie. a + b becomes Identifier(name="a + b"). This is a technically feasible solution as we use string parsing in other places for FPEs and it is well supported by sympy. However, it's not technically a valid string for the identifier name and it would be more correct to convert a + b into BinOp(Identifier("a"), Identifier("b"), +).
