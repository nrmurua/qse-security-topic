Encounter DAGCircuitError when if_test is called in for_loop scope.
No error.
None
The issue here is that the control-flow builder blocks don't track the registers that are used, only the bits, so they don't define any necessary registers in their body blocks.  We need to add tracking of these to ControlFlowBuilderBlock, and add them when the circuits are created to fix this.
It's a DAGCircuitError because the drawer tries to convert the circuit into a DAG first to get the orderings, and that's when the issue gets detected.
