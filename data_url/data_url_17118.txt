Currently attempting to run this tutorial on a real device (ibmqx2). I was getting an error similar to the one in this question, but lowering the size of the testing and training inputs solved that issue. Now, the problem is that the job is seemingly running forever. However, when I go to the IBM Q experience web page, it says that the job has completed. But for some reason my program is not progressing (in the log it still says "Running 0-th qobj...). Job id is 5d3769298f07180019c33447, for reference. In addition, is there any way to run the program on a real device with larger inputs, such as in the original tutorial? Thank you for your help in advance.
Source code:
`from qiskit import BasicAer
from qiskit.aqua.utils import split_dataset_to_data_and_labels, map_label_to_class_name
from qiskit.aqua.input import ClassificationInput
from qiskit.aqua import run_algorithm, QuantumInstance
from qiskit.aqua.algorithms import QSVM
from qiskit.aqua.components.feature_maps import SecondOrderExpansion
import logging
from qiskit.aqua import set_qiskit_aqua_logging
set_qiskit_aqua_logging(logging.DEBUG)  # choose INFO, DEBUG to see the log
from qiskit import IBMQ
IBMQ.load_account()
feature_dim=2 # we support feature_dim 2 or 3
sample_Total, training_input, test_input, class_labels = ad_hoc_data(
training_size=4,
test_size=2,
n=feature_dim,
gap=0.3,
PLOT_DATA=False
)
seed = 10598
feature_map = SecondOrderExpansion(feature_dimension=feature_dim, depth=2, entanglement='linear')
qsvm = QSVM(feature_map, training_input, test_input)
backend = IBMQ.get_provider().get_backend('ibmqx2')
quantum_instance = QuantumInstance(backend, shots=1024, seed=seed, seed_transpiler=seed, skip_qobj_validation=False)
result = qsvm.run(quantum_instance)
print("testing success ratio: ", result['testing_accuracy'])`
Job should complete, and the program should print the testing success ratio.
I have no idea.
Do you mind raise the issue at Qiskit-Aqua?
