Currently working on adding Falcon
Great!  Hopefully it's just a case of adding to scripts/copy_from_pqclean/copy_from_pqclean.yml and then running python3 scripts/copy_from_pqclean/copy_from_pqclean.py.
I tried it, it did not work, should I add also to the python3 script (paths etc.)? In any case I will try to do it manually also.
Looks like you did everything correctly, the tests are failing due to alignment issues in the underlying Falcon C code.  It's also being discussed in PQClean/PQClean#221.

Hi, Is there an update on this?  Using Library and Falcon is only signature scheme currently missing.
Still on my list of things to do, hopefully this week!
