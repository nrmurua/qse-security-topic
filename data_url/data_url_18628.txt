compute-applicable-compilers et al. use a fidelity estimation heuristic to decide which collection of compilers is best for converting instructions into the target gateset. Currently, non-native gates are penalized by treating them as having extremely poor fidelity (e.g., 0.5), which causes the compiler crawler to avoid such paths when possible. This has the potential to cause conflict when there are actually "native gates" with miserable fidelity statistics.
I see three things to fix here:
