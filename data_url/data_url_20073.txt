I am interested in packaging liboqs for Debian. Debian build of ba5b61a on arm64 fails due to mismatched bound errors:
(full build log; note Debian turns all GCC warning to errors)
Similar issue was reported as #1035 and seemingly has been fixed since then. Interestingly, most of the other architectures build just fine.
Thanks for the notification. We recently added aarch64-optimized code, so this may indeed be a regression: While we look into your report, would you want to check your build based on a commit prior to #1117?
The aarch64 code is pulled from pqclean while the other versions from pqcrystals-upstream. It seems that the pqclean-version needs to be updated with the recent fix for GCC 11 available on pqcrystals-upstream. See pq-crystals/kyber#43.

OK, I will try building it.
I can confirm that c366e19 (commit before merging #1117) builds just fine on aarch64.
So maybe a question to @jschanck : Would addressing PQClean/PQClean#420 (comment) be "quick and easy" for you (maybe extending PQClean/PQClean#426)?
If so, we'd pull it in when closing out #1031. Otherwise, what about a patch to Kyber-aarch64 as part of #1123 to resolve this issue before the liboqs release as a solution until the PQClean-aarch64-Kyber code gets upgraded? Thoughts, @Martyrshot @dstebila ?
Matthias has been packaging the aarch64 version. I tagged him in the PQClean issue.
I've fixed it upstream: neon-ntt/neon-ntt@c6ffbcd
I also opened a PR to PQClean: PQClean/PQClean#429

Thanks Matthias! I've reviewed and merged them. I'll create a PR for liboqs.
