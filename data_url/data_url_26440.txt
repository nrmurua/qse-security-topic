Dear all,
I have installed libint on my workstation and I can find libint with command
whereis libint
libint:/usr/local/libint
However, when I installed cp2k with toolchain option --with-libint=system, it showed
==================== Finding LIBINT from system paths ==================== ERROR: (./scripts/stage3/install_libint.sh) ld cannot find -lint2, please check if libint is installed or in system search path ERROR: (./scripts/stage3/install_libint.sh, line 101) Non-zero exit code detected. 
Can anyone help me how to solve this problem? Thank you!
set --with-libint=/path
Apparently, this issue was solved. Feel free to reopen it if necessary.
