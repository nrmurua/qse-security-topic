Internally, we have code where we default the gateset to None. When a circuit is submitted and no gateset is specified, we try each gateset that the engine says it supports in turn until we find one that can serialize the given circuit and then use that. In practice, the first gateset that the engine claims to support should be the full "fsim" gateset, which can basically serialize any allowed circuit, so there's little overhead. This could possibly be made cleaner if there were a way to ask a gateset whether it can serialize a given circuit instead of just attempting to serialize and capturing any exceptions.
