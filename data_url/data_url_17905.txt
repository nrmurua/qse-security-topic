@nonhermitian example in issue #938 shows a circuit with a barrier being drawn with a measure after a gate but the barrier is not centered for the gate and measure on q0_15:

The barrier is being drawn from q0_0 (because the \barrier command in latex draws the barrier line down from the topmost bit) and the default horizontal offset is used because there is no measure immediately after the gate on that bit. This ends up being incorrect on q0_15 because because there is a measure immediately after the gate on that bit which moves the center line between those 2 boxes to the left.
Draw a circuit with a measure right after a gate on a bit covered by the barrier, but is not the bit where \barrier will be written in the latex.
The barrier line should centered between gates and measures on all bits covered by a barrier, not just the topmost bit (where the \barrier call is made from in the latex)
We need to adjust the check in the latex circuit drawer that looks for a measure directly after a gate on a bit to check all bits being covered by the barrier, not just the bit
