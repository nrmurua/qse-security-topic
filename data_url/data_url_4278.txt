it would be convenient to allow measurement in an arbitrary basis
at the moment you need to apply some operator that converts from your specific basis to the computational one, then measure, then revert it. it's okay, but not ideal.
Thanks for the suggestion, I agree.
We will add those (and a few other) gates before the next release.
