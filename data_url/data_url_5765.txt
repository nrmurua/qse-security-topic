The following code fails:
Fails with:
Instantiating a noise model from dict (NoiseModel.from_dict(d)) also fails with qiskit aer version 0.10.2. However, it works for:
{'qiskit-terra': '0.20.0', 'qiskit-aer': '0.9.1', 'qiskit-ignis': None, 'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.18.3', 'qiskit-aqua': None, 'qiskit': None, 'qiskit-nature': '0.3.0', 'qiskit-finance': None, 'qiskit-optimization': None, 'qiskit-machine-learning': None}

Instantiating a noise model from dict (NoiseModel.from_dict(d))  should return a valid NoiseModel obj.
There were some bug fixes to NoiseModel methods in qiskit aer 0.10.2 that might have created this bug
The reason is that pauli gate can not be deserialized  from a dict (ex: {'name': 'pauli', 'params': ['II'], 'qubits': [0, 1]})  in QuantumError._to_circuit(). However, this deserialization is deprecated.
