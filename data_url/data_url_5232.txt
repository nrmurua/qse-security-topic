A few years ago, @vontell implemented gate fusion in quilc. Unfortunately, the code never finally landed in master, though the code is preserved.
The goal would be to learn from his approach to gate fusion, and implement it either in quilc or the qvm.
A basic form of gate fusion has been committed as a part of Quilc. What remains is to hook it up into the QVM.
