In file kem_sike.c in functions OQS_KEM_sidh_p503_encaps and OQS_KEM_sidh_p751_encaps
The private key is allocated in lines 123/201 but not set before being used in lines 124/202.
It contains whatever value is in the memory location (many times it is zero from testing).
Suggested fix: as space for the private key is allocated but not set, add a line to generate the private key before passing to compute the public key.
Thanks @kylon94 for spotting this! Fixed in PR #472.
