I'm not sure I'm using this correctly, but I think there is some problem in hadamard gate.
When I apply hadamard gate to every qubits and run them, they are mostly zero.
This mostly returns zero-filled list.
I know this is just a simulator, but I'm using this for my project, which includes some sort of Quantum Randint Generator.
Could you please consider changing some probabilities of hadamard gate, when I measure them?
Hi @kenixer
Problem is that you cannot add single-qubit gate to multiple wires in the same command, so you are not using it correctly.
Correct code would be:
(or even better - make a loop :) )
You can also try https://quantum-circuit.com - it uses this library and there is visual drag & drop editor.
With loop:
-1 means "Add gate to the end of the wire".
You can also export circuit to svg picture and see what you've made (see docs).
By the way, if you need random number generator, best way is to measure and store measurement into classical register, so you can directly access random integer without gymnastics, like this:
Thanks. It helped me REALLY LOT. Thanks for making this great library. ðŸ¥‡
