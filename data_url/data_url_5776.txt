Qiskit/qiskit#7643 implemented mocked IBM Quantum Systems backends using the new BackendV2 interface.
However, noisy simulation of qasm job using FakeBackendV2 is not possible because Aer doesn't support generating NoiseModel from V2 backends. As a temporary solution, a modified code of NoiseModel.from_backend that supports V2 backends (FakeBackendV2._get_noise_model_from_backend_v2)was added to the mocked backend in Terra. We should add native support of V2 backends in Aer and remove the temporary solution code from FakeBackendV2
In order to support building noise model from qubit properties and / target, I believe we need to modify basic_device_readout_errors and basic_device_gate_errors in aer.noise.device.models.py in addition to NoiseModel.from_backend. Please see this comment: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/7643/files#r823994919
@itoko Thanks for taking care of this issue. Would you like to add BackendV2 support form pulse simulation as well? #1478
