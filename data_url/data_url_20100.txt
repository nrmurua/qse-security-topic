The SPHINCS+ implementations have cases of memcpy use where the source and destination overlap. According to the C standard and posix, memcpy behavior is undefined if memory regions overlap.
Detected using valgrind on ppc64le/Ubuntu focal. Memcpy implementations vary, so it seems to be not detected with valgrind on x86_64.
The cause in gen_chain:

Used for example by wots_gen_pk, where src and dst are the same. The replicated code of all variants is affected:

Using memmove would be the safe alternative, or avoid memcpy if src and dst are the same.
Below is the valgrind log. It's part of a constant-time check, but the issues detected are because of overlapping memory.

Yikes -- good catch! Hard to believe the upstreams didn't encounter this before, at least PQClean: Shouldn't this issue then rather be opened there?
PQClean: Shouldn't this issue then rather be opened there?
Yes, thanks. Created an issue in PQClean that links to the one here.
Is this still an issue with the new Sphincs+ code or can this be closed by now?
I checked and it appears to not be an issue anymore with the current version. Closing.
