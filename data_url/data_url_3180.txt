These two classes in the api module are strikingly similar, and therefore we should consider merging them.
@karalekas do you know why both QVM and QVMConnection exist?
QVMConnection was kept around from the 1.x API so that the coin-flipping test program that you'll find in our various materials (the corporate website, slide decks, basic tutorials, ...) still works with pyQuil 2.0, even if it isn't written in pyQuil 2.0 style.
