Hi, I am trying to use pyrpl with python to acquire data from a Red pitaya Board (just in Input 1). I have already installed anaconda and then I activated a virtual environment with all dependencies, however, when i run this code (The first example):
appear the following error:
AttributeError: 'Scope' object has no attribute 'voltage1'
It should be clarified that the communication with the board is successful. This also happens in the same way when running the code without installing anaconda (the other installation procedure ).
I quickly tested your code. Using r.scope.voltage_in1 instead of r.scope.voltage1 works for me.
