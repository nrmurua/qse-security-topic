The BlueprintCircuit is a circuit template stores all the specifications it needs to build the circuit and is then constructed once it’s needed, i.e. once .data is accessed. For example, the RealAmplitudes circuit needs to know the number of qubits to be constructed and has some optional attributes like the entanglement structure or the number of times the rotation and entanglement layers are repeated.
That’s pretty similar to the compile-time synthesis of the gates: Gates store all settings and are only synthesized once .definition is called. So can we not just replace the BlueprintCircuits by a set of Gates where we explicitly allow changing the settings? That would clean up the circuit library since we only have to maintain one concept (and the BlueprintCircuits are a bit hard to maintain anyways).
While we still have circuits in the library, each BlueprintCircuit could get a own gate plus a synthesis function and we'd have to make sure once the gates are in a circuit they can't be modified anymore.
