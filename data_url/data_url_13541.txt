It could be useful if there's a section describing what all the specified extrapolation methods do before this section in documentation.
Agreed this would be a good "living" update to the descriptions already in the arXiv papers
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
Don't think I will have the chance to do this soon. If anyone wants to work on this, feel free to do so.

Closing this because of another similar issue. A detailed theory section will be added for ZNE in the documentation.
Any discussion related to the various extrapolation methods implemented in Mitiq can be added in the linked issue.
