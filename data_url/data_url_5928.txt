From StackExchange:
"I implemented Grover algorithm with matrix_product_state method in qiskit. But I found something strange. I designed the oracle part come out |1111⟩ but, real output was 0011⟩. I check out my code, but there is nothing wrong with it. Even simulating with the other simulation method (such as statevector, density_matrix etc.) "
See use code in : ``https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/14236/grovers-algorithm-with-matrix-product-state-method/14248#14248
Should give correct result.
Can you reproduce this or confirm its an error in gate, not the circuit generation code?
Unit tests should (hopefully) catch an error in the ccx and other basis gates. Also running randomized tests like the following i get the same distributions between MPS and statevector:
From what I have seen up to now, I believe the reported problem is in the measurement, not in the ccx gate. But I have just started investigating.
Regarding your example above, the distributions are close enough. There is no problem there.
Fixed in PR #1011
