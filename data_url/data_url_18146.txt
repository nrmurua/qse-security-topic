I failed to run some circuits due to characters limitation of QASM. I think the number of characters can be significantly reduced if the QASM file generated use math.pi instead of numerical values as below:
The value 3.14... and its derivatives can be compactly described with math.pi. QASM spec mentions that it understands the definition of math.pi. The generated QASM file should use math.pi instead of the numeric values.
3.14.. is used instead of math.pi
The QASM specification allows the use of pi.
Yes, but the compiled circuits seem never use pi, although I wrote the circuit using pi, or standard gates like cx, ccx, and h.
I observed that by simply replacing 3.14.. by pi the size of the qasm circuit can be reduced by 33%.
oh! sorry. I misunderstood. I thought the QASM was coming from you.
Yes, this is indeed a bug that needs to be fixed.
However, the QASM constant pi needs to be used, not the math.pi.
Thanks. Here is a notebook that was used to find that 3.14.. were generated in QASM.

I found that by using pi, the number of chars is reduced to 40k (from 60k+).
This is not a qiskit issue the real issue is in the backend which we are working on getting better estimates of the length and moving away from cloud choices that limited the size of the file.
Closing since this is being worked on at API level. Qobj will also reduce backend size quite a bit by removing the qasm (#589).
