Steps to reproduce:
The cause is the fact that __new__() intercepts and special-cases gate instantiations when phase_exponent is -1/2, 0, 1/2 or 1. It then returns an XPowGate or YPowGate which don't have phase_exponent property.
Since PhasedXPowGate.__new__() returns these gates for some parameter values, they are in a sense members of the PhasedXPowGate type and should behave as such.
