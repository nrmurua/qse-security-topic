Add a note section to explain how to convert old u1, u2, u3 gates to the new s, rx gates. Ideally this should be in a separate how-to guide once we have how-to guide sections, for now we can add that to the tutorial.
See #1329 (comment)
@padraignix Would you like to work on this issue?
Yep, sounds good, I'll grab this along with the rest of #1329
Created #1333 . @HuangJunye have a review. I wasn't certain on the \cdot formatting. I think this makes sense from a visibility perspective, but happy to update if there is a more preferred way to write it.
Also, will be raising an Issue to address \frac formatting throughout the document. Noticed there were mixed approaches of using it and not using it, so will get issue up to bring it to conformity.
