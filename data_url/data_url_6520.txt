We've been having intermittent failures when running mypy to typecheck our code which uses qsimcirq:
This puts mypy in a bad state that can only be recovered by deleting mypy's cache directory. The full traceback doesn't reveal much:
There may be a legitimate mypy bug at play, but it might be worth looking at the type annotations in qsimcirq to see if there's anything suspicious. I wonder if if could be getting confused by the wildcard imports in __init__.py, for example, which are considered bad practice.
