In the C source code e.g. https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/crypto/objects/obj_dat.h#L5798 hybrid signature algorithms have an underscore e.g. p256_oqsdefault.
But in the test harness https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/oqs_test/tests/test_openssl.py#L23 and in README.md, the hybrid signature algorithms have a hyphen e.g. p256-oqsdefault.
Does this mean that they are not running correctly?

FWIW, additional comment: This becomes visible when changing line 76 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable/oqs_test/tests/test_openssl.py
from
else: sig_alg_sized = "rsa"
to read
else: sig_alg_sized = sig_alg
(which arguably is better as then sig algs other than ECDSA and RSA get tested).
Indeed, the hybrid signature algorithms were not being tested. This should fix it.
