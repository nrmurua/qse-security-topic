If the bug manifests in unexpected behavior (as opposed to a crash), confirm that you have consulted the
API documentation
Please provide a concise description of what the bug is.
When printing the effective noise channels for the FullZeroPi qubit, three of the noise channels are concatenated ('tphi_1_over_f_fluxt1_bias_flux_linet1_inductive').
To minimize misunderstandings, please state briefly what you expected to happen.
I expect each of these three noise channels to be separate in the list.
If not clear from your description above, please provide the steps to reproduce the behavior:
for i in scq.FullZeroPi.effective_noise_channels():
print(i)
Any additional information you would like to provide to aid us.
@99elam Can you confirm this issue may now be closed?
Confirmed!
