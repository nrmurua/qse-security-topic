It looks like in #459 we accidentally introduced an a step in the CI that upgrades us to TF 2.4.1 instead of sticking with what we had installed in the requirements.txt file. We might want to make sure the versions stay aligned (it doesn't appear to be breaking anything now, but does make me a little uneasy).

This has been resolved now that we are depending on 2.4.1
