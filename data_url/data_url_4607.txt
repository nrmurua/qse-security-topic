This is just a reminder that actually we are building the custom operators with g++ with the optimization flag -O2.
In principle we could gain some extra performance improvement by switching the optimization flag of -O3 or even -Ofast.
Another option is to compile the code with the icpc intel compiler, which may produce extra speed improvements.
At some point we may be interested in testing some of these combinations.
Benchmarks available at #181 .
