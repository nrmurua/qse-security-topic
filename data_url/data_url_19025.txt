Tensorflow only supports Python >= 3.7 from version 2.7 onward.
Currently, tests in CI are breaking because the version of Tensorflow Probability that gets installed in Python 3.6 requires a higher version of Tensorflow (that is not available in Python 3.6). This happens because Tensorflow Probability doesn't mention Python minor versions in its pip releases. So it is still possible to use Python 3.6 if one explicitly installs a lower version of Tensorflow Probability that can work with Tensorflow <= 2.6

We either drop support for Tensorflow > 2.7 or Python <= 3.6.
