There is an option to the circuit drawers for not plotting qubits that are idle - this is useful for visualizing small circuits that happen to be embedded on large devices. However a barrier on a qubit is seen as a sign of non-idleness. I think barriers should just be ignored as they are not operations. And barriers on all device qubits gets inserted by the transpiler, so it makes this option useless until the drawer can ignore it.
Is it ok if I try this issue?
By the way, could you show an example of what you mean by this? I think I have replicated this circumstance but I'm not 100% sure
Ok I think I understand now actually.
I submitted this pull request a while back. Do you know approximately how long it takes for a code owner to review it?
I can assign myself to it. Thanks.
Thank you!
