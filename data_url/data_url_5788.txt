RelaxationNoisePass produces noisy circuits that cannot be run directly on Aer simulator when circuits with multi-qubit gates are supplied. Because the output circuit contains composite instructions labeled like "circuit-123". So before running the circuit on simulator, users must transpile the circuit to decompose the composite instructions.
We can avoid the above error by transpiling the circuit (decomposing "circuit instructions") before running on the simulator.
However, it feels a little awkward.
Circuits created byRelaxationNoisePass should be able to be run directly on Aer simulator.
We should fix the relaxation noise pass so that it doesn't append composite gates for multi-qubit relaxation errors, but the actual single qubit quantum errors. Though im not sure if there is any easy way to do this via the DAG as the pass is currently implemented...
