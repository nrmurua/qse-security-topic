Memory loss occurs when training a Variational Quantum Classifier with lightning.qubit. This Python code brings out the difference of memory usage between lightning.qubit and default.qubit.
Here is the plot of memory usage over time of lightning.qubit vs. default.qubit:

And a few screenshots taken over time:



Expected behavior: Similar behavior for lightning and default
Actual behavior: lightning has an increasing memory usage over time
Reproduces how often: Reproductible anytime

Hi @aymeric-degroote thanks for the notification here. I am having troubling replicating this behaviour locally.
Can I ask, if you wouldn't mind creating a fresh environment and running with the following:
I suspect this may be due to the PennyLane package versions at v0.19, and lightning at v0.20. If the above succeeds, you can upgrade the PennyLane environment with python3 -m pip install --upgrade pennylane
Hi @mlxd, good guess! You were right, I needed to update my version of PennyLane. Note that we have the same issue with pennylane 0.19 et lightning 0.18, so the bug might have come from pennylane 0.19 rather than lightning.
Thanks a lot
No problem at all. Thanks again for reporting this.
