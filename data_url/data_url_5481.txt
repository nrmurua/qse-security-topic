once 0.6.0 is out remove the cirq_amplitudes_sim.py from python/cirq_interface, because 0.6.0 has the support for SimulatesAmplitudes class
the same for python/cirq_interface/fsim_gate.py
Cirq v0.6.0 has been released, unblocking this issue. @alexandrupaler, please get in touch if it looks like the new Cirq version is breaking our tests.
