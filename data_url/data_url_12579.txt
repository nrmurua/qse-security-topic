Hello! I want to ask some questions about  the MNIST classification example .
1.“encoding  the data as quantum circuits”:What is the initial quantum state before applying the X gate? |0> or |1 > or  superposition state?And What is the initial quantum state of the readout qubit?
Here is a link to the paper followed in the tutorial: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06002.pdf (also linked in the tutorial), they go over all of the model specifics in detail. To answer your questions:
The initial state of all of the qubits in a circuit are  |0>. In Cirq this is an implicit assumption so anytime you enact a sequence of gates you can always assume a qubit started in the |0> state before any of the gates are enacted. That is why you can see in the example in order to get the designated readout qubit into the |1> state we apply an X gate to it.
In the paper the authors use XX and ZZ gates between qubits, but it is entirely reasonable to try other parameterized two qubit gate combinations.
Thank you !  It helps me a lot!
No problem
