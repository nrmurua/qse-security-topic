These are essential for any Python project. They describe how to package and install the project, and how to set up a development environment for it in a repeatable way. As such, they are pre-requisites for implementing continuous integration.
From what I've seen around, the requirements.txt is quite straightforward, although I still wonder: how can you determine what's the earliest version of a package that is required?
As for the setup.py, I've never done one myself and it seems complex, I could use some guidance with that.
@HGSilveri if it's ok with you I'm going to open a PR with a barebones setup.py to get you started, and we can work together to add more to it. As for the versions -- you don't necessarily have to specify them at the start. But we can discuss how you might go about doing that.
Alright, that sounds good. I'll use the same branch to include the requirements.txt (without versions for now) if that's ok with you.
I'll put a requirements.txt in the PR as well, but feel free to edit it if you like!
Even better, thanks!
