Hi everyone! This is my first time creating an issue in Qiskit Metal repo.
The time T1 obtained from LOM (inspired from Capacitance and LOM.ipynb) differs from manual calculation. It appears that we may need to have np.sqrt(2/np.pi) instead for the charge dispersion for transmon in qiskit_metal\analyses\quantization\lumped_capacitive.py as compared to Eqs. (2.5) in paper Charge-insensitive qubit design derived from the Cooper pair box, PhysRevA.76.042319


I really appreciate any feedbacks or comments!
