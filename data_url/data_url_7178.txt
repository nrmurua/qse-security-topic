Regarding #36 I've actually had similar issues of previous code working and then not working after the merge of your sampler codes.
This is strange: maybe I wasn't careful, but basically github allowed me to merge without conflict. So maybe this is earlier still?
In any case, really try to avoid deleting code.
Also, we should build more proper tests. I have ideas, we'll discuss in person.
Thus I opened this issue so that we have a careful look at the previous merges and related code deletion.
