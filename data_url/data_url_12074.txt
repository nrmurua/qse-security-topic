On Qiskit 0.19.6 this tutorial raises the following exception:
SolverError: Either candidate conic solvers (['ECOS']) do not support the cones output by the problem (SOC, Zero, PSD), or there are not enough constraints in the problem.
this issue was handled in #1026
This tutorial no longer exists in this repo -- and sounds like it was fixed in #1026
