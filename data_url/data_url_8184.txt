If I try to calculate the time evolution of a mixed state by mcsolve,  mcsolve will raise an error: initial state must be a state vector. It seems that we cannot define a single quantum trajectory for a mixed state from a physics perspective. But it is still possible that we can replace H|psi> and c|psi> with -i* [H,rho] and c * rho * c^\dagger respectively to simulate. I am not sure it is a faster way compared to mesolve. Can I do a Monte Carlo evolution for a mixed state in QuTip? Thanks.
mcsolve can only evolve ket states. The closest to what you want is photocurrent_mesolve which does master equation evolution of a density matrix with the liouvillian build from H and c_ops but using discrete jumps for sc_ops. It is a lot slower than mesolve since it use only basic ode method (Euler's or Heun's method) and you need to set a very small time step to keep the error resonable.
Thanks for your reply.
