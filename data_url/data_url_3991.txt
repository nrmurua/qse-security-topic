@imranashraf In the recent v0.5 release support for classical control has been added. Currently we often run into the limit of the number of allowed instructions on the CCLight. Automatic compression of programs that contain a lot of structure (such as Gate Set Tomography) would be very interesting for us.
Is this something that the compiler already does and if not is this a planned feature?
@AdriaanRol yes, this is already supported in release v0.5. To give you an example, the following code-snippet generates code to execute 100 iterations of k1:
In the past, this was flattened, resulting in large number of instructions depending upon iterations. Starting release 5.0, the following compressed code will be generated which utilizes classical instructions, resulting in a constant number of cclight instructions independent of iteration count:
The same is true of do_while() where number of iterations depend upon some condition.
@imranashraf I am not sure if OpenQL still generates such eQASM code for the for loop. However, this code seems to have a bug according to my understanding because the target of the br lt, k instruction is k instead of k_for.
Has this label been fixed?
@gtaifu OpenQL does generate such code. Give it a try. The target of the branch instruction was fixed and here is the output I just generated:
This seems to be the correct code, No?
This is correct! Thanks! @imranashraf
