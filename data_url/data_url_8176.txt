Describe the bug
Installing the qutip on ubuntu 20.04.1 shows the following warnings:
To Reproduce
Install qutip on ubuntu 20.04.1 via sudo apt install python3-qutip.
Expected behavior
No warnings during the installation of qutip.
Your Environment
I don't know who maintains a QuTiP package in the ubuntu repos, but wow, that's exciting that we have one!
These warnings should already be fixed in QuTiP 4.5.2 (see #1264).  Whenever the maintainer of that package releases the 4.5.2 version, all of those warnings should disappear on install.
At any rate, you likely won't see any actual problems because of this.  It's a quirk of CPython that the string comparisons it's complaining about actually will do the intended thing in this case (due to a small-immutable-object caching optimisation).  The code is still a typo despite this, but it's fixed in later releases.
