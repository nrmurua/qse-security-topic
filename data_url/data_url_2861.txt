This would allow ControlledGates made from 2-qubit KnownMatrixGates to automatically run on the simulator.
This was originally one of projects that Casey might have worked on. But we decided on a different project.
Does anyone know a reference where they find a nice representation of a 3-qubit gate, akin to the KAK decomp for 2-qubit gates?

@aminjahanpour your gate is a 4 qubit gate (2 ** 4 x 2 ** 4 = 16 x 16 matrix) and not 3 qubit gate.
This works:
However, if you don't mind I'd hide your comment as it is off topic for this issue. Thanks!
An update on this: #2873 basically has the solution, just needs a review (hint hint @quantumlib/cirq-maintainers).
