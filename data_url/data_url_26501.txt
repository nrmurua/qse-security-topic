I've built cp2k.ssmp 2022.1 with Cygwin on Windows 10.The built binary cannot process pexsi regtest inputs with the following mpi error.
*** The MPI_Comm_f2c() function was called before MPI_INIT was invoked.  *** This is disallowed by the MPI standard.   *** Your MPI job will now abort.  Local abort before MPI_INIT completed completed successfully, but am not able to aggregate error messages, and not able to guarantee that all other processes were killed!
The process aborted after writing the Linear scaling SCF section on the output.
cp2k 9.1 has the same problem, cp2k 8.1 and 8.2 with pexsi v1.2.0 has no problem.
Pexsi prerequisites (parmetis,scotch,upcxx,sympack and superlu_dist) were re-compiled, but this had no effect.
Any idea?
We currently don't really support Windows. In fact, I'm amazed that you managed to build such a complete version of CP2K on Cygwin. In all likelihood you are the world-expert on the matter ¯_(ツ)_/¯
Dear Ole
I'm very honored for your comment.
The problem is not yet solved. It needs more time to solve.
I released cp2k 2022.1 binary without Pexsi on github.com/brhr-iwao/releases for now.
Best Regards
The mpi error was fixed by the "mpif90" instructions to FC and LD variables instead of "gfortran" on an arch file for Cygwin.
The updated arch file (Cygwin-x86_64-gfortran-pexsi.ssmp) and the built Windows executables were released on my github.
Congratulations!
I assume the instructions on the wiki are somewhat out of date?
If you like, I could create you a wiki account so you can update the page. Just send me an email: ole.schuett@cp2k.org.
Dear Ole
Thank you for the suggestion.
That's exactly right. The dependencies are complicated, it needs to sort out the ways. (I did not use the toolchain.)
I'll contact you later.
