Dear All,
the avx512-dgemm-kernel in OpenBLAS 0.3.5 is broken. See
easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs#8197
OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS#2061
Hence, we should either patch 0.3.5 in the toolchain or move to 0.3.6.
Best Wishes
Thanks for the hint, I think upgrade to 0.3.6 is the way to go
after talking to other people it seems 0.3.6 may still be affected by a similar issue, the only solution being to disable AVX512 completely for now
wrt 0.3.6, see:
OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS@7ed8431
and
OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS@b1561ec
