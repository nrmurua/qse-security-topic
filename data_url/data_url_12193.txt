It seems like the test set was used as both validation and test set in the tutorial of qsvm_kernel_classification.
As a result, the predict accuracy is higher than actual accuracy.
It's suggested to use non-overlap train, validate, test.
Thank you,
the notebook:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/aqua/artificial_intelligence/qsvm_kernel_classification.ipynb
test set used as test:
cell 3:
datapoints, class_to_label = split_dataset_to_data_and_labels(test_input)
test set used as validation:
cell 4:
qsvm = QSVMKernel(feature_map, training_input, test_input, datapoints[0])
