Hello devs,
When running hybrid calculations, especially with ADMM, its common to run into the following warning:
*** WARNING in hfx_energy_potential.F:592 :: The Kohn Sham matrix is not  ***
*** 100% occupied. This may result in incorrect Hartree-Fock results. Try ***
*** to decrease EPS_PGF_ORB and EPS_FILTER_MATRIX in the QS section. For  ***
*** more information see FAQ: https://www.cp2k.org/faq:hfx_eps_warning    ***
This warning comes before the HFX ERIs are calculated, and so evaluating it must be fairly quick.
I believe it would be especially useful to have an auto-converge setting for EPS_PGF_ORB. Something like while warning exists; set EPS_PGF_ORB = EPS_PGF_ORB / 10 . This way, you can ensure that the calculation is reasonably accurate and numerically stable (the latter being more sensitive to EPS_PGF_ORB in my experience). I have looked into the source, but having no idea of the structure of CP2K and not coded in FORTRAN before, I didn't get very far, and so I'd like to ask how hard it would be to build this into the dev branch of CP2K?
I can see that those warnings can be quite annoying. However, they are not generally a sign of trouble, but rather a hint in case the calculation becomes unstable. The faq explains this in more detail.
Furthermore, I don't think an adoptive scheme, like the one you proposed, would fit well into CP2K's architecture. This is better left to a workflow engine like AiiDA.
That being said, we could probably make our default epsilon values somewhat smarter by taking the chosen method and basis set into account.
