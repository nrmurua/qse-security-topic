Description of the issue
The current coverage checking script check/pytest-and-incremental-coverage relies on the coverage annotate command which is deprecated per nedbat/coveragepy@59b07a1.  The coverage tool has json command for producing JSON report, which should provide equivalent data as coverage annotate.

Hi @davidmerwin - please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file for instructions how to create a pull request.  In short, you need to create your own fork of the Cirq repository, add commits there, and then create a PR towards this repository.  Thank you.
