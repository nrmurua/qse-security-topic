Hi, I am checking the sample code for QCBM and I find it is very efficient for dL/da, where L is the loss and a is the parameters in circuit. This is for the case that the probability of data is the probability of the result state in the computational basis.
However, in general, I think that the probability of data can be the  the probability of the result state in others basis, e.g. p(x)=||<x|U|0>||^2, where x is not the computational basis. I am wondering how to compute the gradient of this probability with respect to the parameters in circuit.
Is there any function I did not noticed yet can help me solve this?
Sorry, I find that the key problem is AD a function with "mutating arrays", which can be solved using a patch code.
