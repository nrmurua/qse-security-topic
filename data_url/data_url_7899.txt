I have a trouble in solving a time dependent Bloch-Redfield master equation with arguments.
Let me use an example discussed in here
The schedule functions of the time dependent Hamiltonian are defined by using some parameters which are passed to mesolve as args.
This method works well for sesolve and mesolve.
However, if I try to use the same method in brmesolve, it returns error in compiling Cython. I attached a python code which demonstrates the above observation.
I also noticed that in bloch_redfield.py it says
args : dict
Placeholder for future implementation, kept for API consistency.
Would it be possible to use arguments in brmesolve? If not, how could I use parametrically defined schedule functions while avoiding the issue raised in here?
I need this for my research and I would appreciate your help very much.

The block-redfield solver only supports string-based time-dependence,
http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html#time-dependent-bloch-redfield-dynamics
so in your example something like H=[[initial_H,'1-0.01*{i}t'.format(i=i)],[final_H,'0.01{i}*t'.format(i=i)]] should work.
I don't know whether that will give you the same issue as reported for repeated calls to mesolve/sesolve.  Probably will, if that hasn't been resolved yet?
