can you add more impurity Solver? this MO-IPT impurity solver seems good, from this paper paper, using GGA + MO-IPT approach gives better agreement on experiment than ctqmc solver.
I don't know how to integrate proper impurity solver manually. it would be great if you make tutorial documentation on MO-IPT integration. thank you so much!
here is their github repo on MO-IPT : https://github.com/msjarrell/MO-IPT
Hi,
Thank you for your interest.
For DCore v2, we describe here how to implement an interface for a new impurity solver.
