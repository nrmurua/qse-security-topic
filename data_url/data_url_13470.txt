For the latest GitHub release (0.8.0), the publish-pypi.yml action never triggered. The fix is probably some minor tweaking for when the action should take place.
@rmlarose The syntax is valid which could mean anything could have gone wrong. Do you mind testing the workflow with a manual trigger without the create condition ? I don't think I will be able to test this in my fork without proper credentials and I just want to verify it does run on release branch. The only thing I can do in my fork is check for syntax. The workflow run fails when I cannot provide username and password for twine.
If it does run on release branch, then I wonder if there's an issue with types : [created] vs create. If it's the latter, then maybe following could work :
We discussed this @ MItiq meeting, I think @crazy4pi314 has a plan for this and will take an action. (Let me know if I misunderstood.)

Not really. I was only throwing around some ideas since these files cannot be tested unless you run them on specific branches.
I can help look into this, and into the test pypi trigger.
