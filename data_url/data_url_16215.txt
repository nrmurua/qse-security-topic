Currently, the constructor of the Register class checks if the name string passed as an argument is valid as per the OPENQASM requirement. If this check fails, an exception is raised.

However, no such check is performed in the setter method of the _name attribute
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/circuit/register.py#L84-L87
Consequently, it seems possible to assign invalid names to registers :
For example, this fails:
However, this does not fail:
For consistency, it would be good to also include the check for the validity of the name string in the setter method.
