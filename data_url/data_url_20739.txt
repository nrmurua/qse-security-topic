Some of the header files of LEDA (#186) have functions in them for the purposes of inlining. It doesn't look very clean to me, but on the other hand that means losing the inlining (if I understand things correctly).
Do we want to take a position on this?
Would it be an option to enforce this only for code in "clean" subdirectories?
It sounds like a decidable problem, so sure ðŸ˜›
Automatically checking this would mean developing some new tests, though.
I wanted to ask about this. I agree that it does not look very clean.
I'll move the implementations over to .c files.
Rainbow also does this a lot. I didn't change it yet, but I agree that it should be moved to .c files.
There's also a bunch of static inline functions in Falcon.
