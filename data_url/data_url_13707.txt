@andreamari @rmlarose Did we decide that we think that it indeed is?
Yes, at least when using the with_noise method of a circuit as we usually do in mitiq.
This is the code of the with_noise method: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/0068c4ea6d5e23a33e3443e679f037da8ed3be39/cirq/circuits/circuit.py#L1829
I think the general answer is it depends on how you add noise. If you use Circuit.with_noise, then the answer is indeed yes as Andrea points out -- noise is added after every moment. For example:
However, there's other ways of adding noise to circuits. For example I can just insert a channel:
I'm not sure why the first example has the virtual tags but the second example doesn't.
Given that we have a handle on this I'm going to remove it from the current milestone.
As the answer has been resolved to YES. Am closing this issue.
