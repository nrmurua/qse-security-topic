Goal: PQClean algorithms referencing KeccakP1600times4_PermuteAll_24rounds should not accidentally "wind up" calling Picnic's implementation thereof
Done in PR #676; @baentsch, does that fix your issue?
@christianpaquin Yes, it does: Thanks! Sorry for not closing the issue earlier.
Unfortunately, I didn't test well enough: When now "opening up" (removing the static declaration) the common symbol KeccakP1600times4_PermuteAll_24rounds (in src/common/sha3) linking creates a collision again. I'll need to investigate some more. Do we agree that it should be the goal that the common/sha3-originating code should be the one made available to liboqs algorithms?
Yes, all non-namespaced Keccak calls should refer to the code in common/sha3. What platform and optimizations (e.g., avx2, etc.) are you using? The Keccak code uses a lot of macros (functions and variants are defined by macros, sometimes implemented in C, sometimes in assembly), and I tried to namespace all of the picnic ones but maybe I missed a few (quite possible if I didn't test on the same platform w/ same opt as you). I'll investigate.
PR #705 should fix the picnic namespacing.
Confirmed. Will follow up with a change to open up symbol for (avx2) src/common/sha3 Keccak
