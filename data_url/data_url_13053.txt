Hi Mitiq Team,
I am having problem getting started with Pennylane using PEC, CDR, DDD and REM. In the documentation, there are good examples of using ZNE with pennylane. I cant find examples of getting started with other error correction techniques included in mitiq.
Thank You.
There exist a few open issues related to using other frontends (#1287) as well as other techniques (#1507, #1773) in tutorials. #1333 is closely related to this feature-request.
@brrbaral Are you interested in working on one of these?
Thanks Biswaraj for the issue! I think it would be great to have another example in PennyLane demonstrating one of the techniques that is not yet in our examples. E.g. using PennyLane in conjunction with CDR.
I'm going to rename the ticket so it's a little more narrowly scoped. If you're interested in working on this (with some guidance if you'd like) feel free to say, otherwise we can pick it up!
And thanks Purva for linking all the related issues!
As discussed at the Mitiq call, we recommend writing this tutorial using a technique other than CDR due to the complexity of the method and relative difficulty of getting it to work well.
Some ideas:
