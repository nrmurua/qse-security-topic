Cannot construct a quantum Circuit object for non-superconducting gates, even though ion trap gates (RXX, MS, etc) are somewhat supported.
Qiskit should be able to generate a QuantumCircuit object from a QASM string which includes extension gates.
It appears that the QASM parser needs to be aware of the non-IBM/superconducting gates. Confirm? So a new "iontrap.inc" file (or similar) needs to be created and placed in a path that the QASM parser can recognize? Is there any documentation on writing a new include file?
Can I have a go at it?
I am new to this, so please correct me if I am wrong at any point. I believe we would need to add the rxx gate (and any other gates defined in qiskit/extensions for full support) in qelib1.inc
