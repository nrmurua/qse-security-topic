Hi I'm Kevin. I'm a new student on the Penning trap. Working with Joe on ARTIQ.
What is happening here is that some Qt bindings have QSortFilterProxyModel in QtGui, whereas others have it in QtCore ...
da83212 autodetects the correct Qt module, and I checked the GUI now works with both the PyQt5 and PyQt4 bindings. Can you upgrade, test and close the issue if OK?
Confirmed fixed. I don't own the issue so can't close it.
