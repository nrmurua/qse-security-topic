Our exiting, working initialization code now encounters an error from a clean install without an environments.db file.
This may block Dave and Soheil in Delft tomorrow/tonight.
How can we initialize it correctly?
No error.
qcodes.config["core"]["db_location"] is unset
KeyError: 'db_location'

The config file bundled with Qcodes has that variable set https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/config/qcodesrc.json I suspect that you have another older file lying around somewhere. AFAIK it loads from user home directory as well as the one bundled in QCodes
or in cwd
Yes, the hierarchy is
It looks like the config file bundled in the whl binary package is out of date for some reason. I think we will have to do a new release. For now you can get the tar.gz by installing qcodes with pip install --no-binary qcodes qcodes which does not seems to have this issue
or get the file json file (and schema) from the repo and put in user home or cwd
@robert-wallis we just put out a new release, v0.1.11. Does using that resolve your issue?
Yes @geoffroth just confirmed the 1.11 release fixed this. üéâ
Thank you for the speedy release! üôè
Great for the record #1044 should make it easier to spot this kind of issue
