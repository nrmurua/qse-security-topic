This issue tracks various components that need to happen before we can be said to fully support Python 3.12.  Notably, we will automatically have wheels available for Python 3.12 already, as since #10120 we've built our wheels against the stable Python C API, which means our released wheels should already be ABI compatible with Python 3.12.  However, not all our dependencies will have pre-built wheels for Python 3.12.
