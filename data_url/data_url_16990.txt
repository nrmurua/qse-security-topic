At the moment, when plotting a statevector using state_plot_city, the assigned labels on the bottom axes are misaligned with the corresponding ticks. This is particularly apparent on the y-axis and when using a larger number of qubits (see below).
Add horizontal and vertical alignments arguments to the calls of set_ticklabels() in state_plot_city. This aligns the labels on the x- and y-axes. The results are shown in comparison below for 2 and 4 qubits (before: left, after: right).
