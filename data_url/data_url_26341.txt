Now CP2K already supports NNP, which is based on BPNN.
Input see https://manual.cp2k.org/cp2k-9_1-branch/CP2K_INPUT/FORCE_EVAL/NNP.html
It will be nice to have the printout section, which can be directly used as a training dataset.
This part could be added in the section %MOTION%PRINT%NNP
The format is shown below and all units are in a.u.

In principle, a good idea and probably not too difficult to implement.
It's a rather specialist format though. I know of only two codes that support it (n2p2 and RuNNer).
If you can live with external software, there is easy support of cp2k native position and force files in the AML python package.
You can use this to convert cp2k output to RuNNer/n2p2 format:
I took the liberty of adding a wiki page: https://www.cp2k.org/tools:aml.
Thank you @cschran
I am aware of AML is a nice python package to deal with NNP training.
Sometimes, it's not really convenient to deal with NPT simulations.
I add this feature in CP2K.
It will be nice if this part can be included.

Again, just a workaround, but you could use the DCD format + the mdtraj-reader in AML:

Can you submit this as a pull request ?
Sure.
