I'm trying to setup a PKI with OQS OpenSSH similar to how it's described here https://hosakacorp.net/p/ssh-pki.html and encountering errors when attempting to upgrade the key to a certificate for QRC algorithms:
Could not upgrade key ssh_ca.test.com.pub to certificate: invalid argument
I'm wondering, is this is a bug or a feature that is known to not be supported as of now? If it is something known, are there plans to eventually support SSH PKI for quantum resistant algorithms in this project? Thanks! ðŸ˜„
Steps to reproduce:
Classical working fine with same build:
As far as I see it, signing of certificates is currently only supported for those which contain public keys of the types listed in sshkey_to_certified, i.e. the signing of certificates with PQC public key types is not yet supported. If one tries to sign a certificate containing a different key type, the error is raised here.
Looks like a duplicate to #24.
