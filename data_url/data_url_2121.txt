affecting #2563 and #2564
This is the same thing that happened the last time we had build protos as a build check. At some random point in time, a library started failing to download and all the builds broke.
I'll turn it off again, and push back against turning it on if this can't be fixed.
@zaqqwerty any idea why this is flaky again?
