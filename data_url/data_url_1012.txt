Description of the issue
Cirq currently has no support for OpenQASM 3. It can be done by writing a lexer and a parser similar to the ones we have for OpenQASM 2.
My take on the sentiment from recent Cirq meetings is: This would be a nice feature to have, but not something we would be able to devote time internally to develop and would be happy to support community contributors here who might be interested in working to put this in.

Hey @anonymousr007, I've assigned you to this issue. Your first step would be to create an RFC: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/docs/dev/rfc_process.md
Thanks @vtomole for assigned me this issue ðŸ˜„. Yes, I have started to create my RFC.
@anonymousr007 any updates on the same?
In case you haven't started, I have some advances and we can work together.
