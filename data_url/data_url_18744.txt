The current version of the listener app does not work on my system:
The listener should be updated to the new commands in version 0.1.0
Hi @lneuhaus. The latest master of Strawberry Fields now includes the ability to save and load blackbird scripts (XanaduAI/strawberryfields#68), so this file is deprecated and I will likely remove it from the Blackbird repo - but thanks for flagging.
To develop using the Blackbird library, there have been a few changes introduced with PR #7. Namely,
New top-level functions, to match the Python standard JSON library:
blackbird.load to load from a file
blackbird.loads to load from a string
blackbird.dump to write to a file
blackbird.dumps to write to a string
parse_blackbird has been renamed to parse, and is no longer the recommended way to parse blackbird scripts.
The main reasons for these changes is to minimize the effect of blackbird syntax/grammar changes on dependent code-bases. Previously, a small grammar change could result in significant changes to the listener methods, meaning that all sub-classed listeners would need to be updated. Now, using blackbird.load, a BlackbirdProgram object is returned, with attributes such as modes, target, operation to extract information about the program.
Thanks for the comments, the new top-level functions work quite nicely and indeed make the Strawberry Fields listener exaple obsolete from my point of view.
Fixed in #12.
