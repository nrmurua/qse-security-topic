@doctor-entropy Could you provide the following info:
Hello! The OS is Ubuntu 18.10.
@notmgsk @karalekas  Do we have an update on the findings so far with this?
@doctor-entropy Could you try upgrading to the latest release and see if that solves the issue: https://downloads.rigetti.com/qcs-sdk/forest-sdk-linux-deb.tar.bz2
@notmgsk It worked!!
quilc --version now outputs
1.12.1 [ba26bab]
Thank you so much for addressing the issue! :)
