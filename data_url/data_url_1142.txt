Engine should take a repetition x parameter sweep size that it wants to break things into, and if the job is bigger than this break the job into multiple jobs of this size (or smaller).
One issue here is how to name these jobs.
I can take this on. I'll plan to solve it in two steps:
How does that sound ?
@MichaelBroughton are you still interested in this?
1.) still sounds useful
2.) we might be able to get away with just implementing this in the methods of Engine, EngineProgram, adding the extra param max_job_size to it and then handle returning of multiple jobs and the merging of the TrialResults
