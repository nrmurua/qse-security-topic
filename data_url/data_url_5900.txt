Not all simulation methods test with QasmStandardGateDensityMatrixTests (defined in qasm_standard_gates.py). At least test_qasm_simulator_statevector.py and test_qasm_simulator_matrix_product_state.py import only QasmStandardGateStatevectorTests. Is this intentional (maybe to reduce testing time)?
Or maybe not all methods support the density matrix snapshot
