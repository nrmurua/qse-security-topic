The hypothesis tests in randomized testing have recently been failing due to some numerical overflows resulting from choices of angles, for example:
these circuits are non-equivalent, because the optimize_1q_gate pass did not handle the euler angle of 10^15 properly!
One fix is to just make the pass handle such weird cases (not sure how feasible this is).
But I think these tests are a bit orthogonal to the spirit of the randomized tests, which were meant to help us catch actual bugs, so perhaps we should just bound the angle range to some realistic interval.
