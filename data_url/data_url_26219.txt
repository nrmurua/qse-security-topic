Newest version of Python was released on Oct 2, 23. https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/
It might be good to make changes in toqito to allow Python 3.12. As tested in #215, we do need to wait for numpy to upgrade to the newer version before we make changes to this repo.
Currently, a Github workflow's virtual environment is installing numpy 1.25.2 but numpy 1.26  released in Sep 2023 has Python 3.12 support. Maybe poetry is forcing an older version of numpy due to other package dependencies.

Note: an easy way to fix the build error in #215 would be to pin a higher numpy version.

This might be fixed by #218
As stated in #354 (comment), we have to wait for cvxopt to be compatible with 3.12 then only we can upgrade to a newer version of python.
3.12 now passes: Bchass#2
@Bchass Feel free to add a PR for this.
I should have had a test PR up after #409. Looks like we did not need to wait for cvxopt or cvxpy.
Fixed by #413
