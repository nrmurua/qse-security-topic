I think it would be useful if an error message were generated if dds channels were duplicated. For example, I tried these entries in the device_db.pyon file,
And the experiment I had ran without any issues, but in setting dds0 and dds1 the same dds was essentially being set twice.
The more general feature should be a "device DB linter" that issues warnings for this and other potential issues (same problem with TTLs, no core device defined, etc.). The master and artiq_run could run the linter automatically after reading the DDB.
@r-srinivas since the experiment ran without issues, we can close #305? Was frequency monitoring also OK in the GUI?
A linter can catch a few obvious errors but it will only be a small aid.
Frequency monitoring meaning? I could run DDS Setter on windows and it seemed to work fine with the one working DDS I have left.
The DDS panel that shows the current frequencies. Anyway, I tested it and it works.
Done for Kasli systems.
