The current QFI implementation doesn't properly reflect that the QFI is purely real, as the code allows to take also imaginary parts of it. Instead we should have a class for the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that allows to take real, imaginary and real+imaginary parts and build the QFI on it, using QFI = 4 * Re(QGT). In summary:

As discussed, we're adding this to the 0.23 milestone again ðŸ™‚
