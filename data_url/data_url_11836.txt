The sample code at https://qiskit.org/aqua does not work with aqua 0.4.0.
When I run the code, an import error occurs as follows.
The correct output by aqua 0.3.1 is as follows.
Remove from qiskit_aqua.input import get_input_instance in the sample because it is not used in the code.
Thank you, @t-imamichi.  We have just corrected those issues in the code, as well as changed all the occurrences of "Aqua Chemistry" or "Qiskit Aqua Chemistry" into "Qiskit Chemistry", added the newly added Amplitude Estimation algorithm to the list, and corrected the qiskit-tutorials links.
See Qiskit/qiskit.org#74
As soon as the above PR gets approved and merged, I will close this issue.
Fixed: Qiskit/qiskit.org#74
Thanks!
