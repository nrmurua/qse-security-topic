I think the flterm documentation on the ARTIQ installation page needs to be updated. Looks like if you follow the instructions the directory should be /artiq-dev/misoc/misoc/tools with two misocs and not just one.
And the flterm file has been changed so--portis no longer valid. Should be just port?
