I forget to add the classical_addresses parameter 100% of the time I use PyQuil. Also it's a source of common confusion in the results that get returned. Can we brainstorm some suggestions to improve this? For instance, if not set then just return all the classical bits that are manipulated by the program. Alternatively, return just the measured bits in order.
See #126 for instance
@stevenheidel Defaulting to returning the measured bits in order seems like good behavior to me.  For example:
returns [0, 1]
What's the latest on this? What about a default to return all (measured addresses | qubit indices)?
