When you combine two quantum circuits, that were created using the same shared register, they will appear on different registers.
Produces this:

The two circuits should end up on the same register. This is the behaviour when running the above code on Qiskit 0.11.0.
The expected behaviour is restored when removing the coupling map in the above example. This could provide a starting point for debugging.
Hi @bjader , thanks for reporting. Following Qiskit 0.12.0, this is the expected behavior. Terra 0.9 included several bugfixes to standardize the way in which circuits are laid out by the transpiler,  including laying out circuits over a standardized device register.
You should be able to achieve the old behavior by either transpiling with a custom pass manager that excludes layout passes, or by looking at the circuit._layout property on the output circuit which will hold the layout used during transpile. N.B. The location/format of circuit._layout hasn't been finalized, and may move in future releases.
Hi @kdk thank you for the response! It's good to know that this is the expected behaviour now - although I think in this particular case the old behaviour would be more commonly what a user would like to happen.
I'll have a try with the circuit._layout property. Could you give more details on what you mean by "look" at it. Would I modify the property to use the original register?
Try qc1.draw(output='mpl', with_layout=True).show().
