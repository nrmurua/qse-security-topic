There are some how to guides which require several small changes for broken links, etc. This issue will track progress of fixing those issues.
One comment to add here. In the how-to example here the link to ct.lattice in "using the ct.lattice decorator" is broken. Also, the tip says "We can specify where the temporary computation results with the results_dir parameter in the ct.lattice decorator is stored. By default, results_dir=./results/." But when I look at the API for ct.lattice here, I don't see a results_dir parameter.
Thanks a lot @arosen93 ! I went through your issue related to these as well and will soon be taking care of them in a PR 😄 . And yes results_dir in the lattice decorator function is a remnant of deprecated code, will fix the documentation 👍 .
Sounds great :) Thanks!
