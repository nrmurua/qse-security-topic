I have simple code for Time evaluation, with mesolve and sesolveI consider two time list as t1=[0,5,10] and t2=[0,10].But I get different states in t=10 in two case
If you run code you get False. This difference between to case is  1.1620088200000005e-6j but it's important in many context such as   measure entanglement in general Form.

You can control the tolerance of the output of the solvers with the qutip.Options() class, in particular the parameters atol, rtol and nsteps.
It's highly unlikely that you'll ever get them to be exactly equal due to the realities of floating-point.  A more relevant measure is the size of the overlap r1.overlap(r2).  Again, this will never be exactly 0, but by setting the tolerances of the solvers suitably, you can bound it to an acceptable value.
This is unfortunately just one of the realities of numeric computing - floating-point calculations accumulate error, and it's up to the user to specify what level of error is tolerable.
@Hosseinyeganeh I think Jake has explained nicely why you get the results you do. Closing this issue for now, but please feel free to continue the discussion if needed.
