Hello,
I have noticed a bug where COMBINE_COLVAR incorrectly reports COLVAR values.
For example, one would expect two COLVARs below to be the same:
and
However, metadynLog reports correct CV1, while CV2 (combined CV) is listed as 0.
I think this bug was reported earlier at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/cp2k/COMBINE_COLVAR%7Csort:relevance/cp2k/_uFtNhs8ptY/la3vSdiX7I4J but apparently it is not fixed yet.
I would like to confirm that this bug is (at least) specific to COMBINE_COLVAR, where COORDINATION is used together with ATOMS_FROM and KINDS_TO.
I have attached an input file that would reproduce this result. It should take less than a minute to run on a single core.
