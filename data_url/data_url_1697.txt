Description of the issue
If you do CircuitOperation(..., qubit_map={LineQubit(0), LineQid(1, dimension=3)}), it is happy but then fails during simulation with obscure message.
How to reproduce the issue
See above
Expected behavior
It should fail at circuit construction time with a friendly error message.
Notes
The check needs to happen in with_qubit_mapping as well.
