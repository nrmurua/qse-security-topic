Upstream also changed the names slightly. I think we should probably follow that for PQClean but downstream projects might want to adapt...
some prep work at sphincs/sphincsplus#37
More work at sphincs/sphincsplus#40
What's the next step here?  Are the upstream PRs just waiting for review (if so I can review) or is there more work to be done?
Yeah it would be nicest if those upstream PRs got merged. I'll bump the PR.
