This is one of the reasons it's so hard to write good optimizers that have compact outputs.
You're thinking about being able to insert across different moments?  Instead of insert at a particular index you could insert at different index for different qubits?
This feels like it might complicate the insert method by a lot, so if it is done it might be via a different method?
Oh I think we have this.
Oh I see this is to make insert return something that is useful for insert at frontier.
OK but it looks like you can achieve this by using insert_at_frontier with no frontier specified.  So I think we just need to encourage that use for optimizers that run into this.
Closing one more time as I don't think this is feasible with current insert's return type of int.  Overloading that feels like it would create a lot of overhead for callers.
