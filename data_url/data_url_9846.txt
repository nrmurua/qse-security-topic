It would be useful to have a string representation for CQM models.
Proposed Solution
The most obvious thing would be something like
(see #1052) or
assuming that we add dump and dumps to go with #1182
LP files are fairly standard and pretty clear to read. However, there are a few issues
Different Proposed Solution
Something LP-like, but a bit less in the uncanny valley might be
At least in this case we dodge problem (3) from above by just doing f'Real({v.variables[0]!r})'
If the LP format does not natively fit to our CQMs, better not to "slightly" modify it. Or conform, but lose CQM-specific details.
That's why I prefer your second proposal, or something along those lines. Like:
Or if we want to be more repr-ish (to allow easier c/p model creation):
Speaking of repr, I'd print only a few significant stats (num vars, constraints, types, etc), instead going for full-eval-ready repr we have on BQM.
I don't think we can do the "Variables" section in full generality because Binary(0) + Binary('0') is a perfectly valid model and it wouldn't be obvious how to cast them to intermediate labels.
So I think that brings us to
it's a bit verbose but is at least unambiguous.
