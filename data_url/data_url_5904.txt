DISABLE_CONAN environment variable and CMake flag don't work as they should, and Conan dependencies are still searched.
Build qiskit-aer v0.7.2 with DISABLE_CONAN=1 python setup.py bdist_wheel from environment without conan.
Optional for full reproduction:
This should build a wheel via skbuild/cmake without conan being present.
Instead, it seems the variable DISABLE_CONAN isn't set properly. See following trace:
Grep'd CMake build w/ --trace-expand flag on (note, this was with the partial solution below applied):
