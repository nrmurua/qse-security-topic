Samples of Sequence instances are currently computed in place in the Simulation class and in the _seq_drawer function as well. This gives two pieces of code dedicated to the same task, which is bad.
To 1) fix this 2) ease the construction of the samples dictionary and 3) decouple its use from its construction, it would be very beneficial to implement an independent Sequence sampler component.
Se the original proposal in PR #337.
The sampler will receive a Sequence instance as well as the strategies to sample it: noise sources, qubits masked by an SLM, modulation effects from AOM/EOM. These strategies must play well with each others: they should be easy to add, remove or update independently.
A couple more concrete ideas to consider here:
@HGSilveri, I have opened PR #345 as a proposal implementation.
I wrote a different design that is not class-based, let me know what you think of it.
