The USB JTAG that comes with old KC705 is an SMT-1 type, which has been discontinued. Current ones are SMT-2. To use SMT-2, one has to change which digilent source to use in the kc705.cfg in the openocd/scripts/board folder to digilent-hs2.cfg.
@r-srinivas can you confirm that this is correct, i.e. kc705 of a certain revision (which?) are shipped with smt2 on them?
I'm not sure if they're shipped with them but we had to resolder the USB JTAG on our KC705. The SMT-1 seems to have been discontinued.

I'm not sure if it's worthwhile to support SMT-2 within artiq, but maybe just a description in the FAQ or something would suffice.
Edit: I called digilent and the representative did say they've discontinued SMT-1 sales. It's possible maybe newer KC705s have SMT-2s but I'm not sure.
AFAICT kc705s do not come with SMT2. The footprint is different and the additional GPIOs on the SMT2 might actually cause problems. I would have a hard time writing a non-trivial FAQ entry for this.
