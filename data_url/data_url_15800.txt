Printing a Instruction to console shows the default pointer information because __str__ is not defined. It would be useful to show at least the minimum information of the instruction itself, i.e. self.name, self.num_qubits and self.num_clbits.
@Lolcroc may I have a go at this?
Is the above-mentioned information sufficient for this __str__ method? Also, if self.name is None, should there be any default name for an object instance?
Yes, a formatted string with just those parameters seems fine. If self.name is None, it makes sense to print it as None.
