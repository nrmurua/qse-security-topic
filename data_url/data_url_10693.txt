For k=1, the embedding should be a randomly sampled qubit.
For k=2, the embedding should be the endpoints of a randomly sampled coupler.
This happens because the clique embedder looks for clique embeddings with chains of a certain shape, and these chains have length at least 2, which is suboptimal for k <= 2.
