Review and approve [RFC for Readout Error Mitigation (REM)]
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1buO5PrO5sS02VXjcaYf37RuR0rF6xpyr4J9H1tI4vN4/edit#heading=h.c072otyej9hw)
Feature request issue #815
Tried to assign @amirebrahimi but he doesn't appear in the list of possible assignees when I type in his username.
Thanks for the update. I have comments in the RFC that I'll be addressing soon.
I've updated the RFC doc and my branch to address some of the changes requested:
amirebrahimi@464578b
amirebrahimi@5d7e51e
Thanks @amirebrahimi, I left some comments on the RFC document.
For my side, the current version of the RFC can be accepted!
However a formal acceptance decision can only be taken after a proper discussion with other members of the Mitiq team. I'll keep you posted!
Nice job Amir, this looks really great. I've made a comment about naming similar to Andrea's, but this is ready to move on to the next steps from me. I've marked it as accepted. Congrats! ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰
I'll close this out now as this ticket was just for tracking the RFC, and we can use #815 for the implementation whenever we decide to do that.
