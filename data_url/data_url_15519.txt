The quantum geometric tensor reads 〈∂kψ|∂lψ〉−〈∂kψ|ψ〉〈ψ|∂lψ〉 and the quantum Fisher information reads 4 * Re[〈∂kψ|∂lψ〉−〈∂kψ|ψ〉〈ψ|∂lψ〉].
Using the features implemented for the LinCombFull Circuit QFI methods implemented by PR 7632, we can easily compute the quantum geometric tensor using linear combination of unitaries methods.
To streamline the possibilities and clarify the methods for the user, we suggest adding a class of quantum geometric tensor methods to the gradient framework such that several QFI methods may be derived from them.

Opflow is now deprecated soon to be removed. New features/enhancements are no longer a consideration.
