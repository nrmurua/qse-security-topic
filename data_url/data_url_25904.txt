electron metadata contains a lot of unnecessary fields fields such as num_cpu, num_gpu, memory, etc. This is due to the default_constraints_dict in covalent/_shared_files/defaults.py.
This will output:
These fields can be moved to a different dictionary and commented. Further, that dictionary can be used as an example on how users can define their custom metadata fields and their default values. default_constraints_dict should only contain backend as a metadata field for now.
No response
I can play around with it and see if I can get it to model the expected behavior. You could go the brute force route and pop them out of the dict into a new one but this could be slow and I think there is a better solution. I would love to take a look.
