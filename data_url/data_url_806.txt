Hi @ryanhill1, could you please try using the LocalSimulator to run the circuit? Currently, gate modifiers are supported for this device.
The following is a code snippet that you can swap out your device object for:
For more information, running circuits on a LocalSimulator can be found here.
@math411 Oh ok, wasn't aware the feature wasn't supported for remote devices yet. Yeah, it works for the LocalSimulator and gives a warning about running on QPUs. Maybe until it's implemented would you be opposed to me adding a more descriptive error message?
Yes, this makes sense. We will adjust the error messaging upstream to be more descriptive and more useful. Thanks for the feedback!
