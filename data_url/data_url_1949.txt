Hello
When installing cirq 0.8.1 using pip
ERROR: google-api-core 1.21.0 has requirement protobuf>=3.12.0, but you'll have protobuf 3.8.0 which is incompatible.
cirq has a requirement protobuf == 3.8.0 . this is incompatible with what other dependency wants.
Does pip install google-api-core ==1.17.0  fix it?
Yeah, I eventually solved the issue with manually installing pip intsall google-api-core==1.14.0, the lowest supported by cirq. Does this mean that pip is that bad at dependency solvig?
I looks like the upper bound our requirements file is too high for the lower bound on protobuf:
google-api-core[grpc] >= 1.14.0, < 2.0.0dev
If you had 1.21 installed before installing cirq it would not have downgraded and you'll get this error, I believe.  Once you downgraded it all worked.
Since this is for 0.8.1 we would need to do a bug release to fix this.
For anyone also facing this issue: the problem with manual installation of google-api-core is that it's actually google-api-core[grpc]. I used a hard-coded version of api-core in a CI script, and it failed on missing grpc. In my case, adding  'google-api-core[grpc]<=1.14.0', to my setup.py file fixes the issue.
https://github.com/googleapis/python-api-core/blame/02d25799243bd76ac76423a08c063a2bee8d11e4/setup.py google-api-core 1.20 is the last that has protobuf >= 3.4.0. So we could put an upperbound on that as @dabacon said.
Alternatively we could upgrade our protobuf requirement. What are the constraints around that?
We will release next week a bug release on this!
