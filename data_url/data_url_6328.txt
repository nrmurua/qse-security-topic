The SWAPTwoQubits unit test for Q# fails. If QUnit is removed from the PInvoke API in favor of QPager, the test passes, suggesting that the problem is in QUnit layer. Disabling Pauli X and Y basis optimizations in code does not cause the test to pass with QUnit. Based on the above, there might be a bug in ProbParity() or MParity().
Fixed by #682.
