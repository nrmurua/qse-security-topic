Include default values for all jobex flags.  Some simple error handling akin to the same level as what's in ridft and rdgrad should be sufficient -- nothing too complicated.  A rollback variable and methodology should absolutely be persued.
Jobex is now supported.  However, it's current troubleshooting methods can pretty much be distilled down into:
jobex >> fail >> actual -r >> jobex again >> fail >> ridft method >> jobex
Issue has become redundant and is covered by others.
