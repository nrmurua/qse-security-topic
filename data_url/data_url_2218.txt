My goal here is to be able to use the cirq pauli exponentiation interface to compile something like $e^{j \theta X_0 Y_1 + Y_0 X_1 }$ to gates parameterized with the correct symbolic expressions
Makes sense to me that this would be allowed.
If nobody else objects could you assign this to me?
I believe this is a duplicate of #1617.  Going to close this one and move assignment.
