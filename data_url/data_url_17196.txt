qiskit.scheduler.schedule accepts a list of quantum circuits. It should make use of parallel_map just like transpile does over quantum circuits to parallelize compilation.
The issue is still in "To Do" stage. Needs more information.
There is sufficient information in here, the issue here is to simply to replace the list comprehension: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/compiler/scheduler.py#L100 with a call to parallel_map() to potentially run scheduling in parallel when multiple circuits are passed to schedule().
May I pick up this issue? I implemented @mtreinish's suggestion locally, as shown below:
schedules = parallel_map(schedule_circuit, circuits, (schedule_config, method))
And did not observe any adverse side effects when I added a unit test that calls qiskit.scheduler.schedule.
Hi @upsideon sorry this issue fell off the radar, are you still interested in working on this?
