Constructing gate times from properties does not return correct results.
It's possible I could just be using this function incorrectly, though I believe I'm understanding the function gate_time_values correctly based on the docstring. https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/master/qiskit/providers/aer/noise/device/parameters.py#L81
I find that...
res_2 should be ('u3', [0], 206.2222222222222)
Not sure, I haven't tried debugging it yet.
Also if it's relevant, here are other versions...
It looks like what is being returned from the backend contains the parameter 'gate_length' but the code is checking for 'gate_time'. Assuming these variables are meant to refer to the same thing it should be a simple case of switching over the naming of one of them.
Oh great, I didn't catch that. I'll try this and make a PR if that fixes it. Thanks!
@maddy-tod yep it looks like we need to update the code to use the "gate_length" field o the backend properties, @georgesbarron were you still planning on putting in a PR?
It also looks like gate length is still not being returned by properties for devices ibmqx2, ibmqx4 or ibmq_16_melbourne.
@chriseclectic I was originally planning on making a PR for this, but Aer is the only package I haven't installed from source and I haven't had time to sort it out yet.
