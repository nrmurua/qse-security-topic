Some operations, like Cliffords, are used repeatedly and are somewhat awkward to do efficiently in pyqgl2.  Therefore there is a proposal to implement them in hardware in the future.  To access them from pyqgl2, we'll need to add stubs (and the corresponding plumbing) to get them down to QGL.  (QGL will also need to be modified to use the new hardware capabilities, when available.)
Added stub for Cliffords function clifford_seq. Copied other Cliffords stuff into QGL2 (as python)
