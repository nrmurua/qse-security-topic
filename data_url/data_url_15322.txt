The default method QuantumCircuit.save_density_matrix() in qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit class is not available if we import QuantumCircuit only.

However, once we import some other Qiskit libraries, QuantumCircuit.save_density_matrix() becomes available.

Just running the following code can reproduce the error.
I also attached an .ipynb file for further verification of this bug.
save_density_matrix.ipynb.zip
Since the QuantumCircuit.save_density_matrix() is a standard method shown in the document, the following code should be successfully run with no errors.
I guess some essential links (imports) that activate the QuantumCircuit.save_density_matrix() method are missed in the current version, though I did not identify the location of this bug in the program.
I hope someone can tackle this bug, many thanks!
The method appears in the documentation like that (as opposed to Aer-specific documentation) as an unfortunate consequence of how Aer monkey-patches methods onto QuantumCircuit, and how the docs build happens.  These methods will start being documented in Aer's standalone documentation soon (maybe with Aer 0.11 but probably the version after), to help avoid this confusion a bit.
You can see some more discussion in #6346.  I'll close this issue as a duplicate of that, just for book-keeping purposes; it's still an issue that needs fixing, we just already have a tracker for it.

Thank you so much for your quick response, I am happy to hear this family of issues would be fixed in the near future.
I will also follow issue #6346.
