Before raising this issue, I have already checked that I am:
Running a QAOA computation on a QPU and attempting to dump the results fails because some QPUs return their measurement_outcome probabilities as a numpy.float, which is not python serializable. This issue may also happen for statevector simulators, where the measurement_outcomes are wavefunctions which are complex arrays.
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
OpenQAOA should convert all non-serializable outputs to native python types, so that QPU results including measurement outcomes can be dumped into a JSON
