@mariomotta  thanks a lot for the PR and all the work done here. The test needs to be worked out a bit and there is still the discussion about the directories. Thus I rename the PR to work in progress and we can keep working in this.
This work needs to be moved/resumed/finished in qiskit-nature. I created an issue there to reference this for now qiskit-community/qiskit-nature#39 Once the work has been transferred across this PR should simply be closed, but I will leave it open for now while the transfer is pending.
Aqua will shortly be deprecated so I am closing this. This work should be moved/completed to qiskit-nature where I already opened an issue to track this qiskit-community/qiskit-nature#39
