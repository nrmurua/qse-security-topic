This code (modified from qubit_characterization_test.py) works:
However, if you change it to
it does not give the correct answer. The density matrix should be

Thanks Matt for catching this. There was a mixup in the order of the qubits in the code which caused the rotation operators to be applied to the wrong qubits. Somehow the Bell states didn't catch it. I fixed it and circuit = circuits.Circuit.from_ops(ops.H(q_0), ops.H(q_1)) should work too now.
