Hi,
I tried copying the code in this example: https://github.com/ProjectQ-Framework/ProjectQ/blob/develop/examples/ibm.py
The code compiles and I successfully log in to the server. It says waiting for results and I get the job id, but soon after this I get a Traceback and it crashes.
I'm using macOS 10.14.2 and I installed projectq on my machine using pip.
I found the error. When creating the compiler engine, if the use_hardware option is set on True the code crashes as soon as it's executed on the ibmqx4. If it is set to true it works. I already edited the example and made a pull request to fix the bug
