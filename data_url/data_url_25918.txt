Using Jupyter notebook version 6.2.0, with Python 3.8
I have problems getting Quirk inside the notebook. Also, I was checking and added swap and cswap gate for interpretation, like validation, for example: in case of swap q[0], q[0] nothing appears (if it was identity).
I attach some screenshots.





Thanks. Will try and reproduce.
This should be fixed now with #7. You no longer need to have a source checkout, so make a copy of the example.ipynb if you want that file and then delete the directory.
Now, just install with pip install pyQuirk. Make sure to have JupyterLab 3 installed. You can launched with jupyter lab example.ipynb or with jupyter notebook example.ipynb.
Re: the swap, cswap gate not producing the correct circuit -- this is a known issue. We unfortunately don't support all gates, but I'm thinking of integrating something like https://github.com/quantastica/qconvert to handle conversion properly from qasm to Quirk.
