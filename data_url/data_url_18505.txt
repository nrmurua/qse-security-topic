Many of the tests in the test suite are parallelizable, and the test suite as a whole is quite slow when run serially. A quick hack might be something as simple as (lparallel:pmapc #'funcall (get-test-list)), where (get-test-list) grabs the test function names from the suiteâ€”but this should be used judiciously, in case there are nonparallelizable regions (like the RPCQ server tests).
