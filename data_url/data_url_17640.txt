In the process to understand #1575, I noticed that BasicSwap also fails with that example (in which move_measurements.qasm tries to be mapped). I managed to extract a minimal example:
This fails with qiskit.dagcircuit.exceptions.DAGCircuitError: 'invalid wire mapping key q2[0]'.
This is fixed by #1611
