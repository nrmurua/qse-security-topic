When the next code is executed:
The next error appears:
This only happens with qiskit_aer 0.13.0, with qiskit_aer 0.12.2 it works
@doichanj  I am happy to work on this if you would like me to.
# Works for IBMProvider() backends
# Since configuration.description is set to the value of backend.description
# setting the value of backend.description avoids the exception
from qiskit.providers.backend import BackendV1, BackendV2 
provider=IBMProvider()
backend=provider.get_backend("ibm_nairobi")
if isinstance(backend,BackendV2):
    if hasattr(backend.configuration(),'description'):  # use an existing description
       backend.description = backend.configuration().description
   else: 
       backend.description = 'My Description'
I do not see a consistent workaround for these backends. If the backend does not set and copy a description  in the backend.configuration() method (e.g. any derived from ConfigurableFakeBackend), there is no workaround .
A few lines of code in the AerSimulator.from_backend would correct the exception for all backends.
Adding description = None, to the declaration for user definition
And adding an explicit check for the existence of the attribute
       if description is not None or not hasattr(configuration,'description'): 
            configuration.description = description
@rrodenbusch Thank you, I'm now fixing this issue, but it takes some time to release 0.13.1 with this fix, so it is helpful to avoid this error
