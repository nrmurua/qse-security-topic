When the latest scipy version is used (1.12.0), QuTiP (4.7.4) cannot be imported since from scipy import array is no longer supported in scipy.
Code to reproduce the bug:
import qutip
Output:
The deprecation warning from scipy==1.11 reads
DeprecationWarning: scipy.array is deprecated and will be removed in SciPy 2.0.0, use numpy.array instead.
However, clearly this functionality broke before that release; with some discussion here:
This commit, 1315742, already has removed from scipy import array from parallel.py. But it appears this commit is not included in the most recent releases of 4.7.X.
Edit:
The problem lies on this branch here: https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/qutip-4.7.X/qutip/parallel.py
