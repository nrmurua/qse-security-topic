When integrating ComplexNumber in to Q, I commented out the check in Qubit initialization for a^2 + b^2 = 1. (I just wanted everything to function again as quickly as possible.) So we (I?) need to re-implement that using ComplexNumber now...
Done. And Qubit verifies that |𝒂|² + |𝒃|² = 1. Note those absolute value operations are before the values are squared! Complex numbers are weird. Fixed by df5a12a
