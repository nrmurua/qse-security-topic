IBM has introduced two new native pulses setp (set phase) and delay (in addition to fc and acquire).
These two instructions can be used inside pulse cmd-def JSON. We need to update IBMAccelerator::contributeInstructions to contribute these new instructions so that the pulse cmd-def Composite can be constructed.
To be able to run a protocol similar to the one described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04302.pdf,
we need to support a couple of advanced pulse instructions:
These instructions allow changing LO freq. per pulse (rather than fixed for the whole experiment).
(pulse frequency is an optimization parameter in the protocol)
Note: we may not be able to simulate these two instructions since Aer doesn't support them (see this)
Topics about pulses are interesting to me. Is this issue still relevant?
Yea, this issue is still relevant. Please feel free to work on this if you're interested.
BTW, we can get around this issue by pre-modulating the pulse signal in the code, but it'd be nice to have these pulse instructions supported in XACC.
I started implementation (a draft pull request  #464 ) and have a few questions:
Hi @flatslm,
Hi @tnguyen-ornl
I added simplest test to pull request #464 .
Check please, is this test correct?
Now I plan send some instructions to armonk ibm device.
Thanks, @flatslm.
This looks good. For the test that you have, you can look at the QObj generated when you execute that cr_comp.
Also, make sure it is validated by the armonk backend :)
Hi @tnguyen-ornl.
Some code and new test was corrected and I marked PR as "ready for review".
It seems that setf and shiftf works ok, but I did not found backend with support of setp/shiftp operations.
