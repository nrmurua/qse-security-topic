The circuit plotted for the attached code is incorrect.
Load and plot the circuit.
Getting a standard teleport circuit diagram.
None
Code to reproduce:
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg qubits[3];
creg corrz[1];
creg corrx[1];
creg final[1];
h qubits[0];
h qubits[1];
cx qubits[1], qubits[2];
cx qubits[0], qubits[1];
h qubits[0];
measure qubits[0] -> corrz[0];
measure qubits[1] -> corrx[0];
if (corrz==1) z qubits[2];
if (corrx==1) x qubits[2];
h qubits[2];
measure qubits[2] -> final[0];
These are the measurement probabilities I got after running your code on the official IBM Quantum Experience Portal.

The measurement probabilities seem right for teleportation.
@RafeyIqbalRahman Sorry for having been unclear: the piece that seems incorrect is the emitted circuit diagram (the classical control is shown before the measurement that sets it).

I can see the measurements been done before applying the control on qubit 2. If this is not the reproduced error, Please upload the image if you can.
Hu, that is not the picture I am getting.

Here is also the driver code (not that that should be relevant):
@bettinaheim Sorry for the late response. The Issue in this case is not your code but its just how the print( ) function in python prints the circuit. The printing happens along the depth i.e. horizontal length instead of the vertical length/ width. So it prints out gates corresponding to each qubit , qubit line by qubit line, Hence although in functionality the circuit works exactly as expected, while printing due to the above nature, it prints the Z gate where it finds space next on the qubit line.
I recommend you using barriers between your circuit to resolve your problem.
As for a permanent fix for this issue, i think developing an in-house qiskit circuit print functionality will solve it for printing in terminal. If you want you or I can start this now issue for enhancement. I have a standard pseudo code solution of how to print it in-house.
I hope this has helped you, and let me know if this issue can be closed.
Here's the attached changed QASM code, and the corresponding output if need be.

@deeplokhande
Thanks for the explanation! Feel free to do with this issue as you see fit - close it, migrate it, open a feature request. I am all set here; I just ran into this and wanted to file it since I wasn't sure whether you are aware of it.
The problem seems fixed now (terra 0.19):
Thanks!
