Passing pass manager to transpile without also setting unitary_synthesis_method to None gives an error.
Should not be forced to set unitary_synthesis_method to None.

This is true, but with the pass_manager argument to transpile deprecated, probably the best solution for us is just to effect the removal of the pass_manager keyword entirely for 0.20, and skip all that code - the deprecation has been kicking around since #4060, which was a little under a year ago now (so probably Terra 0.17 or 0.18).
Closed by: #7679 which removes the pass_manager kwarg.
