Description of the issue
A Simulator object should be able to be initialized with any NOISE_MODEL_LIKE object, but the following error is raised when a PerQubitDepolarizingWithDampedReadoutNoiseModel object is passed in as the noise parameter.
How to reproduce the issue
The simple_noise_from_calibration_metrics method from cirq-google/cirq_google/experimental/noise_models/noise_models.py returns a PerQubitDepolarizingWithDampedReadoutNoiseModel object. When this is passed into the Simulator constructor, the error is produced.

Correct, the state vector simulator has only limited noise support. You can use DensityMatrixSimulator to simulate larger categories of noise models.
Hey @daxfohl, I think the logic we added here was due to a mistake on my part. The sparse simulator and other state vector-based simulators actually can accept channel-based noise, thanks to the channel support in act_on_state_vector_args here. This uses "trajectory-like" behavior for channels, which is consistent with how we currently treat mixtures.
