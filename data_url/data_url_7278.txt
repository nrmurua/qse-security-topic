Noticed by @karolpezet  at #372
We should probably create a "Full API" page in addition to the curated API page (https://github.com/qojulia/QuantumOptics.jl-documentation/blob/master/src/api.md) that just list everything
@Krastanov I think we should just complete the existing API (I briefly talked to @david-pl). I can do this at some point.
I agree, it would be great to extend the curated list. The suggestion for a hidden "Full API" page is more so that future omissions like this (which will inevitably happen) do not cause even the search function to fail.
Some combination of multidocumenter and strict warnings during build can also help.
I included now all the missing APIs in the docu. When you build the documentation you get a warning for all the missing APIs.
What I am suggesting is turning that warning into an error, so it gets detected during pull requests. Like here: https://github.com/QuantumSavory/QuantumClifford.jl/blob/master/docs/make.jl#L24
One just needs to be careful: there is a particular warning type that shows up when an unexported method with a docstring is NOT in the public documentation. But unexported methods are usually private and can break at any time, so it is correct to not have them in the documentation. The except tool can be used to disregard those.
I guess this would be beneficial. However, when I build the docu I always obtain the following strange warning which would turn into an error:
 Warning: no doc found for reference '[SparseOperator](@ref)' in src/api.md. â”” @ Documenter.CrossReferences ~/.julia/packages/Documenter/bYYzK/src/Utilities/Utilities.jl:34 
I do not know where this comes from, do you have any idea?
Not certain, but presumably the docstring for SparseOperator is not visualized anywhere in the docs. Adding an autodoc for it (or adding a hidden page with autodoc for all public symbols) would probably solve this.
