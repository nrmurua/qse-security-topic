The outcome of Amplitude Estimation algorithm in this tutorial is incorrect https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/legacy_tutorials/aqua/finance/simulation/credit_risk_analysis.ipynb In prior release this was fine.
Yes, that seems to be a bug in AmplitudeEstimation, since the other variants of the algorithm work (e.g. IterativeAmplitudeEstimation). Probably something around how the controls of the operator Q are computed.
Closing this since (1) the with the update of QAE this should work, but also (2) this tutorial doesn't exist anymore üôÇ
The tutorial was moved over here in the mean time and was changed to use the IterativeAE which did not have the problem that the regular AE had - maybe you can check that this works with the regular AE now to assure the changes etc that have been done have eliminated the reported problem.

Thanks! Yes I just tried it and it works fine now üëç
Ok -- actually I think there are still bugs if the CircuitFactory is used (I tried running it on circuits) since it uses Aqua's internal control mechanism. We have two options here I think: convert the circuit factories to circuits, or leave it as is since the circuit factories are deprecated. Option 1 would be better if we can do it before release I think, but since I have the tutorials updated to use circuits (the PR will be opened once the probability distributions and finance circuits are merged) users will likely not encounter that issue anymore.
@Cryoris Does this still apply to the refactored AE or can this be closed? If it needs to stay open I will xfer to Terra.
It doesn't apply to the refactored AE in Terra, but still does to the one in Aqua if used with CircuitFactorys.
Ok I  labelled that it will not be fixed as the AE logic here is deprecated.
I will leave this open here for now such that anyone who might experience this issue might see this. The advise now is to use the AE algorithms that were moved/refactored to the qiskit-terra repo, which is where the code will reside now and be maintained, that do not have this issue.
Since all the logic here is effectively deprecated I am going to close this.
