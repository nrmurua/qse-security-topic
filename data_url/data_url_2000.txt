In the test_colorbar test there is a comment about testing that the position size and pad arguments are respected.
I think I can contribute to this issue
Looks like that more works besides the test are required. For instance:
Will generate the overlap between colorbar and heatmap:

Thanks for jumping in! Yeah, that looks like a bug - if you can fix it while you're adding the tests that would be great!
After reviewing your PR and playing with it - this is not a bug, this is the default behavior of the plotting framework. It is the user's responsibility to provide the right amount of padding which they can. So ignore my previous comment.
Yes, I also realize it. That is just the default pad with 2% is not good for other positions. But I do plan to modify the behavior of the default pad into the following style, wdyt?
I guess this is a nice feature to help the user, but I'm not fully convinced that it's worthwhile - these defaults really depend on the font size of the left axis label, for example. What if someone changes it?  How will we know that the defaults are broken now? I guess we could write tests for the default case and ensure that there is no overlap between the different axes. But that sounds like a lot of effort for something the user might tune to their liking anyway.
Yeah, agree that the default pad size is not static. And detecting the collision between the axes then setting the pad for it sounds difficult and unnecessary. I will just leave this function as used to be.
