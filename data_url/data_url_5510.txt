In read_circuit.cpp, the function circuit_data_to_grid_of_tensors(), num_qubits is set to I * J, then num_qubits == I * J is evaluated. This raises the question of whether or not the number of qubits should be determined from the circuit data or from inputs of I and J.
The method of determining num_qubits should be set straight, whether it be from the grid or from I * J
See #103.
