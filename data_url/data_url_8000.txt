I am trying to solve the following type of  problem with time-dependent Hamiltonian;
H = H_0 - f(t) H_1
f(t) = $ A exp(-(t/sigma)^2) $
Please use the help group when the issue is not a bug or feature request.
If you want the evolution with different values of a parameter, you need to call mesolve in a loop, we don't have a way to merge the calls:
Thank you, Eric. It works.
So then this gives me the final_states as a function of time for each A in the list.
One follow-up question.
I want to extract the final_states as a function of A at a particular time. How should I code this?
result.state will return the state for all times in t.
Hi,
Sorry that I wasn't specific enough ( or perhaps articulate enough) about my question.
Here's what I wanted to ask.

No, mesolve does not loop over args.
You can obtain the list over deltas from result, but it's now a python list manipulation question, not a qutip question.
Github issues are for bug report or feature request.
It is now a python question, not a qutip question and I don't want to encourage it's use as a helpdesk so I am closing this.
