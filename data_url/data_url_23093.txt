na acquisition running. go to amplitude, change value with up/down arrows -> restarts new acquisition with new amplitude -> ok
click on sth else without new amplitude value -> restarts once more with same amplitude -> annoying
In principle, this is solved in the branch spectrum_analyzer (that I think can be merged into master)
