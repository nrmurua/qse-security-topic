In some cases, when submitting a Python job, e.g. via jsrun, it is illegal to write to a file in the XACC install directory.
The initialize() method in xacc.py always tries to open and write the .internal_plugins file.
A potential workaround is to have a check if we need to write the file (e.g. existing file with expected content) or to have this .internal_plugins file populated at install time.
When I finished building and test with the instruction given in the installation guide, i.e., python3 ../python/examples/ddcl_example.py, I also get permission error. However, I'm running on my local machine.
