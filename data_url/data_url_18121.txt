I want to demonstrate a quantum algorithm with deterministic success probability (one). This can be done with 1-shot computation on the simulator. But the current simulator will issue a warning as below:
It asks me to use local_statevector_simulator, but the local_statevector_simulator does not accept circuit with measurement, which is a contradiction.
Allow users to run simulator with shot=1 without warning.
This warning is emitted because in previous versions we had a somewhat hidden functionality that if you set shots=1 in the local_qasm_simulator, you would get the statevector in the result. Since this functionality is deprecated in favor of local_statevector_simulator, we need to have a DeprecationWarning for users coming from the old code. This will be removed after a little while (in version 0.6).
