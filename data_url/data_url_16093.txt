Plan:
Is this complete as of the 0.19 terra/0.33 qiskit release? If not, do we know what remains here?
I guess pip install qiskit is still the metapackage rather than specifically being Terra only.  If we still want to change it so pip install qiskit only installs Terra now, we'll have some weird versioning problems, since the metapackage's versioning is far ahead of Terra.
@jakelishman yeah, it's not viable to do that for the reason you've said and also the upgrade path is non-existent to do that in python packaging. This issue is just incorrect in what it's asserting. This really should be about slimming down the metapackage to not have aqua, ignis, or the ibmq provider by default. This is the wrong place to track this and also its well underway as @kdk pointed out so I'm going to close this we can always re-open it if needed.
