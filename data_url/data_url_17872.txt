We need to make it clear for a user what register is associated with what output. Also in the dag and qobj we need to make sure the rule 1 register assigned is the first one and so on
The internal where making this change in #1007
When results is done correctly the data will be a hex and then we will convert it to registers in qiskit.
Should we use first defined by user and order like
where its c2 c1 and c0. Or
closed with #1284
