Terra's Statevector class gives different probabilities than Aer's simulators, when the qubits are not ordered.
The output is:
Terra's Statevector class should give same probabilities as Aer's simulators.
Moreover, it would be good if the tests in Aer could catch such bugs:

Please fix it, so that I can finish my StabilizerState class (PR #5907) which seems to agree with Aer's simulators on the probabilities (but not with the Statevector class)
