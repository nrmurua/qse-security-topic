We already include the MS gate in Qibo, but recently, IonQ has introduced the Partially Entangled MS gate in their set of native gates. (https://ionq.com/docs/getting-started-with-native-gates)
It adds the possibility to change the angle of rotation from 0 to pi/2, and they even claim that small rotations are more accurate on hardware. We should consider adding that angle to our already available MS gate.
