Is Cirq supported on Alpine Linux? I've been using the following steps to attempt to install Cirq in an Alpine-based Docker image:
The above script produces the error:
The following required packages can not be built: * freetype, png
Modifying the script to explicitly add these packages (freetype, libpng) causes it to take considerably longer (5+ minutes) before failing with:
numpy.distutils.system_info.NotFoundError: No lapack/blas resources found.
I can provide additional error log details if needed.
Update: We were able to install using the following commands:
Might want to add other dockerfiles besides Ubuntu to demo how to install Cirq on different linux distros. Every dockerfile needs to be in it's own directory; so maybe we can have a dev_tools/docker/apline/Dockerfile e.t.c. Opinions @Strilanc ?
Edit: Have the docker directory on top-level instead?
That particular docker environment is for development I think, so it makes sense for it to be in dev_tools.
