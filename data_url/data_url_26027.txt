In dependapot actions and other certain PRs, we get consistent error from the test_api_config.py, usually with ibmq_get_provider() function, but sometimes others.
We need to update to the new IBMProvider syntax, but also clean up this API module because the dynamic loading of credentials seems to be very confusing and causing bugs. So may want to revert back to leaving credentials checks to individual packages and just handle the errors when they are thrown.
