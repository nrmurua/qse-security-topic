How can I convert a quantum circuit to and from QASM in javaScript?
We have a fork w/ some export functionality, but it isn't complete: master...adgt:Quirk:master
Yes,  The current QASM export function can only export simple data, and complex data will prompt Invalid Circuit JSON, such as adding a controller. Is there a solution? bro.
If you have the time, I'd suggest to continue with what was started and if you are able to get complete support in, then perhaps @Strilanc might accept a PR. We didn't have time to complete it when we were working on our project, so we only added what we needed.
Ok, but I don't know much about QASM's generation logic. Is there any document or website recommendation? I may improve the code in the future, thank you
The specification is here: https://openqasm.com/
Got it, let me see
I'd definitely accept a PR with a QASM export. You can alternatively use cirq as a bridge since it has from_quirk and to_qasm. Closing this as it's more of a question than a request.
