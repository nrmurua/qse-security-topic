It would nice to be able to set the default values for Sampler.sample keyword arguments on sampler construction.
Something like
Generalizes #501
See the use of embedding_parameters in EmbeddingComposite
That's exactly what **runopts in Hybrid are for -- but right now the interface is a mess and I'm working on generalization (under dwavesystems/dwave-hybrid#141). It proved to be non-trivial.
The standard terminology for this functionality seems to be feed_dict, which I personally dislike, but has permeated the tech world via TF. What about parameter_dict instead of ..._default? It's more descriptive of what is expected.
