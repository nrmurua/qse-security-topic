Currently, we only support 64 bits on Linux / MacOS / Windows 10. So we only provide precompiled packages for these platforms.
For the next release, we are going to support pip building in platforms where there's no a precompiled package (wheel package), but we cannot guarantee that everything will work.
There's a CONTRIBUTING guide with detailed instructions on how to build from soure code.
