Based on the examples, files with either the qasm or inc specifier are allowed in include, however only .qasm is included in the live specification.
I don't think it should matter. Since it's a filepath it should just be treated as QASM3 regardless of the file extension.
Well for parsing it, I don't think I should be opening up the file and adding all of it?
No, that is the responsibility of the compiler to link/preprocess.
It just seems like only one extension is allowed in the specification, but it really should be any string w/ any file type.
Yes, from a parser's perspective.
I think this should be made clearer, I can make a PR if we want about it
Sure, please see https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Include-Syntax.html.
Looks like it was clarified. Was a minor spelling error, so added PR: #105. Closing this issue.
