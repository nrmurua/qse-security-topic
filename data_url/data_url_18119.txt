qiskit failed to compile a circuit for Grover algorithms as described in this tutorial:
https://github.com/rraymondhp/qiskit-tutorial/blob/37b3229c8988bbaf1edda744de456cf195e25fc7/reference/algorithms/grover_algorithm.ipynb
qiskit v0.4.15 could compile the same program on ibmqx5 coupling map.
AssertionError that should not happen, happened.
I was able to run the notebook without issue.
Thanks for confirming this. I ran it three times: two failed and one succeeded. I suspect it is related to the pseudo-random number used in the compile?
One of the latest runs:
This is part of the output when it succeeded:
Repeating the trials for 10 times, 7 failed and 3 succeeded. So, the compile seems to be probabilistic but has high failure rate for this circuit.
Indeed, it does seem to fail often.  Even when the seed=13, which was the old default value.
Indeed 13 is an unfortunate number :-)
@nonhermitian  I fixed seed=0 and compiled successfully.
I have pulled the PR related to this issue to the qiskit-tutorial, but I think I will just leave this issue open here for references until we are sure it is addressed. However, if you want it to be closed that is also fine with me.
Fixing the seed is good.  However, Inwould still leave the issue open as it still highlights an error in the mapper.
