This is a continuation of #380.
Two major issues prevent generating a valid QASM:
gate name(params) qargs {body}
...
Only built-in gate statements, calls to previously defined gates, and barrier statements can appear in body
The following example uses two recursive calls:
The code generates the following MLIR:
After running cudaq-translate --convert-to=openqasm example.qke, the resulting QASM output is given by:
The result should be the QASM below or an equivalent. Note the removal of the leading underscores and the moving of the nvqpp__mlirgen____nvqppBuilderKernel_367535629127 gate definition to the beginning of the file:
Not a regression
No response
Fixed by #604
