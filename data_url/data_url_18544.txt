I want to be able to use Quilc as a shared library, e.g. libquilc.[so|dll|dylib]. This would serve as lighter alternative to the existing RPC server mode for users who want to use Quilc from other langauges like C or Python, especially when working on a single local machine.
As a first pass, I am proposing that this shared library should expose Quilc functionality for:
This is a small but useful set of functionality to begin working off of.
We can use sbcl-librarian to expose Quilc functionality as a shared library.
This sounds like a good blueprint for starting a C API effort with quilc. Exciting!
We'll probably want a higher level Python API to wrap this functionality as well.
