When I try to send a pulse schedule to IBMQ Jakarta in IBM Quantum Lab. I get the following error
Traceback (most recent call last):
Input In [24] in <cell line: 1>
job2.result().get_counts()
File /opt/conda/lib/python3.8/site-packages/qiskit/providers/ibmq/job/ibmqjob.py:290 in result
raise IBMQJobFailureError(
IBMQJobFailureError: 'Unable to retrieve result for job 634c09e4d31ce7a982d82517. Job has failed: Waveform memory exceeds the maximum amount of memory currently available. Error code: 8018.'
I never had this issue before. The execution has to provide me the fidelity of the output state "10".
No response
Hi @mtreinish, I'm still stuck with the same problem. Can you please help me?
Can you try different backend? This bug has been reported in the qiskit-pulse channel in our slack. This is not a Qiskit bug, but some (weird) compiler problem only occurring with the PulseQobj payload. If you attach a whole schedule to another quantum circuit as a pulse gate you can bypass pulse job and experiment works again.
Hi @nkanazawa1989 Thank you. If I'm not wrong, you say that I have to convert the pulse schedule to pulse gate and then execute the circuit at gate level? Also the only backend I have access is to Jakarta that has pulse extension.
Yes, exactly. We are going to remove pulse payload and migrate to pulse gate. The problem has been already reported but I guess the priority is not quite high.
