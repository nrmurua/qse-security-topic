Currently a NoisyOperation is initialized with two arguments ideal and real.
I wonder if it is better to use more explicit names. Some proposals:
I like option 3 with a small change - ideal_operation and channel_matrix
I wouldn't use operation because it always has to be a circuit. circuit is ok but I would prefer unitary for this - both circuits and operations have unitaries, and unitary tends to convey noiseless.
For real, I agree it's not descriptive enough. (Although I do like how ideal and real sit together.) I tend to like superoperator for this but have less strong feelings.
So, I would write-in for unitary and superoperator.
