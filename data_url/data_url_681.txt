$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/qpp_h -DEIGEN3_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/eigen3/eigensrc
works, but after I run make -j8 I get following wall of cpp errors:
Maybe by any chance it is known installation problem? I don't have admin rights, therefore I used costume directory for eigen and qpp. My directory qpp_h indeed has required headers available.
Not a dev, but commenting in case this hastens a resolution.
It looks like your compiler isn't recognising (among other things) this C++11 loop construct, though the cmake targets C++17 with some C++11 dependencies.
What compiler are you loading in your HPC environment? I believe you can add cmd-line arg --trace-expand to your cmake command above to see the decided cmake variables, including chosen compiler. The output may be helpful for the qpp devs to better understand the issue
Indeed, looks like your compiler doesn't fully support C++11 and later. Currently, qpp requires C++17.
