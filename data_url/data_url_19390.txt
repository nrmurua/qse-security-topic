When trying to get the matrix form of U1, qibo returns a single value of the exponential instead of the full 2x2 matrix.
Thanks for reporting this. Indeed when using the qibojit or qibotf backends
will give only the value of the exponential instead of the full matrix, while g.unitary will give the full matrix you expect. There are similar discrepancies for other gates such as the fSim.
This is because .matrix gives the numbers that are required by the corresponding custom operator, while .unitary always gives the full matrix representation in the computational basis. For U1 the custom operator requires only the phase because it works with indexing:
for all appropriate i.
So the short answer would be that if you use U1.unitary instead of .matrix you should get the correct matrices for all gates. However if @scarrazza agrees perhaps we should change U1.matrix to be equivalent to U1.unitary, or just remove one of the two and use a different name not accessible by user (eg. U1._matrix) for internal custom operator manipulations.
@stavros11 yes, I agree. We can probably replace .unitary with .unitary_matrix and .matrix with ._matrix, and document these changes in the docs.
Thanks for the quick response. It is a bit misleading that asking for a matrix returns something that's not a matrix. So merging both seems reasonable.
