Dear ladies and gentlemen,
Is it possible to calculate expactation values of time-dependent operators (using, for example, mesolve)?
I do not know how to evaluate <psi | O(t) | psi>, where O(t) is time-dependent and psi is the solution of the Schroedinger equation.
THe problem has been solved. Thank youuu!
