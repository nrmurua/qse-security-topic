I tried to run the getting_started.py example, but I get the error message:
I know the set_output_dir worked in previous version, because I implemented it in the Quantum Infinity. What has changed in the newest version? I'm using the latest version of the master branch (0.4).
@stanvn indeed this has changed in v0.4, see the release notes. the output directory can now be set by ql.set_option('output_dir', output_dir). This example is not a part of unittests so forgot to update it. will update it and push the changes. for now the getting started example should be:
fe4d44d has the fix. Please let me know if it fixes the issue so that i can merge.
I've tested it and it works now, thank you.

Hi Imran, first of all thanks for the quick response in addressing this issue. I took a look at the release notes of v0.4 and could not directly find it. I assume that the line you mean is
A specific example of such a change (especially if the old functionality is removed) would be highly appreciated in the future.
Also another suggestion, would it make sense to have updates like this be "hotfix" release updates to 0.4.1 (or 0.4.0.1 depending on how you want to do version numbering) ? Especially since we would like to stick to release only versions (as opposed to the latest version on branch x.
Thanks again
most welcome @stanvn and @AdriaanRol.
yes this is the line. mentioning the change. Almost all the tests use this feature and test_options.py is specifically for this.
indeed it will be 0.4.1.
