Hello! I'm trying to use the steadystate solver. When not using MKL, my program runs (albeit a bit slow). When using MKL, I get the following error message. I have tried to figure it out myself, to no avail.
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "cubicH_quantumPump_loop.py", line 54, in 
rho = steadystate(H, c_ops)
File "/home/ingrid/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/qutip/steadystate.py", line 234, in steadystate

You may want to try the development version.  However, it is saying that the MKL solver is failing with a zero pivot.  At present, it is not possible to modify the underlying parameters for the solver, but it is something I want to do.  The MKL solver is quite fast but sometimes runs into trouble.
Hi! I am facing the same problem  with steadystate solver. I am also unaware of how to "not use" MKL for the solver. Is there some settings which can be changed to turn it off?
You can set
qutip.settings.has_mkl = False
This should be addressed in Pull #801.  The only other reported instance of error when using the MKL solver was resolved when the new kwarg weighted_matching=False is used in the steady state solver.
