On the v0.63 chain I mined block 56277 without setting a merkle_root.
Seems like maybe the merkle_root should be validated if the field is present?  Reading up, it seems that the field is more useful for SPV applications that just use headers so maybe not critical now but perhaps in the future?
Fixed in PR #1382
Fix will be effective from next hard fork.
