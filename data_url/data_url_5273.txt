I was trying to install HiQsimulator on Ubuntu 16.04 according to the tutorial, however some exceptions happened when command python3 -m pip install --user . is run. Below is the terminal information.
Have you tried pip install --upgrade pip to upgrade your pip before installing?
I tried, and I was unable to upgrade pip with this command. However, I found that I can upgrade pip with sudo -H python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip.
After this, I found the below message when collecting pybind
There seems to be a Internet connection problem. It turns out that I have to access this website through VPN of my university, but not on 4G.
