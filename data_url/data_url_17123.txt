Some qiskit functions still call numpy.random.seed to set a given (integer) seed. This sets the seed globally, influencing also user's code.
Example: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/quantum_info/random/utils.py#L54
Using numpy.random.seed sets a seed globally which also impacts code on the user side. It makes it harder for the user to derandomize only specific sections of their code.
One can run the following to seed that the seed is indeed global.
The seed should be scoped to the function call.
Either use a numpy.random.RandomState generated from the given (integer) seed internally or accept it as argument. I would suggest something along the lines of what SciPy does: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/7651d17041dfa0bd7df045bd7b418d693178e0fe/scipy/_lib/_util.py#L174
This is already done in places like the StochasticSwap transpiler pass using:
and the like should be done elsewhere.
