When I start a qvm server by default it opens up on port 5000, however pyquil. For some reason starting $ qvm -S -p 5555 doesn't seem to be able to properly start the server.
I have found a work around below, but it's just a little cumbersome when running other notebooks that have been written. Not an essential issue but any help appreciated.
from pyquil import Program, get_qc
from pyquil.gates import CNOT, Z
from pyquil.api import local_qvm
p = Program(H(0), CNOT(0, 1))
qvm = get_qc('9q-square-qvm')
prog = Program(H(0), CNOT(0, 1))
#this way works
with local_qvm():
results = qvm.run_and_measure(prog, trials=10)
#but this was does not
results = qvm.run_and_measure(prog, trials=10)
Taking a step back: what problem are you trying to solve?  Why do you want to run qvm on a non-default port?
Also, if the above doesn't resolve your problem, can you post the error message you get?
Thanks!
Assuming this is solved, and closing.
