I would like to study this Pkg by reproducing the code samples from the official manual. Although I have copy the code sample 4 from the maual, I encountered an error of lim not definded. I have also looked through the first 3 samples and run them, I did not find any information about the variable lim. So I am thinking about whether the lim is a bug may because the samples are run depending on the version 0.4.1 and I am using the version 1.0.7. Following is the pic that may help you:

And this is the official maual pic:

Is there anything I neglect?
I know where the problem lies: the so called lim is actually 1im.
