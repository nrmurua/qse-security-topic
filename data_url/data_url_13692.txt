The most obvious application is adaptive extrapolation. E.g. what we also have in the paper.
It could be used also for other goals, e.g. for batching the total number of shots and scaling the circuit used in each batch in a randomized way.
The extreme limit is applying random noise at each shot. But I guess this would be very slow.
REMARK: not sure if this should be in this milestone. This is probably not urgent.
I think it's a good suggestion. I've added it to the 3rd milestone as low priority.
This is replaced by #223
