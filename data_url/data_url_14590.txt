As per documentation, Isometry instruction can be used for state preparation.
On the other hand, Initialize instruction does its work by first resetting the qubits to |0‚ü© followed by an state preparing unitary.
That means circ.initialize is equivalent to circ.reset + circ.iso.
However, I noticed that using Isometry almost always results in a circuit with much less number of CNOTs.
The result is something like that:
So, I suggest to use Isometry to implement Initialize instruction. This should lead to a better end result with less code to maintain.
Isometry and Initialize use two different algorithms to construct the circuits. Rather than replace one with the other I think it would be better to keep synthesis part of Initialize (i.e. without the initial resets) in some class in Qiskit but have QuantumCircuit.initialize use the more efficient isometry instead.
