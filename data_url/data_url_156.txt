The currently used formatting library generates a couple of warnings that have been disabled by PR #158 by introducing an additional header file that disables these warnings for the include. The warnings may go away with an update to gcc 12.2. This issue is to track coming back to that header file and see if we can eliminate it - either by a compiler update, or by using a different formatting library.
