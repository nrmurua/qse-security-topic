As soon as Colab supports 3.7, we should drop 3.6 support - this is expected within Q1 2021.
Since Colab now supports Python 3.7.10, I think it's a good time to drop support for Python 3.6.
Ooo nice! One thing I realized is that internally Google is still on Python 3.6 in a lot of places so we won't be able to drop it :(
@unaiic - thanks for pointing this out - I'm going to close this!
