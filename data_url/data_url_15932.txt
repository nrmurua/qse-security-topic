For most optimization algorithms setting np.random.seed(seed) is sufficient, but for SPSA (which is not implemented in scipy) one has to set it by hand via qiskit.utils.algorithm_globals.random_seed = seed. I couldn't find any documentation about this and had to look directly at the source code. It would be nice, if this was explained in the documentation.
It is mentioned in the algorithms introduction tutorial algorithms/01_algorithms_introduction.html but you are right, things are lacking - we had more when this was part of Aqua, but that text etc seems to have gotten lost in the migration. Essentially that seed is for a common random number generator used throughout the algorithms so an experiment is easy to seed/reproduce.
I am new to contributing and  I would love to work on this if its okay.
Sure @fs1132429 assigning to you ðŸ˜„
Hi @fs1132429 thank-you for taking on this issue, there are a few different ways you could approach this:
