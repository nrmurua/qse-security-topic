For developing code I prefer a dedicated IDE (such as spyder) over the notebook used by jupyter (or ipython). Will this be possible with qcodes?
For example, right now the qc.show_subprocess_widget() command does not work outside of the notebook environment.
At the moment the only things that require the notebook are the subprocess widget and the plots. I do most of my testing (of other things) in a bare terminal so I know it generally works, but please let me know if you find anything else that cares about it!
The subprocess widget is only necessary anyway because otherwise subprocess output (which is supposed to be just warnings and errors) gets dumped into the jupyter server terminal and mixed up with all the other messages (including other notebooks) there that users typically ignore. This generally won't be an issue elsewhere, I'd imagine.
For plots, pyqtgraph may well work fine elsewhere but I haven't tried it. matplotlib may need some tweaking (since it was made for nbagg) but likely only a little...
@eendebakpt can I close this issue, and ask you (and anyone else who uses qcodes outside jupyter) to log an issue if you run into any problems?
Live plotting, and alternative ways to monitor subprocesses, will necessarily be different in other environments. I'm happy to provide guidance on these features if anyone else cares to port the concepts... but everything else in qcodes should "just work" in any Python environment.
Ok. The tests run on python and I will open new issues if I encounter problems.
