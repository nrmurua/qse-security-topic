The reported process tomography fidelity ùñ•^{cptp}_{PT} is the fidelity of the measured process compared with the ideal process, computed imposing complete positivity (cp) and trace preservation (tp) constraints.
The current phrasing makes it too easy to confuse this notion with the concept of a process fidelity which is closely related to but different from the actually quoted average gate fidelity.
