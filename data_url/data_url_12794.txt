In the "Demo: Examining Qubit States in Q#" part of the Qubit tutorial, we have:

Where DumpMachine's results are  inconsistent with the actual state. The |1> portion of the state should have an i coefficient but it doesn't. (If I'm not wrong, the original state used to be |->)
Indeed, the i got lost when converting the example of text output to a screenshot of a visual output. We'll fix that. Thank you for catching this!
