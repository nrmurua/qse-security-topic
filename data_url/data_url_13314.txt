In resolving #1140 Raise error if executor and observable are not compatible, several tests have been found to be invalid due to use of Observables with result types other than MeasurementResultLike (bitstrings).
This issue is for replacing the invalid tests that will be removed as part of the resolution of issue #1140 .
Can be closed now that 'executors.py` allows the use of observables with density matrix results as well as measurement-like results, and tests are passing
