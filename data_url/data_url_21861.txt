At the moment, there is quite a lot of boiler plate required to add a SUServo to a build.

I do not expect users to alter any servo parameters apart from t_rtt. So, I'd prefer not to expose them in the target file definitions.
Ideally, I'd really like to have a 1-line way of adding a SU-servo to a target, which takes only eem locations and a t_rtt its parameters. cf the nice EEM classes that have been introduced.
In the docstring for the t_rtt parameter, can we note that the t_rtt >= 4 + round_trip_cable_delay/8ns and that t_rtt > ? slows down the servo iterations.
Other than that, I'm happy with the SUServo interface.
At least shift, profile, clk, are parameters worth changing as well. But the rest could be refactored into eem and add_std()
ack.
