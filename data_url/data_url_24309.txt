I think this issue occurs in part because pyEPR includes attrdict library.
Maybe open pyEPR to allow for later attrdict if possible

This looks like an issue in pyEPR, not metal - perhaps this should be added an an issue in the pyEPR repo unless this is a showstopper for metal.  @zlatko-minev thoughts?
It's a quick fix, let's just fix it; not sure it matters where we make it an issue to me
@grace-harper-ibm @zlatko-minev Was this resolved in pyEPR?
Not on my end
This has been addressed by @GyeonghunKim  and issue should be closed.
