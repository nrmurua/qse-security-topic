The issue #1747 put in evidence that the QASM dumper in DAGCircuit needs testing: DAGCircuit.qasm(self, no_decls=False, qeflag=False, aliases=None, eval_symbols=False). Currently, we have no test for any of these parameters. The tests can be placed in test/python/test_dagcircuit.py, in its own class.
This is a good first issue. If you are interested on working on this, ping me.
DAGCircuit.qasm() no longer exists.
