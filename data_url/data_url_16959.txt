There seems to be some issues with initial/final discontinuity in some pulses in the pulse library.


I was discussing with @lcapelluto that zeroed_width is also wrong in a second way. Having the zeroed_width by default be 2*(width+1) assumes that there will be a sample of buffering around the edges of the pulse. However, this is not what we want. We actually want to guruantee that the first sample of the pulse is zero and not having any buffering assumptions made. This means we really just want the zeroed_width = width by default. Which is much simpler. It is related to #3297.
So you want first sample and last sample to be 0? or just the first?
I also think I need to fix drag and gaussian_deriv.
Yes (at least by default). I think the gaussian part of drag will automatically be fixed, but there is some difficulty with the gaussian_deriv component due to its antisymmetry.
