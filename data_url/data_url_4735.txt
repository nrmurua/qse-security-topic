It would be nice to allow users to set a custom value for the tensorflow dtype if they are really pushing their simulations (and aware of the memory tradeoffs). This would be a very straightforward feature to add, most likely by adjusting backend_options to accept a dtype argument or something similar

Hey @co9olguy, I'm looking to learn some more about sf/Xanadu and get involved along the way. Looks like this issue is still up for grabs?
I see the path forward here, so I'm happy to give it a shot!
Hi @Aaron-Robertson! Yes this issue is still up for grabs if you would like to go for it :) Feel free to make a work-in-progress PR
Awesome, will do asap!
