BackendPropertyError: BackendPropertyError: 'Could not find the desired property for u1'
There should be no errors.
In this function , it uses backend_prop.gate_length('u1', qid), and same for u2, u3, which are the previous basis gates. Since the basis gates have been changed to rz, sx, this code should be updated as well. Otherwise, we cannot use this compiler.
