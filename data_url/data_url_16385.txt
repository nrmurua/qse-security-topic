Based on a discussion in #4931, there's interest in displaying pi in the text drawer as π instead of pi.
To do this on all platforms requires completion of #4900 and modifying pi_check and 24 tests.
Can I be assigned this issue please? I'd like to give it a shot, I actually think it might be a good first issue.
It's ok by me. @1ucian0 Ok by you?
Sure
ping @PaulMcElligott ! Any news?
Still working on it.
Have been busy. I'll have more time tomorrow morning.
another ping @PaulMcElligott?
Hi @1ucian0. I have managed to recreate the issue, but I'm having difficulty recreating it in a new environment. I have been following @aasfaw's episode closely. I am new to using git & anaconda.
mpl (below) subtext uses the greek letter 'π' instead of the latinized 'pi'

You might be overthinking this one.
Either inpt in pi_check can take the self.encoding as input, or you replace pi  by π after that (if the encoding allows it).
@PaulMcElligott are you still in it? can I try this one? @1ucian0
Sure! Go ahead @alejomonbar
