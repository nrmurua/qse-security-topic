Over the next few weeks I'll be adding some code to do Bayesian estimation for quantum phase estimation. This is part of a paper in production, along the lines of https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00869 but with multiple qubits and experimental error.
If anyone wants to help with checking + approving code that would be much appreciated!
Cheers,
Tom.
@jarrodmcc and I have spoken with @obriente about this and we're looking forward to the PR!
