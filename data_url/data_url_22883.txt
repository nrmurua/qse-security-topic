Has anyone gotten these outputs to work with the Lockbox module?  I am using the max_hold_no_iir branch.
Looking in output.py, it seems like it should be possible to use pwm0 and pwm1 as outputs?   i.e. pins 17 and 18 on the E2 extension connector.  Monitoring lockbox.outputs.pwm_output with the scope seems successful.  Everything seems to work and the "output_direct" of the pid module assigned to the pwm output gets set to off, like it's supposed to.
It's just that nothing comes out of pins 17 or 18.
update:  tested slow outputs using SCPI server that comes with red pitaya OS.  it works.  just not with pyrpl.
Ok from the commit history of this branch it looks like the pwms were disabled for some reason.
