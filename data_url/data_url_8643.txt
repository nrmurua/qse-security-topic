Good point.  Lets do that for the next version.

#119.
NUM_THREADS actually does not do anything as far as I can tell.  We store the number of CPUs to use in qutip.settings.num_cpus.  We can of course replace this with and environ variable, but is it needed?
You can use it to select number of processes to use, right? I think it is useful if you don't want to use all processors for a calculation, although I usually use the .qutiprc configuration file for this rather than environment variables. I guess it is not really necessary but could be useful I guess.
Every routine that uses multiple processes has a kwarg to change the number and if this is not set then it falls back on qutip.settings.num_cpus which is set in init.py

Yes, your right. And then it is potentially overwritten again in qutip.settings.load_rc_file. NUM_THREADS should override qutip.settings.num_cpus in init.py, otherwise it seems a bit pointless.
I think the priority order should be
*. Default value from qutip.hardware_info
*. Value from configuration file if exists
*. Environment variable if set
This seems to work as expected now.
