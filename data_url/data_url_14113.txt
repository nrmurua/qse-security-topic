The HoareOptimizer pass incorrectly removes CNOT gates. I think the root cause of this bug may be different from #11200 because this bug is about quantum control, not classical control.
The following Python code shows the bug:
This results in incorrect optimization:
Since the control qubit of cx q[0],q[1]; is |1> at the moment, it should not be discarded.
No response
This issue can also be reproduced with controlled-y gates:
Yeah, I'd agree, both of these optimisations just look completely unsound.  The HoareOptimizer pass has not been looked at much at all since its initial inclusion in #3185 (April 2020) and a couple of updates in #5138 (October 2020), #5135 (June 2021) and #7278 (November 2021).  It doesn't appear to have been looked at (or used!) any meaningful way in the last two years, so I'm not really clear what its status on it is.
If you're interested in contributing some fixes to it, that would be very welcome.
I'm indeed interested in contributing and can start looking into it in about two or three weeks because I'm in the middle of doing something else with Qiskit right now. If it's not urgent, I would like to work on this issue, thanks!
