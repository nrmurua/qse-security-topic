Super big nit: would be nice to have the Cirq logo show up without having to scroll down to see it :)
I suppose we could move the python2.7 stuff into a compat folder.
It looks like release.md can be moved into docs.
dev-requirements and apt-dev-requirements could go in dev_tools?
protobuf-generate might get squashed by removing the compiled protos.
It might be possible to configure travis to look for .travis.yaml inside continuous-integration. Similar for readthedocs.
MANIFEST.in might fit into dev_tools
Maybe we need a conf folder for all these config files.
I'll keep an eye out for changes to make this better during the next release.

This is impossible as the screen is cutoff at the docs directory.  Let's just keep an eye out for anything that will go to top-level in the future. This issue is not specific so i will close it.
