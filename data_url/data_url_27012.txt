It looks like currently the library names and install location differs between the legacy build and CMake build. This should be made consistent. E.g. the legacy build creates
$installdir/lib/$buildtype directories and uses names libquick.so, libquick-mpi.so, etc.
while the CMake build uses
$installdir/lib with library names libquick.so, libquick_mpi.so etc.
Module file location also seems to be inconsistent (in subdirectories of $installdir/include)
@Madu86 can we close this?
Yes, we can. The issue is not fixed but the legacy build system will retire in near future.
