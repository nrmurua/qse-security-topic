We are no longer supporting the Wigner function methods correctly.
There are four functions
We need to think about what we want to do here and make it clearer for the tutorial.

Questions do we want wigner in terra?
If so, should they be all from the plot_wigner_data or is it just an option of the plot_state?
If we keep plot_wigner_data should this be in the visualization __init__?
@levbishop can you think about this?
@markjeveritt there have been some recent updates to qiskit that have made your wigner function code fall out of sync. Do you have time to take a look and see whether it can be updated? Thanks!
@mtreinish can we remove the Wigner functions. Then let's add them to the tutorial to give an example. I think they are not used enough to keep them in sync in the main repo.
