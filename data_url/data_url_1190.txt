Description of the issue
I'm having issues trying to run some of the slow checks. I think it is because I am missing IRawChecker. Is there a way i can install this custom package or a work around?
Cirq version
1.3.0.dev
Result from running:
./check/pytest
@shef4 - please make sure you setup your development environment according to https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/main/docs/dev/development.md#setting-up-an-environment
if there is still a problem, please post a step-by-step instructions including your Python environment setup.
Also, per @NoureldinYosri comment this may be a problem with pylint installation or having a different version installed.
Can you check if the following works?
likely related to #6351
@pavoljuhas I'm not sure if this should be in a different area but wanted to share it for newer contributors. If you have any recommendation please lmk else thanks for the help!
After installing all necessary dependencies, the rest of the development cycle steps can be completed in a Jupiter notebook. This helps streamline your work as such:
@shef4 this looks like a nice addition to your personal blog if you have one. If you don't have one maybe you should :D
@NoureldinYosri Thanks, means a lot! I don't have one but that sounds like the perfect place for info like this.
@shef4 - one thing to keep in mind when working with Jupyter notebooks is that code changes are not reflected in the live sessions for any code that was already imported.  In such case, you'd need to restart the kernel and re-run notebook cells as needed.  It is also preferable to separate one-time setup (ie, installation in editable mode, installation of all package dependencies) from a test code that would be executed over and over again.
Circling back to the original subject - do you still get the ImportError for IRawChecker after following development.md to setup your environment?
If so, please reopen this issue with more detail on how to reproduce the error.  Thank you!
