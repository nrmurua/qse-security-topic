When creating a linked copy of a program (e.g., when calling the compiler), the register references are retained. Gate parameters may contains MeasuredParameter objects, which are used as placeholders for mid-circuit measurements. They contain register references to the registers that are measured, and thus have to be kept in the linked copy.
Currently, the circuits are referenced in the linked copy, rather than copied. Expected behaviour would be that only the register references are retained, while the rest of the circuit (parameters, etc.) should be copied.
Above: the program circuit should be equal but not the same.
Every time a program is copied.
