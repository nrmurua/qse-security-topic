Not sure when the move was made, but I see now a lot of 404s when referencing QCoDeS pages.
e.g. https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/api/instrument/index.html gives a 404

and it looks like everything is moved to microsoft.github.io/...
Could we maybe add redirects from qcodes.github.io/Qcodes to microsoft.github.io/Qcodes?
Unfortunately a straightforward redirect based on CNAME etc is not possible with github pages however each html page should now be redirected using a Jekyll layout. The code doing the redirect lives in
https://github.com/QCoDeS/qcodes.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/redirect.html
https://github.com/QCoDeS/qcodes.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml
and
a copy of the qcodes source where each page html page is replaced by a blank page containing only a reference to the redirect layout. This will unfortunately not handle intersphinx objects.inv files but I think this is the bese we can do given the limitations of ghpages
For reference the blank pages were generated with
from a copy of the existing qcodes docs
amazing. thanks! :)
