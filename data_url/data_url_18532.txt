This contrived program implements a fixed-count loop using Quil's classical control flow instructions:
When we compile this program with quilc, we get:
The JUMP-UNLESS instruction gets inverted into a JUMP-WHEN instruction with a new target specified, but that target has no associated label in the program, making it an invalid target to jump to.
After seeing the above result, I tried simplifying the program by inverting the JUMP-WHEN instruction myself:
Unfortunately, quilc still produces an incorrect result:
In this case, quilc adds a target without an associated label and adds an extraneous jump and label to the program.
