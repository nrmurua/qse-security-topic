And in some cases long past (I noticed while reviewing the decorators change to the latest in #9864)
With the algorithms transferred over to qiskit-algorithms this old deprecated logic was removed there ahead of qiskit-algorithm's first release. As all the code here in Qiskit in qiskit.algorithms is deprecated, with users being instructed to upgrade/move to/install/use qiskit-algorithms, I am just going to close this off here as removing a couple of minor prior deprecated bits of code when the whole is now deprecated seems like an exercise in busy work with no real net value.
