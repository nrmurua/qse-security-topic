Current Problem
No ability to see all lowest energy solutions from hybrid output from D-Wave.  For example, from LeapHybridSampler/HSS or from Kerberos.  Do not want to see samples whose energy exceeds the lowest energy.
Proposed Solution
Give the user an option to chose all lowest energy samples as the output.  This will mean that D-Wave has established a means to detect and display all lowest energy samples, and display only those.
Alternatives Considered
None
Additional context
None
Are you looking for something like SampleSet.lowest()?
lowest() is a method on the result object (SampleSet), and it's documented in dimod, where SampleSet is implemented. For other methods, check SampleSet docs.
