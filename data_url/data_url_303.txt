There seems to be more things a play in test/NVQPP/sudoku_2x2-1.cpp (#323). In the following code, the optimizer is unable to unroll the loop. I tried to isolate the cause by creating kernels that only had a similar loop, but on simpler cases the loop was successfully unrolled.
Compile the above program and try to run it. It will report:
I expected the compiler to unroll this loop and correctly execute the program.
Not a regression
No response
It looks like this is the result of inlining being done before the loops are unrolled.
