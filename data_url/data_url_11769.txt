Generating Oracle circuit using Truth table give a wrong circuit for some bitstring values
example here  below :
bitstr = '0001'
oracle = TruthTableOracle(bitstr)
oracle.circuit.draw(output='mpl')

Can be reproduced using bitstring="1000"  or bitstring "0001"
We would have expected the circuit below :
(Note that using logical  "LogicalExpressionOracle"  and expression = 'And(v[0], v[1])') we get the correct circuit )

@patdenim many thanks for catching this!
@hushaohan . I just realized that i didn't append the correct circuit
It  should be

i guess you already noticed it
