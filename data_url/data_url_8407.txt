It would useful to have the option of generating a random Qobj (like rand_unitary) using a seed, so that one is able to vary other parameters in the code and see the effect for a specific random Qobj.
I think this is a great idea. It makes results of an experiment easily reproducible and there is no need to log literally all data, all we need to keep is the initial seed.
I believe the pull request is ready to be merged.
