#2542 pointed out that "Qudits" is missing from the menu and readthedocs says it's displaying the docs for e8f9323b (the hash of the commit tagged v0.5.0).  Also the title of the page is "Cirq: A python library for NISQ circuits â€” Cirq 0.5.0 documentation"
@Strilanc Do you need to tell readthedocs the new stable version?
Fixed by removing TensorFlow dependency.
