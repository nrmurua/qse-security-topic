The transpiler pass BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements is currently run before RemoveDiagonalGatesBeforeMeasure in the level3 preset pass manager. RemoveDiagonalGatesBeforeMeasure won't optimize across a barrier (even if it was inserted by another pass, and not by the user) and so final diagonal gates are not removed.
Update the level3 pass manager to run the optimization passes RemoveResetInZeroState and RemoveDiagonalGatesBeforeMeasure prior to the embedding stage.
This may also be a good time to:
Though each of these could just as well be individual issues/PRs.
Is this already fixed? The current (master) output for the OP's example is:
Feel free to reopen otherwise.
Looks like this is still an issue (but some changes to the default levels have made it harder to replicate). Most likely, the changes to the level 3 layout selection pass in #3999 mean that for level 3, we now find a perfect layout for the example circuit, so the routing stage is skipped and BarrierBeforeFinalMeasurements is never run.
I'm able to still reproduce the issue by specifying an initial_layout
