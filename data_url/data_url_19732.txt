The readout error mitigation filter returns counts in binary like format, e.g.
When saving such results using pickle and loading them again, the validation raises an issue because it is expecting hex format.
The pickle file should load.
Have the readout error mitigation module return counts in hex format.
Code to reproduce
Then showing
and
Will reveal that the counts are in a different format. The mitigated counts will be in binary format while the original result will display hex.
@chriseclectic Should we convert the binary counts into hex when creating the mitigated result?
This bit of code is the issue in class MeasurementFilter()
since new_counts are in binary format. We could convert the keys to hex but I'm wondering if this would pose a problem for results when states like |2> are involved?
At the moment the Result object internally stores counts in hex format, as this is what is in the result schema spec. They are only converted to bit-strings when you call the get_counts method. So I suppose for the filter updating the result object it should use the same format (hex) so the output is still a schema valid result.
In principle hex counts could be converted to any base strings (via going to int then custom dit-string) if we allow more than 2-outcome measurements in the future, but the dimension information would have to come from header/config or somewhere.
Closing since this no longer seems to be an issue as of Qiskit 0.19
