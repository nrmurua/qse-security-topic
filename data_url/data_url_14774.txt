According to @liupibm:
Given two circuits, check whether their final amplitude vectors V1 and V2 are equivalent: they differ only in the global phase, i.e., the equation V1E^(Ix)=V2 has a solution.
This is useful for debugging transpiler passes also.
As in the last one this goes on hold until we are ready to scientifically discuss this. Can you put this back on hold or make it in a roadmap for qiskit 0.8. We will have an equivalence checker but after the transpiler is complete.
This is being done in Aer now.
reopening as the API to interact with the equivalence checker may end up in Terra
