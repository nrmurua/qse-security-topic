There is room for improvement in the way qiskit prints debugging info.
In the current situation some API calls have a silent argument (eg. QuantumProgram.compile ) and some other calls have a verbose argument (eg. _mapping.swap_mapper), with opposite meaning.
Debugging is already painful enough :) A better logging system would also make easier to get debug infor for bug reports. Something like logging is probably the way to go.
Hi Luciano, I already have filed an issue (#88) about this. You are right, it's a low priority bug and we think it's a good candidate for new contributors.
