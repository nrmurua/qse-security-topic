The documentation for the fluxonium class states that,
Here, flux is given in dimensionless units, in the form 2\pi\Phi_\text{ext}/\Phi_0
However, the 2pi are hard-wired into the implementation of the operators.
If I am not mistaken, this means, that flux should be given in Units of $Phi_\text{ext}/\Phi_0 $(without the 2pi). At least for my implementation I had to divide the flux by 2pi in order to show the expected results.
Maybe I am just confused, since my definition differs by a factor of 2pi from the definition used in scqubits, but I still think one should have a look at it.
Indeed, that factor 2pi was incorrect in the documentation. This should be fixed now (and reflected on RTD). I found and took care of two additional occurrences in the documentation for the two zero-pi classes.
