Hi all,
I'm working on packaging Cirq for Nix (https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs), and running into a few test issues (NixOS/nixpkgs#78779, NixOS/nixpkgs#78779 (comment)). Everything else seems to work.
I started working on it before the 0.7 release, so that's why it's behind. I tried a basic bump to 0.7 but it raised even more issues (can discuss in separate issue).
I have failing tests on cirq/google/op_serializer_test.py. See below for details. Seems to be issue when comparing boolean types, and I'm just not familiar with protobuf to debug it. Seems to fail on both protobuf=3.8 & 3.7. (condensed duplicate failures)
Thanks in advance!

@drewrisinger Maybe it's your python version? Check for other configs.
Not sure why this is not failing for us, but this looks like your version of the protobuf parser does not like numpy bools.
I think this could be fixed by casting appropriately to bool in https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/google/arg_func_langs.py#L131
Note that we just release cirq 0.8, so it may be a bit before we get this fixed and in the next release.  (also thanks for getting this in Nix!)
I believe this is now fixed, but you will need to wait for Cirq 0.9.  If it is not fixed, please reopen.
Thanks for the fix. I can test it against that commit actually. Will report back
Tested working with that commit on 0.7.0 & 0.8.0. Much appreciated @dabacon!
