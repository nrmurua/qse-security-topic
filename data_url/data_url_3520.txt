Hi,
I am now trying to use pyquil, but from the documentation I find that I need to get an API first. It says that on your website (https://www.rigetti.com/) I can sign up to get one. I entered my email and enterprise, and received an email saying that I am in the waiting list. But till now I still have not get the API token.
So what else can I do?
Thank you so much!
Oh I have found it out myself. After sign up, the token can be created using this link: https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens
@yangjy0826 Sorry for the confusion but the latest pyQuil doesn't require an API key. The latest docs to obtain our SDK can be found here: https://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Thank you for your reply! I find in this link that I need to install the QVM and Compiler, but it is only for Linux and MacOS, right? How about Windows? Thank you!
