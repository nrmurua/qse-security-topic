For the following code,
The evolution does not have the time step for clocks = 0. It would be better to have the clock = 0 time step as well, i.e., to make the clocks and density1 having the same length.
If I do clocks = [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3], the simulation can run, but the results look weird; density =[0.0  0.345492  0.904508  0.904508], somehow the last two numbers are the same, but I think they shouldn't.
The result is correct, you can check this by brute forcely apply exp(im*t*H)*st:
We need to follow the same convention as DiffEq's iterator, otherwise this is not consistent with each other, so we shouldn't include the first point here since DiffEq doesn't
