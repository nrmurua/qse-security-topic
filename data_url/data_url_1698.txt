Description of the issue
SingleQubitCliffordGates write incomplete information to JSON, and their type cannot be understood by the JSON deserializer.
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
0.10.0
This is because SingleQubitCliffordGate is not yet serializable
However, I think we should try to enforce that objects which are not yet serializable throw an error instead out producing incomplete json.
That would be seem a step in the right direction. Also would be nice if this was clear in the documentation somewhere (instead of only called out in test files).
I would like to work on this issue.

At this point you might be ready to commit, and create a pull request, but ping us if you run into issues.
Thanks!
This has been idle for a while. Would you mind if I take a shot at it?
Yes, please take it. I will be able to contribute to Cirq from the month of September.
