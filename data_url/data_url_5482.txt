@benjaminvillalonga - I have a question about this. Is it actually necessary to allocate a vector of length K-1 below? As far as I can tell, only 2 of these are ever used.
Pushed a commit to fix this.

Is there any reason for a grid coordinate to be a vector instead of a pair?
Something similar needs to be done with google_circuit_file_to_grid_of_tensors as well.
