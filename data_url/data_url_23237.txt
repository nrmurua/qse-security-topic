I am not sure whether it is a bug or a "feature", but the following works fine:
pyrpl.c.foo.bar = 4 # if foo and bar are already existing
this works fine as well
pyrpl.c.foo["bar"] = 4 # #even if bar did not exist before
On the other hand, this never works:
pyrpl.c["foo"]["bar"] = 4 # even if foo and bar exist
Moreover, it doesn't throw any error, and even worst, it gives the wrong impression that the data has been stored properly, eventhough the file hasn't been touched at all... I find this very misleading...
Also, it is not clear to me how to create new branches: it seems that you have to do:
pyrpl.c["foo"] = dict() # I would have expected something like pyrpl.c._new_branch("foo")
completely changed. fixed now
