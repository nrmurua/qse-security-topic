Symmetry verification technique - 2 methods introduced in this paper depending on the gate set and device connectivity (see Fig 1, 2). Note that symmetry verification does not do better than symmetry expansion.
This method will probably re-use some functions from the quantum subspace expansion technique.
Closing this for now because the chosen paper introduces a quantum error detection method not an error mitigation method.
The circuits used to verify the symmetry only checks if noise has shifted the eigenspace or not. If it is, then the circuit is discarded whereas we want a method that checks the symmetry & also closely approximates a recovery operation.
