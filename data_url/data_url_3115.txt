When aiming for repeatable simulation results, the wavefunction simulator itself supports a random seed. However, this is not carried through to the sample_bitstrings method of the Wavefunction class, and so sampled measurements of the wavefunction to not provide seeded repeatability.
Recommend the Wavefunction class be updated to accept a random seed, and it to be seeded on creation with something derived from the seed given to the wavefunction simulator.
None.
See linked issue #1258 for recommended fix for both these issues.
