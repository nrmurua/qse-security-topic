Considering most of the accepted enhancement proposals so far have been in docs, I think it's better to link to another template in docs.
It would also be better to avoid the confusion between RFC and MEP by updating the documentation. I propose keeping both the md and doc versions just in case.
The md template also has a missing link to another MEP.

Sounds good to me!
