The HybridSchrodingerFeynmanSimulator seems to fail when there is a SWAP gate present. It gives Assertion failed: (targets.size() == 2), function getDD, file Operations.hpp, line 240. The error disappears as long as you remove the SWAP line.
The simulation results should be returned
Thank you for creating the issue! From the top of my head, I would guess that the splitting the circuit between two targets is not supported in the decomposition. I'll have a look.
