When using the wide interface and DMA, RTIO collisions
The experiment runs without issues, and produces the correct RTIO events.
The ARTIQ console reports "artiq.coredevice.comm_kernel:collision(s) reported during kernel execution".
Kasli logs:
Analyser dump:
Note these events are not distributed 1us apart. In fact, the 2nd to 4th all have the same timestamp!
This seems like it may be related to #1521
Some additional comments here:
The for _ in range(16): loop is not actually needed here. If we leave it off, we can see that the core analyser contains 18 additional RTIO events! Which is, assumedly, the cause of the collision.
This only occurs when creating a "full" DMA frame. Sending less than 512 bytes (for instance, with (admittedly absurd) self.fastino.set_group_mu(0, [0] * 15)) only produces one RTIO event and no collisions.
It looks like there's an off-by-one error in the RawSlicer - will submit a PR.
