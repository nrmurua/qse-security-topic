The DistinguishUnitaries Kata doesn't currently have all the problems from Microsoft Q# Summer 2020 Warmup Contest and Main Contest. Should we add them to this Kata?
If so, I wouldn't mind working on adding the problems as new Tasks.
Yes, I need to add them - I have them in Kata format already (that's my default development format for the new tasks), it's a matter of me sitting down and adding them to the already existing tasks. I should be able to get to it some time next week.
