Consider this example:
If you adding an image applet you will find the test.image is refreshing very slow (slower than 0.1 s).
This will be much more clear if you increase size. The applet would keep updating long after terminate request.
So is there a limit on the broadcast speed? Is it possible to speed it up?
The current code isn't optimized (e.g. a lot of it is in plain - slow - interpreted Python), so it is certainly possible to speed it up. But someone has to study and implement the best ways to do it, it's not trivial.
