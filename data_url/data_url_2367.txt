ParamResolver is a class that adds nothing beyond Dict[str, float] except a value_of method that does this:
I suggest we move this logic into the resolve_parameters protocol (if it's not already there) and then delete the ParamResolver class.
SG. I guess resolving symbolic formulas would also follow into this protocol?
Yes
+1. This class just makes parametrization more opaque for new users in my experience
We haven't had objections to this proposal, removing proposal from title.
At Cirq Cync it was decided we should do this.
Update from 2021: this is no longer desirable IMO. The ParamResolver class includes a memoization scheme for rapid resolution of previously-encountered mappings, which would not be possible if functionality were moved to cirq.resolve_parameters.
+1 to what @95-martin-orion said. Also, having our own wrapper around Dict gives us a place to document that ParamResolver is supposed to be immutable (or to enforce immutability in some way a la #4329).
