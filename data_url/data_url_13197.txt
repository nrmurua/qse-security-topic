It would be great to add a brief PEC tutorial to the documentation in the form of a .myst file so that it shows up in the examples index page.
I propose to simplified version of the PEC section of the research workload contained in existing supporting material for this paper. For simplicity I suggest using an IBM Fake device as backend.

hi @vprusso I added this to milestone 0.21, which closes a week from today Nov 30. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help get this closed by then ðŸ™‚
Sounds good! I will put up a draft. Any input/tweaks/etc to that draft would be much appreciated once I put up a PR. Thanks, @Misty-W !
