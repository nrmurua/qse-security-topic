Hi thanks for your interest and apologies for the slow response! We are currently in the process of reorganising the Qiskit Tutorials, archiving this repo and moving the existing tutorials to the main qiskit repo or other appropriate projects. During this transition we will be focusing on maintaining/improving our existing content and are not able to take submissions for brand new tutorials at this time
In this case, the material mentioned in this issue already belonged to a different project: https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-finance, I would suggest you to re-open this issue in qiskit-finance if you still find it relevant.
Thanks anyway for your feedback and helping us make Qiskit better! ðŸš€
