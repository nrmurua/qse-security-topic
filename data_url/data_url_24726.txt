For example executing ln[2] in notebook: .../doc/source/examples/03PointPulse.ipynb raises the following error:
NotImplementedError('Can only plot waveforms without branching so far.')
File "...\qctoolkit\pulses\plotting.py", line 33.
Thanks for bringing this to my attention. Seems like I broke the master branch.
