I noticed in the adder.qasm example that multiple qubits can be declared at once (https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm/blob/master/examples/adder.qasm#L20). I assume this is more generally true that one can do type identifier1[size1], identifier2[size2], ..., identifierN[sizeN]. I think this should be made explicit.
Dup of #106
