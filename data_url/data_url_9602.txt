Could seq.declare_channel('ch0', 'raman_local') be replaced by something like this
(or using Constants instead of Channels)
I think this would make the project a bit more robust and also easier to use as autocomplete in IDEs would pick these up.
This one is not so simple, because the channel's specs change between devices. When you choose the raman_local channel, you are effectively saying you want the channel named raman_local of the device chosen for this Sequence (in this example, Chadoq2). So, in fact, there can be multiple raman_local channels with different characteristics.
The way it is currently done, you're supposed to not need to look into the device because of the Sequence.available_channels property, which fetches and filters the devices available for declaration.
I admit I'm not a big fan of the solution we came up with, particularly when it comes to using strings to identify the channels, but I still think it's the best one so far.
Closing this issue, as the channels can't be static as suggested.
