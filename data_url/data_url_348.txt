After #152 gets merged.
As a added task for this one, once these types are added to the bridge, please add a deprecated tag to qreg and qspan.
I believe this should be qvector, qarray, and qview. For the next release make sure the compiler generates an error message; we will not support these quite yet.
Error messages are produced for qvector<>, qarray<c>, and qview<>. (Setting the level value to > 2 also causes error diagnostics, but a lot more of them.
Target release X for an implementation of these.
