The doc directory seems to have api reference, but it isn't included in any toctree. Additionally it should provide an overview page for grabbing overview of the framework at a glance.
I'd like to send pull request for this later, if you allow it.
Thank you. Please send pull request.
The fix is merged into master and the build is now successful on Read the Docs.
