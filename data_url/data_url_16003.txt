The confidence_interval of the Max Likelihood Amplitude Estimator is already rescaled. The confidence_interval_processed is rescaled twice. This does not happen for example with the Iterative Amplitude Estimator
Run a Max Likelihood Amplitude Estimator with a post processing function
Have the confidence_interval not rescaled, and the confidence_interval_processed only rescaled once
I haven't seen where the bug is
The same problem happens with AmplitudeEstimation too
