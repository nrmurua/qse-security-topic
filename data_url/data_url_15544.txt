I am having trouble evaluating operators built from composed ops and list ops.  I keep getting the error:
ValueError: Cannot compute overlap with StateFn or Operator if not Measurement. Try taking sf.adjoint() first to convert to measurement.
Copy/paste and run the code block below:
Should be able to get the expectation value of the operator.
No response
I think you're not using the opflow instructions correctly here:
If you change the code as follows it seems to work:
Thank you for the observation!  I see now how to do this.
But I keep getting unexpected results!  For example for the code below:
No matter what parameters I use, it always gives results:
[0j, 0j]
My understanding is that the code creates a circuit, puts the qubits in superposition via Hadamard, entangles them via CNOT and rotates around x axis in Bloch sphere.
Shouldn't I get non-zero results here?
Thanks again!
Hmm I think the expectation value is correctly 0 as the Pauli Z operator you measure against introduces a phaseflip and makes the states orthogonal. To get a non-zero result, try rotating the qubit states e.g. around the Y-axis with the QuantumCircuit.ry method.
Since opflow was removed in #11111 and no longer supported, I think this issue is now obsolete.  Thanks for the discussion, and feel free to re-open if I've missed anything.
