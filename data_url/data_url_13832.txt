In Gate subclasses, the parameters control, target, and phase appear in that order, whenever two or more of them apply to a gate.
The ParityPhase gate, however, has the parameters in the order phase then targets (note the plural).
The FSim gate has the parameters in the order theta, phi, control, target.
Based on the other gates, I would've expected the parameters for these to be ordered as targets then phase, and as control, target, theta, and phi, respectively. Then the unwritten rule would be "control if it exists, one or more targets, followed by one or more phases".
(Since ParityPhase and FSim are more complex, there may very well be a good design reason to order the parameters differently for them, but in that case, the reason should be documented and explained.)
Since gates is a starred parameter, it has to appear last. The other option would be for that parameter to take in a list, in which case it would also be different from the other gates, so I think for ParityPhase it is fine.  FSim does not have a reason to be different from the other gates and hence could be cleaned up.
If the phases always appeared first, then the Gates could be curried, but I guess it's too late to do that now.
