Firstly, I must admit that this is a great library. Thanks a lot!
Secondly, I have a few questions:
There are no current plans to convert Cirq to javascript.
In terms of inter-operability with other quantum languages, Cirq already has output to QASM and plans to have interoperability with quil.
@dstrain115 Ok, thanks for the information!
Closing as resolved.
Hey @ArturJS. We kind of have this. We support Quirk. See https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/tree/master/cirq/contrib/quirk.
I reopened this issue so you can try out the Quirk support. Please let us know if it does what you are looking for.
@vtomole Wow, didn't know about that.
I'm gonna try out it the next week, when I have spare time for implementing a small prototype with this.
Thanks!
I think the goal of ArturJS would be to fully run Cirq in the browser as a webassembly package.
Would be interesting to see working, and pyodide certainly would help. Performance of Cirq would however be unknown, but maybe not really a dramatic decrease. With eg Quirk as frontend the use cases would exist.
For example, I ported pyzx to pyodide and experimented with combing in the browser C++ code for circuit compilation to use quirk as frontend. All code below still experimental.

@alexandrupaler Thanks a lot for the useful links!
Btw, I've found one more)
https://github.com/joastbg/quant-js
Indeed there are more projects doing quantum-something with webassembly. A useful use case could be where GUI and framework are joined.
@alexandrupaler Yeah, cannot wait when I have time to connect this with https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum
Hope it will exponentially decrease the time for at least some machine learning approaches in the near future =)
@ArturJS I do like the idea of having a https://www.tensorflow.org/js combined with Cirq.js or something. As @dstrain115 said, we currently don't have the resources to get into this. If you want to implement it, that would be awesome.
@vtomole
" https://www.tensorflow.org/js combined with Cirq.js" - hmm, sounds very interesting =)
I'll create a basic setup for the project and will let you know about the progress.
