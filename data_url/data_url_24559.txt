Cirq: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq
A python framework for creating, editing, and invoking Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits
From current understanding: Allows the implementation of a Device class which takes a quantum circuit defined in cirq, transforms it into hardware specific representation (and executes it?)
We could consider implementing such a Device class for qc-toolkit to have a first nice integration of qct with other (higher-level) software frameworks.
First step would be to find out how exactly Cirq works and if integration make sense, then discuss if/how we want to approach this (possibly thesis topic project?).
