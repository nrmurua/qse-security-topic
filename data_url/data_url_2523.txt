Right now the compute_displays_sweep methods are only tested via a test on an impl.  This can cause a problem if the interface needs to be refactored, in that the impl may satisfy the contract that the methods need, but the interface may no longer obey that contract.  Adding a single test for the methods that rely on the abstract classes will avoid that and make refactoring code safe and easier.
Is this about adding a test for compute_displays_sweep in SimulatesIntermediateWaveFunction class?
I think @dabacon means that we should have tests that take a proposed implementation and exercise it to verify that they satisfy the interface's contract. For example, we have generic gate tests that check that things like _unitary_ and _decompose_ are returning consistent results.
Displays are no longer supported.  Closing.
