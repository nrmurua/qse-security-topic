In qiskit/validation/base.py, function check_types: currently, if n_qubits or memory_slots are of type numpy.int64, then an error is triggered, because type int is expected.
I find it too strict. Especially considering that if the number of qubits is originated in a numpy array, then its default type is numpy.int64. Terra can allow additional types, or convert the type internally.
Good catch @yaelbh . Do you mind write a small snippet to illustrate the issue? We can add it as a test.
I'm not sure how the validation checks, but for a straight up type check you can use isinstance(obj, (int, np.integer)) or np.issubdtype(type(obj), np.integer) to work for both python and numpy int types.
I think the issue here is the delayed the fail. qr = qk.QuantumRegister(n) should failed because n is not an int.
Follow the duck typing philosophy, I think the right approach is to try to cast to int before failing. See #2288
