Some of the fields in the covalent/executor/base.py module are missing Type hints. This issue is to ensure that all the fields have type hints.
I would be happy to add a PR. I looked at the code, considering the Optional[str] fields' default value is an empty str, I think Optional could be dropped. Would you agree?
Hi @sayandipdutta ! Yeah, I agree with you. Plus since we are handling the empty string cases in respective places where they are being used we can remove the Optional part from these type hints.
I am not sure if I should update VERSION and CHANGELOG over this.
