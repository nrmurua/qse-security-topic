Button should call the get_analog_offsets-function here: 
A temporal quick fix is to enter the string get_analog_offsets in the 'function_call'-field of a new lockbox stage, hit 'go to stage' when the function should be called (i.e. laser is off, etc.), and then delete that stage so it does not interfere with the locking sequence when the laser is back on.
