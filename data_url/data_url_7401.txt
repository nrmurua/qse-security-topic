QHack allows participants to submit a PR for a new feature to any open source project. As the defacto Quantum Computing package for julia, there may be interest in contributing to the Yao ecosystem. Thus, it might be prudent to direct potential participants to issues or FRs which need to be implemented. Preferably, we could set up a website with a small description of what and how we want features to be implemented, so we can benefit more from contributors.
Hi thanks for your interest, we are currently putting this version under maintenance mode and hopefully deliver a refactored version next year. So it's always welcome to submit bug fixes or small feature implementations (as listed in the issue) for now, you can pick any of them or anything you think is cool and propose that. But we won't have a more ambitious roadmap in public recently until these refactor is done.
EasyBuild might be a good place for people to contribute? Even if there is internal refactors, APIs shouldn't change so drastically that such high level things require changes?
yeah, EasyBuild is a good place to contribute, the surface API won't change much, and at least easy to transfer from.
