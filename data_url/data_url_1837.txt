Hey folks (specifically @balopat),
I noticed you tried using treebeard for testing example notebooks and that it hasn't exactly gone smoothly (context).
Just wanted to encourage you to leave me a list of problems, frustrations, suggestions, and any other feedback I can use for prioritising work on my end (here or in gitter/issues).
Hey @alex-treebeard, I like the reachout :) I like treebeard. But then the specific use case here convinced me that it wasn't a fit (at least for now), so I ended up rolling my own driver for the notebook tests. Specifically:
Other than that treebeard was super easy to get started and provided a very pretty output, that would have been very useful. I might still use it for the "jupyter user journey" that we want to support: when the user checks out the repo and uses the cirq code itself in a Jupyter notebook.
Thanks so much for the writeup.
I can see how much work you put into this testing setup so I'd like to get your feedback in a few days after I put in some fixes on my end as I reckon this is a great case study for my project.
Will follow up on your fork.
