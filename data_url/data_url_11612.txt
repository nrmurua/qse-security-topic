I am trying to run molecular models on a HPC system. However, while the various parts seem to work as intended on my personal laptop, the part of the code intended to solve the problem classically causes a Segmentation Fault. Run from the console, the code returns a Segmentation fault on the line "result = algo.run()" . Run from Jupyter Lab, the kernel dies.
The below code is adapted from the qiskit-aqua test code "qiskit-aqua/test/aqua/test_numpy_eigen_solver.py". When this was run
On the HPC system, the script returns
The code works as intended on my personal computer, printing
Given this is only a 2 qubit problem I do not know what might be happening. Its not something that has ever been reported before. Is there any more information around the fault and where it occurs that might help. Did you try perhaps looking at numpy & scipy versions you have installed to see if there is any newer version that perhaps might help.
All packages are the most recent versions available via Conda
Have discovered that the SegFault occurs in environments with the version of scipy that is installed automatically with qiskit, scipy 1.5.1
It does not however occur if I directly install SciPy with Conda, which installs SciPy 1.5.0 . With 1.5.0, the code functions as intended
I am not sure what is causing the 1.5.1 to be pulled in when you install qiskit - the version we have listed says >1.4.0. Normally it would only install if the version already there did not meet the requirements unless some dependent we use needs a newer version. Anyway, certainly it can be better that the versions installed via Conda are used when that it being used, as the native libraries will have been compiled to be compatible so that the installs work together correctly.
Since you seem to have a solution I will close this issue.
