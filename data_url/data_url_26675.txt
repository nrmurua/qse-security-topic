I get build failures on 32bit x86 for v8.1:
See e.g. https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=cp2k&arch=i386&ver=8.1-1&stamp=1609432216&raw=0 (but happens on 32bit ARM as well)
This used to be a warning already, maybe this is due to Debian unstable now using gcc-10/gfortran-10. From https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=cp2k&arch=i386&ver=7.1-5&stamp=1605443143&raw=0:
Ah, it's because I dropped -fallow-argument-mismatch from FCFLAGS due to #1255 (comment) I will put it back in, but the question is, is this a bug or expected on 32bit arches?
@mbanck I haven't looked into it, but my guess is that plan should be of type int(c_intptr_t) or type(c_ptr) instead of an int(8) to match the C side, similar to  #1242
Fixed via #1705.
