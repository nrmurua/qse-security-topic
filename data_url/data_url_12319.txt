Hello,
I am trying to install tensor flow Quantum but having an error No module named 'tensorflow_quantum'. What's the solution?

Making colab a supported version I have found to be unreliable. It seems to sometimes work and not work for reasons I can not determine (e.g. #782). I have since stopped using colab + TFQ because of these issues.
