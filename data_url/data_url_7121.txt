Currently control nodes apply to entire columns and are dragged around separately from gates. This is not ideal: it forces extra columns when doing independent CNOTs, it adds extra clicks and drags for moving things around, and internally the way it affects the tensor product is... "unique".
Current ideas to improve:
It's limiting to not be able to put independent CNOTs in the same column, but interacting with the control as if it were a gate makes it so much easier than having a separate interaction. Going to leave it like it is for now.
