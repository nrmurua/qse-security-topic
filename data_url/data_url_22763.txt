Put in FAQ:
import serial.tools.list_ports
import pprint
pprint.pprint(serial.tools.list_ports.comports())
or just python3 -m serial.tools.list_ports -v
Done in 7821d0f
The purpose of this is to use serial numbers, not /dev/ttyUSBX nodes.
Ack, fixed in f0dddd9
Still not clear and users already know how to list their serial ports (ls /dev, dmesg, windows control panel, etc.). So the FAQ entry should be entitled "...determine the pyserial URL to attach to a device by its serial number".
Ah yes you're right, it's not clear : fixed in c381102
Sorry about that.
