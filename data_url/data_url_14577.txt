Gradient.convert raises an error with an operator with parameters.
I tried the following code with main branch and #6847, but both raise an error.
output
Does Gradient support parameterized operators? If not, it might be good to raise an error when Gradient.convert detects the input operator contains Parameter.
Hm I think this is a problem with symengine thinking (correctly) that a might be complex. If you change the code to this it should work:
Like that, the parameter a is not conjugated and that should be ok for symengine.
But this is still a bug that we should fix.

For
is this the output expected?
