This random test failure was observed on travis ( https://travis-ci.com/quantumlib/Cirq/jobs/228700099 , but likely no longer appears due to re-running the check ):
I ran the test 100 000 times and got 6 failures.
Looks like the issue is the difference in atol between the optimizer and the assertion.
I'll run some tests with different tolerances and see if I can reduce the failure rate.
