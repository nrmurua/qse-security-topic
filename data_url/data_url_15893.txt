A useful expression when constructing Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary numbers of qubits includes tensor products of the form
However, when including a coefficient in the form of an int, float or Parameter, this fails:
Opflow should handle the coefficient correctly.
Perhaps it has something to do with type(I^0) = int instead of Parameter? This may be causing the parser to get confused.
In your expression what do you expect to happen - the same as without the 3* prefix but now with coeff of 3 instead?
The operator character used for tensor i.e. ^  is the xor in Python and has lower precedence than multiply so this
is evaluated the same as this
Now adding brackets so the whole lot is multiplied
@ikkoham FYI since this ends up in the TensorMixin in the current code in main here.
Yes, that was the expected behavior I was looking for. Since this is the correct order of operations, I will close the issue. Thanks!
