It seems that the --emulate flag require a specific server helper to be implemented, e.g., to emulate quantinuum we need a the quantinuum server helper. As we are emulating the kernels, this feels unnecessary.
I believe this is no longer required. I remember enabling emulation tests also when the server helpers were not compiled. @amccaskey  for confirmation.
