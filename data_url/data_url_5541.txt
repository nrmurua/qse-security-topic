I have seen that there is a function in the C++ code of the matrix product state to calculate exactly an expectation value of Pauli operators (sequential contraction of the MPS and adjoint MPS over the Pauli operators). However, I cannot find any method that takes this into account. I don't think that qiskit.primitives.Estimator calls this method.
