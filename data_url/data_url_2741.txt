I setup a dev environment on a windows machine, ran the tests, and got eight failures from three classes.
Class 1: Numpy doesn't have float128 on Windows? I tried a couple different versions of numpy and this attribute was consistently not present.
Class 2: multiprocessing not working. We probably need to mark these tests as "don't run on windows":
Class 3: differing circuits. Not sure why these would ever fail just because of an OS change.
