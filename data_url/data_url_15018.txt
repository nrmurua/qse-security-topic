the variable cr_sched is undefined.

The exception should be raised
Change the description to not include undefined variable
Thanks for pointing this out!  I imagine that the original intent was to say "native direction cannot be determined" and a bit of debugging information to go with it.  Would you be interested in making a PR that updates the error to say that, and includes the qubits and instruction schedule map passed to the function?
Sure, I'll do that
