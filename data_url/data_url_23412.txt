"Nice" feedback from Qdev:
As it turns out examples notebook are not that effective. (Also hard to discover)
The tutorial is almost useless. For a new user the mocks are just noise and add complexity.
No simple example to be found.

thanks!
One thing that we have done is that the example notebooks now build as part of the docs http://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/index.html
They still clearly need some work
