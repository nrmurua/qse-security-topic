I sent this email to some people late last year, reproducing here for reference. The original context was how to document the HFVQE experiment in ReCirq, but on the openfermion sync we talked about how a similar structure of ~4 notebooks could serve as a good tutorial to openfermion basics.
The project is to take the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04174 which has code here: https://github.com/quantumlib/ReCirq/tree/master/recirq/hfvqe and write ~4ish Jupyter notebooks to serve as a tutorial-style documentation for the experiment. The notebooks shouldn't just be code -- they can lift passages from the paper to motivate and explain what you're doing in code. Ideally, the resulting notebooks would be a perfect resource for someone like @ncrubin to leverage to give a talk to a ~CS audience. The notebooks should be mostly standalone from the paper.
I imagine the notebooks would have the following subjects:
Obviously this is a very rough outline and things can be moved around; notebooks can be added/subtracted etc.
