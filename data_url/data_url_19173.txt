Changing, e.g.

This would make all the error models unnecessary and allows one to use all gates and channels directly in noise models without defining a new error wrapper/class.
For example,
The parameters of add() are:
Suppose we have this circuit

And we create the following NoiseModel
Then the noisy circuit would look like this:

Create an AbstractTranspiler in Qibo so that the NoiseModel can transpile a circuit given any rules from a user.
