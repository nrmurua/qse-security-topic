Could we get better documentation on what the evaluate_classically method in the Oracle classes is supposed to do? Namely, what is the content and format of what it is expected to return? Right now the only explanation I can find for the method is "evaluate classical".
This would help a lot when implementing CustomCircuitOracles for Grover.
As an aside, is there a reason that all of the arguments to CustomCircuitOracle are listed as optional, when most of them are required by Grover?
I added some text to describe what is expected. Let us know if this helps or something needs further clarification.
Is there a reason for the params... I am not sure why they were defaulted to invalid values. I changed this but to do it for circuit I needed to re-order it. Since the only use of CustomCircuitOracle I see is calling it by named parameters (rather than positional) that change should not impact the Aqua codebase here at all.
@woodsp-ibm Perfect! Cleared it up for me. Thank you for the quick turnaround.
