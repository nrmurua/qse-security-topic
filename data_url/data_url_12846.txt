The above code passes, even though it is written in the docstring that "Do not use two-qubit gates".
This is similar to #68 - test harness is not sophisticated enough to validate this kind of restrictions. It is a little tricky to validate - it is very easy to check that the code doesn't use CNOT or Controlled X gates, but CNOT can be expressed using a wide variety of other gates (CCNOT or Controlled Z ), which means that we need indeed to prohibit any 2-qubit gates.
I'll need to think about it. Meanwhile, treat this as a helpful suggestion to direct the learning process - if a task asks to to implement CNOT in a certain way, you can of course just use the CNOT to pass the test, but you've hardly learned anything this way :-)
#170 finally fixes this issue.
