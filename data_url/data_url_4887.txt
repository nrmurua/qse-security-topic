Currently, distributed mixDamping will cause nodes to exchange (when communication is necessary) half their state-vectors before local modification. However, an exchange isn't necessary; it can be shown that, via the assumed preconditions which make mixDamping's implementation valid, only one node of each communication pair needs to send its partition; the other need only receive it.
Therefore, a simple modification to prevent both nodes sending will halve the bandwidth of the function.
It should be noted the existing mixDamping implementation assumes qubit q and q+N of the Choi state-vector are on either sides of the segmentation of a node's represented basis states into a node-unique prefix and suffixes - this is the problematic condition also assumed by mixDepolarising (see #322). The additional scenario introduced by correcting mixDamping (when a single node contains a sub-column) can also make use of this one-way pairwise communication optimisation - and in that scenario, half of all nodes communicate, and when doing so, send (xor receive) all of their local amplitudes.
