Being able to toggle on and off individual features of the compiler is an extremely common ask by power users of our hardware, internal and external. (In particular: being able to turn off particular features, like qubit remapping.) This is the primary mode of operation for IBM and Google. Our primary mode is complementary to theirs, but that shouldnâ€™t stop us from offering both styles.
This is probably best implemented on top of #63.
