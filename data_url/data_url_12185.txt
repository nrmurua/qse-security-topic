After importing qiskit and Qconfig, I created qx_config which holds my APItoken(taken from Qconfig.py) and the URL. Then I try to do "qiskit.register(APItoken, URL)". I then get an AttributeError saying module 'qiskit' has no attribute 'register'. The probelm also occurs when I pass just the APItoken into qiskit.register()
I have followed this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3hXSftZuoc for the entire process.
import qiskit
import Qconfig
qiskit.register(Qconfig.APItoken)

After leaving and coming back, I have found that the commands are different now. After apply what is used in the tutorial above, the problem no longer exists.
