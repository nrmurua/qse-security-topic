blas_u32.c contains casts of uint8_t* to uint32_t*, which isn't defined behaviour if the pointer is not aligned – and I'm getting crashes in rainbowIIIc-cyclic-compressed.
A solution would probably be to use uint32_t pointers everywhere... If that's possible.
This is caught by test_functest_sanitizers sometimes. It can only tell you when it's going wrong that we have this problem, but not if it's going fine, unfortunately.
-Wcast-align=strict does catch this, but it is not supported by GCC 7.4. It appears to have been introduced in GCC 8
I also get stack overflows...
