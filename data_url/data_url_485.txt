Hello,
I'm having some difficulties with installing the listed packages for use by XACC on Ubuntu.  I've tried to install them using pip3 normally and also with "sudo -H".  I've gotten Qiskit to install, but it gave me various warning messages that makes me somewhat uneasy.  Normally I put things in to a conda virtual environment, using Anaconda or Miniconda usually, and I'm able to keep things segregated nicely, but I'm not sure if I can do that with XACC.  Maybe I just need to make sure I'm running with the correct Python environment activate whenever I'm working with XACC.
When I run the cmake command I get a message that seems to be related to qiskit.
When I try to install QSearch I get a message about qsrs version problems, but I already have that installed, and the version is in the correct range.
I face the same problem when install qsearch, and I solve the problem by following the step below:
Need to install qsrs first,according to its wiki page
First, install the dependencies.
sudo apt install libopenblas-dev libceres-dev libgfortran-10-dev
then install Rust like as follows:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
Accept all of the default prompts. Then run source ~/.cargo/env, and switch to the nightly toolchain change the version of cargo and proc-marco2 to avoid the issue of unknown feature proc_macro_span_shrink :
rustup default nightly && cargo update -p syn --precise 1.0.99; cargo update -p proc-macro2 --precise 1.0.43
Clone the Qsearch repo:
git clone https://github.com/BQSKit/qsearch.git && cd qsearch/qsrs
and run:
pip install .
Finally install qsearch
pip install qsearch
