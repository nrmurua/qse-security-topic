Linkcheck non-deterministically fails when checking two MyBinder links that are in the README file.
Both links seem to work but maybe they are slow.
This is the error message that is produced by test-docs in CI:
Unless there is a better solution, we can ask linkcheck to ignore the 2 links.
Haven't seen this happening recently, so maybe we can close for now?
