Using CGate with an empty list for the controls argument returns Null, as in the following example:
I think that this should either return an uncontrolled gate acting on the target register, or should produce a message and an unevaluated result.
Perhaps relatedly, CGate also propagates a Null if the control dimension is 1:
Here, the problem is that the Control â†’ 1 option doesn't make sense for a 1-dimensional space, but that error isn't properly being caught and turned into a message. This can be verified by noting that the following snippet does what is expected:
I agree this is a bug. Of your suggestions, I like the uncontrolled gate solution best.
Fixed.
The first case was a bug with the  3-argument function being called with the wrong inputs due to {} being interpreted as an empty set of options.
For the second case I added an error message if a control subsystem is 1-dimensional.
