Make sure you choose cryptonight as the algorithm.
Are you overclocking your GPUs?
There have been some people in xmr-stak reporting similar problems in the past:

Default settings on core and mem.
Power Limit is set to 75%
Basic responses point to not using this miner and moving to XMR-STAK Unified all in One Monero miner. That gives a different error.
