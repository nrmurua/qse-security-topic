The test suite drops an extra file test/python/visualization/test_latex_cif_single_bit_bundle.tex as part of its run, which isn't cleaned up.
As part of the same problem, the test that generates this does not actually compare this file with the reference - if it did, it would throw an error, because the generated file is not equal to its reference.  The erroneous test was introduced in #6248.
Run the test suite to generate the file that shouldn't exist.
No extra files generated at the end of the test suite.
Add the reference-comparison assertion to the relevant test case, which also cleans up the file.
