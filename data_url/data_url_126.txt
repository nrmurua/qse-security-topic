At present, one is disallowed from creating classical data such as a std::vector<double> from within a kernel. This may be too restrictive for kernel writers.
Example 1: creating complex data structures.
Additionally, some computations of classical values may involve calling back to the C++ standard library (math) functions, etc.
Example 2: computing non-trivial expressions such as sum +=  expr .
