PQClean dropped algorithms that didn't make it to round 3. So beware when running ´copy_from_pyclean´ without first deciding on an adaptation to copy_from_pyclean.yml. I'd vote for doing the same that PQClean did.
Such renewed copy_from_pqclean import would have the added benefit of replacing the upstream dilithium code with AVX2 issues at the same moment (with slightly older, but tried and true code from PQClean), thus resolving for good #793 and #785 at the same time.
