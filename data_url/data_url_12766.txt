Hello, I am troubled by the oracle proposed as a solution in the Graph Coloring Kata. The ColorEqualityOracle_Nbit operation applies the X gate if both colors are equal. This means the "conflicts" qubit array would be equal to |1...1‚ü© if all the colors are equal, right ? Then why are we using 0 in ControlledOnInt(0, X)(conflicts, target). Shouldn't it be a 1 ? Thanks for the read, I probably already understood this, however I can't remember.
ColorEqualityOracle_Nbit flips the target qubit if the colors are equal. For VertexColoringOracle, the cases when the colors are equal make the coloring invalid, so to mark the coloring as valid we want no pair of colors to be equal - all qubits in conflicts should be in |0‚ü© state for the target qubit to be flipped (think of it as "there should be no conflicts"), marking the coloring as valid. ControlledOnInt(0, X) does exactly that.
No worries, sometimes looking at a task I haven't seen for a while gives me pause too :-)
Of course ! I am feeling pretty dumb right now. Thanks for reminding me what the goal is üòÅ.
