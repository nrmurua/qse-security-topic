Following #2103, gate params can be sympy expressions
Is this on all backends or just text?
Ok, I just tested this locally, mpl also fails for the same reason casting trying to cast the sympy expression to a float which it can't do because there is no value. But latex actually works:

without any modifications. I think this is a first where latex is the one without a bug! :)
I'm self-assigning the text part.
Well done latex drawer! :)
Text drawer fix in #2168. When merged, this issue should be renamed to be mpl specific.
