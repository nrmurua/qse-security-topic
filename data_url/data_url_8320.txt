I am trying to implement this heterodyne example provided here:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qutip/qutip-notebooks/blob/master/examples/smesolve-heterodyne.ipynb
It seems that the main issue is that this example is written in an old version and the general_stochastic function is not supported any more. So I changed to smesolve and modified its arguments, which leads me to the following code (which still doesn't work):
The error message
Does anyone have suggestions on what is going wrong here? Thanks a lot!
Please refer to smesolve new methods and benchmark. I think you should just use c_ops or sc_ops. Keeping this open as the notebook needs to be updated and the Users guide documentation. The API documentation is updated.
Thanks for the reply, and the new example. Passing sc_ops to smesolve does work.
The heterodyne stochastic example was updated as part of this year's GSoC tutorial renovation project. The updated notebook can be found at https://nbviewer.org/urls/qutip.org/qutip-tutorials/tutorials-v4/time-evolution/015_smesolve-heterodyne.ipynb.
Thank you for reporting this.
