I can't get a unitary representation of circuits with Diagonal gates.
This gives:
I should get a unitary representation of the diagonal operator.

You have to transpile the circuit before running it
The transpilation is not only for real devices but also for the simulators, as they too have a set of basis gates that are supported ðŸ™‚
Thanks!  That works. I was following the example in the tutorial, which does not mention traspilation:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/1_getting_started_with_qiskit.html#Unitary-backend
Very confusing for new users.  Perhaps a documentation fix should be included to update examples everywhere with a consistent transpilation step?
