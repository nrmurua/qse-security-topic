Hi, I recommend you follow the installation steps of the qiskit-tutorial here, which is simpler:
https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/INSTALL.md
Once you installed the tutorial, the qiskit is also installed for you.
Closing - please reopen or comment back if further help is needed.
