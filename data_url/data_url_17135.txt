There is a small inconsistency how the parameters of a gate are showed in the matplotlib, with and without '(...)'.

If I have to choose, I would go with removing the parenthesis everywhere. But, for sure, it should be everywhere the same...
Similarly, another inconsistency in the way to present the parameters when usepiformat is used.


Interested in trying my hand at this to learn more about how Terra was wrote, but I haven't worked inside this project's source before. Any recommendation on a starting point for this (if you know one, otherwise I'll poke around until I find something).
Thank you :)
Awesome! You will find the mpl drawer code in the visualization folder. Start by running the visualization tests in the test folder. Let me know if you need any help!
Hi @baileytincher, just checking to see how this is going. I wanted to give this a shot, but wanted to check with you before doing so.
@aasfaw I think you can go ahead. @baileytincher seems MIA.

I've been working on this a little, but by all means go ahead if you have an idea. I don't want to hold up the project if you can get it done sooner!
hi @1ucian0 can i have a shot with this
This issue seems closed. Do you think it was wrongly closed @ZuansiCai  ?
