@maffoo Maybe we should split the library requirements into dev and user? Development has to happen in python 3, so it's reasonable to have a dependency requiring python 3 in that context. But for users, not being able to get at mypy is no big deal.
Alternatively, we do have a separate python2.7-requirements.txt without mypy. Maybe there's some way to point pip at it when in the 2.7 case?
I don't think pip installing from git with python2 can possibly work, because the python2 sources have to be generated; the sources in the repo are python3 only. You would have to check the code out, generate python2 sources, and then install from that.
Good point.
I have the same problem. I'm concerned about this since many of our users (myself included) tend to only use python 2.
This is fixed now, due to the introduction of separated requirements files.
