Certainly the concept of a gate that does this operation is well defined.  Having it around as an object may not be super valuable, except that I really do think having the concept of a gate is very useful for defining what is supported by a device.  So now if we have QC that support this phasor we cannot say whether it is supported or not without talking about what qubits it is operating on.
Currently we still have PauliStringGateOperation.  It is not at all clear why this is necessary.  Certainly PauliStringPhasor is a well defined gate time.
