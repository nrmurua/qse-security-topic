basis_gates get from BackendConfiguration is a list of string but transpiler takes basis_gates as a comma-separated string.
BackendConfiguration:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/backends/models/backendconfiguration.py#L43
transpiler:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/transpiler/_transpiler.py#L39
Could we align the data type?
yes the transpiler is being updated.
Possibly related to #1333 - and something that would be great to finally tackle indeed.
Yes itâ€™s the same.
Closing as dup of #1333
