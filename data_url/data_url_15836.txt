The BIPMapper only works on, for example, QV circuits with less than three qubits when using the version installed with pip install cplex.  Otherwise the following error is given:
DOcplexLimitsExceeded: **** Promotional version. Problem size limits exceeded, CPLEX code=1016
It should be documented somewhere that these limitations exist, and that a full license is required.
Note that I used the tutorial here to find this: Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#1241
Actually I see that it does this:
Since the free version of CPLEX can solve only small BIP problems, i.e. mapping of circuits with less than about 5 qubits
although the limits are off for QV.
