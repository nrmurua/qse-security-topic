Suppose the IP address of my ARTIQ Master machine is x.x.x.101 and in DNS it is called x.x.artiq_master. The user may well reasonably expect that the following are synonymous.
For example, the following works on the same machine.
$ artiq_master --bind x.x.x.101
$ artiq_ctlmgr --bind x.x.x.101 --server x.x.x.101
The following does not work on the same machine.
$ artiq_master --bind x.x.x.101
$ artiq_ctlmgr --bind x.x.artiq_master --server x.x.artiq_master
The following does not work on the same machine.
$ artiq_master --bind ::1
$ artiq_ctlmgr --bind 127.0.0.1 --server 127.0.0.1
Recommendation: Bind to network-facing IP addresses, never to 127.0.0.1 or ::1 or "localhost" (or DNS names).
Regarding the last case:
::1 is the IPv6 address and 127.0.0.1 is the v4 address - binding to the IPv6 address and connecting on the v4 address predictably does not work.
The second example works correctly here, both with the IP address and the hostname in the device database. What are the contents of that DNS entry?
Automatically binding to network-facing IP addresses is problematic:
The following does not work on the same machine.
$ artiq_master --bind x.x.x.101
$ artiq_ctlmgr --bind x.x.artiq_master --server x.x.artiq_master
The following are run on the same machine.
DNS
Use artiq_ctlmgr --bind 688penninga.bw.nist.gov --server 688penninga.bw.nist.gov?
Is 688penninga.bw.nist.gov resolving to the right address (132.163.82.151), not 127.0.1.1 as 688penninga does?
Yes. That works!
If it would help others avoid these pitfalls it might be good to update the
docs to require complete domain names.
