This tutorial repo is the first point of entry to learning QISKIT. Some of the latest commits added functions for QISKIT 0.7 which is not yet released. I think it is better to not get ahead and keep the tutorials compatible with the QISKIT pip installed version (i.e. 0.6.x) to avoid confusing new Qiskitters (like me). My suggestions:
I know there was sub suboptimality and next time the tutorials will be made to a branch, not master. I apologise for the confusion.
