When I try to execute the code below, I get the following error:
Apparently, parametrized Hamiltonian gates fail to convert to unitaries when AerEstimator is used. However, if qiskit.primitives.Estimator is used instead, then everything works as expected. As far as I understand, one should be able to use these estimators interchangeably.
The following code reproduces the problem:
I expect no errors.
Thanks. As @mtreinish transferred, this is the transpilation issue.
minimal code to reproduce this is
It's actually more of an issue with the implementation of the HamiltonianGate, it is raising errors when there is an unbound parameter when the transpiler is asking for it's definition to unroll it into terms that can be used for basis translation. There isn't a way to transpile it directly with an unbound parameter because it's definition can only be realized with a numeric parameter for time because the definition just returns a unitary gate, and we can't define the matrix without a numerical value for time.
Yeah this only work with the Estimator in Qiskit (Terra) as it binds the parameter values before simulating the circuit.
If you'd like to use operator evolutions with the Aer Estimator, you can use the PauliEvolutionGate instead of the QuantumCircuit.hamiltonian function. The PauliEvolutionGate implements a Trotter expansion, so it is not exact, but this is what we would also have to run on a quantum computer.
I'll go ahead and close this issue, but feel free to re-open if the answers above didn't answer your question.
