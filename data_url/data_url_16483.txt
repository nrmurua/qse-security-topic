I've been looking over the source for the generation of latex source, and I have become puzzled over aliases variable.
Most other options get passed in when creating the QCircuitImage class, but this one is passed in when running the obj.latex(aliases=None) function.
Also, there is no way to pass in aliases through the circuit_drawer in visualization/circuit_visualization.py, which is the front facing way to generate the latex-source.
Is this purposeful, or should the method of passing in aliases be changed?
Seems like this has never been used so I think you can safely remove them entirely. good catch.
