What happened?
Building the Python API failed because the sse2 and avx2 extensions are not relevant in the aarch64 environment.
How to reproduce the issue
Relevant log output
Other information
If the sse2 and avx2 sections in setup.py are removed, the API build successfully and all tests pass.
To remove those sections, apply the attached setup.py_patch.txt:
patch setup.py setup.py_patch.txt
Environment
Stim commit 81142ac
Ubuntu 20.04, GCC 9.4.0, Ampere Altra Max without SSE, SSE2, AVX and AVX2
Note: the issue does not occur in this environment: Fedora 35, GCC 11.3.1, Intel architecture with SSE, SSE2, AVX and AVX2
This seems really difficult to fix. The purpose of building the three modules is to allow runtime machine architecture detection, and is necessary in order to distribute binary wheels that work across machines. Removing the -mno-avx2 argument could result in bad wheels.
You might be able to use the bazel dev wheel build as a workaround?
Yes, bazel can build the wheel on aarch64:
Are there similar commands for building the cirq, zx and sinter packages using bazel?  The developer_documentation.md file provides pip commands for building those packages, but not bazel commands.
