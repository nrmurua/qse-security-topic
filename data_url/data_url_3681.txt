It should be 'C:\Users\Steven.pyquil_config' (note the 3rd backslash)
I believe the correct line is os.path.normpath(os.path.expanduser('~/.pyquil_config')) but this needs to be tested on a Windows machine.
Is this actually a problem? I just tested it and windows tolerates forward slashes (as well as back slashes / mixed) for paths
A user on the community Slack channel identified this as a problem (Windows 10, Python 3.6). When we changed the forward slash to a backslash it started working.
