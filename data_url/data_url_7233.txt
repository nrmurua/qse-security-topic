Noise examples...
would be nice to add a jupyter notebook.
Split species examples with barium..
It would also be nice to have an example of something that involves continuously driving a short-lived state, like optical pumping or Doppler cooling. I think we'd have to use the QuantumOptics semiclassical solver in order to for this to be efficient, but I'm not sure -- never tried it before. Here's a related QuantumOptics example: https://docs.qojulia.org/examples/lasing-and-cooling/
