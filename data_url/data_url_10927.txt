Hello.
The function evaluate() in solver.c calculates row_sum and col_sum; row_sum affects result, the return value of the function, and both row_sum and col_sum affect flip_cost, an output parameter.
The function Simple_evaluate() appears to be a simplified version of evaluate().  It also calculates row_sum and col_sum, and row_sum affects result, the return value.  But in this function, col_sum is not used.  Calculating it appears to be unnecessary.  Would it make sense to eliminate col_sum from Simple_evaluate() for clarity, to save a few lines of code, and to save a few CPU cycles?
The only call to Simple_evaluate(), from near the end of solve(), is commented out.  But presumably Simple_evaluate() might be pressed into service again.
Thank you.
S.D.
