LEDA 2.1 as we have in our repo is broken (https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/455); we should update (see https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/pqc-forum/LZXD_WFqzs8/zg3TUKjWBQAJ).

LEDAcrypt not in round 3.
Hmm, should we remove LEDA then, considering the current implementation is insecure and we are probably not motivated to update?
