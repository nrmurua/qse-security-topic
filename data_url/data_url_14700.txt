Indexing for single qubit error rates is wrong in parse_backend_properties.
The U1/U2/U3 error dicts are populated with a single floating point number instead of the error rate map (line 155, 160, 165).
(CX error rates are parsed correctly)
Each U1/U2/U3 error rate should be indexed with the qubit id.
Line 155 in crosstalk_adaptive_schedule.py needs to be changed to:
self.bp_u1_err[qid] = round(u1_err, NUM_PREC)
Line 160 to:
self.bp_u2_err[qid] = round(u2_err, NUM_PREC)
Line 165 to:
self.bp_u3_err[qid] = round(u3_err, NUM_PREC)
Thanks to Gokul Ravi (U Chicago) for pointing this out.
This issue was on its way to be fixed by #5399 If you want to build on top of that partial fix, please request to be assigned and don't forget add the original author as a co-author.
