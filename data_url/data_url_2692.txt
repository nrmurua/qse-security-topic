Add a low depth simulator a la
https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05384
and related works.
https://github.com/ngnrsaa/qflex currently has a Cirq interface.  There are other low depth simulators.  I don't we have a plan to add these directly into Cirq unless there is high demand, but we welcome other simulators to write Cirq interfaces (and we can help with this!)
