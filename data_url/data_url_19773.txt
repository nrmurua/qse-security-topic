rb_opts_dict appear in the documentation and notebooks of RB,
but does not appear in the code of the function randomized_benchmarking_seq in rb/circuits.py
Add rb_opts_dict to the function randomized_benchmarking_seq in rb/circuits.py and return it
This was by design. Originally I coded as passing in a dictionary, but we decided to change it to explicit arguments to be more in line with the rest of qiskit and for readability. Python allows you to pass a dictionary into a function by unpacking into an argument list so that's what's done in the notebooks.
