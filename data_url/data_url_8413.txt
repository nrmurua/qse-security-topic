mesolve returns num_collapse =0, even when I pass collapse operators to it like this
(Some of the code is from @ajgpitch ).
PFA the test run of the qutip.testing module as qutip_testing.pdf so that anyone interested could see if there is anything wrong with my installation. Also please let me know if there is any other piece of information that needs to be known.
Computer OS: MacOS 10.13.3 High Sierra.

I would guess that this behavior was intended and that storing the number of collapse operators is intended for the results of of mcsolve. Nonetheless, you can add it easily in the mesolve function beneath:
or the whole conditional statement.
Try setting default for num_collapse = None.
Fixed by #1424.
