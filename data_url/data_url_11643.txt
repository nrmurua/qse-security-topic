I'm trying to use the built-in QuantumInstance measurement error functionality, but the following code
results in an error:
Note that adding measurements via circuit.measure_all() results in the following error:
However, the error does not arise when the quantum instance is initialized without the error mitigation settings.
A similar issue was reported here a while ago. Is there a way to fix this problem?
It seems there are measurements missing, try to apply measure_all to the circuit before execution.

Unfortunately, this is incompatible with performing measurements in a way you suggested here.
I have updated the post above. The problem seems to be caused by the error mitigation implementation.
Why is this line there?
q_instance.execute(psi)
Its not doing anything with the result as such anyway. The logic you have afterwards in CircuitSampler convert will end up calling execute in the quantum instance which will apply measurement mitigation on the circuits it uses sending in necessary calibration ccts etc.
I do not have an example of similar logic outside of VQE using operator and expectation but here is a tutorial that works with VQE and uses a quantum instance with measurement mitigation https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-community-tutorials/blob/master/aqua/simulations_with_noise_and_measurement_error_mitigation.ipynb showing it working.
The measurement noise mitigation here, just to be clear, is to compensate for noise arising in the electronics that are measuring real qubits on a actual device. We can simulate this with a noise model in Aer (as well as other noise that real qubits are susceptible to). It is different than shot noise which will be there anyway since its a probabilistic outcome.

Thanks!! Everything's working after removing it.
