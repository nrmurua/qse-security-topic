When I perform a cp2k test, I enter the mpirun -np 6 cp2k.popt |tee test.out command on the ubuntu terminal(ubuntu version 20.04 is used). The following error occurs: I tried a lot but still couldn't solve it. Thank you for your help

As the error message suggests, you are missing command line arguments. Your CP2K call command should look like mpirun -np <number of requested processes> cp2k.popt -i <your input file> -o <your output file>. (The command mpiexec is preferred over mpirun because it is standardized whereas mpirun is not.) Call CP2K with cp2k.popt -h to get some help with the command line interface.

Hello. When I run the "mpiexec/mpirun -np 1 cpek.popt -i 1.inp -o test.out" command, the following error occurs: How to solve it next

Can you upload your input file and the output file? Your error message is too unspecific without any details on the attempted calculation.

Sorry, these are my input files and output files. Thank you very much for your help
input.txt
test.out.txt
The line
in your output file does not contain the feature keyword parallel, but only omp. Thus your CP2K binary has not been built with MPI support, but only with OpenMP threading support, and thus it won't run in parallel using MPI via mpirun or mpiexec.

Thank you for your answer. How do I solve this problem. Could you give me some suggestions?
You have to recompile CP2K (see here or via CMake).
