The functions projector from subspace.jl always return DenseOperators. Could you implement versions which return sparse operators? It is just a matter of replacing zeros with SparseArrays.spzeros and DenseOperator with SparseOperator.
Oftentimes these projection matrices have lots of zeros, so it is convenient to have a sparse version available.
Thanks!
On the latest master branch of QuantumOpticsBase.jl you can now do projector(b1,b2;sparse=true) to obtain a sparse operator version of the projector.
Thank you so much! That's great!
