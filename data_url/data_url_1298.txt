Description of the issue
Expected cirq.Z to not decompose into cirq.PhasedXZGate in the code snippet below (probably the same issue in other target gatesets as well):
How to reproduce the issue
Are we checking only the gate and not the operation when decomposing?
@tanujkhattar
My bad, the example given above isn't an issue because CZTargetGateset ejects Paulis as expected. The actual code that failed was this:
This fails because raising the whole operation to an exponent removes all tags, which is a separate issue but not related to target gatesets.
