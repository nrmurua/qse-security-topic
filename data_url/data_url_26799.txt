How can I retrieve the arch file setting in detail within each dashboard test?
In general case, what kind of the CUDA arch setting is using in Dashboard?
I only found this one "https://dashboard.cp2k.org/archive/cuda-pascal/index.html".
Thanks,
Vitesse.
The employed arch file is included in the report. Just search for --- ARCH-file ---.
