In looking into #7789 I discovered that master is throwing a NumPy warning when importing a fake backend
Run the above. My NumPy is 1.22.3
Now UserWarning
No response
This is actually a qiskit-aer bug (it was compling with fast math by default): Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1461 It's fixed for inclusion in an upcoming bugfix release (which is in progress Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1481 ). It's triggered on the use of the fake backends because they internally import aer.
(closing as fixed upstream)
