Description
Team Psi have started implementing back end  test cases. This issue is more of what approach have been implemented.
Frameworks
FastAPI testclient:
Since FastAPI is based on Starlette, TestClient is used for API testing.
unittest.mock:
unittest will used for functionality test purpose.
pytest:
pytest is used for running and collecting detailed info of passing/failing tests.
Current Implementation Approach:
Currently, unit test case has been initialised for back end.  When test cases gets initiated from pytest, a mock database is created and all API test cases will make use of the test database so that test workflows get populated on the test database. This approach avoids unnecessary workflows getting populated on the actual database.
After the tests are completed, the test database gets deleted automatically.
@wjcunningham7 FYI, this is the approach that we have initially implemented.  And  currently we have created a folder inside /tests as ui_backend_tests.  Please let us know if there are any comments.
