We need to improve URL validation when building with the option to override the default URL for the server helper, e.g.:
Few examples and their results:
Using only url = 127
Using only url = 127.0 (it works!)
Using only url = 127.0, but not port
Using only url = localhost, wrong port
Hmm, I am unable to reproduce. Can you catch the exception in lldb or gdb and see where this is happening?
