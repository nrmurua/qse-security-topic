There are still some gaps in the schema as shown in the following example:
Now I do
and compare lattice attributes:
Some keys are missing relative to the original lattice:
The missing keys are: __name__, workflow_function_string, metadata.deps, metadata.call_before/after, metadata.results_dir, post_processing, electron_outputs, lattice_imports, cova_imports
__name__ and workflow_function_string were previously used by the UI and could introduce regressions if they are missing. They are actually already in the DB, just not retrieved by result_from. The other missing fields are not so important now but will be needed later if we want to resume workflows or implement other features that require lossless Result.persist() and result_from().
@santoshkumarradha @FyzHsn should this be fixed before release?
@mshkanth is your team independently retrieving lattice.__name__ and lattice.workflow_function_string in your data layer?
@cjao great catch as long as this does not affect UI, this does not matter much for this release. For now, since we are close to release, as this is not a bug, I would probably have this for the next version (if we need).

@cjao - We are directly reading from the DB - lattices.name and lattices.function_string_filename
