I think it would be great for our users to have a page or extend some of our pages in our documentation describing the different kind of representations we have for operators and what features each have and how they interrelate.
Currently the list would be:
And then if we introduce butterfly (Dirac?) operators - they would be a sparse representation for arbitrary operators relying on the Dirac formalism, where you can capture things like projectors.
We should also capture where there are nice interoperability between these representations - e.g. PauliSum and PauliString and Dirac operators can be added and multiplied together.
I like this idea, especially concerning observables where (to my knowledge) examples are a bit lacking. PauliSum's and PaulSumCollector's could even be used in some existing tutorials on variational algorithms, if desired.

Discussed on Cirq Cynque: this will be very helpful in mapping theoretical understanding to the framework.
