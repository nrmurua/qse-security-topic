I think this is a general problem with VISA communication and can be reproduced on most instruments by simply issuing a write command with a query string and neglecting to read back the answer. Now the VISA message queue is out of sync.
One obvious solution that's actually been on my mind for a long time is to extend the QCoDeS VisaInstrument with a clear_message_queue method. Incidentally, the driver in question, the AWG5014C, already comes with that method. @fvanriggelen, you can make sure to call that method when needed.
