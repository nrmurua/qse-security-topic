The function rtio_log(...) is not defined anywhere in ARTIQ (in Python at least, in builtins.py there's fn_rtio_log). This causes an issue for static code analysis (i.e. flake8, pylint), as well as for documentation purposes (unsure what arguments to pass it). Maybe an @syscall like:

would be helpful. I'm not familiar with all the intricacies of syscalls (which flags), or if there's a reason that this is missing.
Related: #206, #550. Also, documentation on using this feature is still a little sparse (or de-localized).
My best guess for what this should be, based on the LLVM IR generator:

Yes, I know I'm using type annotations, but it helps with clarity here.
