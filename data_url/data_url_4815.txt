Strawberry Fields version:  0.7.2
Expected behavior: After a backend.reset(), the backend should be in the exact same initial state as it was after begin_circuit() was last called.
Actual behavior: If any modes were created or deleted after begin_circuit(), the reset will not restore
the correct initial state.
Minimal example:
begin_circuit() has to store the initial number of modes somewhere.
A fix for each backend class (fock, tf, gaussian) is needed.
