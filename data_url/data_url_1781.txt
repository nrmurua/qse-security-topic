Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
As described in https://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4698 Fourier Checking is a simple quantum algorithm that can decide whether two 2^n random bitstrings are "forrelated" or not. I would like to showcase with this problem oracle query complexity and oracle synthesis using diagonal gates.
Describe the solution you'd like
We need the following:
Additional context (e.g. screenshots)
I did some hacking on this colab, that could be used as a starting point: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iT-PO6GSstreo5edvxdvVQ2Xj4fxHRXo?usp=sharing.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
I can contribute to this.
Thanks @ybc1991 - as discussed, I'll also split out the oracle synthesis into a separate task from this one.
@balopat Hi Balint, when you have time, would you please create another issue to specify the requirement of oracle synthesis? Thanks.
Interesting paper out showing some easy cases https://scirate.com/arxiv/2102.06963 and connecting them to recursive QAOA.
