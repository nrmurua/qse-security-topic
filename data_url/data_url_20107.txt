@xvzcf You had some concerns about backlog of incomplete coverage in CI, e.g. some algorithms being disabled on AppVeyor.  Can you document those in this issue?
Yes, was going to do so later today.
We might want to go over these before adding new CI jobs:
I also noticed here that the triggering mechanism doesn't fail if the branch wasn't found. I introduced this bug, will fix it.
If I get it right, every single item above was triggered by the need to save (CI) time, either because the algorithms are too slow (i.e., we effectively did pick (on :) "losers") or the tests are too time-consuming/not adding serious value (to warrant their regular execution).
So I see some alternatives for resolution:
I intentionally didn't list the fifth option to add another CI system (for on-demand or release-only testing): It would make our system even harder to maintain/remain consistent.
Further ideas very welcome.

Agreed, and the need to save CI time is still present.
I also think the easiest way out would be to buy more CircleCI resources, but we can discuss this on Wednesday.
Basically resolved, with the exception of a few jobs; closing this issue and tracking the remaining jobs separately in #1076.
