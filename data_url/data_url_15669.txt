Ahh, an unexpected dependence on Aer.
Just to clarify it's an optional dependency on aer. If you don't have aer installed it will fall back to use basic aer without issue. But if you do have aer installed you need at least aer 0.8.0 installed (which is the release which introduced the use of `BackendV1).
I had 0.7.6 which caused it to throw the error.
