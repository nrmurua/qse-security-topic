I'm trying to follow the CRAB / pulse optimizer tutorial but realize that my Hamiltonian takes a slightly different form than the control form ("H_c") they use. They use a list of QObjs w/ variable amplitude, whereas my Hamiltonian has the following term which seems challenging to input:
$$
f_j(t) (a_j e^{-i \phi_j(t)} - a^\dagger_j e^{i \phi_j(t)})
$$
Even for $j \in [1]$ only, how can I make it so that this term has two controls, one which controls the amplitude and one which controls the phase?
