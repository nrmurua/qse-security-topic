The qip.hadamard_transform function does not return return expected output.
Tested with N=1 in Python 2.7 and factor is 0.5 rather than 1/sqrt(2).
The 2*(-N / 2) would need to be something like 2(-N / 2.0) to ensure float division
Thanks for finding and reporting this bug! It should be addressed by #259
