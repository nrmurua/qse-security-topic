As discussed in the engineering meeting, it would be a good idea to report fit error to the user, so that they can understand the underlying reason as to why error mitigation might not be working as expected (and it's probably just good practice as well). For example, when running on a real device, undersampling (aka too few shots) can lead to a poor fit / extrapolation. We should also consider adding a discussion about this to the documentation.
