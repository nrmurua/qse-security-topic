I am running VQE-UCCSD calculations for H2 molecule in minimal basis set (STO-3G) with precomputing excitation amplitudes. Function MP2Info.mp2_terms() for H2 molecule returns an empty dictionary.
output: {}
Returns the only double excitation [0,1,2,3].
output: {'0_1_2_3': (-0.06834019757197064, -0.012232934733533095)}
From what I see the problems lies in line 119 of mp2info.py and can only appear when the set of orbitals is equal to the excitation set. Changing < to <= seems to solve the problem.
