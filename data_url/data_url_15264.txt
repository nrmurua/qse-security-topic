It takes 10sec to view the available backends from the FakeProvider, ie.
takes 10secs on my machine, and the result is not cached so calling it again also takes 10sec.
Just doing provider.get_backend('fake_athens') also takes 10sec.
This appears to be similar to #8783, and I am guessing the root-cause is the same.  As such closing.
