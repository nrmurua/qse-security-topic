There is no functionality for retrieving bitstrings in a more compact base:
Add random hex, base32, and base64 functionality to QRNG
The user can translate the output bitstring manually
I can work on HEX, post that will take up other bases too can I just create a function called get_random_hex to achieve this? if not can you elaborate on what is expected
Hi @anushkrishnav! Thanks for showing interest!
It is my understanding that somebody else is already working on this. They reached out via Discord. Am I right @Avhijit-codeboy? You can maybe work together to get his done.
I've actually already implemented all the encodings @pedrorrivero
Awesome @Avhijit-codeboy! It would be nice though if you could chat with @anushkrishnav and see if he has any fresh ideas ðŸ™‚ I am assigning this to you two!
Thanks @Avhijit-codeboy, great job!
