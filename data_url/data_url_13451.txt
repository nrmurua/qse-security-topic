Any test like test_execute_with_shots which uses cirq.PauliSumCollector occasionally fails in CI. Example error message below.
The status of this may change after moving back to Cirq 0.10 in #717. Let's see if any tests continue to fail.

The change to Cirq 0.10 does not seem to have affected this, as it just popped up in CI again: https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/runs/2889110440?check_suite_focus=true#step:6:2057
This error doesn't appear in CI anymore since a long time.
Probably it was due to some subtle problem in Cirq (or in Python?) that seems to be solved.
Therefore I am closing this, but please reopen if someone disagrees.
Just saw this the other day actually, still around: https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/runs/3502306803?check_suite_focus=true
ops, sorry

Based on last Friday meeting, the plan for this issue is to:
The reason for this strategy is that these functions are not essential anymore, since we can now use a mitiq.Observable.
