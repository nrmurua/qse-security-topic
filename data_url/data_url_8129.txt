matplotlib 3.4 has begun issuing some new deprecation warnings against some of the stuff we do in bloch.py.
Simple reproducer from within ipython --matplotlib:
produces
This particular environment had matplotlib==3.4.1.
The warnings themselves suggest fixes, however some care needs to be taken; I suspect that the additional keyword auto_add_to_figure might be new in matplotlib 3.4 (not sure about the .M attribute).  We want to keep compatibility with at least matplotlib>=3 (we don't want to picky so it's easy to use QuTiP with other packages), so it might be necessary to include a version test using packaging.version.parse.  If someone could test whether that's necessary, that'd be great.
Confirming that auto_add_to_figure is new in matplotlib 3.4.
