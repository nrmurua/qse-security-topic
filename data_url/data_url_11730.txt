Qiskit/qiskit#3600 implemented the Cry gate in Terra, therefore we can remove it from Aqua. This duplication might also cause some bugs, since the Aqua version is imported after Terra's and we override the definition as proper CryGate with ours.
Yes, there are a number of gates that are in the process of being moved (or have been to Terra). These all need to be taken care of (PS. The CRy rewrite was submitted here first as a PR #745 which I suggested was re-opened against Terra which has been done). I asked that when the move of the gates was complete to Terra a PR be opened here to delete them (yes at present they are mostly duplicated - except that the CRy was rewritten, as you have seen, to subclass Gate and the one here not)
Yes, the multi control gates are already in Terra, thanks for the hint. So these should also be removed from Aqua, and the tests moved to Terra since they don't have them yet.
@woodsp-ibm do you know why the logical gates haven't been moved? They seem to be the only ones missing.
I am not aware of the current status, last time I had checked with Kevin work was on hold at that time due to an imminent release being prepared.
Terra released 0.11.0 last week, so this should be good to move forward.
Once Qiskit/qiskit#3714 is merged, we can remove the gates from Aqua (except the boolean logic one).
Gates left in Aqua are mcmt and boolean logic. These were never duplicated and the duplicate gates, the subject of this issue have been removed. Should this be closed and if needed another issue to manage mcmt and/or boolean logic gates if change there is still expected?
