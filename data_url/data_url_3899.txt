this error was actually observed using PycQED test case Test_multi_qubit_oql_CC.test_two_qubit_parity_check (https://github.com/DiCarloLab-Delft/PycQED_py3/blob/develop/pycqed/tests/openql/test_multi_qubit_oql.py#L139)
details to reproduce:
This error still occurs after the recent refactor, i.e. in PR #360. Attached is the output of:
Zaphod-2:PycQED_py3 wouter$ pytest -v pycqed/tests/openql/ -k test_two_qubit_parity_check > test_two_qubit_parity_check.txt 
The source of the test is at:
