When I try to invoke Qubiter_to_IBMqasm2() it fails when there are PHAS gates in the English file.
Do we have a PHAS expander that translates into gates available on IBM etc.? Just like we have expanders for DiagUnitary and Multiplexor...
I did use CGateExpander but it leaves the PHAS'es unchanged... The file is pretty large, but I'll see if I can reproduce with a smaller one.
csd_X4_5_eng.txt
They are not controlled but they are not global either i.e. they act on one qubit only, not on the the "compound wave function" so to speak... I'm not 100% sure they are irrelevant, but I'll check...
I did what I promised to do in my last message.  Hope it works.
Thank you, that would work!
