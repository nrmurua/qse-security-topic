Instead of appending the operations in, which can result in the operations moving around, the method needs to directly construct the moments of the new circuit.
Look into SupportsParameterization now that the magic method protocol is in place
Is there a known example where it happened?
I think resolving cirq.Circuit([cirq.Moment(), cirq.Moment([cirq.X(cirq.NamedQubit('q'))])]) will return a circuit with one moment instead of two. Make sure to look at the repr instead of the circuit diagram.
Thanks, that was a good example!
