QFT import fails.

The same command in the IBM Quantum Experience runs properly

No idea ?
If you update your Qiskit version the import should work, the QFT came with Terra 0.14.
Oh, sorry, I checked the version on IBM's server and Terra version given in the "Start Coding with Qiskit" manual was 0.12.0. I didn't thought about rerunning the command. They are indeed in version 0.14.1.
Thanks !
