I'm working on a generator for qsim circuits, and for certain gates that qsim does not support it decomposes the gate into a sequence that qsim does support. If there are other gates running at the same time, this can create out-of-order gates in the file, e.g.:
Is this allowed in qsim or not? Either way, can we update input_format.md to clarify this for users?
(I have no preference for whether we should support this or not - if it's currently not allowed, I can refactor my generator code.)
It depends. Your example will work. However, the following examples will not work:
or
That is gates acting on the same qubits must be in ascending order of time. This can be fixed by sorting gates or as you suggested, we can update input_format.md to clarify this.
