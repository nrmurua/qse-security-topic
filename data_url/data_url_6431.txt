New problem that I faced when using qsimcirq as backend in tfq.ControlledPQC.
I have put the cuquantum files in  /usr/local/cuquantum and in .bashrc have added these lines
followed by source  ~/.bashrc. Ran the test program given on docs site (statevec_example) which gave the result example PASSED.
Any solution for this would be helpful.
@Gopal-Dahale, can you confirm that you set up both cuQuantum and NVCC on your device before building qsim? The error you are seeing occurs when the qsim_custatevec is not initialized, which occurs if either cuQuantum or NVCC is not available when qsim is initially built.
Relevant code snippets:

@95-martin-orion  This issue is resolved for me. Here are the steps that helped me and can be used on google colab.
I think we can close this issue.
FYI, from 0.16.0, qsim uses CUQUANTUM_ROOT only, no more CUQUANTUM_DIR.
