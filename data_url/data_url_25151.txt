This is basically a mimic of #1651 except broadening the scope to non user specified Electrons (e.g. a .__getitem__ task). It was mentioned in #1651 that this would be a separate issue from the post processing Electron, so I have opened a new issue.

Thanks for this ! Been a long backlog.
@Prasy12 , can we add it in the next set of backlogs to pickup ?
