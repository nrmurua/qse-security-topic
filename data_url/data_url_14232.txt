Getting this error Cannot apply instruction with classical bits: subcircuit
Is a subcircuit always considered as having classical bits? Not sure if I understand this.
It makes sense to throw an error with measure gates but I'm not so sure with an empty sub-circuit.
No response
Your subcircuit has 8 classical bits, which are attached to qc when you append it. Since you're then trying to get the statevector of a circuit that has classical bits it seems the error message is justified ðŸ™‚
I'd say it doesn't matter what state the classical bits have, since they cannot be properly represented with the standard notion of a statevector, I think this correctly raises an error.
I was actually a bit surprised by this. When I try to run your example, I get an error when trying to append subcircuit (which is defined without any cargs) to qc with cargs:
That said, I agree with @Cryoris ' assessment that Statevector bailing as soon as it sees any classical bits is currently the right behavior. (The case could be made that it should inspect subcircuit to see if those classical bits are used anywhere, I'd be curious to hear more about how this comes up in practice to see if it's worth changing the current behavior.)
I totally agree with @Cryoris
