Being able to get the Schmidt decomposition of a bipartate state can be useful to determine its degree of entanglement, find the shared eigenvalues of its reduced subsystems, and to compare if two states are equivalent to each other (i.e., they're equiv if they share the same decomposition). It would be great if there was a function under utils, or if the Statevector class had a method to do this for a given state.
The steps to implement should be fairly straight-forward:
The function could return a list/array with each (λᵢ, |uᵢ⟩, |vᵢ⟩). Since |uᵢ⟩ and |vᵢ⟩ are normalized statevectors, they could be Statevector objects.
I'm willing to work on it if there is interest.
Thank you for your nice proposal. I agree with this direction. I think that utils is fine.
If you open the PR, I'll review it and if you have questions please contact me.
Thank you so much @ikkoham. I have had a working function for a little while now, so I thought integrating it into qiskit wouldn't be too difficult. However, I started looking into this yesterday and realized I still need a couple of things:
I am currently working on getting these fixed and will submit a PR right after. I will also let you know if I have any questions.
Thanks!
Thanks. Yes Qiskit is a little endian, that is the reverse order of usual textbook.
