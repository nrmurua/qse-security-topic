The example Jupyter notebook at https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/test.html is quite nice, but it's very strange to include this in the same spot as Mitiq examples - it's a note to contributors, not an example using Mitiq.

Can we move this to https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/toc_contributing.html under "Contributing to the documentation"?
Personally I don't dislike it too much where it is. One option could be to include it in the Contributing or Contributing to docs part.
Agreed to remove from TOC @ Mitiq meeting.
