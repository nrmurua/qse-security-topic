Since every model gives different results (including the Pre-built models). It would be interesting to have comparison utility for users which model to finally use.
Proposal:
Add comparison utility for different models.
Pseudo code
Do you propose to compare the models (conectivity\number of qubits), or compare the compilation results for the different models?
I believe comparison on the basis of compilation results for different models would prove to be more useful.
This is very interesting! For a general-use case API, there are a lot of dynamics that would need to be captured (I think). For example, most quantum algorithms require many circuit compilations during execution. Different steps of the same algorithm might be compiled widely differently. Also, there are many metrics that users might be interested in. How would you propose handling the different situations/dynamics?
