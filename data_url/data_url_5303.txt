Currently the approximation will run either when the DD grows too large or evenly interspersed between between blocks of operations in the circuit.
When creating a circuit, often it contains building blocks at whose boundaries approximation make sense. It would be nice to be able to control when the approximation is applied.
Possible ways I can think of right now:
