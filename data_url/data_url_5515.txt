qflex has a variable num_qubits which is read in as the first line of an input file, and is assumed to be the number of qubits in a rectangular grid of size I * J. (All qubits set to off are ignored.)
ShallowQC also has a variable named num_qubits, which is also read in as the first line of an input file, but denotes the number of qubits in the circuit. Consequently, when qflex reads in a ShallowQC circuit file, it has to read the first line into a dummy variable, then calculate num_qubits based on I and J.
The file formats should be reconciled so that circuit files can be shared without modifications to inputs or source code.
The clock cycles are also counted differently. In the long term, should probably converge on the "qsim" format.
From what I understand, the ShallowQC project has been dropped.
ShallowQC has indeed been discontinued. I think it makes sense to defer the convergence with qsim until it is open sourced, because qsim's format may change before that happens. I propose to close this issue.
