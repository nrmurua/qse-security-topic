Using 1.0 rc3 on Windows, bit of a stupid bug but if you accidentally move one of the experiment panels too high such that the title bar is obscured by the GUI title bar, you can't access it. You're then forced to reset the gui through its pyon file. Could the experiment panels have a limit to how high they can be moved?
Doesn't a scroll bar appear in this case?
That's what it does here, note the scroll bar on the right.

You're right, thanks.
