The docstring for pi_check is inaccurate.
To fix this, one needs to read and test the code to see what the code does. Finding what the code does and expressing it in a doc string is relatively easy.  But we need to document the part we want to guarantee. Possibly make some changes if it does not do what we really want.

It's always fine to get the docstring in order, but I don't think pi_check should be documented publicly (and honestly, I don't think it should exist at all, other than as probably 3 separate private helpers in the drawers).
I was calling pi_check on various numbers, wondering when it might return False or "false" or throw an error or something.
Yes it's clear that fixing the doc string is not the best thing one could do with this code. But it's perhaps the easiest improvement. I thought that the title of this issue was better than "Do something about pi_check".
We could remove the doc string altogether. Or write a better one and put a # symbol at the beginning of each line. Or split the function up and move it elsewhere.
I intended this issue to be a quick note as a reminder to make a relatively quick fix.
