Is there any way of specifying the subnet mask on the KC705? We can't connect to the board unless we're on the same subnet, which is not always the case for even computers in the same room. We can work around this but it be easier if we could specify the subnet on the KC705.
subnet mask is not the limiting factor here. needs a default gateway.
both (netmask and gateway) are storage entries like ip. try that.
Okay. Could this be added to the installation page, then?
Adding the subnet and gateway worked, thanks.
