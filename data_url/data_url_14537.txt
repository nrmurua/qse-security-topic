As for the deprecation I think that probably makes sense, but we maybe should do that in a follow up because I don't know how widely used it is

Some more detail: #7036 found substantial performance improvements by moving away from usage of Layout.__getitem__ in favor of fetching Layout.get_{virtual,physical}_bits. Given how core the Layout object is to the performance of many transpiler passes, we should look in to either updating the implementation of Layout.__getitem__ and similar to be more performant (maybe checking input type before deciding to check _v2p or _p2v?) or restructuring the API (deprecating getitem`?) so other pass developers can avoid the same performance concerns.
