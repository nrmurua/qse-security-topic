When transpiling circuits for a real backend and circuit contain no cnots, transpiler gets stuck (does not return to caller).
Does not happen when circuit contains cnots or cz gates.
Does not happen with qiskit 0.36.2 (qiskit-terra 0.20.2)
Transpiler should return transpiled circuits after a few seconds for small input circuits (as in the example).
