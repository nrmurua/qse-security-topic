It seems that in new matplotlib version they separated classes Axes and Axes3d, so some plotting functions that have 3d aspects don't work as expected anymore. See example in the code below.
There should be a plot and not an error

This seems to be because of this change: https://matplotlib.org/3.8.0/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_3.8.0.html#axes3d
The solution from the docs:
The w_xaxis, w_yaxis, and w_zaxis attributes are now removed. Instead use xaxis, yaxis, and zaxis.
