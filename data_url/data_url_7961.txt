My CI builds are suddenly erroring out:
No response
no exception
This exact same environment was working in yesterday's CI build. We speculate that Cython's major release yesterday is related.
Thank you for reporting.
Yes, Qutip does not work with cython 3.0.0.

I think this has been resolved by #2220
