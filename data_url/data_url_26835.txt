Since #358 the performance tests on GPU and CPU are missing the results for RI-MP / RI-RPA. This is most likely because the regex mention in the report don't match any more:
I only noticed this by chance. In general it would have been better if the test failed entirely.
I am responsible for #358. I have read access to the files on Daint. Due to error message in the slurm output, there is a truncated message from mpi_sendrecv in mp2_ri_gpw/compute_2c_integrals. The regtests are running. I have a look at it now.
Fixed.
