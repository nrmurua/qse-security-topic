If a QuantumCircuit is executed with an initialize command, a RuntimeError is thrown whenever the state chosen to initialize has complex amplitudes. (This problem has occurred upon updating to qiskit==0.18 it does not occur for qiskit==0.17)
The error:
The issue is that because of the way the terra Instruction checks param values the complex values of the array are being added to the params list as numpy.complex128 instead of standard python complex, and these weren't caught by the pybind11 wrapper to C++.
@ereastman is working on adding support for that to the wrappers, but probably the Instruction object should be modified to call tolist on Numpy arrays if it is storing the array as a param list, or better yet the param should store the full numpy vector since it is more efficient to pass Numpy arrays to C++ through Pybind11.
A work around in the meantime is to call tolist yourself like this:
This should be fixed by #697
