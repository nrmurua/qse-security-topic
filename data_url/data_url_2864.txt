The explanation of ExtrapolatableGate should be expanded with more examples and should mention that in most cases, the continuous parameter is periodic. We should add an explanation of the relation between gate exponentiation by turns and rotations by radians, which applies in all existing use cases. We should support initialization of common gates with radians too.
One of the reasons I made sure gates forced the half_turns= keyword was to allow for adding support for radians later. Currently it's blocked by Symbol not allowing scaling.
...alternatively, we could support symbol for half_turns but not for radians. It looks kinda gross:
Whereas if Symbol supported addition and scaling then it would just be:
Though all this logic could be pushed into the canonicalize method.
I'm thinking that the user should be forced to use either half_turns or radians, and providing both is an error. Using both to mean "add these" seems kind of unnatural.
Ah yeah, that's probably best.
Fixed in #494 ? @Strilanc
Yup, fixed by #494
