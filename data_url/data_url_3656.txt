The getting started sections and the source code docs are missing for how to define parameterized gates such as a controlled RY rotation.
One other point is that it can be dangerous for us to import functions named sin and cos. User behavior may be to do from pyquil.parameters import sin, cos which could cause unexpected overwrites of the built in Python functions.  We could make is clear that best practice in the docs is import pyquil.parameters as ps or something.  Still perhaps we should rename them? Thoughts @stevenheidel ?
We could rename them it's just a question of what to rename them to
Maybe quil_sin or pq_sin for pyquil sin?
Okay I tried but couldn't think of better names so I'm happy with quil_sin, quil_exp, etc
I wrote this part of the documentation, but I got some error in the parser after changing sin to quil_sin and I can't solve it by myself. Could you help? @stevenheidel @willzeng
My code is here: https://github.com/mstechly/pyquil/tree/fix/paramater_quil_names
The error message (last part) is:
I suspected the "_" in the function name, but after changing to 'quilcos' it also returned an error.
I've generated parser code as suggested here, but I have not commited it.
Also _parser/gen3/QuilParser.py has not changed after running the antl4 command, especially in literalNames sin has not changed into quil_sin.
Should this be updated manually or not?
@mstechly - I think this ticket wasn't clear enough, sorry. In Quil the functions are named sin and cos, this is not changing. It's just a Python problem. Will was suggesting changing the function names in pyquil.parameters package, not in the Quil grammar.
Or change to classes and rename 'Cos', 'Sin' etc. They're instance factories anyways, and all the other expressions are classes. e.g. Something like...
