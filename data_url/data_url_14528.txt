Given a set of Kraus operators for a channel, the method should return the set of Kraus operators for the complementary channel.
This channel is needed to compute the quantum mutual information and the coherent information of a given channel, for example in https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01286. The Kraus class already has methods for the adjoint channel, the conjugate channel and the transpose channel. Adding the complementary channel and the adjoint complementary channel 'completes' the picture.
I will give it a shot and report back during the week
I wrote a quick and dirty implementation of the algorithm at this link in this file (look at the complementary_channel property in the class Channel). Will need to be improved a lot, at least for readability and maintainability, before adding it to Qiskit. @tyrolize mabe we could work together on this?
sure, let me know if I can help you with something.
otherwise it looks like you already have some good progress, I'll start working on other issues
