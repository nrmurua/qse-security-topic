When passing sesolve a time independent Hamiltonian, there is still time-dependent evolution returned. It seems to depend on the number of time steps passed to the solver, with more time steps giving more drastic time-dependent evolution.

The graph provided should be a flat line, indicating no time evolution.

This plot shows a loss in population when beginning in the x state of a simple two level system. Playing around with the code, I find the slope of this line changes as you give a different number of points in tlist. This also happens with mesolve and mcsolve with no collapse operators (although I suspect this is because behind the scenes, it's just using sesolve).
This is numerical error from the ODE solver.
Try changing the solver tolerance:
sesolve(..., options=Options(atol=1e-10)
Thanks for the help! I've tried changing both atol and rtol up to 10^-30 to no effect. I've also (I think) played with all of the solver settings that are relevant to sesolve to no effect.
This is what I get by changing atol:
