Pauli and PauliList have a method delete to delete elements (qubits from a Pauli; Paulis or qubits from a PauliList).
This method accepts a list specifying the indices to delete. However, it raises an error when the list is empty. It would be helpful for programmatic use of delete if an empty-list (empty iterable) would instead delete nothing, i.e. return a copy of the original Pauli/PauliList object. This would also be in line with the behavior of np.delete(), which is expected here since Paulis are built on, and nominally act like, numpy arrays.
Case 1:
Case 2:
Case 3:
Do not raise an error. Return a copy of the original object.

This seems sensible to me - I think there's quite a lot of places within quantum_info that don't quite have correct handling for the empty list, and I'm generally in favour of giving them the expected behaviour.
This seems like a rather easy thing to fix. If there's no rush, I can look into it next week.
Sounds good to me, thanks!
