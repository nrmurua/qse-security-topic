When instantiating a new register (Quantum, Classic or Ancilla) by supplying a list of Bit(s), it is possible to specify the same Bit(s) more than once, resulting in unintended behavior.

Register instantiation based on bit(s) list should check for identical entries.

It would seem that we can resolve this issue by adding the bits parameter duplicates check routine into the constructor of the qiskit.circuit.register.Register class.

Could I take this one?
