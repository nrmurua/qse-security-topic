Description
Got error  File "c:\users\mdecandia\desktop\env\lib\site-packages\dimod\bqm\__init__.py", line 16, in <module> from dimod.bqm.adjarraybqm import AdjArrayBQM ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.
when running dwave setup after installing dwave-ocean-sdk in a fresh virtual environment on Windows.
Installing the latest version of Visual C++ from here fixed the issue.
Steps To Reproduce
Possible Root Cause
From @randomir:
A basic (or universal) MSVC redistributable (a collection of DLLs for C/C++ programs compiled with MS VC++) comes with Windows, and the problem (like this) usually arises when the C++ program/compiler uses some "too modern" features that require a newer VC redist. (For example, that's what happened here: Issue 577
Environment
Additional Context
Windows was running on a VM using VMware Fusion
