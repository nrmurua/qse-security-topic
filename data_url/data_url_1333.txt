Description of the issue
This is probably due to our ramp up to Cirq 1.0, but none of the links to the Cirq docs that are indexed by Google search work anymore. Even the links in the docs themselves 404.
How to reproduce the issue
Google a Cirq  functionality and click on the first quantumai.google link

Cirq version
Cirq master and 0.14.1
This might be more so to Google search indexing than the docs themselves. I can access stuff by going to the quantumai.google site so this might not really be a bug. Closing.
Re-opening cause this was brought on on the Cirq sync.
Cirq cync:   Most of these should be fixed now with added redirects.  A few remaining stragglers will remain, but should disappear over time.
If we see any more bad links, please post them here and we can add redirects.  Otherwise, these should disappear.

Looks like this is not an issue anymore. Will re-open if I run into it again.
