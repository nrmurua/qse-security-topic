Hi,
I tried to use "multiRotatePauli()" function in c++, but it gave an error message:  _error: no matching function for call to       'multiRotatePauli'
multiRotatePauli(qubits, (int[]) {0,1}, (int[]) {2,3}, 2, .1)
note: candidate function not viable: no known conversion from 'int [2]' to 'enum pauliOpType ' for 3rd argument
void multiRotatePauli(Qureg qureg, int targetQubits, enum pauliOpType targetPaulis, int nu..._*. do anyone know how to use this function?
Try defining the arguments separately:
I've struggles getting the enumerated paulis working, but the above works for me.
Hi all,
A one-liner is possible, without any warnings.
In C99:
InC++11, you'll need to use the enums:
I'm kicking myself for not aliasing pauliOpType. It was originally an internal type which only appeared later in the API since it was quick & easy. Ho hum!
