It would be nice to be able to write `ket("1101")`` to generate a multiparticle state.
Doing the same with with a typical approach is a bit more cumbersome:
Example for braket notation in QuTiP (just try to imagine some of the examples typed in the basis/tensor way):

I found this notation useful for my own purposes. I am not sure how well does it go with  QuTiP so I refrained from a pull-request-surprise.
Hi. It's looking good. But have you seen the function qstate? It does something similar. But you implementation seems more general so it would be great if you could go a head and create a PR and then we could continue the discussion there.
I missed qstate for some reason, thanks for pointing to it. Anyway, I needed something more general.
Anyway, I was thinking how to combine different notations.
That is, for qubits, people use:
and, of course, numbers.
I was thinking about making a dictionary, but I am not sure if it is going to help or not (e.g. there may be intersecting conventions). But it would be nice to write e.g.:
I will clean things and do a PR.
