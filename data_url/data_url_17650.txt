It is the same as the issue here. After upgrading to qiskit 0.7, there appears to be qiskit directory empty and does not contain packages that can be imported. I suspect something not right when upgrading.
Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#464
See: Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#464
Import succeeds.
Closing, as the original issue in Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#464 seems to be resolved.
Resolved by a workaround. Imho, we should test the upgrade steps and document them well too.
