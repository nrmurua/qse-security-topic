I followed the instructions on the site here, but still get the following error message:
Here is my pip list:
I'm on Windows 11 running from a mingw32 (git shell)
Windows hasn't been supported for a while now. I think TFQ 0.3 was the last version to support it. You can always install that version from source.
Did I miss this somewhere? If not, then it might be good to update the installation instructions:
https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/install
https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/master/docs/install.md
I could create a PR for the latter if you like, but wouldn't be able to do anything about the TF website obviously.
I'm not sure if it's in the install docs or not. I think the windows build was on the todo list (at one point), but I think it's been pushed back for a while. If you are on windows (like I am) you can always use colab, or WSL, or any cloud compute.
Thanks, that is what I have done in the end - use WSL. I just think that it would be helpful to others if they knew that Windows is not currently supported, so there is not time wasted or more issues created like this one.
