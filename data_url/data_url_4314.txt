At least the underscore classifies it as internal, but it is then exposed by the Circuit.queue attribute, that is used everywhere in qibolab, e.g.:
https://github.com/qiboteam/qibolab/blob/4b17d657b72026c16f18f0434fe8d8a0120a7d48/src/qibolab/backends.py#L90
(and I'm also attempting to use it in qibotn)
I agree, we should remove the underscore. I guess the original motivation was to keep the queue private (I think in the past it was also Circuit._queue) and expose only what is needed through the Circuit object. However Queue also implements the moments which are useful externally, such as in qibolab, so it is probably better to expose it directly. It should be easy to rename.
What do you think about the fact that it inherits list? In principle we could also remove this inheritance to keep the object simpler.

We could, I agree. I don't believe to be crucial: I read multiple times people warning about inheriting builtins, but never found a good motivation.
Moreover, the object itself is quite nice and intuitive :) (i.e. it is really behaving like a list)
If you like more to drop inheritance in favor of composition is fine by me, but I would just decouple from the _ change, because the latter is non-breaking and "urgent", while the inheritance it might be a nice-to-have.
