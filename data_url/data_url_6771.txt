qWireY, qGateY, cWireY in QuantumCircuit class are never defined before use. This is causing error when building the package.
They could be fixed by adding var before qWireY, qGateY, cWireY at line 7445, line 7449, line 7453 in /dist/quantum-circuit.js file
@tat757 this is fixed now.
Thank you for reporting!
