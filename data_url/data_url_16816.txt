I can acquire the same channel within the same instruction:
Acquire(5)([AcquireChannel(0), AcquireChannel(0)], [MemorySlot(0), MemorySlot(1)])
This should raise an error
Could be validated at assemble time
This should be resolved by #3574.
Looks like this bug has been fixed.
raises a PulseError (PulseError: 'Overlap on channel AcquireChannel(0) over time range [0, 5]')
