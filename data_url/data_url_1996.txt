From the doc string:
Operations marked with this tag are presumed to have zero duration of their own, although they may have a non-zero duration if run in the same Moment as a non-virtual operation.
It is strange that it both does and does not have duration.  The places this is used are for Virtual gates, which are gates that are compiled out when the circuit is run, and (potentially) in Channels where it means "ignore this because I've already touched it" #2719 #2789
These seem like different things.
Oh I misread the documentation.  This is if they are in the same moment.  OK.  But still think we should be a bit more clear about virtual, since it is true that they have no duration, but they also have non-local effects on the execution of the circuit.
