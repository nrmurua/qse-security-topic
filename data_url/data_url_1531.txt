Description of the issue
I have a project that depends on cirq. It has tests. When I run said tests I literally get more than 10,000 deprecation warnings, most of which are cirq related. A majority of these warnings I cannot address myself because they are occurring within the cirq library itself or its dependencies. This makes it difficult for me to find deprecation warnings (i.e. for other dependencies) that I should actually be concerned with.
Here is a simple example:
invoking pytest on this test throws 100 warnings. It looks like most of them are traced to code locations such as
/cirq_google/engine/client/quantum_v1alpha1/proto/quantum_pb2.py:874
and
/cirq_google/engine/client/quantum_v1alpha1/proto/quantum_pb2.py:860
Cirq version
You can get the cirq version by printing cirq.__version__. From the command line:
0.13.0
How are you running pytest? I can't reproduce this issue?
I am using python 3.9.7, pytest 6.2.4, and cirq 0.13.0. i'll make a clean virtual env and see if I can reproduce it there.
After making a clean virtual environment and reinstalling all my dependencies, I no longer see the warnings either. I can't reproduce this now. Sorry for the bother!
