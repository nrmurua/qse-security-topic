All CI runs are currently failing due to additional deprecation warnings being issued by a transitive dependency jsonschema updating its version to 4.0, which issues new deprecation warnings (released about 4 hours ago).
Run CI tests.
CI tests don't fail.
The deprecation warning appears to be caused by behaviour within nbformat, which we use (again, transitively through jupyter), which doesn't look harmful, so the best solution is probably to permit this deprecation warning until nbformat updates, rather than constraining the version.
Let's just pin this in constraints until nbformat releases a fix
Ok, very reasonable.  Done in #7091.
