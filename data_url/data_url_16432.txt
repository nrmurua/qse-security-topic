The following code breaks if basis_gates=['u3'] and optimization_level=3.
It works for basis_gates=['u3','cx'] or if optimization_level<=2.
Edit: changed to a simpler example.
Transpile with only a single qubit gate, if possible (or throw a meaningful error).
i got expected behaviour , try updating or moving to another low version of terra or other
On stable it still works, right, but we should fix it on the master version (ideally before the release). Which versions did you try for transpiling? I'm running on 5bdd12d (version of July 30th).
