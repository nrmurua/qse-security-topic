Using Aer statevector backend the VQE evals in paulis mode become progressively slower. A simple test over 250 evals using H2 with 6-31g basis and RYRZ var form took roughly 4 times longer with caching enabled than without.
The issue only exists when using following setting
Since VQE will use Aer's expectation instruction to manipulate the qobj load from cache; however, the qobj is a reference; therefore, with more iterations, the qobj become larger and larger.
