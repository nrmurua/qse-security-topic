Steps to reproduce:
The depth result is -1 (should be 1 since there is 1 gate)
I think the issue is from the DirectedBoostGraph::depth() method.
I think it subtracts 2 due to the Initial and Final nodes. That's probably the source of error.
I think the logic of -2 is okay, but in this edge case of a single gate somehow DirectedBoostGraph::depth() returns 1 (it should return 3, I think).
@amccaskey checking other cases, I think you're right :)
We shouldn't subtract 2  in Circuit::depth()
