A user may want to only use the part of the EmbeddingComposite layer that handles seamlessly embedding and unembedding, but not calculate a new embedding each time. They may already have an embedding or they may want to use another tool (other than minorminer) to calculate their embedding.
As well, this logic is duplicated in VirtualGraph. Having the embed --> sample --> unembed workflow in one place would make it easier to update in the future.
