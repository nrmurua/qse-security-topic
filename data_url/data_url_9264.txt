Describe the bug
Trying to run .ci/run doc serve (with AND without the --light flag) after an initial successful run (which produces /docs/build/ and /docs/src/assets/indigo.css) causes the command to get stuck in an infinite loop where it seems to constantly re-render documentation from the command line output. Attempting to access localhost:8000 during this just produces a broken page or a file directory in the browser.
A temporary workaround is after each time .ci/run doc serve is executed, rm docs/build/ and docs/src/assets/indigo.css so the next run doesn't infinitely cycle.
