In the tutorial "Tutorial 2. Field calculations - dielectric energy participation ratios (EPRs).ipynb", it is described how to use the Fields Calculator. The example code tries to include the corresponding class by
from pyEPR.core import CalcObject
When trying to execute that, I get the error ImportError: cannot import name 'CalcObject' from 'pyEPR.core'.
This is because CalcObject is defined in ansys.py, not in core.py.  Indeed, with
from pyEPR.ansys import CalcObject
the import works again.
So I think it would be good to either adjust the template to this or to update core.py so that CalcObject is really imported.
👏👏👏 You are awesome! Thank you for making your first issue to pyEPR ' first issue
