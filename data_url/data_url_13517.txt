I encounter two behaviours:
Strangely, test pass on CI.
Note that pip install  -r docs/requirements.txt  has some errors due to conflicts in cirq version requested.
Use the about() function to summarize information on operating system, python version and dependencies.
Additional Python Environment Details (pip freeze or conda list):
Can't reproduce, but doc tests aren't actually running in CI... See #535.
I propose we merge #509 first as that has many doc changes, then patch this.
I can reproduce the doctest failures on the current master release. Just checked out up to date master and ran make doctest in the docker container.
I also  went back to the 0.4 release tag and it worked there, albeit with some warnings from the same guide page where we are now getting the errors. Seems to be a regression since the last release.
It seems like at least part of the issue is that there are doctests that require the testing framework to load an IBMQ account: https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/blob/master/docs/source/guide/guide-ibmq-backends.rst#high-level-usage
I can't find anywhere where we are providing credentials for this, it seems like we should revisit how/if we want to test this.
