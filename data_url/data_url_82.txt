There's too much pattern matching on specific trees of IR nodes here. I think we should perform a reaching data-flow analysis over the function to determine what classical operations use the result(s) of a quantum measurement (a transitive closure). That set can then be examined to determine any control operations or control dependent subgraphs of the CFG.

The long-term plan is that we won't need the QuakeAddMetadataPass. That is - we should be able to update the simulator to not depend on the qubitMeasurementFeedback attribute and instead make "on the fly" decisions about path splitting with respect to the state vector.
Also note that this is somewhat related to #782.
