In lieu of directly exponentiating a Hamiltonian, each term of the expansion can be iteratively applied to a clone of the state. This can already be done hardware-agnostically using the clone and pauli functions, but there may be a smarter parallelisation.
Note this requires a specification of a Hamiltonian in the Pauli basis, and may require/lead-on to thinking about representations of more general operators in QuEST
