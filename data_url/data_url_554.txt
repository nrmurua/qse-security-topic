Just starting a thread to keep track of xacc DEB packaging.
Let's start with Ubuntu 18.04 (16.04 is sufficiently old, and not easy to ensure proper compiler version are available). We should be able to create xacc_1.0.0-bionic.deb packages via Docker CI. apt install gcc default gives version 7.5, so thats good. gcc-8 is also available and its at version 8.4 which is also acceptable. So we can hook up CPack to create this deb, and it should depend on python3, libpython3-dev, python3-pip (all give version 3.6.9 which is good), libblas-dev, liblapack-dev, gcc-8, g++-8, libcurl4-openssl-dev.
Where to install? Will need to install to /usr/local/xacc probably, and maybe update existing plugins to check that path in addition to $HOME/.xacc

For ubuntu 20.04, default gcc is version 9.3, python3 is 3.8.2
If we set this up via github pages, then I think the proper way would be with the following directory structure
(assume its at me.github.io/my-site)
my-site/debian/dists/{bionic, focal}
and the sources.list.d file would look like
deb https://me.github.io/my-site/debian/dists/bionic ./
