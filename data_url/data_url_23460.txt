This can be exposed by reordering tests for example with https://pypi.org/project/pytest-randomly/
It turns out that this is due to a bug in pyvisa-sim requireing the resource manager to also be shutdown.  pyvisa/pyvisa-sim#82
We could perhaps extend close to also kill the resource manager if we are running on a simulated instrument.
Reopened since the solution did not work and is reverted in #5363
A draft solution is in #5360
