I just pulled QCoDeS v0.1.11 and tried to run py.test. This failed on a missing import of hypothesis simply pip installing hypothesis solved the problem. A quick check revealed that hypothesis is missing from requirements.txt.
Hi Adriaan the requirements that are only needed for testing are in test_requirements.txt
