After installing cuda-quantum via pip, the  site-packages directory looks like this:
I think the include/ (C++ header files) and lib64/ (static .a files) directories are not necessary (deleting them seems to be fine for some Python examples that I tried).
Moving lib/ and targets/ directories into cudaq/ would also be nice (seems to work out-of-the-box)
The cudaq/_cudaq.cpp file is not necessary for the Python package as well I reckon.
