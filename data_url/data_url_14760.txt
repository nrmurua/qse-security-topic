Hey @nonhermitian , Is this still open? I'm a newbie but I'd like to try to contribute to this if I can.
In #3325 , the module got the toc for its components. But it was merged the same day as this issue was submitted. So I assume that @nonhermitian refers to module level documentation beyond just the index. Like an actual  explanation of the module, with examples and text.
are you still interested @abhik-99 ?
