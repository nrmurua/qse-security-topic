The plot option in single_shot_fidelities_2D requires one or both of PyPlot.jl or LaTeXStrings.jl.
Should we just make PyPlot one of the dependencies?
I'm fine with PyPlot but if anyone has experience with Plots.jl I'd be curious if it really  is a backend agnostic option.
I've never tried Plots.jl
I tried Plots.jl at some point. By default it pulls in some other backend which is definitely not as pretty as PyPlot. And if you really want fine control over your plots, you probably need to dig into a specific backend. However, for most things it's probably okay.
Not sure what to recommend here. In the short term, I would just add PyPlot as a dependency.
