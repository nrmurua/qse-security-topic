In Dilithium5, shouldn't the parameter "PQCLEAN_DILITHIUM5_CLEAN_CRYPTO_BYTES" be 4595? But I saw that its value in "api.h" is 4627. Why is this?
The correct value is 4627.
This is due to the change that was included in the NIST draft
If you look at Section 1.3.2, NIST writes:
Extending cËœ adds 32 bytes compared to previous version of Dilithium (which had 4595-byte signatures).
This is reflected in pq-crystals/dilithium@7c3f547.
Unfortunately, NIST forgot to update the values in Table 2 of the draft spec.
See NIST's statement here: https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/EKoI0u_PuOw/m/xQVnr5D0AQAJ
Adding to @mkannwischer's comment; the api.h in the pq-crystals/dilithium repository has not been updated to reflect the above change (even though params.h has).
