Currently, the NumpyEigensolver implements a _eval_aux_operators which evaluates the auxiliary operators on the excited states.
Without much effort and using an equality in the form of Eq. 13 in https://doi.org/10.1103%2Fphysrevresearch.3.023244, we can extend it to evaluate transition amplitudes for the same auxiliary operators between two eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.
This would allow, among other, the evaluation of non-adiabatic couplings between the excited states (see in the same article).
The idea would be to have a static method for two fixed eigenstates:
which would be called by a higher level method for a Dict of pairs (i, j)
If we add such a functionality to the class it would be nice if all Eigensolvers can do that. Is this something we could also do for other excited states calculators in Terra or is it based on the fact that you have access to the statevectors?
A good point raised by @Cryoris offline is that this could become a standalone method very close to the eval_observables of the aux_ops_estimator. This way it would also be usable for VQD.
I also wanted to add that this feature is also currently under work for the excited-state solvers in qiskit-nature.
