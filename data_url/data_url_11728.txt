When I use python to run the sample program in the aqua's README about
Creating Your First Qiskit Chemistry Programming Experiment, some error comes out
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "Algorithms/VQE/qiskit_sample.py", line 18, in 
qubitOp = qubitOp.two_qubit_reduced_operator(num_particles)
AttributeError: 'WeightedPauliOperator' object has no attribute 'two_qubit_reduced_operator'
Thanks for reporting, it seems the sample was not updated after the recent Operator refactoring
