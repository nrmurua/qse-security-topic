When suservo channels clip somwhere in a longer sequence, it is often non-obvious what the cause is. In particular, if offset calibrations/... are slightly off, channels might clip low for very low power setpoints.
Add extra bits to the clip word to disambiguate between high/low clipping for each channel, and update artiq.gateware.suservo.iir.IIR to set them.
