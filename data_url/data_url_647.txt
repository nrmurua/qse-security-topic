This could help with deployment in #30
https://github.com/mrtazz/restclient-cpp
What's the license on RestClient-CPP?
MIT License
It wraps libcurl, so I feel like it will be easier for users to have that on their system, then a very specific version of openssl
Yea that was nice üëç
With this we would have users
to a system path thats always in LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Then
to install the os-specific pre-built wheel.
