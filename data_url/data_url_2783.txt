This method is used preferentially over repr in Jupyter notebooks and in ipython:
repr is supposed to be unambiguous, so we often can't be too creative with it. In order to make the ipython experience smoother we should show coarser easier to read information.
Circuit works the way it should (pretty printing a circuit), but e.g. TrialResult does not. Support is generally very easy, because our __str__ methods do the hard lifting:
We don't have many implementations of this.  It is probably most urgent for "heavy" objects since otherwise it uses repr.
Here is a pass on object we should consider making sure we have this for
Some of these may already be done or covered by superclasses.
I guess we also have guidance to use repr_pretty for Gates.  So we should do a complete audit.
There are now on results and on devices.
