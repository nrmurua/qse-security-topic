SequencePulseTemplate.__init__ currently has an optional keyword argument Ã¨xternal_parameters. If provided, the external parameters are checked to be equal to it.
This feature has seen no use in real world applications and is buggy. I suggest removing it.
I think as a first step, we should mark is as deprecated.
I have done so in the pull request above. We could also think about setting the default value for allow_partial_parameter_mapping in MappingPulseTemplate to True and thus further relax the strictness of mapping specifications.
Or introduce a convenience function?
Implemented in #243
