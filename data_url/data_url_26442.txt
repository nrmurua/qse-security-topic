I am not 100% sure when it is needed, but I had to insist for SIRIUS build to use the proper libvdwx location. I don't see how it would hurt to always do this.
It seems my build currently works well without this patch. I needed it for CP2K 7.1. So maybe the issue can just be closed â€¦
Thanks for reporting. Many toolchain fixes have been applied since version 7.1 and it is quite likely that this issue was resolved.
