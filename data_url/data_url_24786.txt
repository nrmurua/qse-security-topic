The translation of pulses to pulse-control should be relatively easily achieved by implementing a specialized SequencingHardwareInterface which translates elemtary instantiated PulseTemplates into pulse-control MATLAB structs similar to how the plotting works in the corresponding development branch. This task is concerned with the first implementation of such a subclass of SequencingHardwareInterface.
