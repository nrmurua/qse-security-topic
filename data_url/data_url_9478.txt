The constraint on the sum of weights in DetuningMap (sum of weights = 1) was introduced because detuning sent via the DMM was thought to be redistributed between the atoms.
In fact, as underlined by @Lassabliere, some other physical effects are at stake and limit the minimum detuning of each atom more than the minimum detuning that can be sent via the laser.
Moreover, deleting this constraint eases the use of DMM and DetuningMap.
Going over the devices specs, the specs for the bottom detuning of Chadoq2 is wrong, since it is -20 MHz so $-2 \pi 20 rad/\mu s$, that should be fixed as well.
