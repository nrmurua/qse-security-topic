Currently we have get_device_specification, but that returns a proto.  Typically you take that and then pass it directly to a SerializableDevice.from_proto.  It would make more sense, I think to just have get_device() on the EngineProcessor which returns the cirq.Device object.
Is there something in the proto that doesn't end up in the device that is important?
