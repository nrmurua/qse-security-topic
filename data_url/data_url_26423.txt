ðŸ‘‹ trying to build the latest release, but run into some build issue. The error log is as below:
full build log, https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/actions/runs/5692000123/job/15428333003
my local build log (ventura arm), https://gist.github.com/chenrui333/55cfeb72d0f8087dcd1e1d9b47587848
relates to Homebrew/homebrew-core#137880
Did you check this HowTo?
We did, and have built cp2k in Homebrew for several years now. More specifically, the exact same build process was working in 2023.1 and is now failing with 2023.2
I couldn't find any reference to libint in the 2023.2 release notes, is there a change in the requirements there? We build cp2k against libint-v2.6.0-cp2k-lmax-5 from https://github.com/cp2k/libint-cp2k/releases/download/v2.6.0/libint-v2.6.0-cp2k-lmax-5.tgz which seems to be the latest version available
To the best of my knowledge, nothing has changed with respect to libint 2.6.0 in 2023.2. The macOS Apple M1 regression test works for 2023.2, but, note, that gcc@12 is used instead of the default GCC 13 in the corresponding arch file.
Hum, not sure what happened, but a re-run on our CI worked this time (Homebrew/homebrew-core#141288). Intermittent linking error seems like a weird thing, but hey, it built on all machines this time. Maybe a new version of something fixed it.
This can be closed.
