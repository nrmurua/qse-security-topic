and the report shows as follows:
The above errors say that libraries of pybind are not installed correctly in your environment. Could you tell how did you install qiskit-aer in your env?
I just pip install qiskit, and I've tried to  install it with 'pip install qiskit-aer', but the problem stayed the same.
is controller_wrappers.cp39-win_amd64.pyd in c:\users\linya\appdata\local\programs\python\python39\lib\site-packages\qiskit\providers\aer\backends\?

yes, it is.
@arsenallin can you re-setup your python environment? I guess you now do not use Anaconda, which is recommended for qiskit installation: https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html
We tested Aer on several Windows machines and have not encountered this issue.
There is no response for more month. Please post a new issue if this issue is happened again.
I have the same issue, the error is:
qiskit.exceptions.MissingOptionalLibraryError: "The 'qiskit-aer' library is required to use 'Aer provider'. You can install it with 'pip install qiskit-aer'."
@sashofthedark
Do you use virtual environment of Anaconda? If your error still exists though you follow instructions in  https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html, please open a new issue with information of your environment.
I have the same error and i tried it with a virtualenv and with conda, no difference in the erro rmessage.
If i go with pip install qiskit-aer i get the response that this package is allready installed.
I tried to install other versions of qiskit-aer(0.9.3, 11.0, 0.11.2), no difference.
My packages in the virtualenv are(from pip list):
My packages in the conda env are(from conda list):
I am totaly lost I am using venv from pycharm and it is absolut WTF in one notebook it is working absolutely fine in the other I am geting the erore I try re-installing package without difrence one notbook works fine other one not.
I encountered the same error:
"The 'qiskit-aer' library is required to use 'Aer provider'. You can install it with 'pip install qiskit-aer'."
The script that I am trying to run has worked a few hours ago and I did not change anything. I also did not install any new packages on my computer. The code just suddenly stopped working and I am breaking my head to find out how to fix it.
If I try pip install qiskit-aer, I get the response that the package is allready installed.
I deleted the old environment and created a new one, making a fresh install of Qiskit but the issue persists.
I rebooted the computer, created another new environment and tried again but I get the same error.
I am using Qiskit installed via pip install qiskit in an Anaconda environment with Python 3.11.2 on Windows 10.
I tried Aer's 'aer_simulator' and 'aer_simulator_statevector' but neither works. Perhaps there is any other simulator I can use locally, since this one seems to behave unexpectedly?

I have found what caused the error in my case. Maybe it will work for some of you.
In my case the bug was related to how I import Aer. I changed the way of how I import Aer (I suppose the one I used is deprecated) and now it is fine. Still I have no idea why the old method stopped working so suddenly, but at least now it works.
Before I had:
from qiskit import Aer
and in the code I used:
 backend = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator_stabilizer')
Now I have:
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator
And in the code I use:
backend = AerSimulator()
