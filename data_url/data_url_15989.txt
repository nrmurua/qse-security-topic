The InstructionScheduleMap allows to add callable schedules. This works for normal callables, but fails for callables defined with partial.
A minimal example is:
Adding the second callable schedule partial(callable_schedule2, amplitude=.4) should have worked.
Modify the line func_parameters = list(inspect.signature(schedule).parameters.keys()) from the add method so that the correct signature is used.
