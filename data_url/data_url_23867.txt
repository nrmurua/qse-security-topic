The current version of qcodes does not work with pyqtgraph 0.9.8, it does work with 0.9.10. Where can we add checks on the versions of packages? For a normal python package the place for this is setup.py, but this is not yet present in qcodes.
@eendebakpt I just updated the docs and included dependency versions in the main README. But you're right, we should make a setup.py and requirements.txt fairly soon. I'll leave this issue open until we do.
And thanks for the info on pyqtgraph 0.9.8 - Always a bit frustrating working with v0 packages...
huh, I thought my comment on #22 would have automatically closed this when I merged it, but it didn't.
