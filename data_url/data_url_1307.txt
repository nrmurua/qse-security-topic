Description of the issue
The program dev_tools/modules.py exits with a confusing and user-unfriendly error message if it is invoked without any arguments. At the same time, it is not obvious (or at least, I haven't found it mentioned in the docs) that not passing any arguments to it is unsupported.
How to reproduce the issue
In a shell, with the current directory being the top level of the Cirq source code repo cloned from GitHub, run the following command:
Cirq version
0.16.0.dev
Additional comments
A user coming to Cirq might reasonably try to run python dev_tools/modules.py, not knowing ahead of time what arguments are valid. IMHO, it would be more user-friendly if modules.py would at least print a help message if invoked without arguments.
Now that the PR is merged, this issue can be closed. Is the protocol for me to do it myself, or should I leave it to someone else?
@mhucka You can close it. BTW, if the PR description contains Fixes #PR Number, a bot will close this issue once that PR is merged.
Oh, good to know! Thanks!
