It seems the llvmlite_artiq package is not found when using conda. Maybe related to #1469 .
No import error
A full log can be seen in this CI job, though not everyone can access those logs at this moment (will be accessible by everyone later this week).
The verdict can be seen below:
Not related to #1469 - the latter is Windoze-specific and fixed by workarounds such as "open the graphical IDE at least once after installing VS so that it silently finishes the setup, otherwise the command line linker will use the wrong DLLs" ðŸ™„
llvmlite_artiq is a binary package that tends to be specific to a Python version. In your case you have 3.8, whereas we are building with 3.7. Try to use the same Anaconda version that we build the packages with, and downgrade Python to 3.7:

I see, I guess Conda on Linux is too optimistic by settling on Python 3.8. We only use that combo for CI.
It already works by just limiting the Python version of the environment with python<3.8, tnx for the quick reply!

I could add this to the ARTIQ dependencies if that helps.
I guess that would make sense, then the Conda environment should resolve correct instantly. I'll leave that decision up to you.

Yes, in theory, but there are plenty of bugs in the conda dependency solver.

I think it does that on all platforms. On our CI, conda does not have access to the network, so it does not see the newer Python version at all. Before we kept having this sort of issue, which is beyond our control and with poor reproducibility with no way to completely rollback.
Well, I think it then definitely makes sense to add a 'python<3.8' dependency to ARTIQ on Conda. Then at least the Python version it resolves is correct.
Done, https://git.m-labs.hk/M-Labs/nix-scripts/commit/b8a803a64fd6523d81a1f774969773fd5a84ec7d
