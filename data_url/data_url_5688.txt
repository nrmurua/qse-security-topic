I am trying to install Qiskit Aer from source but I get an error about a file that does not exists (or at least I am unable to find it).
No error
It is very similar to this problem #1687, so might be related. However to this person the solution was just downgrade the version of Python 3.11.
I was trying with Python 3.10 an after seeing this I tried also with Python 3.11 (both cases got the same problem).
This is my requirements
Notice that it only happens when trying to import Qiskit Aer being in the project root folder.
Also saw that it is the same problem you are having with the CI (#1695), so I don't know if closing the issue...
can you use pip install . instead of pip install -e .? Sometime editable mode is not good for a project with pybind.
also, if you in qiskit-aer/ (top of this repository), to avoid to refer qiskit_aer package from the current directory, rename qiskit_aer/ directory as qiskit_aer.bak.
In summary, I recommend you to do as follwos:
Yes, renaming the qiskit_aer folder fix the problem.
