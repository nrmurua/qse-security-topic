Before the function collect(ChainBlocks) returned a sequences so that we could do operations like:
where grads is an array of real number.
However, since now collect(collect_blocks) only returns an array of blocks and disptach! does not support the method of dispatch!(::typeof(+), ::Array{AbstractDiff,1}, ::Array{Float64,1}) in which the 2nd parameter is an array, we have  to use for loop to achieve the purpose, which is inefficient.
I hope maybe we could add the method to support array operations. Thank you!
I just realize this just work out of box, so actually we don't need to define any extra interface at all!
I think this is solved now with a bug fix QuantumBFS/YaoBlocks.jl#33
