Originally classical registers were transformed, but this didn't preserve the order of measurements (#551). The measurement order was fixed in #557 by removing all measurements then adding them back in the original order. It is therefore no longer needed to transform the classical registers (but this is still done). Rather, one can:
This simplifies the _transform_registers function in mitiq_qiskit.conversions.
@rmlarose I can take on this one next!
