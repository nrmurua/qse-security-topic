Is there a way to read out the slow ADCs on the E2 Extension connectors right now?
Yes that is fast enought. I only want to add some analog controllers to the RP.
Thanks for your promt reply.
I wanted to use the scpi connection to read them out in combination with Python scripts as in the example on the rp Website https://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appsFeatures/examples/ana-exm1.html
Or is there a better way to do this?
