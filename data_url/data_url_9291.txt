from discussion with Jonathan on slack
There is another factor of 2 speedup if one keeps all Krylov vectors in memory, so we could actually get a factor of 3 if we keep vectors. It also speeds up observable expectation values a lot, too. This is because we need H^2k+1 to compute orthogonalization, and <H^q O H^p > for observables
