The test suite may fail to collect now for all OSes on CI, due to the new ddt version 1.4.3 (released about an hour ago).  This appears related to datadriventests/ddt#92 - the signature of ddt.idata changed in a backwards-incompatible manner, and there's no way to support both signatures idata(iterable) and idata(iterable, length) cleanly.
Run the test suite with ddt=1.4.3.
Tests do not fail to collect.
Arguably this is a bug/mishandling of the user interface in ddt, but we can work around it by either forbidding use of ddt=1.4.3 in constraints.txt, or swapping all uses of ddt.idata(iterable) to ddt.data(*iterable).
Having looked into it a bit closer, I think this is a slight "interface bug" in ddt, and the best thing for us to do is just disallow ddt==1.4.3 in the constraints, and I'll work with the ddt team to see if we can have an interface fix merged upstream.  For now, see datadriventests/ddt#97.
