circuit.draw() with setting set to mpl does not draw first time it is called.
If I follow and set it to mpl

the following code

does this the first time

and I have to rerun it to get the figure.
make it draw the first time
I think the figure is not saved or something.
If this is in a notebook, are you doing
%matplotlib inline
Or
%matplotlib notebook
At the top?
let me try. I always forget that :-)
