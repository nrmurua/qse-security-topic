Constant time tests keep failing when CPU extensions are activated: Sep 5 , Sep 12.
A quick analysis:
Suggestions for improvement solicited: Extending no_output_timeout beyond 1h? Dropping some algs from testing? Re-running and debugging locally?...
I think we should drop these algorithms from the test, and make a note on the release page for the wiki that these tests should be run locally before release.
