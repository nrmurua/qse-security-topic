While we are at it, I have found another undocumented, untested "feature" is the solvers.
In sesolve, when H is a function and a Qobj is in args, it is replaced by it's data"
sesolve.py, 696:
mesolve does a similar thing: (mesolve.py:889)
While this is probably not common, I don't see it being useful (at least without proper documentation).
This seems somehow familiar, but its not coming to me now. Maybe @nonhermitian can illuminate?
@Ericgig Should we close this issue?
