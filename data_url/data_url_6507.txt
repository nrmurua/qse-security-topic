I've been getting segfaults when trying to compute expectation values for long Pauli strings.
When I run the following code for qsim==0.10.2 (pip package) on my laptop it reproduces the problem:
This outputs
fwiw the corresponding code using cirq.Simulator and obs.expectation_from_state_vector works fine.
This is a limitation of the qsim expectation value calculation code - it only supports up to 6-qubit operators. For larger expectation values I recommend using the Cirq tools as you described.
Oh I didn't realize that. Thanks.
