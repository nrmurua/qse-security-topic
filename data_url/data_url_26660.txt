When trying to build CP2K v8.1 with ARCH=minimal VERSION=sdbg (arch-file patched to use gcc-10 from homebrew due to OpenMP-requirement), building fails at the linker step:
Since there's no CUDA support, the .a files of grid/hybrid have actually no symbols:
... and as it seems ar (respectively ranlib) from Xcode has a problem with linking empty .a files: adding a dummy function which is not "ifdefed" out to hybrid/grid_collocate_hybrid.c makes the error go away.
The same applies for libcp2kfpga.a.
We are currently using ar -r. According to ranlib's manpage the -r flag updates the archive symbol table only if it exists. So, maybe adding -s helps?
Maybe, but the problem is not that the source files wouldn't exist, they are simply empty (in the sense of not containing any symbols).
Yes, the empty source files are certainly the root cause. However, I'd like to avoid adding dummy functions if possible. We should instead try to convince either ranlib to create an empty table of contents or ld to ignore a missing table.
This seems to have been resolved because our new test for macOS builds successfully.
