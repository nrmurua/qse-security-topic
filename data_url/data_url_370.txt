After printing the circuit using print(circuit), you get a segmentation fault if you attempt to apply any gates on the qubit register.
It seems like one should be able to view the circuit and still edit it. It's behaving more like a dump() than a print().
Not a regression
No response
This is due to the QuakeValue lifetime issues. I've got a fix I'll PR soon.
