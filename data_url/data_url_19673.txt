Copying the code from the source for the quantum volume fitter but getting an import error:
Copy the code and try to run it
Should run without any errors
This code is not meant to be run independently, only when you call QVFitter as described in the tutorial:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/noise/5_quantum_volume.html
Anyway, if you replace this line by:
from qiskit.ignis.utils import build_counts_dict_from_list
then it should work.
If you have any further questions - please ask them in the qiskit-ignis slack channel (see the link in the README file)
