The statevector drawer in LaTeX mode with convention="ket" (the current default on main) silently reverts to "vector" (the default as of 0.18) if the dims is not a multi-qubit state.  See #6154 for more context.
For example (note that convention="ket" is currently the default):

At the very least, we need to emit a warning if the user explicitly supplies convention="ket" and we can't output in that format.  We could also decide on a convention for labelling non-qubit kets (beware that in the general case, we probably need commas between separate labels) and implement that.
