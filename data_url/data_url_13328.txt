Upon merging #1151 that updated the version of the action via dependabot, the test-docs checks are failing.
Not sure this is related, looking at the log here it seems to be due to linkcheck.
It's due to the Discord link not working properly: https://discord.unitary.fund/
I assumed it was a temporary problem, but it is still broken.
Maybe @crazy4pi314 knows?
The link is not https, just http for the discord short link. Hope that helps!
Link works now, problem self-solved :-)
I probably didn't realize at the time, but Discord and a lot of other major services have had outages over the last 36h...  Glad it fixed itself :)
