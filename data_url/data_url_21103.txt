When I use "getinfo" and "wallet" commands, I got following errors with the latest codebase.
Here is the log file's link. => https://transfer.sh/O1Nct/qrl.log
I have fixes for these two in the grpc branch
builtins.AttributeError: 'DB' object has no attribute 'Delete'
builtins.AttributeError: 'Chain' object has no attribute 'version_number'
Not sure about this one
builtins.AttributeError: 'Wallet' object has no attribute 'inspect_wallet'
It really looks like a reference to very old code (@cyyber ?)
listaddresses command was disabled and I found that it was re-enabled by @randomshinichi . So I have disabled this again and removed the function as "wallet" command is self sufficient to list addresses. PR is being tested will be committed fixing the above mentioned issues.
Fixed in PR #349
