Initializing a cirq.google.EngineProcessor requires providing an EngineContext, but simply passing cirq.google.engine.engine.EngineContext() works so that should be used by default. Also, shouldn't EngineContext be exposed outside the file level?
Yes it should be exposed in cirq.google.
And noticed this refers to EngineProcessor not Engine so yes, should use a default of None.
Looks like this is ubiquitous in the constructors of the Engine objects.
Oh I see.  The idea is that you should only get to EngineProcessor via Engine.  Constructing it directly isn't what is intended.  This is why EngineContext is not exposed except at the file level.
I think we need to document this at least in the constructor that you should be getting this object through Engine.
I think this is an old issue that can likely be closed, maybe after verifying or adding a snippet to a docstring.
