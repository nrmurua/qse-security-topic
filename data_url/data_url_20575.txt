Hi,
I was trying to build openssl branch OpenSSL3, with liboqs main branch, but I get the following failures, checked to see the missing symbols are not within liboqs too.
Is this a known issue? or did I miss something on my build?
Regards.
The branch OpenSSL3 is outdated: The current OpenSSL3 (provider) code is at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider.
Thanks, closing this issue.
