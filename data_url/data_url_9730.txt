A frequent source of confusion in 0.10 is the distinction between x and 'x' in
The former is a dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel object, the latter is a string label of a variable. This leads to confusing behavior like #921.
Would likely require #966 and #923.
The biggest challenge will be hunting down all of the locations that take a variable label and updating them. Though updating dimod.Variables would be an obvious place to start.
A good first step would be to raise a better error in some of the most common places it happens.
Another approach would be to make a Spin, Binary, Integer full subclasses that promote themselves to QM and BQM. I think that might also lead to lots of confusing behavior.
