As noted in #44, the qasm parser currently doesn't understand the ry gate. By looking at the definition of this gate in the Qiskit source, it should be relatively straightforward to implement support for this gate.
I wonder if this is working as intended after #101? It is indeed possible to use zx.Circuit.from_qasm with a QASM string that has ry gates in it to get a circuit circ, but it is not possible to, say, run zx.basic_optimization on the result even though it's possible to get something that works after running it through zx.extract_circuit(circ.to_graph()).
This is not really well-documented, but basic_optimization requires the gates to be from a restricted set. Generally you want to call to_basic_gates() before calling basic_optimization.
This isn't quite working even after PR #101. The rotation implemented there is in the reverse direction to how the RYGate is defined in qiskit. In particular, this means that compare_tensors will always return False (even with preserve_scalar set to False) for any circuit with an ry gate imported into pyzx from a qasm file output by qiskit.
Repro case:
Output:
In the test of #101  they write
However, the Wikipedia page defines the Y rotation differently https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_quantum_logic_gates#Rotation_operator_gates:

So it looks like the XPhase(alpha) should be replaced by a XPhase(-alpha) in #101
