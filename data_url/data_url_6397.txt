#192 is drawing our attention to a pile of arithmetic code, written a year or so ago, that isn't up to our current standards of reuse. I promise you, I will have a refactor of this code on Saturday, in its own PR. However, this is causing the scope of #192 itself to creep.
I propose we treat #192 as pertaining to its titular functionality. I will follow this with a PR, on Saturday, for the refactor that is blocking that PR.
Sound good?
I take it, by your approval on that PR, that this is the plan. Thank you!
Definitely!
Resolved by #198.
