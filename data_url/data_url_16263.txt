The implementation of PolynomialPauliRotation passes ancillas to mcrx and mcrz, but those two functions expect none. (No error is thrown, as these ancillas take the spot of a boolean argument not used here). In https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/circuit/library/arithmetic/functional_pauli_rotations.py lines 341 and 345
(This is not a problem for mcry as its implementation was changed recently)
Pass no ancillas to mcrx and mcrz (but would not be consistent with mcry where they are used) or change mcrz and mcrx to accept and use ancillas as mcry does.
