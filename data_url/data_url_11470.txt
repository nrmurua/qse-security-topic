Running QAOA with the master branch takes 10 times longer than the stable branch.
Output of machine: 345 seconds with master, 38 seconds with stable.
Maybe compare transpilation times.
Is this Aqua's issue? (Which did you use Terra master or Terra stable?)
Perhaps, Qiskit/qiskit#5429 Qiskit/qiskit#5431 may be related.
These are recently found performance problems.
I used master branches of Aqua, Aer, and Terra. Compared to stable branches of all three.
I have checked this. My environment is master and stable/0.8 of Aqua, and master of Terra and Aer for both.
227s (stable/0.8) -> 27s (master)
27s (stable/0.8) ->227s  (master)
stable

master

This is opposite to my findings...
Ah sorry my mistake (I wrote opposite)
