I am trying to install qsim on a linux machine. I did
which successfully ran. However, running
in the root directory produces the above error logs. I am not an experienced C++ user, please bear with me if this is a stupid question. Thank you!
From the error logs:
Our Makefile assumes that C++11 is enabled - in your case, you can either:
Hope that helps!

Thanks, that gets me through the first errors. But there are other errors appearing now.
From the file:
This is a known error when using older versions of gcc, highlighted in issue #84. Your previous error logs indicate you are using gcc-4.8.2 -- if possible, I would recommend updating your gcc version, as we currently don't plan to support gcc-4.8.x
@sergeisakov, this shows that some subset of users may be using these older gcc versions - should we reconsider adding support for these versions?
I updated to gcc-8.3.1. However, make still produces the following errors:

Hmm...that indicates that your system does not use AVX by default. That should be fine, since PR #82 added multiplexing for (AVX|SSE|basic) simulators, but obviously something's not quite right.
You can try replacing -march=native in the Makefile with -mavx2 -mfma, but if your machine doesn't support AVX then that may fail as well.
@sergeisakov, could you take a look at this? I think the Bazel tests only check the AVX case - we probably should expand them to cover SSE and basic as well.
I switched to a newer Skylake server and it works now, so I am closing this issue. Thanks!
