The PyPi package doesn't seem to have been updated since 2020 https://pypi.org/project/quimb/#history. Maybe there should be updates from the development branch more regularly? Some automatic GitHub CI can be setup to do this from just making new version tags.
I'm also looking for new release.
Also from the dependency tree, some packages are already expired for quite a while...
Perhaps it will help to use some CI tools and automatically generate (pre-)releases from the git tags.
Yes I'll push a new version soon and start doing more regular versions.
Originally the plan was round out some of the new features, bring the tests and docs in line etc, and release a version 2, but I think more incremental updates regardless of making them 'complete' is the way to go in future.
I've just pushed 1.4.0, thanks for your patience!
Thank you Johnnie! I think that will be indeed better to have a continuous delivery, regardless of major or mirror changes. So people know this repo is still alive. Anyway, thank you for the updates. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
