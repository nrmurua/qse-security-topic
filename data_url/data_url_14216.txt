Defining a PassManager object on MacOS throws a RuntimeWarning,
Adding import numpy as np; np.seterr(all="raise") throws a FloatingPointError: divide by zero encountered in det. Maybe related to this issue?
No warning should be raised.

Could you show the output of numpy.show_config() (and the version of Numpy)? I suspect this is something BLAS-related, because on my Mac I can't reproduce it.  I'm on macOS 13.3.1 and have OpenBLAS available, but I'm wondering if Apple have changed something about Accelerate in 13.4.
Is there more to your stack trace, as well? It'd help to know where in Qiskit code the error comes from.
Thanks for the answer! I have numpy version 1.23.5, numpy.show_config() gives
Here's the full stack trace:
Does anyone have an update on this issue?
Looking at the runtime configuration, I'm assuming this is happening on M1/M2 Macs (the available SIMD instructions are ARM-like).  Unfortunately, I've got an Intel Mac, so it's going to be difficult for me to help diagnose the full problem.
If you've got a complete minimal reproducible example (the example given at the top doesn't include the circuit that's being used, which I didn't notice at the time), that might help, though with me not having an ARM Mac, it'll be tricky.
If you do have an example, you could try setting the environment variable NPY_DISABLE_CPU_FEATURES=NEON before launching Python (or importing Numpy), and see if the problem still exists.
