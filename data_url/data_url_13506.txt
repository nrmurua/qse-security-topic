Currently I'm trying to test the execute_with_zne() function with a QFT circuit in Qiskit. However when I run the code it gives back an error stating that the circuit cannot be converted to an internal mitiq circuit. It seems to be because it does not recognise cu1 gates which are used in the QFT circuit.
Thanks @mcoggins96. For now you can get around this by compiling your circuit before the call to execute_with_zne:
A more permanent fix on our end is to handle a larger set of gates which can be converted. I will remove the bug label for now, though, because we don't claim to support folding arbitrary gates.
Thank you very much it's running now.
Will re-open to keep track of this going forward.
