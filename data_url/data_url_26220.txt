Pylint has been flagging a line as redefined variable type. If this is disabled via   # pylint: disable=redefined-variable-type, then pylint flags this as a useless supression.
This behavior is not uniform across the 2 different workflows labeled as 3.10 or 3.11. See this comment for more information.
This is also not due to pytest raising some warnings in the same file as I initially thought. 87d7e82 should have fixed it.
Paid attention to the warning raised by pylint.
Should be fixed in 8c800c0
