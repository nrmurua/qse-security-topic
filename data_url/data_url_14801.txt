I am building a quantum machine learning simulation application with PyQt5 and qiskit_machine_learning, when debugging there are no errors and it can run and make predictions. However, after I tried to create an exe extension with pyinstaller and opened the exe application file resulting from the build, the following error occurred. I'm a bit confused about the qiskit_machine_learning configuration in the .spec file and also how to solve this error.
Sorry, i use this picture to show this error because when this error displayed, a few seconds later this terminal will be close

here is the .spec configuration file
when I run the Qiskit machine learning exe file application the build results with pyinstaller
When I run the exe application file, it should display the application running according to the previous debug
No response
Was raised here initially /qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning#714 and I commented there qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning#714 (comment)
Yeah, this is likely due to a difference in handling implicit packages in new versions of setuptools that we haven't addressed yet. I'm a bit surprised to see it causing bugs, but the short-term fix will likely be to drop an __init__.py file in qiskit/qasm/lib. Longer term, we're planning to remove qiskit/qasm entirely and the OQ2 and OQ3 libraries will be reorganised as part of #10737.
While I don't see this in the error output, I suspect that qiskit/visualization/circuit/styles will exhibit the same problem.

I'll try to this sir, thanks for giving me solutions
