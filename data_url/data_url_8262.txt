I'm getting the following error when the first three arguments for the clebsch function aren't all ints:
Fixed by changing
c_factor = np.zeros((j1 + j2 + j3 + 1), np.int32) 
to
c_factor = np.zeros((int(j1 + j2 + j3 + 1)), np.int32)
and same for _factorial_prod() etc. It's now giving expected results. This shouldn't break anything as j1 +/- j2 +/- j3 should always give an integer.
Seems to have been caused by #1142 in response to #1141.
Thanks for the details and tracking it down. Could you open a Pull Request and add a test for that?
#1177
