Last week at the ScaleQIT conference there was a presentation by  Zurich Instruments.
Afterwards I had a discussion with one their employees, about the software they created for controlling their instruments LabOne. I think there are some good ideas in there that we could use when thinking about a gui.
I think the central idea is to have on instrument server that all the specific gui's talk to (with the addition of showing the commands you clicked aswell). We could use a similar approach where we start the instrument server (and other qcodes processes) in one notebook to which we can then connect using other notebook instances and/or specific instrument gui's.
This might already be similar to the ideas floating around here but I tought it could be interesting to take a look at.
p.s. I'd say that strictly speaking this is not really an issue but I thought it would be useful to share it here anyway, if anyone has a better suggestion for these kinds of discussions I'm open to it.
@AdriaanRol Wow, that company makes slick looking stuff. It's like Apple for science :)
Something similar to QCodes from the Ion trap community.
Not entirely sure on what it does exactly but it looks remarkably similar, python based, using ipython notebooks and pyqt(graphs?) for plotting.

Whoa, artiq looks neat - kind of a python compiler for FPGAs... a little overlap but mostly it just looks like a cool system for us to integrate with when we want to involve FPGAs in our experiments. Nice find @AdriaanRol
Close for now, this things will now got to slack unless somebody has a different strong opinion :D
