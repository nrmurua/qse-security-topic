Before raising this issue, I have already checked that I am:
Using local statevector/wavefunction simulators results in optimizer.log.probability.best being empty.
The reason is probably a mismatch between the attributes probabilities and counts in the logger
The probability attribute should be populated! Note that the optimisation does happen, so the bug is at the logger's level

Probably a solution is to remove the difference between probability and count, and use the same attribute for both cases!
@Q-lds, @shahidee44, this issue was fixed with PR #34, correct?
