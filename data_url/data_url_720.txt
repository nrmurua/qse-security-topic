When I look at this file, I notice you have got the extra r and cswap gates. That is cool. So, I use that as my template to make my own qelib1.inc, which includes more of my own custom gates.
That does not work if I do it verbatim. The trouble is on these lines:
The ccx is referenced in the first line before it is defined later. Well, I can fix my qelib1.inc easily.
I gather you may be interested in assessing whether those lines affect other parts of the system.
@DevelopDaily good point, I think I just need to flip the order so everything is defined before usage
@DevelopDaily Fixed
