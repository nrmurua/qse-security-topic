The SU-Servo gateware sends data to profile 0, while profile 7 is enabled by default on the CPLD.
It is caused by not updating the gateware of SU-Servo after this change of urukul.py in #1584. @pmldrmota
Enable SU-Servo. Run an experiment that involves SU-Servo.
Urukul is able to output waveform.
No waveform from Urukul.
Update the profile that the SU-Servo gateware will feed ASF to. (See this line)
A software-only solution would be adding a derived CPLD class like this to coredevice/urukul.py and changing the device_db so that all SUServo cards use it instead.
We use this pattern to implement half-duplex readback for phase-coherent SUServo. The PR for this is still in the waiting stage (will follow up on #1782), but you can have a look at 4d3c889.
