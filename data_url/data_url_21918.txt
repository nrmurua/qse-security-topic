If an experiment repository contains modules with the same name, the experiments in all previously imported modules of the same name appear under the path for the currently imported module.
E.g. if scanning a repository:
in the repository explorer the folder a would contain the experiments from a/x.py, the b directory
would contain a/x.py and b/x.py, and c a/x.py, b/x.py, c/x.py.
@cjbe I cannot reproduce this; can you provide a tarball of a minimal experiment tree that causes the problem?
Ah nevermind, I reproduced it. My modules had the same experiment names in them, so the problem was masked.
