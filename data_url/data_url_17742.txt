qobj without mapping
Output
Qobj after mapping to a coupling map
output
The error is the measurements are passing through the conditional.
Run the example teleport
outcoumes should be the same
Debug the mapper pass
NOTE you may need to look after #1284 is merged as there was another error with the qubits randomly changing position in the circuit.
