I found that two-qubit RB sequence created by QGL is not right. Shown below is the 4 Clifford gates for two qubit RB, measured with our oscilloscope. The pulse sequence plot in the jupyter notebook looks the same as in the oscilloscrope, so I thought this would be a QGL issue.
The problem is that the qubit pulse train appears to go out of sync with the gate pulses so a gap appears between the ends of gate and qubit pulse train.
Can you see if this is reproducible in your QGL and if yes, would you fix it?

@jaseung please try #163
I actually can't reproduce this issue anymore after the fix above. Can you try to set all delays to 0 and see where your markers go out of sync? Is it at a specific point in the sequence, or is it cumulative?
Hmm, it's the same. I set all delays to 0 and still see the same problems (gate and qubit out of sync). I even tried with markers disabled, but no luck. To see if there is any difference, I also tried to use QGL-last-matlab release, but the result is the same. Which QGL version did you use to test the fix? Any suggestion?
Just in case you're interested, I attached the ChannelParams.json below.

I'm only testing on the master branch. Unfortunately we do not support the matlab-compatible version anymore. It seems that your settings are alright, though. What happens when you disable the gatechan for both q2 and CR12?

Remaining issue, reported by @jaseung : control qubit gate (marker) stays high when combined with a gate on the CR pulse in the same channel
