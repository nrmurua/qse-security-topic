I'm getting this on FreeBSD:
Could you send the entire installation report? During the installation, the script will try to compile using several different options and some will fail. In this case, vectorization will be disabled because of the missing support for xsave. Is your goal to enable vectorization or to get the compilation to work?
In any case, you can try adding -mxsave to the CXXFLAGS & CFLAGS environment variables before running pip install.
Is your goal to enable vectorization or to get the compilation to work?
My goal is to make it build.
Actually, the build succeeds in the end, but this error looks very strange, because it happens in the course of the build, not during configuration.
-mxsave in CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS didn't help.
But it's okay if you say this is just a trial and error situation.
Okay I see.
Just trying to figure this out anyway: Was the mxsave flag present in the compiler call? Did you get the same error?
Did you get it to work?
Not yet. I'll come back to it soon.
I will close this issue for now since the compilation succeeds, although without support for vectorization.
