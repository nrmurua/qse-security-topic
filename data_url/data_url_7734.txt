In the 1d_tebd calculation, the entropy function offers the option to set cur_orthog manually during the update. If I calculate the magnetization at site j before calculating entropy with cur_orthog set to j, then I recover the correct results. However, if I calculate entropy directly with cur_orthog set to j, then I obtain negative entropy values.
I understand that the calculating magnetization somehow adjusts the cur_orthog to j, but nonethelss the entropy should never be negative, instead it should raise an error, regardless of cur_orthog is set automatically or manually.

I'm not totally sure what the best route here is.
