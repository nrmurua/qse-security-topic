Moved from qiboteam/qibolab#606 with some updates:
This list is sorted in terms of priorities with lab usability in mind.
To clarify the second point (originally requested by @MatteoRobbiati ), take for example
currently transpiled_circuit will be a 5-qubit circuit with a gate on qubit-0. We would like an easy way to use a different qubit. A potential way would be transpiler(circuit, qubits=[2]).
@renatomello if you have any other transpiler related issues in mind, please add them here or open new issues. We can mark them with the transpiler label to distinguish from the rest of qibo.
Currently fixing the point 4 (Fix Sabre transpiler to work with measurements) in #1084
currently fixing point 1 in #1095
One thing that is still missing, I believe, is some documentation for the transpiler. It would probably be good to have an example in advanced code examples detailing how to use the transpiler, and a section in api-reference illustrating its structure.

There is already an example in "advanced code examples". have a look at it and tell me if it is necessary to change something.
With the new PR we can also add a section in API

Where is it exactly? I couldn't find it in the advanced examples

I also was searching for it yesterday. I think there is no example for now :)

It's here https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/blob/master/doc/source/code-examples/advancedexamples.rst#how-to-modify-the-transpiler.
You probably cannot find it in the stable documentation online as we have not released qibo after moving the transpiler here. I guess the only way to view it for now is to compile the docs locally (or just read directly from the link above).
Also, I agree that transpiler should also be added in the API reference.
ah yeah that's right

Many thanks. Anyway, I think it should be better to have a notebook as a proper tutorial (like the ones we have for algorithms). As soon as I find some time to read this documentation, I can try to do it.
