@zchen088 uses this functionality quite heavily as part of randomized benchmarking, and cirq is the bottleneck. Switching off XmonSimulator made it better, but there's still quite a lot of overhead from computing gate matrices repeatedly.
+1, though I should note that I tried implementing caching of the matrix computation and that only helped by around 20%. It looks like the remaining bottleneck is doing isinstance checks.
Yes, it's likely that the move away from extensions will help this use case.
What functionality is missing from the moment iterator in the XmonSimulator?  That's the pattern we'll use with the numpy simulator too.
I suspect it's just that the functionality is sort of hidden away.
I don't think there are any missing features for this use case. Just want things to run faster. @zchen088, do you have an numbers to compare the performance of cirq with what you'd want?
Closing this as likely this is legacy from wonky xmon simulator.  If this is still to slow for some reason, please reopen, hopefully with some timings showing the issue.
