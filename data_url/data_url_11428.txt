On Linux, in pycharm, the code execution of the BayesNet.py example stops at the line bnet.draw(algo_num=2) and opens a viewer, thereby masking errors with the reading and writing sample files that follows after that. Nevertheless the code will get executed after closing the window.  Not the behaviour I would have expected.
In Jupyter this works as expected. Since Jupyter is the environment we target I will close this issue.
