It is not possible to do an silent init of intel-qs lib
Describe the solution you'd like
A flag 'silent' in the ctor to control if outputs are done to the terminal
Additional context
I did an impl for this in PR #59
Hi @mbuchberger1967,
the effect of flag 'silent' is the same of argument variable 'do_print_info' in method
iqs::mpi::Environment::UpdateStateComm().
I believe this should be consolidated and will propose edits to the PR.
this is correct. I did a parallel implementation as I didnt want to break any existing logic.
I'm happy if you consolidate the two flags into one.
I saw you updated my PR and I think this can be closed now.
