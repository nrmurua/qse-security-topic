In the dimod CQM object, there is a relabel_variables method that is available to rename variables for objective function. However, for a constrained problem we also need to relabel variables for constraints.
We need a method to relabel variables for both objective and constraints. When relabeling variables in the objective the method should also search for variables in constraints and rename those.
We probably need a method like this.
cqm.rename_variables_as_integers(prefix='x')
This should relabel all variables to x1, x2, ...,  uniformly across all constraints and objective.
I believe it should be as simple as adding the following function (as a method of course).
This function should work as a hack for now until we can add it.
edit: fixed typo
That is smart, this will work  for sure!
