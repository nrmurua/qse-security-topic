Currently the tests for tasks 1.6 and 2.2 generate the SAT instances randomly, with up to 7 variables and 14 clauses, which can cause significant test slowdown if several tests are generated on the larger side (the more variables and clauses the test has, the longer it runs).
It makes sense to refactor the tests so that they run faster without loss of coverage.
