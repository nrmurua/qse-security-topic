Commit 7485ed9 removed the CompositeGate.X = X from the  qiskit/extensions/simulator/*.py files. Because of this, CompositeGate is not usable as before.
This code fails at execution with the error
Download the code and execute it with a version of Qiskit that contains the modifications of 7485ed9.
The CompositeGate should work as before, i.e. be appended to the quantum circuit.
thanks for the input we are thinking about how to fix this. @ajavadia and i were discussing today. I think the best idea is to not try and revert but give an update in the change that it is broken but fix with a method that scales better.
I think in the interest of backwards-compatibility we will keep CompositeGate and properly deprecate it (see patch #1765 that restores it, @nelimee is right that it inadvertently broke).
But in general for the next release we will make it easier to drop a circuit inside another circuit, removing the need for composite gate.
