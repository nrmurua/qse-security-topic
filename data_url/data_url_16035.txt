When the algorithms module from Qiskit Aqua got migrated to Terra, the VariationalForm was included (possibly by accident).
Before the next release, this class will no longer be needed because all variational forms will have been refactored into BlueprintCircuits (see also qiskit-community/qiskit-nature#66 for an example).
Thus, it would be good to remove the VariationalForm class.
Furthermore, the preferred_init_points argument, which is checked for in VariationalAlgorithm and set to a dummy value in NLocal will no longer be needed.
As discussed in #6064 (and more extensively offline), we do actually still need the preferred_init_points argument.
However, we should refactor the handling of this in the future.
