The aer simulator (and others) does not support the sxdg gate. Is this intended or is the sxdg gate missing?
See the behavior of transpiling the sxdg gate to the aer-simulator here.
I think we just missed it. If you transpile your circuit it will run, but to add native support it would need to be added to all the simulation methods like for the regular sx gate.
Alright, thanks for your reply, @chriseclectic! ðŸ™‚
Do I understand it correctly that in order to add it we'd just need to replace "sx" with "sx", "sxdg" in aer_simulator, pulse_simulator, qasm_simulator, and unitary_simulator?
And then we might want to add it to test/benchmark/simulator_benchmark.py I guess? Haven't figured out how the test works yet.
If it is that easy or you could tell me what I missed, I'd be happy to add the native sxdg gate support.
@chriseclectic I guess you are pretty busy and have much more important tasks. Sorry to bother you! Do you think I should work on this?
