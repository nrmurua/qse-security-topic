Running the pulse solver raises an exception in file data_config.py function op_data_config() executing final_freq = freq_list[-1] when no channels have been defined in the Hamiltonian Model string (using the syntax, e.g., "0.5 * omegaa * X0||D0"), since OPSystem.freqs remains empty.
Verify emptiness of OPSystem.freqs.
I tried to fix this by verifying that freq_list and chan_list are nonempty so these lines do not raise an exception, but this caused the process to crash with access violation [Process finished with exit code -1073741819 (0xC0000005)] at some unknown later point.
I think if no channels are defined the HamiltonianModel class should raise an exception when loading from a string since these types of hamiltonians arent currently supported by the simulator
