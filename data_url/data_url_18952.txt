In line 130 of spec/qasm2.tex there should be a \phi instead of \theta, i.e.$R_z(\phi)=\mathrm{exp}(-i\phi Z/2)$ instead of $R_z(\phi)=\mathrm{exp}(-i\theta Z/2)$.
This is correct. We are current moving it from latex to Markdown so that it is simple for people to edit and fix. We will make this correction after we make this conversion.
