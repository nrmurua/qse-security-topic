It would be good to parallelize the calculation of Hermite polynomials which is right now done serially.
In line 
It would also be useful to introduce generalized multidimensional Hermite polynomials :math:  \tilde H_{n}^{(B)}(\alpha) = H_{n}^{(B)}(\alpha)/\sqrt{\prod_i n_i}. This would require to construct explicitly the recursion relation of these new polynomials and implementing it. It would have the advantage of reducing overflows or underflows in the calculation of properties of Gaussian states and gates.
The polynomials should be defined so that they depend on :alpha: and not in :B alpha:. See this line 
This matrix vector multiplication could be done ahead of time a not at each iteration.
