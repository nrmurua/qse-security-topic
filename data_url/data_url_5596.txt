I am seeing AerSimulator runs that took around 0.3 seconds with Aer 0.12.2 take 6-8 seconds with Aer 0.13.0.
Here is my test script. It requires a the rb.qpy file with the circuits which I am attaching along with the code blocks in this post here. These are randomized benchmarking circuits.
With Aer 0.12.2, the script prints around 0.2 seconds for the run while for 0.13.0 it prints around 7.9 seconds. A colleague tested on macOS and saw 0.05 seconds vs 4.1 seconds for the two Aer versions.
No change in performance
I do not have a suggested solution, but here is the code that generated the circuits. It requires qiskit-experiments. It is based on a test from the qiskit-experiments test suite.
I found Aer 0.13.0 uses stabilizer method but 0.12.2 uses density_matrix method.
I think there is some issue in selecting method when method="automatic" is set (or no method is set)
When I set method="density_matrix", I got the similar or faster simulation time on 0.13.0
