Hard-coding compiler flag -march=native in setup.py completely destroys possibility to set up Qutip on heterogeneous cluster. In general, it brings a lot of problems for people that don't have a good experience in debugging "illegal instruction" errors, that often happen, if you compile the module on different machine than you use.
If you are sure you need optimized build for localhost, you might use
instead or provide separate option for setup.py script.
Might this be the cause of #674?
I am almost certain that this is the reason.
