Why in the simulator there isn't an equivalent to get_probabilities() (like in IBM backend)? Wouldn't it be great to have something like this?
While there is indeed no functions that can give you the data you want immediately, the simulator does provide a get_probability() method to access the probability of a particular bit string.
If you want to have the complete set of probabilities, you can do something like this:
Thanks a lot for your disponibility! ðŸ˜Š
