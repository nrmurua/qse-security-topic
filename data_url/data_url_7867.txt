Hi, I believe the definition in the function lindblad_dissipator is incorrect.
The source code reads:
however ad_b = a.dag() * b should actually be b.dag() * a as seen in this wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindbladian
The two are identical for symmetric interactions in the single-excitation manifold, but not in general.
The lindblad_dissipator not being trace preserving when b is supplied is definitively strange and there is no tests for it being right when a!=b is certainly worrying.
However I was told that it looked right like this, so I am not sure if we should change it...
Maybe removing b and letting more complex variant to be constructed manually would result in less problems.
@jonahpeter Do you perhaps have some specific a and b in mind that we could use to write a test case?
Can I have a look at this issue @Ericgig @hodgestar? I mean is it still open?
@bopardikarsoham It can definitely still be looked at, but the situation needs to be untangled before any code change is made:
So the physics will not change from what it is now if we make the proposed change and it appears that how the terms are organized within the larger sum is a convention. So the question is whether there is a standard convention to follow or not, and I don't know the answer.
Step 1 is probably to find some textbooks or canonical references which make the choice clear.
Step 2 would be to write some tests for the behaviour in the case where a != b.
