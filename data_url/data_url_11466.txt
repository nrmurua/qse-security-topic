A license needs to be added to the code. I suggest using BSD New v. 3.0 for full compatibility with QuTiP and the NumPy stack. @araza6, Github will prompt the templates directly once you try to add a file called LICENSE from the web interface. This can still be added as a PR then, instead of merging to master.
Closing this issue with PR #7
