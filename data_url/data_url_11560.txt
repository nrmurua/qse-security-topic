When trying to run the pyscf driver integrals the following error appears:
~\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\qiskit\chemistry\drivers\pyscfd\integrals.py in compute_integrals(atom, unit, charge, spin, basis, hf_method, conv_tol, max_cycle, init_guess, max_memory)
53     hf_method = hf_method.lower()
54     if max_memory is None:
---> 55         max_memory = param.MAX_MEMORY
56
57     try:
NameError: name 'param' is not defined
You list Windows as the platform. You built PySCF yourself ? The param is imported as per this
Which you will see in this file https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf/blob/master/pyscf/lib/__init__.py
Hi thanks for your response,
I have installed it but as I am talking to a tech person they think I have something wrong in my python package. So it is likely not a bug but I didn't know where else to go. Sorry and thank you for your time!
