Conda complains about a malformed version string when attempting to install artiq or artiq-kc705-nist_qc2.  Problem does not appear using conda in Linux.
#132
@dhslichter You are pulling an outdated version of pyqtgraph that will not work with ARTIQ anyway. I guess it is coming from https://anaconda.org/fallen/pyqtgraph, please change your conda repository URLs to those in the ARTIQ documentation. The correct pyqtgraph version is 0.9.10-py_105+giteea3752.
