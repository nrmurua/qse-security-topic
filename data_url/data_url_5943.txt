For a simple circuit creating an EPR state and measure 100 shots, a user measured time_taken is 42sec for 23 qubits, 88sec for 24qubits, 207sec for 25qubits, 510sec for 26qubits and 0.2sec for 27 qubits. Also 0.3sec for 28qubits .
When we add the option:
'mps_sample_measure_qubits_opt':20, we get the expected performance.
The default value for this parameter should give the optimal performance.
Re-examine the default values for this parameter and also for mps_sample_measure_shots_opt.
Also add documentation for these thresholds in qasm_simulator.py.
I am running experiments to define better thresholds to decide between the two algorithms for sample_measure. The experiments include 3 parameters: number of qubits, number of shots, max bond dimension.
Here are the results for bond dimension <= 2.
