The SuzukiTrotter class in qiskit.synthesis.evolution currently accepts any integer as input for the order. However the formula is not defined for odd orders (see definition below) and even though the code works on such input, the results do not make sense when the order is odd.

It should raise an error message and do not accept odd integers as input for the order.

An order of 1 would still make sense I think as that's just the Lie-Trotter formula ðŸ™‚ Do you have an example of why the results are weird for other odd higher orders?
At the moment an order 1 would only give the right answer if time=1, because the coefficients in pauli_list are never multiplied by time.
These formulas are symmetric, which means that they do not have odd order errors. I could add an example where it does not converge as you increase the number of Trotter steps but intuitively the formulas are defined so that you cancel these odd error terms by combining symmetrically to 2n-order product formulas. And that allows you to jump to the 2n+2 order.
