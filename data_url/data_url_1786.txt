When using the quantum computer, I would like to pick the best qubits and the best 2-qubit gates for my experiment based on the calibration metrics.
Currently, the calibration.heatmap('two_qubit_parallel_sqrt_iswap_gate_xeb_average_error_per_cycle') allows me to see the 1 qubit metrics, but doesn't allow me to see the 2-qubit metrics
Describe the solution you'd like
In an ideal world, there will be a heatmap showing the 2-qubit fidelities of all the two-qubit metrics (link).  In addition to seeing all the two-qubit grids, it would be nice to have CDFs plots as well (similar to Google's internal reports).
I'd also like to see a grid showing which qubits have high coherent error, which is equal to (two_qubit_parallel_sqrt_iswap_gate_xeb_average_error_per_cycle -  two_qubit_parallel_sqrt_iswap_gate_xeb_incoherent_error_per_cycle), in order to avoid qubits with high coherent error for my experiment.
Lastly, a tutorial would be helpful for visualization

[optional] Additional context (e.g. screenshots)
The following bug would help quite a bit.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
