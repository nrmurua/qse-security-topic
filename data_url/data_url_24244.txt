Renderer option in Ansys is getting added as a GDS option in the qgeometry tables
Branch 224_wirebondAnsys
Add any component with paths, then look at design.qgeometry.tables['paths']
Should only be adding hfss_wire_bonds and q3d_wire_bonds to the table

Suspect it is in the qgeometries_handler, not differentiating the renderers when defining the keys for the tables
Worked on this so the pull request #224 would have this fix.
