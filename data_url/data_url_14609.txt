Consider the following backend:

Let's create a circuit with a layout:

The drawing is unexpected to me. The layout is non-trivial, for example:
I would expect 14 in the top corner, where the 0 appears.
This bug is probably related with the recently introduced registerless circuits.
I would like to work on this issue.
