I'm not sure if there is an issue with dependancies or I did something wrong but I had an older version of the Braket-sdk installed, I then pip installed the latest version of the Braket-sdk, but my "amazon-brakes-schemas" was not updated.
This resulted in an error where this line failed to import:
https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python/blob/main/src/braket/aws/aws_quantum_task.py#L30
Issue was fixed when I manually updated to the latest "amazon-brakes-schemas"
Thanks for reaching out @GenericUser127. We recommend using the following command for updating the SDK:
pip install amazon-braket-sdk --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager as specified in the package README. Let us know if this doesn't help.
