The current master CI test for testcode are broken, seemingly due to a linkcheck issue. Note that the test was passing on the PR #944.
It may be this item below, labeled al "broken"
(    contributing: line   15) broken    https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/ - HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.asmeurer.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /git-workflow/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7fe6c84d3250>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -2] Name or service not known'))
That web page  https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/ doesn't exists anymore. The associated GitHub repo still exists.
So I would propose this fix, untill the web page will reappear: 2039dd9
Actually https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/ is up again!
The magic of open-source: asmeurer/git-workflow#11  :-)
Tests are again failing on master due to linkcheck.
Doc builds are failing again (https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/runs/6623525872), so am going to reopen this.
I've run make linkcheck locally and despite only seeing ok, redirect and a few -ignored-, the program finishes with
I've also run make linkcheck | grep broken, but there is no result. This points to spurious errors.
Is there a way to run this program to only show failing links?
Upon further consideration, this is another case of #1308. Sorry for the notifications. Closing.
