The Statevector.probabilities method sometimes contains roundoff errors, leading to probabilities larger than 1. This breaks the Sampler if shots are emulated, as larger than 1 probabilities are not valid inputs to NumPy's multinomial library.
The error raised is
The probabilities should not exceed 1.
Clip the probabilities.
