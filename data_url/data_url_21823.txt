On linux 64 bit, after creating a conda environment via conda create -n artiq-3.6 artiq-kc705-nist_qc2=3.6  the artiq_flash command is not found
This also happens if you create an environment from the "main" channel with conda create -n artiq-main artiq-kc705-nist_qc2 which installs version 3.6 as well.
