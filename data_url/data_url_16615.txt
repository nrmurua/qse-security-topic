The object FourierChecking (in qiskit/circuit/library/fourier_checking.py) needs testing.  No line is currently coveraged.
Hi I would like to work on this issue, please may I be assigned?
Assigned! Let me know if you need any help.
Thanks, I'll get on it now!
Sorry I'm taking so long, have had a lot of stuff going on, Testing the FourierChecking object now
Hi!
Would it be fine for me to pick this issue up if it is not being worked on at the moment? I am working on a similar issue (#4349) at the moment, so I think I would have enough background to pick this one up.
Hi again!
I looked into this briefly and came up with the following:
Would something like this be good for this test? It is a simple check based on calculating the circuit matrix multiplying Hadamard and diagonal truth table matrices. I assumed this straightforward check should be fine. Additionally, I thought it would make sense to add a check that an error is raised with an invalid input.
If you would think this looks good, I would be more than glad to make a pull request with the test. If someone else is working on this issue maybe this piece of code could be helpful for others.
If this code does not really make sense, feel free to ignore this comment üôÇ
Thank you!
