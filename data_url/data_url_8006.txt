In qutip/qutip-tutorials#42 (review) @BoxiLi noticed that qutip.ipynbtools imports Cython without a try: ... except: ... around the import. This results in qutip.ipynbtools.version_table() failing even though Cython isn't a required dependency of QuTiP.
We should do a thorough clean up of this module in dev-major and fix this particular issue while we're there.

qutip.ipynbtools.version_table() can be called without Cython installed.
