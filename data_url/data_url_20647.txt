Make sure all of OQS's algs are available in OpenSSL.
(I'll start on that, @dstebila)
@dstebila, what's the process of adding new algs to the TLS 1.3 PQ and hybrid groups spreadsheet? We're missing Classic-McEliece.

I sent you an invitation to edit the spreadsheet. Go ahead and add the ones you need, sequentially after the existing ones.
Is this done now?
Not yet. It will be when https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/more-sig-algs is merged into master, but that is pending a decision on what signature algorithms to enable by default.
