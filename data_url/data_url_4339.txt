Hi all,
I just wanted to bring to your attention some papers related to perform evolution of states through a Hamiltonian. The Adiabatic procedure of QIBO makes use of several methods such as "linear" or "exponential" to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation. Today I discovered the Omelyan operator (https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0110438.pdf Eqs. 4, 7, 8) and  Force Gradient Integrators (https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.2950.pdf Tab 1). These methods could giive us efficiency when performing state evolution.
Let me now what you think about that
