As the title says.
The stable version from the github-pages artifact is correct (https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/suites/12501423988/artifacts/666795868), however after upgrading the master version it falls back to the previous stable release (https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/suites/12505078811/artifacts/667072603).
I rerunned the worflow (https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/actions/runs/4810572887) and now it seems to work.
Thanks, do you understand why this happened?
I'm not sure, but it seems that the workflow generates the right artifact (stable) when the tag is generated, but the website is not updated instantly, so when you change Qibo's version the stable is downloaded from the website (https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/actions/runs/4811898485/jobs/8566505151#step:5:26), i.e. the old stable version.
I don't know (if this is a reasonable explanation) why this delay happened.
Ok, thanks, we can monitor during the next release.
