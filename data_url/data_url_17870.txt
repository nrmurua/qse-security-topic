Tox is a nice tool for automating testing: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ It enables automatically creating isolated environments for running tests by building a venv with all the requirements and then run test commands. In my experience it's real usefulness just comes from repeatability though. It makes it much easier for developers to run tests the same way as CI does without having to remember what's required to setup specific environments for running different types of listing. Adding a tox.ini for running pylint, and different testing configurations will make it much easier to verify code changes work before people submit PRs. Since it'll like be reduced to a single 3 letter command.
Right now I think the only blocker for this though is that by default we don't package a setup.py in the repo and the setup phase of tox expects that it can run pip/setup.py to install the package in a venv without anything extra.
For examples of other projects where this is used you can take a look at:
All you need to do to run tests and/or style checks for all those projects is clone the repo and run tox
