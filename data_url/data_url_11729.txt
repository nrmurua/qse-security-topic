Qiskit's implementation of QAOA outputs inconsistent results when invoked through the Aer instead of the BasicAer simulator.
Executing this cell on a Jupyter notebook reveals the problem:
The expected result is the first QAOA result output by the code above. It should look like:
qaoa.random_seed does not exist so you end up creating some field and not setting any random seed that ends up being used by qaoa. Try this as the correct way to set the random seed that is used by Aqua is via aqua_globals.
@sami-b95 Did the above make things work for you as expected - if so we can close this issue.
@sami-b95 If we do not hear back from you shortly I will assume the solution I provided fixed things for you and we will close this issue out.
