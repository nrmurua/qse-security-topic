What is the current status of dynamical-decoupling in qiskit-ignis?
I am aware of #545 but the concluding message is a little bit vague and I do not understand if the pull request was closed because the implementation was not generic enough or because there are other (internal?) reasons. @coruscating or @lcapelluto might be able to answer this.
In any case, I had the need to test some dynamical decoupling sequences in the past months with qiskit, so I wrote down an implementation (available here). If this is welcomed, I would be pleased to integrate it within qiskit ignis in the following weeks/months.
A few features of the implementation:
I think it is better to wait for an answer about the closing of #545 before opening a pull-request, but if I am wrong please tell me and I will open a pull request.
@nelimee - thank you very much for your suggestion!
Ignis will eventually be replaced by Qiskit Experiments, written in a way thatâ€™s more modular and reusable for experimentalists, see the following blog:
https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2021/04/qiskit-application-modules/
So we currently do not incorporate new code into Ignis. I therefore suggest that you will re-open your issue in Terra.
Ok thank you for the feedback.
Is there any link that introduce a little bit more "Qiskit Experiment", or it is still only a planned change?
Is the "Qiskit Experiments" this: https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/ibmq_experiment.html or will it be a new module in qiskit.experiments?
