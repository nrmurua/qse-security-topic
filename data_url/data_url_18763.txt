The OpenQASM3 Spec for Arrays states the following:
The reference Type is not defined anywhere in the current Spec.
For clarity and completeness, we should define the reference Type, and its properties.
@steleman can you provide a model PR that would allow the spec to indicate more rigorously that array parameters are passed by reference as we all more or less understand the sense of things?
I think this also covers the constructor / destructor PR.
@steleman can you please comment on @blakejohnson 's question to #450 ?
