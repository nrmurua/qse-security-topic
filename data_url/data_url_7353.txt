It seems like multiplication of sparse superoperators on sparse operators is not defined. For example,
results in
This seems strange!
Edit: bases.multiplicable(so,ρ) returns true in this example as well.
Thanks for pointing that out. Seems like we simply missed that. I will add the function asap. In the meantime you can just add the following function which I quickly drafted to make things work:
As a remark: please be aware that sparse-sparse multiplication in Julia is currently not that efficient. So if you are planning to use this product of a superoperator and an operator in a time-critical function it might be better to leave ρ dense.
I implemented the function as shown above. You can pull the latest master branch to use it (type Pkg.checkout("QuantumOptics") until a new release is drafted.
