In the current documentation I cannot find anywhere how the underdamped spectral density for the HEOM module (i.e. UnderDampedBath) is defined. While for the gamma and w0 parameters this is quite straightforward, different authors use very different conventions in the prefactors multiplying the spectral density (factors of two, pi, gamma, w0, etc.). This makes it very hard to understand how the lam parameter is exactly defined. Having a proper understanding of the lam parameter is quite essential to properly compare with the results obtained via other methods.
I think it would be quite useful to explicitly write down the mathematical formula of the spectral density being used in the documentation. In the mean time, I would also appreciate if anyone with knowledge of the proper definition would be kind enough to share it here.

I would expect the documentation to make it clear what each parameter controls in the spectral density definition.
