The mirror method calls the append method in the circuit passing a tuple while the signature should is: 'append(self, instruction, qargs=None, cargs=None)' causing the append method to fail.
This causes Aqua unit test to fail.
The problem is at line 191 of quantumcircuit.py. I believe it should be: reverse_circ.append(inst.mirror(), qargs, cargs)
