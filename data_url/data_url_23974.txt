When we render a design from Metal to Gmsh using the QGmshRenderer, it fails to render the design and launch Gmsh GUI if Metal GUI is open. Moreover the behaviour is random and it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.
The Gmsh renderer should render and mesh the design properly and then open the Gmsh GUI to show the rendered design.
One possible solution is to modify the conda installation file -- environment.yml, as follows for MacOS.
But still the problem only gets solved with render_design and the launch_gui call fails. We need to find out the reason of this and think of a better fix.
