Is there a way we can run qasm_simulator for more than 24 qbits. (assuming computing and memory resources are available)
I tried to modify the file qiskit-terra/qiskit/providers/basicaer/qasm_simulator.py  and changed the line that checks for max number of qbits.

qiskit-terra version 0.9.1
ðŸš«  We can indeed run qasm_simulator for values above 24 qubits if the system allows in the current version of terra! :)
Note: Here I have used Aer for simulating, BasicAer still doesnt support above 24 qubits. If author can run their implementation on Aer and achieve their goal, then this issue can be closed! :)

Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
Python version 3.9.7
qiskit-terra version: 0.19.1
Technically the original issue is still present, because BasicAer is still limited to 26 qubits, but really the solution to this is to install the full version of Qiskit Aer, so this can be closed.
