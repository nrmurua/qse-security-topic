When trying to link with liboqs on OQS/OpenSSH I run into a configuration error. In config.log I see:
This indicates that either liboqs is not compited with -fPIC or there is some assembly code that is not position indpendent. I believe the former is not the case. I recall having this problem with some assembly code in a version of BIKE.
This was done on an Ubuntu machine:
$ uname -a
Linux himsen-VirtualBox 4.4.0-78-generic #99~14.04.2-Ubuntu [time information] x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
When I tried this on a OSX (10.10.5) I instead saw undefined symbols: log.txt
Disabling picnic resolves the undefined symbols and OQS/OpenSSH also compiles. However, disabling picnic does not resolve the Ubuntu issue.
Hi Torben, I ran into that problem yesterday myself and was able to fix it by building liboqs with
I forgot to push the update to the README.md for openssh-portable, but did just now.  Can you try and see if that fixes it for you?  Even if it does, it still suggests something is not quite right in our build of liboqs that we have to fix, but I am not sure exactly how.
Thanks Douglas, it solves the problem.
