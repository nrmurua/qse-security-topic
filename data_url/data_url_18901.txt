Currently, kernelDeclaration is defined as follows in the grammar.
This returnSignature is defined as follows, while including classicalType.
On the other hand, classicalType is defined in kernelDeclaration after this returnSignature. Therefore, from the grammar, two classicalType can be listed in a kernel declaration after argument specification.
If both of ARROW classicalType and classicalType are allowed to specify a return type, the current grammar may be reasonable (though (returnSignature? | classicalType?) is better). If not, classicalType? is not necessary in kernelDeclaration.
Currently, this qasm can be parsed.
Good catch. Should only be a single return type. You can remove the additional classicalType? following returnSignature?. It should be done how subroutines do it, which are valid.
Fixed in #195
