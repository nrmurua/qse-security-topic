The latest version of QuTIP uploaded to PyPI (4.0.1 uploaded on 2016-12-29) has scipy (>=0.15) listed as a dependency. However, the file fastsparse.py imports get_sum_dtype from scipy.sparse.sputils, which is only available in scipy 0.18 and newer. I believe that the function was not actually used, and the import was removed in commit #596.
I am not certain that the current version still requires scipy(>=0.18), but the version currently available on PyPI (and thus auto-installed with pip) does require it. If the user has an earlier version of scipy, qutip will fail on import (ImportError).
I would try 4.0.2.  The requirements txt file still lists 0.15 so not sure what the issue is.
Yes, 4.0.1 has this issue. Hence the main motivation for 4.0.2.
4.0.1 only really exists on PyPI right now. Website and conda-forge are now 4.0.2. I will be uploading 4.0.2 to PyPI today.
I don't know if 4.0.2 will work with scipy 0.15. It only gets built and tested (import qutip) on conda-forge against numpy 1.10 / scipy 0.17 and numpy 1.11 / scipy 0.18 as far as I know. Our Travis (full) tests only test numpy 1.11 / scipy 0.18.
@nonhermitian do you think we should bump the requirements up to numpy 1.10 / scipy 0.17?
4.0.2 is now the latest release on PyPI.
I can't see why anyone would be installing 4.0.1 now, except from some old package they had downloaded.
Ok, we will continue to claim we are compatible with scipy 0.15 until proven different.
