Someone emailed me, asking about the ability to save a circuit that would work offline twenty years from now.
This is probably a good idea. Basically I'd want to be able to generate an HTML file that contained all the necessary ingredients, including both a script tag containing the contents of src.min.js and an extra script tag to force the loading of the desired circuit.
Isn't the JSON encoding enough? (As it is now in the address.)
It's a slightly different use case.
If I think of a clever way to dynamically pack the html and javascript + circuit-to-load into a single html file, without having to manually quine the whole program, it would fit right in as an option in the export menu (if that's added).
You mean - rather a standalone single-html file? It is possible.

(I use it in my Quantum Game, but only for creating JSON files describing;
I hope that there are no bottlenecks with it's size.)

I'll probably drop the ctrl+s override, since it's not a reliable way to override that particular behavior (i.e. file->save will behave differently, users using differrent OSs with different key combinations won't get it, etc).
