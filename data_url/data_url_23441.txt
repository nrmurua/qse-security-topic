A NumpyJSONDecoder has to be written to decode complex variables introduced in pull-request #227 .
See discussion there. This should probably go into
qcodes.utils.helpers
see also qcodes.utils.helpers.NumpyJSONEncoder
If we decide that anything encodeded should be decoded as well, then we should also encode and decode numpy arrays. I tested 3 methods for that. They all work, but only the binary versions are fast enough if you want to write a larger (e.g. 1000x1000) Numpy array.
Supposedly already there in some form, close when checked
@damazter , Is it there?
I never had the time to write it
So it is not there as far as I know
