The CBox backend Produces Graphical Traces including the Timing Diagram and Hardware Resources Usage as an Intuitive Graphical Monitoring / Debugging Interface for Users. However, Producing the Timing Information in a Simple Textual Format as Time-Annotated QuMis Instructions is Easier to Process By other Tools and Scripts than Complex Structured Data used for the GUI.
Now, the CBox eQASM Backend Generate Timed QuMis along with the actual QuMis:
However, the Timed QuMis file is named 'program.tasm', it Should have the same Name as the original Program.
The File renaming Requires Moving the Timed eQASM up to the eQASM Compiler Interface to Access the Program Name, and thus Doing Same for all eQASM Backends.
Therefore, a separate Issue will be Create for that.
