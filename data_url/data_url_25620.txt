Covers the following
Hi @AlejandroEsquivel - Reg re-usability of ORM models, the 3 base models mapped to the 3 tables will be directly re-usable. However, the other models we write will be more closely tied with te GUI. We are open to any re-use provided it makes sense for both the Web app & Covalent core.
May I suggest that we pick this up again once Covalent core is re-factored to write to the new schema? We can then take a look at the models AQ has written and take a call.
Please add your planning poker estimate with ZenHub @ArunPsiog
