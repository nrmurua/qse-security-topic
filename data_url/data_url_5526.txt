Noise Model doesn't work well if the circuit has a CZ gate along with if_test operators.
Noise Model
Circuit
Obtaining Counts
The output is {'10 0': 1024}
For given quantum error, the expected outcome must be {'00 0': 1024}
It works fine, if I remove the CZ or the if_test block.
I tried same with CX and CY gates, which do not pose any such problems. I also transpiled the circuit with basis including 'cz' but still doesn't improve.
I was not able to reproduce this issue.
Code:
Output:
I used the execute function, which still gives the wrong results.
Is it wrong to use the execute function or does it have some limitations?
