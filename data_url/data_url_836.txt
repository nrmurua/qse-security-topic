Running the following PennyLane circuit,
works accordingly with boto3 v1.26 and throws a value-error with boto3-1.27.0.
Traceback including the error message:
This may be an expected error message (due to some deprecation which I couldn't find any notes about) or an incompatibility issue with the plugin that requires a fix.
System information
@maliasadi Thank you for reporting this. For now we ask that you pin your boto3 version similar to what has been done in https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python/pull/598/files. We are actively looking at a fix to allow newer versions of boto3 with the Amazon Braket Python SDK.
Updating the Braket SDK or Braket PennyLane plugin through pip should also fix this issue (for the same reason, pinning boto3)
