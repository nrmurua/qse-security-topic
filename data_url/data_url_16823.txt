Currently returns a <qiskit.visualization.text.TextDrawing>.  However, it should print to the terminal because it is an explicit command to draw the circuit.
hi, can you share the code to replicate the problem , i would like to look into it if you are okay with it
Anything really:
i just checked in my jupyter lab, its perfectly working

From the terminal, not Jupyter:

Try:
print(qc.draw(output='text'))
Hi @mohfaz, you are right, the possibility is there. However, the issue is about the representation of the object in the terminal. Basically, implementing your work around as the __repr__.
I just PRed a possible fix to this issue.
hi @mohfaz , your method does work on the terminal , however i believe adding the repr function to the source text should avoid any further issues without using commands like print and directly calling circuit.draw.
thanks
I got this error:
C:\Users\naman\Anaconda3\envs\qiskit_programming\lib\site-packages\qiskit\visualization\circuit_visualization.py:263: UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using module://ipykernel.pylab.backend_inline, which is a non-GUI backend, so cannot show the figure.
image.show()
I am using Atom Editor, so temporarily I was able to solve the problem by installing the hydrogen extension, and running the code with it.

Hi @namandoctor , this looks like a different issue. Can you raise this on the qiskit slack or stack exchange? (Also, did you run %matplotlib inline in this notebook?)
In this way, no problem!
