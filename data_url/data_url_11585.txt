Z.exp_i().to_matrix() and X.exp_i().to_matrix() give incorrect results.
The docs string for exp_i is "Return a CircuitOp equivalent to e^-iH for this operator H", so I expect this matrix:
It looks like there are two problems
Z.exp_i() returns  PrimitiveOp(RZGate(1)) which has a spurious (in this case) factor of  1/2 in the phase. https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/38f727b618b0b09a2aaf6deee8ad4e5fda7fb814/qiskit/aqua/operators/primitive_ops/pauli_op.py#L228
RZGate(2).to_matrix() returns the correct matrix, but PrimitiveOp(RZGate(2)).to_matrix() does not. The latter uses a 'unitary_simulator' to compute the matrix. This includes an additional global phase factor, which may not matter in some cases, but it does here.
