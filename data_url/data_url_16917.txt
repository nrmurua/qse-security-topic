Job monitor fails unrepeatably in a fashion suggesting that if the job has finished right at the instant the job monitor loops it ends up comparing None with an int.
Not reproduceable on-demand.
This occured on ibmq_london
Job monitor survive any value returned by backend.
None at present.
It looks like None is a valid return from job.queue_position() ( https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/blob/2216e758d65e48a8cab49826dd769c14de5619e8/qiskit/providers/ibmq/job/ibmqjob.py#L347 ) so the monitoring tools should handle this case.
