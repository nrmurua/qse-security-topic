In some PEC tests we had to define a custom depolarizing channel:

since at that time cirq.DepolarizingChannel was not compatible with 2-qubit gates.
The Cirq issue has been fixed and so we could replace the custom channel with cirq.DepolarizingChannel.
@andreamari This seemed like a very quick fix - replace the channel and make sure pytest runs test_local_depolarizing_representation_with_choi successfully. Let me know if I forgot to change something else because I found only 1 test using this custom channel.
