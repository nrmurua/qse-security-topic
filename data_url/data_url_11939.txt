I'm running 02_vqe_convergence.ipynb, and at the part of Using Gradient framework, it seems that the grad_method fin_diff isn't computing for the optimizer. I changed the grad_method to "param_shift" or "lin_comb" and it works fine.


run 02_vqe_convergence.ipynb.
grad_method fin_diff should compute the correct value as -1.85728.
Hi thanks for your interest and apologies for the slow response! We are currently in the process of reorganising the Qiskit Tutorials, archiving this repo and moving the existing tutorials to the main qiskit repo or other appropriate projects.
In this case, the material mentioned in this issue has already been refactored and should not contain the mentioned bug, you can find it in its new project: https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms/tree/main/docs/tutorials.
Thanks anyway for your feedback and helping us make Qiskit better! ðŸš€
