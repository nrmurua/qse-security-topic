Trying to install artiq 3.4 (py_0+git9db30ce8) on windows 7 64bit fails at the dependency
The most recent windows binaries in the conda repository are v 2.25.1.
I could look into building it myself, but since you'll probably want it in your repository anyway, that doesn't seem worth the effort.
@whitequark I tightened that dependency to match artiq-dev. Are we/should we be using different binutils?
@jordens I don't remember the exact diff between 2.27 and 2.25.1. I think 2.27 is just 2.25.1 plus our patches. The Windows build requires Cygwin and that isn't currently automated.
Why are the automatic tests not catching that?
Catching what?
The ARTIQ conda package not installing correctly on Windows, either on the release-3 branch or master; both specify binutils-or1k-linux >=2.27.
http://buildbot.m-labs.hk/builders/artiq/builds/2026 was for 4c22d64.
In that build build 520 was installed on windows while the parent build was 521.
The windows test is not installing the artiq version that the build is running for http://buildbot.m-labs.hk/builders/artiq-win64-test/builds/718/steps/conda_create/logs/stdio
@whitequark what should we do? different binutils versions on windows (kernel build) and linux (firmware build)? ignore the version?
I believe the clean solution is a) fix the buildbot b) do the build of binutils-or1k-linux 2.27 that wasn't done for Windows.
do the build of binutils-or1k-linux 2.27 that wasn't done for Windows.
Done.
