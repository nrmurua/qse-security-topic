Create interfaces (and basic examples) of classes to aid in optimization algorithms.
Two implementations to examine before doing this:
One way we could do this is to have a cirq.optimize.minimize method analogous to scipy.optimize.minimize. We don't really need to make any classes to do it this way.
closing due to inactivity / don't think this is still relevant
