The notebook on 'using different gates' has an example of classical control for a single bit register. It is not trivial to work out how to adapt this for a many bit register, so an additional example should be given.
This can then be used to answer this question on the QCSE.
I posted this answer to the above question. It seems a bit of a hack to me, but if it represents best practice then I'll add it to the tutorial.
Can we start an issue in terra in this we need to make a decision on this?
I have written a small example here using c_if (is it what you mean by classical control?)

@rraymondhp As I understand, the first two examples here are conditioned on an entire classical register being zero, and the third is conditioned on the register being 100...000. Is this correct? What I'm specifically asking is how to use  a c_if command that is conditioned on just a single bit.
@jaygambetta I opened this issue.
@quantumjim  Yes, you are correct. I was not able to write individual bit as a controller, and hence that style of writing. This is because the c_if only accept argument the whole classical bit.
great lets close here and track in terra
