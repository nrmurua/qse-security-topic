Trying to take a station.snapshot(update=True) fails, and the error only says timeout, but not which instrument that timeout is from.
Oh interesting... a rare disadvantage of add_parameter... that your instrument driver itself isn't in the traceback at all!
It's instrument "2" of course! Yes, we can do better.
