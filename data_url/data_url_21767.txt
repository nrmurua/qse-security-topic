Expectation is that frequencies are left at 2*self.f by end of experiment but observe self.f.
There is only one SPI bus, so setting several DDS on the same card at the same time is not possible. Isn't there a collision error in the log?
When operating AD9910 in Single Tone Mode there are 8 independent Profiles. Set PROFILE[2:0] to select the desired profile. A change in the state of the profile pins with the next rising edge on SYNC_CLK updates the DDS with the parameters specified by the selected profile.
AFAICT it is straightforward to update several AD9910 DDSs in parallel. Use a pair of PROFILEs on each DDS and switch between them round robin.
0) load FTW_i into profile_0 on both DDSs
Non-parallel DDS updates follow naturally. CPLD keeps track of which profile is currently selected by PROFILE[2:0].
It would be great if you try your suggestion, report back, and then prepare a high quality pull request.
If this was user error and there is nothing more, we can close it.
