I thought I know a thing or two but failed miserably to run it locally. Any hints or overview, please, on environment would be helpful - I will update docs respectively then after get it up and running.
Well, you need node, npm, & yarn, it's based on the Theia editor. The AppImage should work cross-platform, but I've only tested it on Linux.
There's been a lot of issues with node packages this past year or so, people intentionally sabotaging packages and the like, so it's difficult. I'm working on getting the editor updated to the latest versions of the needed packages
