The idea would be to have an easy access to the samples of a Waveform, preferentially without computing the full array of samples. Currently, the properties first_value and last_value do this for the first and last values, but a __getitem__ would replace them and extend the functionality to the entire waveform.
The keys would be the time in ns, also allowing specification from the end (e.g. t=-1) and slicing.
You can assign me.
@LaurentAjdnik Great! There's a bit of nuance here, but I'm sure you're up to the task. A few pointers:
Thanks again, and feel free to reach out with any questions!
Lots of questions raised indeed. I will draft-PR something soon and we can discuss based on that.
