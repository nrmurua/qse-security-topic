Describe the bug
src/braket/devices/local_simulator.py imports pkg_resources (https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python/blob/105433edb22ad2ccb50afbb72fd74ccb8d8d63b9/src/braket/devices/local_simulator.py#L17), but it fails when setuptools is not installed.
setuptools can sometimes be missing, depending on how you create the (virtual) environment.
I think setuptools should be specified as a dependency explicitly, i.e. added to install_requires in setup.py.
In my case, I created the virtual environment with Poetry, with amazon-braket-sdk listed in  pyproject.toml ([tool.poetry.dependencies] section).
(Actually it seems to be an unintended behavior (cf. python-poetry/poetry#6328), but I still think that the dependency should be explicitly specified.)
To reproduce
Expected behavior
The import succeeds without errors.
