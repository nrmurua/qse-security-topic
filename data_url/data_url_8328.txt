Exception: Invalid keyword argument 'use_precond' passed to steadystate.
and I cannot seem to get around it. I am not sure why its not working, I tried to install 4.3.0 instead and it still did not function. It runs if I comment out the use_precond but I am not sure why its giving me this error and how to proceed from here.
