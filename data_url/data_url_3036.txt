There is an extra copy of scratch back to state in the xmon simulator.  We could avoid this copy by have two states and a flag that keeps track of which state is the current state.  Since copy is the heaviest operation in the simulator this could potentially speed up the simulator significantly.
This is an obsolete issue.
