Adding a QASM Validity Check Systematically in All Tests where a QASM is Produced (when Programs are Compiled). This is Very Handy for Locating the Error Source when the QASM is not Valid.
Note: I Tested all the QASMs Produced in the 'test_output' Folder, but I Realized that a lot of Programs within the Tests have the Same Names so the QASM is Overwritten Multiple Times in each Test Run, and Consequently Some Errors cannot be Detected but Just a Simple Check of the Files in the QASM Folder.
This is done in Commit 87e249a.
