When I create a QuantumCircuit from a qasm string:

It works correctly. But if I get the qasm from the circuit:
it creates as many custom gate definitions as times the gate is used.
The qasm should be:
Internally, these custom gates are independent instances. I dont think that we currently support a way to know they are the same.
The effect is the same, in the meaning that the generated qasm is working qasm and creates the equivalent QuantumCircuit object. Based on this, I would not consider this a bug.
âœ… Issue reproducible in the latest version of terra!
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
gate nG0 q0 { h q0; }
gate nG0_1923100198512 q0 { h q0; }
qreg q[3];
creg c[3];
nG0 q[0];
nG0_1923100198512 q[1];
Will update comment/add more comments if cause is found/fixed!
