Good morning,
today I got access to 'ibm-q-research' provider but I can't submit jobs, I changed my provider into
provider  = IBMQ.get_provider(hub='ibm-q-research',group='Stefan-Barison', project='main')
but every time I try to submit a job I get the error
qiskit.providers.ibmq.exceptions.IBMQBackendApiError: "Error submitting job: '400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://api-qcon.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/Network/ibm-q-research/Groups/Stefan-Barison/Projects/main/Jobs. Reached maximum number (0) of concurrent jobs, Error code: 3458.'"
Since the maximum of concurrent jobs is 0, I can't submit any job.
Even if I  use the circuit composer in https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/ and I try to submit a simple circuit evaluation, while with the public provider all works well, but i need to work with ibmq_rome
Try to submit a job (does not mater which) using my new research provider.
At least I expect to submit 1 job at the time (although the limit should be 20 if I ain't wrong)
I don't have any suggested solutions, it seems a bug or my account has not been fully activated yet
Hi, this is not really an issue around Aqua more for the IBM Q Provider. However I did see on the ibm-q-experience channel of the public Qiskit Slack workspace a report of the same problem. There it was replied to as being a bug and would be investigate and was reported fixed a couple of hours ago and for that person to try again. Would you like to retry your code and if this is fixed then close this.
