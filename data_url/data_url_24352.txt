Ansys  open ansys project even if project has no design
Could this even manage to open Ansys if it isn't already open?
I will have to make changes to pyEPR to do this.
After making changes in pyEPR, how to make people update their pyEPR install lib?
@dwang429  and @jfwills  can help do this. we should probably have a demo on it, it will come up a lot
On branch QiskitMetal-issue200 on pyEPR, I also allowed pinfo to return if the project is missing, along with log message. Will like a review before merging to master.
pyEPR has a commit to address this issue.

Will close this issue.
