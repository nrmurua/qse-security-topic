Description of the issue
following #3786
check/format-incremental now takes ~8 seconds instead of ~1 second
It also puts a little promotional message each time

I suspect many had gotten in the habit of running format-incremental regularly during development, so this slows things down.
Cirq version
0.10.0
Speedwise, we can have it only format changed_files similar to pylint.
I think it definitely should only change changed files if it's being called from format-incremental
