The two 2-qubit errors with the same superoperator affects the same CNOT gate in different ways.
I suppose print(np.linalg.norm(superop_CX_1 - superop_CX_2))  gives a very small number (in the scale of 1e-12 to 1e-16). Because both noise models apply the same noise superoperator to the same CNOT gate.  In fact, in the noise model 2, if I write  error_ver_2 = QuantumError(error), both noisy CNOT gates are exactly the same.
Thanks for your time! If it is just because I did not understand how QuantumError works, then I apologize for the trouble, and please enlighten me.

I think this is a manifestation of the same bug as #1415.  Could you try upgrading to Aer 0.10.2 and check whether it works correctly there?  (For what it's worth, I get the same results up to 1ULP with Aer 0.10.2+, but can reproduce your error with Aer 0.10.1.)
Thank you. It is indeed the same issue. I have no problem with Aer 0.10.2.
