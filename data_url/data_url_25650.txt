Please add your planning poker estimate with ZenHub @cjao
An implicit assumption here is that the dependencies for an electron remain the same across all invocations of the electron. This seems like a reasonable assumption for import deps (the electron's code is static) but may need to be revisited for file deps.
Supporting requirements.txt is a bit tricky. The file format is more general than just a list of packages, and Pip doesn't expose any public API to parse the file. Perhaps we can just support a packages list for now.
