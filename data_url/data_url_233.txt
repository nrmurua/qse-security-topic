Docker Image ID: sha256:a2cb46ef4db9a8f7f1c8c144e6eb68f88a3282e61b8d85b39cd9f202ae54f6e4
More info:
Performing the change below in the file /opt/nvidia/cudaq/lib/cmake/cudaq/CUDAQEmQirConfig.cmake solves the issue, but I don't know if it's a bug solution or evasion.
This may be due to #658, which went into main yesterday and changed cudaq-em-qir with cudaq-em-default. We need to figure out if this is a transient issue with Docker images or if there needs to be additional changes.
@srulre - I can't find the exact Docker image you're using but I suspect the problem is that we need to rename and update cmake/Modules/CUDAQEmQirConfig.cmake as a follow-up to #658.
@srulre - I can't find the exact Docker image you're using
I pulled it ~6 hours ago, so it's probably the latest version. Thanks.
@srulre - When this job finishes (probably in about 90 minutes), please try to update your image and let us know if this resolves your problem, or if you have additional problems. Thanks for letting us know about this problem.
I confirmed that the new latest image has updated cmake files:
Please let me know if this resolves your issues or if you still see remaining problems.
Works now, thanks!
