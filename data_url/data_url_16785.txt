If I have a matrix of say
([
[1.5, 0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0, 1.6],
[0, 0, 1, 0],
[0, 1, 0, 0] ]), how do I decompose it?
Hi @monica1131 , for a given unitary matrix, qiskit.quantum_info.synthesis.two_qubit_cnot_decompose will generate the KAK decomposition (in your example though, the provided matrix is not unitary).
The Qiskit slack (linked from the bottom of https://qiskit.org ) or the quantum computing stack exchange ( https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/ ) are the best venues for questions (and will generally generate faster responses than asking here).
