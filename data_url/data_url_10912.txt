I got a huge QUBO matrix with the size of 872760*872760 to be solved by qbsolv and it says
qbsolv error - memory request for X[872760][872760], -834 Mbytes  denied
I'm wondering if there is any solution to this, is 16GB memory enough for solving this problem? Or I should just use a cluster with more memory to solve it?
small qubo matrix with the size of 140*140 is ok, on both local tabu solver and D-Wave sampler. Thanks in advance.
Hi @yongchengding , a qubo matrix of that size (with single precision floats) would need 872760*872760*4/2 bytes, or ~1.5 TB of memory.
It is probable that your problem could be expressed with a smaller formulation. Is there anything you can tell us about how you're generating the matrix?

Thanks a lot. I've reduced the problem to a smaller scale and the result was perfect!
Great!
