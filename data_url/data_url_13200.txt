There are cases in which ExpFactory fails to "choose" the optimal sign of $A$ in the model $f(x) = A e^{(-B \lambda)} + C$, which determines if  $f(x)$ is a decreasing or an increasing function.  The problems appears only if the option asymptote is passed (asymptote corresponds to fixing $C$ in the model ).
The reason for this problem is that the sign of $A$ is guessed by Mitiq based on data without taking into account the value of asymptote. However the sign of $A$ should be based also on $C$, if $C$ is constrained.
This is ok as long as measured data decay or grow towards the expected direction $C$. If not, the extrapolation fails to get the best fit.
In both cases the expected results are, approximately:
