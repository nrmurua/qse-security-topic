It looks like sub-classing QuantumCircuit, as done in the circuit library, causes jupyter execute to re-execute each circuit method, e.g. cx, cy, again as it thinks it is something new.  This causes the docs builds to be very slow.  For example:
I would expect that the underlying gate examples do not get executed every time I build the circuit docs.
I am not sure how to fix this given that we add gate methods in a unconventional way.  Perhaps make the library objects functions rather than sub-classing QuantumCircuit.
