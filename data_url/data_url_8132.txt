Describe the bug
Currently qutip is requiring scipy > 1.12  and in the CI checks scipy <1.5 is being checked. There was a bug in scipy 1.4 See .Stackoverflow error , bug report   that has been fixed  by this solution in the 1.5 release.  This is related to the linalg.eigh() API which performs eigenvalue calculation, it causes error of this form  Intel MKL ERROR: Parameter 12 was incorrect on entry to ZHBRDB,  which mostly the get silenced, and  instead of terminating it just outputs an array of zeros except for the last entry.   This issue occurs exclusively when using the API with high dimensional tensors, which are probably not being handled in the tests, but will inevitably cause miscalculations for the users as eigenvalue finding of hermitics  is pervasive.
To Reproduce
Just as an illustration you cun run
pytest qutip/tests/test_superop_reps.py -s -k SuperChoiChi
from the codes in #1491  in an environment like the generated for coverage tests in the CI
The terminal out put is
