Right now, the option scope.trigger_source = "asg_trigger_positive_edge" will only let the scope trig once at the ASG setup call. It would be nice to trig on every asg cycle:
This could be either a new trigger_source : "asg_sync_positive_edge"
or simply modify the ASG trigger to send an event at every cycle...
I am not sure which solution is the best.
This is possibly related to issue issue #15 : there have been changes in the ASG logic that were merged when the fpga code was migrated to v0.95, that have not yet been implemented in the python interface. It is possible that with proper understanding of what the logic does with a certain register configuration, this problem will solve itself. If not, once you understood that logic, please solve these two issues at once.
To you question, I would prefer the ASG to behave like a commercial one: If a periodic waveform is output, it should send a trigger once per period. This is easy to implement, just look at where the wrapping is done.
Done in #29. Works. No more distinction btw pos and neg edge for asg, but btw ch1 and ch2 from asg
