Add a check for mypy in 
Right now, ~/toqito$ mypy . fails due to following:
scipy is not in typeshed as suggested by mypy's docs.

It might be better to ignore scipy related warnings/errors raised by mypy.
scipy/scipy#19502 (comment)
The same issue in scipy also applies to toqito. So, we will have to
https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubs.html#stub-files
How scipy ignores all issues related to [import-untyped] modules in their package: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/fcf7b652bc27e47d215557bda61c84d19adc3aae/mypy.ini
To work on either of the above options, need to first fix toqito/channel_metrics/fidelity_of_separability.py: error: Source file found twice under different module names: "channel_metrics.fidelity_of_separability" and "toqito.channel_metrics.fidelity_of_separability". The same error is applied to all toqito.some_module. Might be related to how mypy finds the import path.

Edit: Ignoring all module is installed, but missing library stubs or py.typed marker, issues that need to be fixed are in the attached file mypy_errors.txt. It might be better to create a PR per module or per function.
@vprusso FYI I am un-assigning myself from this issue.
I believe trying to fix some of the errors in the txt file might require a major refactor considering quite a few functions allow multiple types of inputs and same variable is re-assigned a different value/type based on these inputs.
For example, the following lines are flagged by mypy due to the redefinition. We disabled pylint warnings for the same.

What if we defined one private method per allowed option for an input? Then we could call these in the main function sk_vector_norm.
Sounds good, that's completely reasonable. Thanks for the heads up, @purva-thakre !
Great!
