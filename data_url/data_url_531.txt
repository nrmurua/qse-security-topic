Similar to the statevector mode, where we compute the expectation value from the state vector, we can also implement the exp-val calculation for Aer noisy sim based on the density matrix.
Currently, we can already get the density matrix in the newly-added density_matrix mode. Need to add a helper to compute exp-val-z from the density matrix.
Implemented in #379. Closing.
