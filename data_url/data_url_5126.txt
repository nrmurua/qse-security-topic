I am using Grove's VQE to run on a QVM with a noise model but I get a TypeError when I run it. Below is an example of how one would use the VQE on a QVM with a noise model:
However, this results in the following error:
Is there a way to run a VQE on a QVM with a noise model ?
Hi @pacobontenbal , could you try updating to the beta version of quantum-grove and let me know what errors you get?
Hi, i tried running the same code snippet, but with the beta version of Grove and it seems like ik get the following error:
@pacobontenbal can you share the pyquil script you're running?
@notmgsk It's the same pyquil script as in the initial issue report, so:
@pacobontenbal Sorry for missing that. The issue is where you pass qvm=noisy_qvm.qam to vqe_run() -- it should be qc=qc. (Be sure to update to the recent 2.0.0b version of grove: https://pypi.org/project/quantum-grove/2.0.0b0/)
I'm sorry I used the same pyquil script but i did update to the beta version you referred to and changed the variables accordingly, so my previous script should be disregarded, I actually ran:
@notmgsk Yeah i've tried that before too, but it seems that it says quilc is not running while I do have a server running, giving me the following error:
With this error in the console:
You may have the qvm server running, but it looks like the compiler server is not running. Issue quilc -R -P at your terminal.
