Currently, running make html produces a _build/html directory that is 50MB large.  This causes problems with the qutip/qutip.github.io repository, because currently part of our deployment process involves copying this directory in a new folder in this repo every time we do a minor release.  The docs folder of the website is already 239MB (and downloads is another 154M, but that's a separate problem - we need to start releasing the PDF documentation in GitHub Releases from this repo and hot-linking to fix that), which is already somewhat beyond "reasonable" for a website.
There are two main problems causing this right now:
Both of these are quite fixable I think, but may require us patching/intercepting the output of Sphinx.  This can be sensibly done within the Makefile, but it's a very nontrivial task.
