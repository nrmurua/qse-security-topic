A condition to verify the limit of decimal limitation while creating token is required.
max decimals = 19 - log10(max amount) - 1
It would be a good idea to verify the formula and add positive/negative tests.
There are some disabled tests here:

the proto definition uses uint64t. That limits the max value to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.
depending on the max amount defined for the token, the number of decimal positions should be restricted so all values are representable.
Issue fixed in PR #1257
