qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction.BooleanExpression fails with message that the tweedledum library is required. However, tweedledum is not listed a requirement for the qiskit-terra package.
Use API's that instantiate the BooleanExpression class. E.g.
Leads to error:
No error about missing library should happen.
Add tweedledum to ./requirements.txt.
Related to #5853 and #5830 where tweedledum is present in ./requirements-dev.txt, but not added to ./requirements.txt
Tweedledum is an optional dependency, mostly because it hasn't fully stabilized the python api yet and also because there are some packaging issues for some of our supported platforms. However, it is correctly listed in the setup.py:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/setup.py#L108
which enables you to install terra with tweedledum using:
This is also documented, albeit not very clearly worded, in the documentation for the class: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction.BooleanExpression.html#qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction.BooleanExpression
@mtreinish I get a similar error message when running tests locally with the command tox --epy37. I can install tweedledum locally, but that doesn't solve the error message inside the tox environment.

Did you have an existing tox venv created? If you did and it had an old version of tweedledum installed tox may not have pulled in the new requirement on subsequent runs and updated the venv. (this was a longstanding bug in tox with requirements files that I learned recently has been fixed and will be included in the upcoming tox 4.0 release). You can try rebuilding the venv with tox -epy37 -r which tells tox to rebuild the virtualenv.
@mtreinish I did rebuild with the -r option and the problem remained. But I cannot reproduce this now (tests work locally at the moment), so I am not sure what happened.
pip install tweedledum doesn't work, what do I do about this?
