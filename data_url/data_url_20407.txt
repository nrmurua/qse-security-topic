Pull request #158 added a way to enable/disable each algorithm at compile-time.  But subsequent applications that compile against the resulting liboqs build won't know which algorithms were actually enabled/disabled in the version of liboqs they're compiling against.  So we need some way to pass this information down.  The way that comes to mind is to have a .h file created during ./configure that #defines each of the compile-time options, and then this header file is included in all the other liboqs headers and part of the make install command.  This way when other applications compile against the installed version of liboqs, they will also get the #define options passed through and can make choices based on that, if they need to.
Fixed by #177
