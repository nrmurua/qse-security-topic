In cirq, a KeyCondition evaluates to True if the value in that measurement key is not zero. Thus it outputs qasm if (mkey!=0). However qasm has no not-equal symbol.
Qasm only supports conditions of the form mkey == {i}, for literal integer i.
I'd recommend adding optional fields comparator (EQUALS or NOT_EQUALS), and value: int to KeyCondition, with default being not equals zero. Then output qasm only if the comparator is equality.
This needs fixed on the parsing side too.
This is a fairly straightforward fix and could be a good first issue.
Alternatively leave KeyCondition alone and use SympyCondition for qasm support. (I find myself leaning toward this option, keeping KeyCondition simple).
