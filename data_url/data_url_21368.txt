If the GUI is maximized, then closed, then restarted, a docked XY plot applet has grown in size vertically.
Confirmed on Linux. Does not happen on Windows.
only happens to me if the applet is vertically adjacent to the explorer
On state restore a big number applet sometimes stays small. This is in the browser on the right hand dock area.

This one is probably another Qt window embedding bug unrelated to this issue. I suppose that it grows to the correct size when you resize the dock?
Correct.
