Hi!
I cannot see my result when library was changed:
"WebGL is not supported by your browser - visit https://get.webgl.org for more info"
On this page WebGL is fully supported, and works fine
Should I back to chrome?
Thanks!

Hi @OneDonMateo, thanks for the bug report! Can I ask you what changed that caused you to see this message --- does it still work fine in Chrome?
Same issue there.
Maybe it's related to my old saved structures (old diagrams). I can create new and let you know...
Just speculating @josh146 but maybe an update to plotly caused this issue?
Can confirm this occurs for me on both Chrome and Firefox. As there have been no updates on our end, I'm guessing you're right --- a plot.ly update is causing the issue.
This is now fixed thanks to @antalszava!
