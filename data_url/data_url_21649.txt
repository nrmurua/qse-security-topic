Hello, I am first to ARTIQ!
So I have some trouble with connecting FPGA(KC705) to computer(OS : Ubuntu 18.04 LTS ).
FPGA is connected through JTAG cable, and Ethernet cable directly (without any hub).
Input commands were
"
$ artiq_flash -t kc705 -V nist_clock
$ artiq_mkfs flash_storage.img -s mac 00:0A:35:02:A1:DF -s ip 169.254.8.19
$ artiq_flash -t kc705 -V nist_clock -f flash_storage.img storage start
$ artiq_run led.py
"
And execution result is below.

<Figure.3>
Device connection is set as below!

<Figure.4>
As you can see in figures, 'artiq_flash' command works well!
So, I think JTAG works without any problem.
However, when I implement 'artiq_run led.py', it displays 'No route to host'.
Also, 'ping 169.254.8.19' responds well, but 'ping 169.254.8.10' does not.
My question is below!
Do I need additional connection, like UART and SFP, or device, for example hub ?
Is 'core_addr' in 'device_db.py' the IP of enp3s0?
Thank you!
P.S. If I set 'core_addr' to IP of PC(192.168.0.24) or enp3s0(169.254.8.19), 'conncetion refused' occurs.
No. As long as the board is flashed and the RJ45 is connected it should ping.
No. It should be the IP of the device.
From your screenshot, you flashed a link-local IPv4 address into the device, which can cause problems. You should flash a proper LAN IP address into the device - perhaps ask your network administrator for one. If you are unfamiliar with IP networking, try setting up a network connection manually between two PCs, and once you understand what is going on, move to the device.
I don't see any issue coming from ARTIQ itself here, so closing.
P.S. If I set 'core_addr' to IP of PC(192.168.0.24) or enp3s0(169.254.8.19), 'conncetion refused' occurs.
This is expected since ARTIQ will try to connect to your PC instead of the device.
