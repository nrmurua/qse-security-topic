Would be interesting to see benchmarks against QuTiP 4.1. QuTiP 3.1 is a bit dated.
Yes I absolutely agree. I just realized that on archlinux the AUR package for python2 is qutip 4.0 while for python3 it is qutip 3.1. I will rerun the tests tomorrow for the latest official release. Thanks for the heads up!
No problem.  Good to see someone getting into open-source quantum simulation.
I ran the benchmarks on qutip 4.1 and for partial traces it is a huge improvement. However, for the operator based tests (expect_operator, qfunc_operator ans variance_operator) it gives wrong results. I submitted an issue at qutip/qutip#681.
All benchmarks displayed on the website are now done with QuTiP 4.1.
