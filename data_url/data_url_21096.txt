I have Python 3.6.3 via PyEnv and tried the install process with sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt.
The process fails when PYTHON_LIBRARIES and PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRSare not found, and think they should be added to CMakeLists.txt of qrllib, but this is installed via requirements.txt.
Is there a way I can specify them in the QRL setup?
Should I attempt to just download/install qrllib separately rather than via requirements.txt?
thank you

Hi @ubidefeo
qrllib is using find_package(PythonLibs 3.4 REQUIRED) (cmake's FindPythonLibs) to detect python development libraries. These two should have been set. Are you sure you have the python development headers installed?
We suggest using brew because it does not only install python but also the contents of python-devel (header files, etc.).
You can always follow the instructions in qrllib to install it independently.
thank you @jleni
I'll try installing python3 with homebrew, although I kinda like the PyEnv way.
Keep you posted :)
As far as I understand, you can use both simultaneously. I cannot be sure because I don't use PyEnv, however, I use python with both brew and conda without problems.
@jleni
wow!
BOOM!
thank you so much for the heads-up. I would have struggled for quite a while :D
no problem üëç
