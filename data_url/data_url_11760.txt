Computes wrong gradient for qaoa.

Computes the parameter shift rule for the params. Does not include the product rule for when one parameter is used for more than one gate.
Init qaoa circuit
Compute gradient
Compare with actual gradient (using, say, pennylane)
Uses product rule
Use the product rule
@Nick-Singstock do you have any thought?
@BryceFuller I believe the new gradient logic that has just been added has product rule support. Presumably this issue could be addressed by allowing AQGD to support a gradient function that was passed in rather than just ignore it as today. Any thoughts - would the gradient need to be typed checked here to ensure it was an analytic gradient? Is this something you might be able to take a look at?
Taging also @adekusar-drl to give his opinion on this.
Closing as there is a issue now opened in Terra to fix this in conjunction with the gradient framework that did not exist at the time.
