@imranashraf , I did a fresh update of the latest work on the CCL eqasm compiler branch and I get massive amounts of assertion errors. These cause my program to crash (much harder than ever before).
I would like to know what happened and how they got introduced.
For clarity, I am working on commit  2e55705 . I have first deleted the cbuild folder and then reinstalled everything using pip install -e .  . Runing py.test -v directly after leads to these problems.
This is running on windows (the intended measurement computer). Error message is shown in screenshot below. I will try if this reproduces on my laptop.

@imranashraf
Ran the same tests on my mac. pulled latest changes, deleted the cbuild folder and reinstalled using pip install -e .. Results are below. I don't think the entire bug report is useful.
The main difference is that it does perform a hard crash here but still most tests fail.
@AdriaanRol you mean on Mac, it does not perform a hard crash, Right?
@imranashraf This is correct.
The main problem was difference in end line on linux and windows. A minor issue was instructions which were not available in config file were being used in std tests. The crash on windows was not because of openql but because of qisa-as. Because of opcode mismatch it was crashing. All the tests now pass on windows as well as linux as shown below.
@imranashraf I'll test it now.
If everything works as expected I suggest we merge to master and tag this as a release (v0.3.0) and note that that is the version we use in M18.
I don't think all that we intended for V0.3.0 (CC light release) is is there but we can move that to a later version.
@imranashraf
Updating did not resolve the problem.
Will now try removing the repository and running pip install -e . again.
