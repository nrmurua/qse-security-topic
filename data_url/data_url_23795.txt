A measurement process (startup with qc.Loop) is given the name Measurement. This name is used explicitly in checking whether the process is a measurement or something else:
It would be nice to give measurements a custom name, so we can easily identify them. So instead of:
we could have
The .name field should be used either as an identifier or as a type both not both. We could give a QcodesProcess both a nameand type field.
Propose name of process is whatever the name is specified in the loop syntax
The qcodes Loop  should not be used any more, closing the issue.
