Currently, the guess pulses are calculated in such a way that the values at 0 and T are not preserved. This runs counter to the point in the documentation (http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/qucontrol/krotov/blob/4dff23f/docs/time_discretization.ipynb, input cell 6) that the guess controls must be discretized to tlist before converting them to guess pulses.
