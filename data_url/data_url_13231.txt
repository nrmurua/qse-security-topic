I think I have attached the output of pip install here - the full traceback. Can you see it?
I just said "pip install mitiq". That is all there is to it
Hi @anna-naden, maybe your Python version is too recent. Mitiq is currently tested with Python 3.7 and 3.8. We are working on supporting newer Python versions but it's not straightforward.
Hi.. yes, it is incompatible with Python 3.10. The issue was resolved by creating a virtual environment with Python 3.9
Glad you got the issue resolved, but sorry you hit it in the first place!
Since we have #1292 open to upgrade our python capabilities, I'll close this for now. Thanks for opening the issue!
