Hello Merav, I am pursuing a project revolving around using MBQC as a tool for Blind Quantum Computation Protocol and this simulation method will be very helpful for my research, I would love to help in develop a MBQC based simulator, Is there any way in which we could reopen the issue and start active development?
Hi @karthiknair253 , on a personal level, I find this subject very interesting, but unfortunately I won't have the bandwidth to work on it this year. Of course, if you or one of your colleagues would like to do the development and contribute the code, it would be great. I would be happy to help if possible. All the best with your research! @chriseclectic, do you know if there are any plans for such development?
Hi guys,
Just want to point out that we have developed a MBQC toolkit in Paddle Quantum. All of your desired requirements are met. You can even do quantum machine learning with it! Please find the source code here and the tutorials/API documentations here.
We have also applied the MBQC toolkit to the universal blind quantum computation. You can find the tutorial here if interested. Basically, we have a module that automatically translates user's quantum circuit to a MBQC algorithm with brickwork pattern. Then the computation follows the UBQC protocol and interacts in real-time between your laptop and our cloud server :)
