If I have a superoperator already in the Kraus form (that is, as a list of operators), I cannot directly compute its average gate fidelity: average_gate_fidelity will try to convert it to Kraus anyway:

As a minimal example, shouldn't something like
be made to work?
What about adding a check in average_gate_fidelity so that if the input is already a list then don't do anything (although it seems more robust to have some kind of wrapper to flag an object as list of operators of a Kraus decomposition)?
I noticed this recently while addressing an issue for which the test of average_gate_fidelity was failing when the random supermatrix included an odd dimensional object. I had your same impression but was unsure of the proper function. I am pinging @BoxiLi and @quantshah to keep an eye on this, if they are knowledgeable, in the future months. Thank you @lucainnocenti, and if you think that your fix is fine, please open directly a pull request.
