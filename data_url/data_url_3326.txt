I'm unable to install latest pyQuil together with latest Sphinx via pip on Python 3.7 while running Ubuntu 20.04. I think this is caused by how pyQuil pins the requirements inside pyproject.toml.
Starting with a clean Python 3.7 environment and trying to install latest stable pyQuil and Sphinx:
Trying latest RC of pyQuil leads to the same issue:
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
Python Version (python -V): Python 3.7.12
Python Environment Details (pip freeze or conda list): Empty
I don't think importlib-metadata has actually had any meaningful breaking changes so we should be able to expand that range. In fact, it may be worth us updating our Sphinx version anyway to verify the fix. I'll take a look at this and try to get a fix into rc soon.

Thanks for taking care of this so quickly @dbanty! 👍
