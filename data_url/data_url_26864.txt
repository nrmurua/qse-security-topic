Hi there,
I'm performing a comparison between DZVP and TZVP. For reason there does not seem to be a H TZVP-SR
is there a specific reason for this?
thanks
If referring to the MOLOPT basis sets: I'm not sure about the reason, but we have an unpublished TZVP-SR for H and at least in the deltatest it does not improve significantly over the DZVP.
