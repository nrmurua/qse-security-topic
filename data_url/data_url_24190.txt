The jogs are drawn, but the method computing the connecting segments (connect_frame) takes in the pins and the lead_straight values, thus outputing a solution that ignores the jogs already drawn, causing weird loopy shapes (basically the lead points are suffixed with the same route as if it had no leads.
just give a jog to one of the leads of any RouteFramed
Must recognize the new point of origin, thus ignoring the leads (which are already taken into account from the leads generation step) and using as analysis source point the new tips of the lead (not the pins)
