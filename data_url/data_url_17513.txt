The Pulse API will supply a pulse scheduler, which in conjunction with the CommandDefinition (#1918) will allow compilation of QuantumCircuits to a PulseSchedule (#1919). See #1713 for more information.
For v0.8 a simple pulse scheduler will naively compile a QuantumCircuit to a PulseSchedule. v0.9 will include a more advanced scheduler that utilizes a PassManager.
After a discussion with @ajavadia, we will still implement the basic pulse scheduler for the push forward/backwards scheduling policy as this will be useful for testing the extensible passmanager based scheduler (#1922).
The rough pseudocode for the function is something like. We should also consider a push_backwards_scheduler, these will share much of the same code. The scheduler should also return the header information that qiskit includes for circuits in the qobj.
