Hi everyone,
After installation via Conda I was able to flash Pipistrello board but I keep getting the following error when running led.py (copied from artiq manual) in artiq-main directory. How could I solve this problem?

thanks
Did you establish the PPP link?
Hi Sébastien,
I have added two files to the ~/miniconda3/envs/artiq-main directory, one is device_db.pyon and another is led.py from the manual. Here's the command that I run on one tab while I run   source activate artiq-main  while in the artiq-main directory:
sudo pppd /dev/ttyUSB1 115200 noauth nodetach local nocrtscts novj 10.0.0.1:10.0.0.2
which I am guessing is PPP that you are referring to. After which I run the command artiq_run on file led.py
However I still get the same error.
thanks again for your help.
The device_db.pyon and led.py files can be put in any folder, they do not need to be in the conda environment folder.
Is the PPP connection succeeding? Have you edited device_db.pyon to set the IP address of the board (10.0.0.2)?
Thanks for your rapid answer. Yes, I set one to 10.0.0.2, and it didn't work. I also set all of them to the same address and got exact same error as before.

You are editing the wrong entries, you should only edit the comm entry. Can you ping the board?
Hi Sébastien,
Thanks for your help. We got it work but I also had to replace the device_db.pyon file from miniconda3 with the respective file from conda installation, or else it wouldn't work.

What do you mean?
Miniconda3 itself doesn't come with a device_db.pyon.
I see what you're saying. I just assumed that I need to put that file in the directory where I run the script.
