As it might be so
Can I ask for your comments on this proposal, @dstebila @xvzcf @christianpaquin ? Anyone else?
I support reducing the number of tested algs at check it, test all of them on a nightly basis.
Makes sense.
In PQClean, all of the tests are parameterized by a filtered_test command which then pulls various environment variables to decide what to skip.  These environment variables can then be set in the various CI test configurations.
I'll remove the slow-running algs from the per-commit appveyor run; I'm waiting for @xvzcf to finish work to properly disable the algorithm.
Just noting that it seems to be the SPHINCS and Rainbow variants that impose a big slow down on the Appveyor tests.
