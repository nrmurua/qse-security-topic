As a follow on to #3940, pulse objects are often hashed for comparison. Instructions/Channels are considered immutable and may also have performance improvements by caching these hashes.
I'd like to give this one a go :)
Awesome! I've assigned to you. Please see #3940 for an idea of how to go about this.
@taalexander I've started working on this but am a bit lost when it comes to testing (am generally not very experienced with python testing or the Pulse codebase). I couldn't find any examples of the initial hashing being tested for any of the pulse files, and I'm struggling to apply the testing examples in #3940 in the context of Pulse objects. Could you please give me an example of how to test the hashing for a Pulse object?
Heres a link to the branch I'm working on fyi: https://github.com/javabster/qiskit-terra/tree/fix-issue-%233951
Hello @javabster, looks like you're off to a great start. If you could create a WIP (or draft) PR it will make taking a look and recommending an approach easier. For testing of hashes, I would simply verify that if you create two objects they are equal and that the hashing approach works for pulse objects that inherit from the base object.

Thanks, for the comment, just opened a draft pull request: #4091 :)
Closed by #4091. Thank you @javabster ðŸ˜„!
