The outcome for the expectation value -- see below -- varies between QASM and statevector/eval computation.
Notably, the observable is non-Hermitian but can be decomposed into two Hermitian observables.
The QASM output should be equivalent to the eval outcome.
I would expect that the problem lies in the eval function of the ListOp.
Can be resolved by converting the exp_val using the PauliExpectation converter.
exp_val = PauliExpectation().convert(exp_val).reduce()
