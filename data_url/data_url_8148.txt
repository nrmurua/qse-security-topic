Describe the bug
In qobj.py, on line 1699 in the image below, ket was a QObj when using numpy v1.19 but in numpy v1.20 it's a numpy array.
To Reproduce

Expected behavior
In line 1699 in the image above, ket should not be a numpy array but rather stay a QObj.

Additional context
Working with @marcolincs on this.
Thanks for this.  We've already merged a fix to master (#1440), and we'll be releasing a new version of QuTiP in the coming days that will officially support Numpy 1.20.
In the meantime, you can work around by pinning your Numpy version 1.19 (there are some other problems within all current released QuTiP versions when dealing with Numpy 1.20 as well).
