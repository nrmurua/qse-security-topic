While we integrate more and more drivers into qcodes we will have to make sure they can be used in a uniform fashion from the user perspective.
We might already run into this in @eendebakpt comment in #74
I guess all DMMs have basically the same main functions, but different special functions, the same goes for SourceMeters, magnets and others.
If we have single users working on a new driver we somehow cant force them to go through potentially tens of other drivers to figure out the optimum syntax.
How can we unify this?
Also in line with this, most instruments have a model name, a manufacturer, version, software version, i even think the visa *IDN? command is unified, at least it looks the same for the instruments I looked for.
In my drivers I did:
and put that data in a dict, however, I think this should be unified as well and be saved in the snapshot.
How should we go about it?
Great point. We can make groups of instruments that have such things in common (most probably ones from the same manufacturer), then make a class for each group from which they can inherit these methods and parameters, e.g. KeithleyInstrument(VisaInstrument) and Keithley2400(KeithleyInstrument).
Inheritance is important for clean and simple drivers, but also different instruments that have the same function e.g. a rhode schwarz microwave source and an agilent one should be relatively indistinguishable in their commands.
Closed if we have an example where instrument inheritance is used.
