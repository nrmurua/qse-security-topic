Hey there, Pranav here. I'm hoping to get involved with OpenFermion, so I started taking a look at #274 which seems like a good first issue (thanks @kevinsung and @idk3 for the clear description and background discussion).
I was reading through the code for PolynomialTensor and noticed that it implements a __neq__ method. Should this method be __ne__? (https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ne__ and
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__ne__)
If so, I can submit a pull request.
Yes, you are correct. It would be great if you can fix that and test it better, ideally using the EqualsTester utility in utils/_testing_utils.py.
Note that for the EqualsTester tests to pass you should set __hash__ to None for PolynomialTensor. That's a change that should be made anyway.
Resolved by pull request #303
@singular-value thanks for this contribution. If you'd like to be on the OpenFermion release paper, please email me at [my github name]@google.com and I can send you the link to our overleaf.
