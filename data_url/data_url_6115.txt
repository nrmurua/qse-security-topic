Generically we should run through ways to make the simulator faster.
This is fairly straightforward if you are restricting to few numbers of qubits and no oscillators.  The underlying monte carlo method was designed to scale to large systems and uses sparse matrices. Moving to dense arrays will give a performance benefit for smaller systems.
