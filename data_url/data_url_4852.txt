Can't import tensorcircuit in nightly build.
The psutil dependency is introduced in readout_mitigation.py but it is not included in setup.py.
In CI installing qiskit also installs psutil so the error will not be raised.
ah, thought it is a built-in package before, then in this case, I will move the import within the function to avoid the general user to install this package
