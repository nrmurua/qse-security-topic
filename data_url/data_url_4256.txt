This do-nothing test:
Fails with this error:
I think it has something to do with cache invalidation, because if I use a new empty-engine list for each call then the test runs to completion.
No, cache invalidation has nothing to do with this. We should remove the backend again from the engine_list in the initializer of the MainEngine once all checks have been performed and the linked-list of engines has been created. The backend is added to the list in a first step and should be removed again afterwards.
Actually we should just (shallow) copy the list.
