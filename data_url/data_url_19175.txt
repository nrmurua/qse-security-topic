Qibo is generating OpenQASM 2.0 code, but the current version is 3.0 since almost a couple of years, and it is the only version currently available online. At least the only one directly reachable from the home page:
https://openqasm.com/

Yes, we had some discussions about this in past, in particular when we started in 2020. The major limitation was that other codes were not compatible with v3 at that time, therefore we decided to use v2.
Ok, so maybe we could reassess the situation three years later.
For what I know, in 2020 the default docs could have been about v2, and they have changed by now...
Hi, I was wondering if there were any ongoing plans to add support for OpenQASM 3.0 to qibo anytime soon? (specially in circuit.to_qasm() )
Yes, but we need volunteers to tackle this implementation at the moment.
In order not to reinvent the wheel, there is a Python package available to parse OpenQASM, from the string to its objects.
The package is from the authors of OpenQASM itself, so it is kind of official (and officially a Qiskit project), but this means that there exists an official package doing the parsing (with ANTLR), and we just have to translate from an objects' tree to a circuit.
Unfortunately, they have no docs for the Python package, other than the docstrings and an index file, that is a bit poor...
But the code is quite clean, so it is simple to understand the hierarchy from the dataclasses themselves :)
