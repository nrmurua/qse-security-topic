Hi @praveentn!
What is your exact Python version?
python --version
Can you try the verbose mode?
pip install -v qrand
Do you get this message?
Link requires a different Python (3.8.8 not in: '>=3.9,<4.0')
This is indeed the requirement mentioned in the Wheel's Metadata:
Requires-Python: >=3.9,<4.0
Weirdly enough, I get this error message about Python 3.8.8 while I have Python 3.9.5 installed...
Try this and it might work (it did for me):
python -m pip install -v qrand
Hi @praveentn and @LaurentAjdnik , thanks for reaching out.
To install QRAND you need to be running Python 3.9 or greater (python 3.8 was unstable).
As @LaurentAjdnik mentions python -m pip install -v qrand should fix it as long as the command python refers to to a suitable version. You can check this by running python --version. Alternatively you can also do python3 -m pip install -v qrand provided that python3 --version returns Python 3.9.0 or greater. If all of that fails, you can simply invoke the specific python 3.9 binary through <path/to/python3.9/binary> -m pip install -v qrand.
Let me know if this helps!
Thanks for the support.
This worked python -m pip install qrand, after pointing to 3.9 version of Python.
