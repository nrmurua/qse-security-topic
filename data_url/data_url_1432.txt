Description of the issue
Args say qubits and nx_graph are optional, but their type is not Optional[].

Args say the returned qubit set can be None but return type is not Optional[FrozenSet['cirq.Qid']].

Args say the returned graph can be None but return type is not Optional[nx.Graph].

nx.graph is used as a type instead of nx.Graph -- the former is a module and latter is a type.
