While studying the code, I have found this comment by @edditler

From what I remember, calculate_drho_elec has an output parameter drho_g, but it appears that it is never used. Comparing a numerical derivative of the electron density with drho_r, I found that the real-space quantity was fine and could simply be transferred to the reciprocal grid.
I think, that I decided that the error must be in density_rs2pw_basic, but I never got around to investigate it in more detail. FWIW, this routine does a bunch of pw_transfer as well.
I think I found the culprit. In principal, density_rs2pw_basic does the same as density_rs2pw but does not consider the case of spherical grids. As it turns out, only the contribution of the very first grid in r-space is considered in drho in g-space then (see here). I will prepare a PR to fix it.
