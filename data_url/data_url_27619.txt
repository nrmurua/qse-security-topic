The paper suggests that q is supposed to be a prime number > 2 but in the parameter selection part for lwe it states:

Obviously, there can be no prime number that must be some integer to the power of 4. So what is the correct parameter?
"Even if q is not a prime the property and hardness of LWE problem is also preseved. But it may suffer some security loss. In practice, we make q large, say 2 to the power of N in most cases , which you can see in many papers on LWE based key exchange protocols. Even to figure out large prime number is a very difficult problem that many researchers are working on. When writing your codes, you are not necessary to select q as a prime."
