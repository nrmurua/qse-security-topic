In the file doc/manual/installing.rst under "Configuring the core device" it gives the following instructions for setting the IP and MAC addresses of the core device:
$ artiq_mkfs flash_storage.img -s mac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -s ip xx.xx.xx.xx
$ artiq_flash -f flash_storage.img proxy storage start
To work properly, I had to append "-m nist_qc2" to the second command like so:
$ artiq_flash -f flash_storage.img proxy storage start -m nist_qc2
This is probably obvious to an experienced user, but given that this page is designed to guide those like myself who are just starting out with ARTIQ, it may be beneficial to update those instructions to read:
$ artiq_mkfs flash_storage.img -s mac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -s ip xx.xx.xx.xx
$ artiq_flash -f flash_storage.img proxy storage start -m [nist_clock/nist_qc2]
