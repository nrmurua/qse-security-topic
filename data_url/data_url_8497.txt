When calling sesolve on a Qobj H representing a Hamiltonian with data stored in COOrdinate format e.g.
H.data gives <..... sparse matrix of type '<type 'numpy.complex128'> ..... elements in COOrdinate format>
_sesolve_const in sesolve.py throws AttributeError: indices not found on line 286, because L.data.indices does not exist.   (Nor does L.data.indptr for that matter).
Sure, because it is not the correct csr format.  In addition, if you use that format, your matvec multiplication would be slow.
Thanks!  I wasn't sure if this was something which should have been caught or dealt with in qutip (rather than thrown in scipy) since the exception doesn't immediately tell one the underlying cause.   (Perhaps through throwing a specific message indicating that the data type should be changed).
