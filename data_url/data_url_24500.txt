Installing dulwich from condalist.yml attempts to install the version that includes C bindings, which require Microsoft Visual C++, which is quite heavy and not straight forward to install. This could be fixed by adding --global-option="--pure". I'm not sure if this is easy to do in the condalist.
qtt.measurements.ttrace requires pycqed, which is now optional for us. But ttrace gets imported in qtt.tools.addPPTslide eventhough I don't really need it. I could just install pycqed but this is a bit annoying.
Consider adding spirack to condalist.yml (needs to go in the pip list)
