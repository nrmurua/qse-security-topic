In PR #216, @atilag modified _qeremote.py to add an hpc parameter to the run_job function. This throws an error since the function signature does not have this argument.
I think perhaps the fix should be applied to the API repository, but I'm raising the issue here since this is where errors occur.
Function signature must match use case.
You can update IBMQuantumExperience with
pip install IBMQuantumExperience --upgrade
This issue should be solved in IBMQuantumExperience-1.8.25.
In the future, we should be more careful with userland. It looks like the IBMQuantumExperience changed the interface in a minor upgrade.
