Implement a function that calculates the min-relative entropy for quantum channels.
The functionality for this should be created in channel_props/min_relative_entropy.py with corresponding unit tests found in tests/test_channel_props/test_min_relative_entropy.py. Be sure to also update the docs in /docs/channels.rst under "Properties of Quantum Channels" with toqito.channel_props.min_relative_entropy.py.
For a definition of min-relative entropy for quantum channels, consult:
