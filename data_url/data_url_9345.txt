If I want to simulate a specific time step, prob = KrylovEvolution(reg1, 2.0, h1) throws an error, but prob = KrylovEvolution(reg1, [0.0, 2.0], h1) does not. The former shouldn't throw an error either.
The input of Krylov is clock not time span we shouldn't support this interface otherwise it doesn't make much sense on how to run this evolution. It always require a start time and a stop time so the input must be a vector with size larger than 2
I think the docstring is quite clear on this: https://solid-journey-b55ed955.pages.github.io/dev/emulation/#BloqadeKrylov.KrylovEvolution
