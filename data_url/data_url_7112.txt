Long circuits go off the edge of the screen. Being able to scroll would let them get much longer.
Might cause performance issues.
The canvas now auto-stretches to cover the width of the screen. I think scrolling would go against the "should be super simple" vibe. Plus you can emulate it by zooming out.
