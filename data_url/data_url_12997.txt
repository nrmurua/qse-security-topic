When trying to pip install -e . bqskit, I get the error ERROR: No matching distribution found for bqskitrs>=0.3.0. Changing setup.cfg so that it says bqskitrs>=0.3.0rc1 fixes the issue, but I'm not sure if this is the preferred way to do things?
This is on a local branch of master.
There is a similar error on the bqskitrs branch: BQSKit/bqskitrs#10
This might be fixed with 1.1-dev. Can you try on that branch?
I had to change it for 1.1-dev as well.
Merged into master, should be fixed. Feel free to re-open if it still exists
