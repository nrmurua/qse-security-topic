artiq_coremgmt reboot does not actually reboot the device. Instead, the device is placed in an inconsistent state.
Expect the device to restart.
The issue can be seen in the UART logs after running artiq_coremgmt reboot. The error seen is panic at runtime/kernel.rs:11:9: attempted to start kernel CPU when it is already running
UART logs:
Another reboot-related issue: #1504.
Seems like implementing a reset function using ICAP would also fix this.
