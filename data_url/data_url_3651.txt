Has qaoa been formally published? if not , how could you ensure the correctness?
Hi @Buhtig314 ,
I'm not sure what you mean by ensuring correctness. Maybe you can explain a little bit more?
We do have an implementation of QAOA. Have a look at https://github.com/rigetticomputing/grove/tree/master/grove/pyqaoa
The original paper by Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann is here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028
i mean, any paper can be wrong , especially thoses are not formally published, cause no  expert reviews that paper. furthermore, the paper hasn't been published since 2014 giving a sing that there may be some flaw in the paper.  in terms of mathmatic, an implementation doesn't  add any correctness.
Debates about the value of publishing vs. the arxiv notwithstanding, this discussion is out of scope for issues with the pyQuil library so I'm going to close the issue.
There has been lots of follow on work on QAOA and it appears correct.  If anyone has any proof that it isn't, then I bet they'd end up with an interesting publication.
