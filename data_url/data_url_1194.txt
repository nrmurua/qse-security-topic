Description of the issue
I'm trying to define a noise model with Clifford gates, and then serialize it. However, I get an error when trying to serialize it using cirq.to_json.
How to reproduce the issue
A simplified version of my noise model is the following.
Then, I do the following to serialize it.
And I get the following.
(full log below)
I also noticed the same happens when I use a cirq.CZ gate.
Cirq version
1.3.0.dev20230915001934
@epelaaez  Do you want to work on this?
Yes, I can look into it
It seems like the problem here is that when defining a gate as follows:
Doing gate.__name__ returns the error I'm experiencing, but doing gate.__class__.__name__ returns 'SingleQubitCliffordGate', which I think is the output we want (can you confirm this?)
which I think is the output we want
Yep
I found that doing
solves the problem.
The issue is that OpIdentifier._json_dict_ calls protocols.json_cirq_type(self._gate_type) and this is where the '__name__' is not found. This could be fixed by doing something like
but then I get
which loses information about the specific Clifford gate I'm using in my model. I think this is the intended behavior of OpIdentifier though, as it takes as an argument gate_type: Type['cirq.Gate'] and not a specific gate. Since it seems like I can get away with not using OpIdentifier when using particular gates, and this looks like intended behavior, I think this could be closed (wdyt @vtomole)?
So, it looks like OpIdentifier can't be json serializable for some inputs?
Yes, I think that's the issue. At least that the specificity of certain inputs is lost when serializing it.
Okay, sounds like a bug that we can fix as part of this.
