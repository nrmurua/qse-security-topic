Enhance the coding examples in the VQE-molecules tutorial with the usage of Qiskit primitives Estimator and Sampler and showcase the effect of error mitigation options.
I would love to go ahead and start with the documentation enhancement myself.
Since this would be my first contribution it would be great to get some feedback about my suggestions from more experienced members (@HuangJunye, @ElePT ) first :).
I will note the runtime has this https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/tutorials/vqe_with_estimator.html For textbook context, it is managed elsewhere, for a contribution to that an issue here https://github.com/Qiskit/platypus would be more in context.
@woodsp-ibm VQE-documentation enhancement is indeed an open issue in Qiskit/platypus.
I will thus close the issue here.
