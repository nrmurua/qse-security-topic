the current version of the Spack-based toolchain relies completely on the Spack CP2K package for versions of direct dependencies. While this has the advantage that we get a bleeding edge toolchain, it also has drawbacks, like a less-reproducible toolchain.
Note: this only affects new installations of a toolchain. Since we're using environments an installed toolchain is supposed to be very stable (unless the CP2K package is updated to require new/other versions of dependencies).

Since the spack-toolchain is only meant for developers, we don't have to support all the variants that we provide for end-users. Basically, the spack-toolchain should install everything and just allow for an external MPI library.
