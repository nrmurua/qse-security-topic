The execution time of AerSampler increases too fast with the number of circuits.
Output is:
Run with batch_size = 40
<class 'qiskit.primitives.sampler.Sampler'> takes 0.03s
<class 'qiskit_aer.primitives.sampler.Sampler'> takes 0.15s
Run with batch_size = 80
<class 'qiskit.primitives.sampler.Sampler'> takes 0.05s
<class 'qiskit_aer.primitives.sampler.Sampler'> takes 0.35s
Run with batch_size = 160
<class 'qiskit.primitives.sampler.Sampler'> takes 0.15s
<class 'qiskit_aer.primitives.sampler.Sampler'> takes 1.45s
Run with batch_size = 320
<class 'qiskit.primitives.sampler.Sampler'> takes 0.19s
<class 'qiskit_aer.primitives.sampler.Sampler'> takes 5.90s
I would expect the execution time of AerSampler to be similar to that of Sampler. In the worst case (no optimization), the execution time grows linearly with the number of circuits.
Here is my result:
Could you try again after upgrading Aer because the performance is improved from Aer 0.12?
Many thanks. The results look good after upgrading Aer.
