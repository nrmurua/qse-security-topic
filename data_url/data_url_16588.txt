The reset instruction will be a more optimal way to initialize circuits in the ground state than the default. Qubits which are active in a circuit, and which do not already have a reset instruction, should have a reset added to them by the transpiler, unless the optimization level is 0.
I believe support for this is backend specific. That is unless they are ignored by those that do not support them.
Hi @lcapelluto , is there a way for a backend to signal that an initial reset is needed?
If a backend requires this for good results, in modern Terra the backend should insert a reset-insertion pass itself using custom transpilation stages.  Terra doing this automatically would be outside its remit.  I'll close as "wontfix" now, since it violates backend agnosticism.
