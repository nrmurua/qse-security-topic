In the current build, the following expands to 1
OQS_ENABLE_SIG_qTESLA_III_speed
the following is well defined
OQS_SIG_alg_qTESLA_III_speed
yet  the following code returns NULL
OQS_SIG *sig = OQS_SIG_new(OQS_SIG_alg_qTESLA_III_speed);
This is not a malloc issue. I sig.c, there is no entry for this in OQS_SIG_alg_identifier, and also no branch in OQS_SIG_alg_is_enabled or OQS_SIG_new.
I believe it is a legacy of some older version?
