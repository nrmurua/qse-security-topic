Right now, it is not possible to change the way chain breaks are resolved during un-embedding, in the EmbeddingComposite et al. (see the return statement of EmbeddingComposite.sample())
Proposal: make chain_break_method (of the dwave.embedding.transforms.unembed_sampleset()) a parameter of the EmbeddingComposite (and the related embedding composites).
