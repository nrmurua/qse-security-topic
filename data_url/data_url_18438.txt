The function pprint-aqvm, which was largely lifted from the QVM project, contains code which handsomely prints wavefunctions. It would be helpful to be able to handsomely print wavefunctions that aren't directly part of an AQVM — for instance, those returned by aqvm-extract-state. Factor this out. (Maybe also type AQVM wavefunctions more strongly than just as vectors, so that you can dispatch a pretty printer on them!)
Ideally, make this factored routine also respect *print-polar-form*.
I'll take a shot at this. May take me a while as I'm tied up with other things, but should be attainable over the next few weeks.
I would call format-complex here
Should I be looking to support any types beyond aqvm and the aqvm state returned from aqvm-extract-state?
Regarding format-complex, there is also complex-fmt, which you can embed in a format string like so ~/cl-quil:complex-fmt/, in which case it can be melded into the preceding format call on the line above.
I'm not sure about the types that should be supported. I think the idea was to define some new type / type alias that abstracts the wavefunction type, in which case you could add an entry to the pretty-print dispatch table for that type as well, just like we already do for the aqvm type here. See for example:
http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/22_bad.htm
http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/22_bb.htm
But it sounds like that part is optional, and just factoring out the wavefunction printing and adding support for printing whatever is returned by aqvm-extract-state would be useful on it's own.
