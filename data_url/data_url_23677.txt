I don't find that model online:
Could be the GS200 or the GS610 perhaps

We have a very minimal driver for the GS200 in https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/instrument_drivers/yokogawa/GS200.py
More information from John Watson
Coincidentally I've been working on this driver at the same time.
See:
https://github.com/spauka/Qcodes/blob/device-dev/qcodes/instrument_drivers/yokogawa/GS200.py
It will be ready for a pull request soon...
@spauka Great and thanks for the heads up
