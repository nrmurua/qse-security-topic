Currently, after #1323 (and unmerged #1331), the local simulators have a number of placeholder values for some fields of those structures:
Those are for conformance with the specification - they require that those lists have at least one item. We should populate them properly (or alternatively, decide if the schemas need to be relaxed for the simulators).
Some fields might be able to be generated using the existing information (such as basis_gates) and the terra infrastructure - an approach might be to include some tooling to generate them, instead of copy-pasting.
An update: @max-reuter is working on the configuration, and I'll be working on not having properties for the simulators.
After #1401 and #1413, the only thing left would be to update the qasm_def of some gates (the ones that are not part of the standard library, which still contain some placeholder values). Considering the upcoming moving of the simulators, I'm closing the issue - @jaygambetta please reopen if this is something that should be tackled pre-move to aer.
