The BlockCollapser class fails for blocks containing multiple nodes with full ClassicalRegister conditions on the same registers.
Minimal example
No error.
The collapse_to_operation method is incorrectly collecting the full classical register from all conditional nodes in a block as a list, when it should be a set to avoid duplication.
Thanks for the report, and yeah, that does appear to be the direct reason.
I would like to take a crack at this one, if someone can assign it to me.
