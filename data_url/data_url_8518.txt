Hi,
I am trying to compute a single function (not an operator) on every states returned by mesolve call.
Typically, I am doing this:
which should be correct, as far as I understand the doc.
However, I get a traceback which I can't understand:
Am I doing something wrong or is it a bug with handling of single function callback? Thanks!
What version of qutip are you using?

qutip.mesolve(H, rho_0, times, C_ops, populationCount(alpha) progress_bar=True)
which should be correct, as far as I understand the doc.
However, I get a traceback which I can't understand:
AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'nnz'
Am I doing something wrong or is it a bug with handling of single function callback? Thanks!

I'm using qutip 3.1.0.
You need the latest dev version

This has been fixed in 4.0
Oh ok. I'll wait for the next update to be pushed on pip then I think. I can workaround this in the meantime.
You might be waiting a while. You can install the github master via pip fairly easily.
OK, I'll have a look at it. Is there any specific reason for not making more frequent (and with less features) releases?
I'm closing the issue as it should be fixed in latest dev branch. I will reopen if I still experience the issue after updating.
The main reason is time. I only have an occasional hour or two to put in. In addition, there are many holes in the docs and examples that need to be closed before a release. We are trying to take care of all of this before next years APS meeting.
