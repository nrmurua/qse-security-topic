Spent some time debugging strange behaviour with @dieris and it once again came down to sequences with multiple references to the same pulse block object getting modified in place by the compiler.  In this case the flow was.
One hammer solution is to implement __deepcopy__ for Pulses and PulseBlocks and the first thing we do in compile is copy everything.
This was solved with immutable pulses #60
