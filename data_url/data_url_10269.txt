When random problem is generated a structured solver is assumed.
If user selects an unstructured solver (like BQM/CQM solvers), or such solver gets selected for the user, problem generation will fail:
Select a structured solver (QPU) with:
or
Adapt random problem generation to selected solver (similar to #332).
