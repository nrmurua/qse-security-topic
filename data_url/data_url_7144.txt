Qubit needs methods for converting between matrices and Bloch Spheres. From 𝒂 and 𝒃 to θ and ϕ and back again. And also from θ and ϕ to XYZ; coordinates for the point on the surface of the sphere.
Created Q.Qubit.toBlochSphere with b9550dd
But still do not have a Q.Qubit.fromBlochSphere. (Is this possible or is some phase information lost and therefore perfect conversion back is not possible?)
The only thing that seems to be lost is the "symbol" and the "name" of the Q.Qubit .
The idea for the Bloch sphere is that it captures all the information of a single qubit.
Edit: specifying complex $a$ and $b$ has extra information (i.e. 4 real numbers); so converting back you can only know the phase difference between $a$ and $b$.
