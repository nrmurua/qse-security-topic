Perhaps some different gate definition is used, since when I check the matrix representation of the u gate in https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.UGate.html, I find that the off-diagonals don't quite match up what i see in the documentation. Maybe I'm missing something simple?

vs.

I obtained the above using:


Related to #6434
I would like to work on this
I agree, except for the global phase (which is important), the off diagonals of

and

do not concur.
I used the code in the gist below to check it:
https://gist.github.com/jond01/2a71557438d424ee41d6d5501589eada
(Specifically, see Out[9] and Out[10].)
Should we fix the documentation? Maybe remove the first definition to avoid confusion? (the true array definition of this gate is the 2nd one)
Ok, I think that the following is a valid explanation:
U was defined as:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03429.pdf#page=5

Instead of qiskit's wrong definition (even with global phase tolerance):

The following is correct and implemented with a pair of Ï€/2-pulses (from the paper above):

I verified the equality between the definitions of U in eq. (2) and (5) above (see the updated gist - "OpenQASM 2.0 definitions").
The definition of U gate has changed by a global phase from QASM 2.0 to 3.0:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14722.pdf#page=11


In conclusion, I think that the correct equality in QASM 3.0 is:

And we should change it in our the documentation (below "Implemented using two X90 pulses on IBM Quantum systems").
See also the implmentation in cirq:

It matches the true definition:

Rather than the wrong one from qiskit:
