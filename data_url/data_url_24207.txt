Please be as descriptive as possible, including: what is expected, why is this feature needed, what is the objective, etc.
This may be eventually be broken into smaller issues.
Design a user experience and flow for optimization.
Implement the optimization
User can identify an option in a QComponent that they want to vary.  They identify a target value with percent accuracy for analysis. The QComponent manager will take the user input, and use the result of Issue #529.
The manager will need to populate the QGeometry table, render to a chosen Qrenderer, obtain the simulation data (i.e. capacitance matrix) pass to analysis (i.e. LOM) .
