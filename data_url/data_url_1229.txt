Description of the issue
isolated_packages_test.py fails at HEAD. This is blocking new PRs (e.g. #6090 )
How to reproduce the issue
Clone Cirq and run the test
Cirq version
Cirq HEAD (at the time of writing)
@tanujkhattar I think this happened after #6073
The test failure is unrelated to the PR. It happened because sympy 1.12 released 5 days ago - https://github.com/sympy/sympy/releases/tag/sympy-1.12
The CI failure was expected as per the discussion in #5930 (comment)
@pavoljuhas Can we just remove the xfail condition on the test now?
See #6096 - hopefully it will fix that.
