i have quantum machine learning deployment project. but i'm so confused for load VQC model and predict on real backend. bellow is one of my code from my this project
any suggestion?
I think you should create an issue here: https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning as it is related to qiskit machine learning.
Honestly, I don't get the question. But if you have a trained model and you are running inference on quantum hardware, then this is the way to go:

Thanks, I Will try this
Thanks both.  I'll close this now because it's best to continue any further necessary discussion on the Machine Learning repo, but please feel free to raise more issues here if they're part of Qiskit core.
