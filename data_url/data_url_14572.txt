QuantumCircuits are very rich in operations on qubits, but lack operations on classical bits. The feature request are classical operations (logic gates) on classical bits, such as NOT/CNOT (acting "in-place" on the classical register) that are part of the QuantumCircuit itself.
Thanks for bringing this up, @Lolcroc .  We're planning enhanced support for classical instructions and data types  as part of support for the new set of features available in OpenQASM 3 ( https://qiskit.github.io/openqasm/language/classical.html ).
Are we still planning to fix this issue for 0.20?
No, this is dynamics circuit work, so it's pushed til at least 0.21.
