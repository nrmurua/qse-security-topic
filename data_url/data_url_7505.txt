The quick-start tutorial contains deprecated API. It would be nice to refresh the tutorial.

good catch! Sorry I forget to update that. Updated in QuantumBFS/tutorials@5f03189
The tutorial CI is broken somehow, I'll close this issue after I finish that so the website gets an update. Thanks for reporting.
