For example,
Do we want to move functions like these to a folder called useful_operations along with descriptive docstrings of what they do instead of repeating them? These could be further distinguished into two categories: state_operations and channel_operations. The first step to this would be figuring out all the operations that are repeatedly defined across different techniques.
Open to other possible solutions.
