Relative imports in Python can result in a number of non-obvious issues - most notably, the inability to run certain binaries except from a specific directory. If possible, we should convert the relative imports used in tests into absolute imports.
This appears to be the root cause of #219, and also causes unexpected behavior when manually running tests (i.e. with python3 -m pytest) as noted in #221. We should resolve this before the next release.
