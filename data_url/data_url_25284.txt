The logs search bar is only working with lowercase letters. Say, When trying to search for "Error" status, if the user gives "Error" it is showing "No results found". However, if they search for "error", the results are shown. So it is not working when the user includes upper case letters in the search text.

The logs records should be filtered by as per the search text, irrespective of upper case letters  ( from the above case, it has to be filtered by Error status ).
