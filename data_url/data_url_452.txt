From the latest qcor/cli docker image...
Of course just deleting xacc_iontrap gets you going, but there are some link problems with the plugin that should be fixed. I think, specifically, it is linking and using functions from another plugin, which is not something we should be doing.
Here's the ldd output
Problem is that the plugin RPATH is not pointing to INSTALL/plugins, so it won't be able to find the circuit optimizers library to link.
@ausbin I think you should try to get the GateFusion dependency out of this plugin at some point. The best way might be to create an interface at the quantum/gate/utils package level that GateFuser in circuit-optimizers can inherit from and contribute GateFuser as a plugin to the service registry under that new type. Then you can remove the link from xacc-circuit-optimizers on your iontrap plugin, and only rely on xacc-quantum-gate.
Hi @amccaskey, sorry for the slow turnaround on my end. Attempt at a fix here: #521
