The error for the following code snippet is a little hard to understand. Is it possible to simplify it to something more clear like "there is a mismatch in your kernel datatypes, check your gates" or even better, "the ry gate has a mismatch in datatypes (array vs qubit) for arg 1".
For this minimal example (this is based off of an existing test problem we had before kernel.qalloc started returning qreg arrays)
the error message produced is:
