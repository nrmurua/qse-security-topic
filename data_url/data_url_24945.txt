Looking at Nick's code, it is clear that diagonalization of qubit Hamiltonians occurs more often than actually necessary. Not clear what our best strategy is to avoid that. Store data inside qubit class? But that costs memory and leads to internal issues (such as user changes flux, but then data is obsolete etc.) Could also have user provide optional eigendata in some routines.
