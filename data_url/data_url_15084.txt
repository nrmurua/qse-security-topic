I want to use np.abs() on a Parameter instance but got:
TypeError: bad operand type for abs(): 'Parameter'
However, I can do:
np.exp(Parameter instance)
So I think I should also be able to use Parameter as the input of np.abs().
If it is the problem with Numpy, then is there an another way to add an absolute Parameter to a circuit?
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.circuit import Parameter
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
theta = Parameter('theta')
qc.rz(np.abs(theta),0)
Parameterize a circuit with an absolute parameter.
Add a new class method Parameter.abs() that returns the absolute value of Parameter.
See #9309
@mtreinish This probably should have been transferred to Terra earlier as a feature request  and linked to close via the above issue which added abs support (or closed as a duplicate). I commented here and linked a PR, that was adding abs, as that was all I could do. The PR has now been merged so the feature has been added now, to Terra main. Accordingly the request this issue makes is now satisfied.
Closing as #9309 added abs() to ParameterExpression
