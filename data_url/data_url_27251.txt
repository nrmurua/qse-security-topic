Given this cryptic note at the top of the repo
SECURITY NOTE: the scheme is NOT secure when using static keys.
Could you elaborate on what "static" means? Are static keys ever the default?
Static keys in the sense of "re-used" keys. This version of SIDH is only secure in ephemeral settings: new keys must be generated for every session. As an example, this is what we do in our OpenSSL integration. The warning is for developers wishing to integrate SIDH in other protocols/products.
@christianpaquin: got it. thank you.
Can't find this note. Is this still the case with version 3 or can static keys be used with SIDH v3.0 without any security concern?
Version 3 of the library includes two protocols: SIKE (a key encapsulation scheme) and SIDH (the original supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange). SIKE is IND-CCA2 secure, which means that it's ok to reuse the key pair generated by crypto_kem_keypair_SIKEpXXX(), whereas SIDH is insecure with re-used keys, as before. The note you are looking for can be found in P503_api.h and P751_api.h.
