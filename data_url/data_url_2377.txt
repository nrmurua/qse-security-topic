(Still exposed as a list by legacy methods though)
I'm not sure flattening to int is the right call for all users though it appears that this was done.
Also this will fail at 64 qubits because pandas data type is int64 in our current code.
Oh this does work, my bad.  Closing this issue.
We do need to document this in sampler.
