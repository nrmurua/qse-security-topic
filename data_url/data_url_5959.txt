In statevector_state.hpp:
Do all these types still exist?
Yes the all still exist, though some are never really used (like memory, and registers).
I think we could consider deprecating the matrix expectation values and only supporting Pauli expectation values (since arbitrary matrices can always be converted into SparsePauliOp to run as pauli expectation values.)
