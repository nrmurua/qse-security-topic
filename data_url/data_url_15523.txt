Binding parameters to a parameterized Opflow objects requires passing a dictionary with {parameter_instance: value} pairs.   More often than not, this is used in the following setting
which is a bit cumbersome as  we either have to carry along the parameters we're interested in or have to write an extra line defining the param_dict.
Instead if would be nice to allow binding the parameters using only an array. Since we introduced a global parameter order in #5759, which says that parameters are sorted by name, that would be easy to implement. Using the same ordering convention as for the circuits, we could simply write
Since Opflow objects already implement the parameter attribute, the steps to implement this could for instance be
I'm labelling this as "good first issue", but some previous experience with qiskit.opflow would certainly be helpful!
Hello, is this issue still open? I am new to this project, happy to work on this with some guidance.
Sure, thanks!  I'll assign you now, so others know you're working on it.  Feel free to ask questions here - @Cryoris knows rather more about opflow than I do, so he's the best person to ask.
Nice to see you're interested! You can check out how the parameters are sorted in the quantum circuit

and how they are assigned if not a dictionary but only a list of values is passed

Let us know if you have any questions!
I made an attempt to construct a circuit with parameters like this
Is this a good working example for this issue where instead of passing param_dict, we would like to be able to pass my_values to bind_parameters?
Hi @pradkrish, for the QuantumCircuit we're already able to pass my_values. But here's a slightly modified example where we are currently not able to pass an array but would like to
Hi @pradkrish any news on this? ðŸ™‚
@Cryoris, Well I'd love to give it a try. I'm dying to start my first open source contribution. May I be assigned?
If not using array, can the parameters of "assign_parameters" be in a dictionary or boolean format?
Am I going down the right rabbit hole?
This snippiet is from the qiskit docs:

Hi @nssensalo, of course you can work on this, I'll assign you ðŸ™‚
For opflow we don't allow inplace right now, so the input to assign_parameters would only be one argument that is either a dictionary of parameter values (like right now) or an array of values (this would be new!).
@Cryoris Hello, my friend and I wanted to work on this issue if it is still open. This is our first project but we are interested and are happy to work on it.
@Cryoris Hello, my friend and I would like to work on this issue, This is our first project but we are interested and happy to work on it
hi @GaneshH0571 @AbhirMehrotra this issue has already been assigned to @nssensalo, there are many other open good first issues that haven't been assigned yet if you would like to take a look at those!
for @nssensalo if you're new to open source and contributing to qiskit I recommend taking a look at these resources:
Or if you are no longer interested in working on this also let us know so we can un-assign you and let someone else be assigned to it ðŸ˜„
update: issue has been unassigned and open for other contributors to jump in ðŸ˜„
