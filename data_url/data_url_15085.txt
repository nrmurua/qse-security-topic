It seems transpiling QV circuits for ecr based backends raises transpilation warnings for various seed values.  It is not hard to find a seed where this issue occurs.
gives
TranspilerError: 'Maximum iteration reached. max_iteration=1000'
Switching the backend to ibm_kyiv that has the same topology, but uses cx gates rather than  ecr works fine.
It should work fine.

Thanks - we're fairly sure this is because an optimisation loop tends to get stuck oscillating between two possible solutions. #9612 should hopefully solve this.
confirmed that #9612 fixes this issue.
