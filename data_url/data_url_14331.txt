The jupyter module in qiskit.tools.jupyter has a bunch of magics and default formatters set for backends from the qiskit-ibmq-provider. However, that package has been superseded by qiskit-ibm-provider and will soon be deprecated and archived. This will make the jupyter functionality with backends not usable anymore. We should update all this functionality to be generic and work with any backend, not just those from the ibmq provider.
Hey, I am interested working on this one.
For clarification - what we want is that the table generated for BackendV1 (generated by code in qiskit.tools.jupyter.backend_monitor) upon calling a BackendV1 object will work the same for BackendV2 objects?
Yeah that's basically it, along with loosening the type hints to say they will accept any BackendV1 or BackendV2 based backend instead of being limited to IBMQBackend and FakeBackend. The other piece is updating the HTML_FORMATER hooks to work on the abstract backend types instead of importing the ibmq provider and setting it for that.
