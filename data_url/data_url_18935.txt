Circuits and stretch diagrams are missing from the live doc.
We need a way of translating tikzpicture files into SVGs first. Also, think about how to continue creating this kind of pictures later, and if we want to keep the original files too.
I just fixed the .tex files, to generate the PDF >> SVG versions.

Any update on this, @delapuente ?
I'm working on this. The converted images were missing some symbols. I'm coming up with an automatized method to do it relying on LaTeX tools and pdftocairo. Also, the lack of some kind of multi-image figure for Sphinx is also very convenient so I'm creating an extension to support it. I hope to have it ready by the end of this week, early next.
