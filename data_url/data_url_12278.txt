Show tutorials of well-known quantum algorithms.
I agree we need to get these in the algorithm section. Hopefully we can find someone with time to make them.
It is resolved with this PR:
#131
Great tutorials! In #253 I removed typos and made minor corrections in the equations and description of the Simon's algorithm.
I want to participate and I had implement Grover's algorithm, what is the next.
I think this should be closed now. We have tutorials for Grover's, Shor's and Simon's algorithms, once PR #131 is approved.
I agree
