@1ucian0 please assign me :)
@frankharkins To prevent conda or python version conflict, should we add a more specific tutorial on virtual environment setup? p/s: Since qiskit is not dependent on many exotic packages or dependencies, docker container is not worth to be investigated, so far.
@resduo what kind of details did you have in mind? It's out of scope for this page, but we can consider it in the installation instructions.
@frankharkins I see that many new-experience users encounter the dependencies conflict. For this, I guess the simplest, yet effective approach is to use pyenv. What do you think if we add the installation instruction of pyenv, and how to manage the versions of dependencies through it, for both qiskit usage and contribution?
