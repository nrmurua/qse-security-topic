XACC is a powerful framework that allows to simulate and interface with quantum processors through the use of accelerators in the backend and decorators on top of them, also interfacing with qcor.
XACC is written in C++ but contains Python plugins. Among its features, it has a micro-service-based framework that interfaces with HPC. It already includes error mitigation techniques. It would be great to include, in the User's Guide part of the documentation:
I can take n. 2 and would ping @amccaskey for 1, which would be great. Adding this issue to the next to next Milestone for my side.
There needs not to be any additional installation requirement (even dev requirement) for this example. Information on XACC installation should be given as a note for the end user in the example.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
