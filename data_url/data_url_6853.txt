It seems to me the the density matrix is conjugated, i.e. non-real elements flipped vertically.
For example, the density matrix for SH|0> is 1/2(|0><0|-i|0><1|+i|1><0|+|1><1|) based on my calculation, but Quirk shows 1/2(|0><0|+i|0><1|-i|1><0|+|1><1|).
I've done four test cases, SH, TH, SH(x)SH, S^(-1)H(x)SH, which are documented here:

Did I miss something?
Thanks.

You're right. I reproduced using numpy:
Result:
Which has the -i in the top right, whereas quirk puts it in the bottom left:

The issue could be that the matrix is being drawn transposed (accidental index swap) or that I forgot to negate the relative Y coordinate when drawing (which would look like conjugating). I'll look into it.
Thanks for looking into it.
Fixed in 5d2b332 . Will be in next release.
Thanks! Looking forward to the next release.
Thanks for the release of v2.2. I like the explicit "S" gate.
On the Density Matrix, I can see that the caption has been changed but it looks to me that the amplitudes are the same as before. Could you please have another look?
Bah, I think I transposed it in a second place and forgot to untranspose it in the first..
The issue was that I fixed it in the multi-qubit density matrix display but not in the single-qubit density matrix display:

They're implemented using different mechanisms because there's higher performance code for the single-qubit case (because every circuit needs all the single-qubit density matrices for the displays at the end).
Fixed in b7add27
