For a lot of problems it will be nice to be able to map a spin_op to its matrix representation. The main use case I foresee for this is for extracting eigenvalues and eigenvectors to compare against results coming from the quantum computer.
Add the complex_matrix type. This type should hold the raw data for a matrix with complex elements. It should hide away implementation details for the matrix (so one could use Eigen but not expose Eigen to the public cudaq API).
Add complex_matrix cudaq::spin_op::to_matrix(). This should compute the matrix elements based on the current Pauli string information.
