it reports fortran did not supoort mpi-mode.  do you have any suggestion?

This seems to be the same issue you had with ELPA 2020.05. So, let's continue the discussion at #1275.
this time, it was compiled through devtoolset-gcc 9.3.1, openmpi-4.0.5 and openblas,  not intelmpi.
Fair point. Still, I think your three issues are very related and we should therefore bundle them.
I only now realized that by devtools you were referring to this product. So, I've renamed #1275 accordingly.
Yeah, that is it . centos /redhat 7 use  gcc-4.8.5 as the default edtion of fortran / c&c++. for newer edtion, devtoolset has been developed as convienence.
Do you develop and test cp2k-master based on fedora 33 or ubuntu 20.1?  the default edtion of gcc for cp2k 8.1 is  10.2, which  is employed by the referred two open OS.

We mostly use Ubuntu but we have one dashboard test for Fedora. However, it does not use the devtools, but builds GCC from scratch. Essentially, we are using this Dockerfile with Fedora 33 as base image. I guess, one could add a test that uses more of the Fedora packages similar to Dockerfile.ubuntu_nompi, but it's not gonna be me.
