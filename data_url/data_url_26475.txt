As pointed out in #2463, the script install_openmpi.sh is not properly tested on the Dashboard. It would be great if there was an appropriate test at our dashboard as this script is potentially run by users.
Actually it looks like it is (https://dashboard.cp2k.org/archive/openmpi-psmp/index.html), and it has been failing for a while. PR #2463 should fix it. I did not scrutinize the Dashboard well enough, my bad!
It was 1ed20a1 which introduced the curly bracket. Since then, the dashboard test fails because the -D__parallel flag is not defined in favor of an erroneous -D__parallel} . I was also confused because I used the exact same test for my PR #2438 and I am not too familiar with build systems in general. I will close this issue as you PR will fix the dashboard.
