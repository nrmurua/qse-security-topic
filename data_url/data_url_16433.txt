Some gates miss the OpenQASM definition, such as RYY, RZX, DCX or iSwap. We should add this, this can be done by adding the definitions in the qelib1.inc file.
Hi can I work on it?
Sure! üëç
Hey I would like to work on this issue. Can I give it a shot?
Hi, Sorry I am already working on this
Okay, sure. No problem.
We decided to initiate a transition to move all the QASM related code out of Terra. Therefore, I'm tagging this issue on hold until the new repo with the QASM related code is created.
Closing as qelib1.inc should not be extended. See #4312 and #6125
