Describe the bug
The .plot_matrixelements  method shows incorrect coloring for the values when plotting the Hamiltonian of FluxQubit.
Expected behavior
When running .plot_matrixelements('hamiltonian', mode='real') the graph should look like a diagonal matrix. The values away from the diagonal are known to be zero, but the coloring (as specified by the legend) does not match this; the off diagonal elements are shown as non-zero.
To Reproduce
Create a FluxQubit object named flux_qubit, then call flux_qubit.plot_matrixelements('hamiltonian', mode='real'). The graph values look incorrect when compared to flux_qubit.matrixelement_table('hamiltonian').

Additional context
I'm not sure if this is a problem just for the Hamiltonian or just for the Flux qubit, but this is where I noticed the problem.

Confirmed - looks like the color legend is not being generated correctly. (In addition, it is obvious that matplotlib needs help with selecting a reasonable number of ticks on x and y axis.)
This is fixed with 78c58ec (color legend fix).
(The tick marks issue is left untouched, as the typical use case are matrix elements for a few low-lying states. Can always override plot settings manually.)
