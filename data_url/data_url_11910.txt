Dear Everyone,



As per documentation bind_parameters({parameter: parameter_value}) bind_parameters takes dictionary as input.Here param_bind refers to dictionary. ref: Qiskit documentation . As per tutorial notebook param_bind is initialized in cell 11 as follow:
param_bind = { tau: 1, tau_def: 0.5 }
please check if you forgot to initialize it.
Thank you. I have checked it and solved this issue.
