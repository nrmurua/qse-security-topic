The following runs fine.
Uncommenting self.core.break_realtime() results in the following error.
This is also different behavior than expected from RTIOSequenceError(RuntimeException)
What happens here is you are programming a LED off event far in the future, then set now to a value close to the RTIO counter, then program a LED on event before the LED off you had already programmed. led.sync() at the end of the loop would fix this.
Shouldn't the RTIO core keep operating for RTIOSequenceError? To what does "channel 0" refer in the exception? If led, that's channel 18...
It keeps operating in the sense that other events are not affected (or are they?). Exception parameters are broken due to issue #30.
