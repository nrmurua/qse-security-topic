cg.EngineClient.get_calibration accepts a timestamp for getting a specific calibration, but cg.engine.get_engine_calibration does not. We should update the latter to match the former.
On a related note, what is the recommended way to get calibrations? The tutorial uses an Engine object, which has no "get_calibration" method (only "run_calibration").
CC @dstrain115.
@verult Can you take care of this?  It should be a fairly straightforward change.  @wcourtney for visibility.
Bumping this - had an issue where one of our hardware team members wanted to get older calibrations and had to jump through some hoops because this method didn't support it.
