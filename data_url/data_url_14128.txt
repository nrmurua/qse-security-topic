This is the tracking epic for the work to improve the runtime scaling performance for the transpiler's optimization level 2 and level 3. It generally scales linearly with the number of gates but some of the passes we run in the higher optimizations have high constant factors which make the total execution slow. We'll add sub-issues here as we do more investigation and profiling to get to the bottom of the bottlenecks and identify things to speed up:
