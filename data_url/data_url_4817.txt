In the setup.py, the requirement is set as
"
requirements = [
"numpy>=1.13",
"scipy>=1.0.0",
"networkx>=2.0",
"tensorflow==1.3.0"
]
".
However, it should be "tensorflow>=1.3.0" according to documentation. This will make most user cannot install starwberryfields as tf1.3 is outdated.
This has been fixed - setup.py now matches requirements.txt:
Strawberry Fields has been tested and is working against Tensorflow versions 1.3-1.6, however 1.7 introduces some API changes which will require some modification.
