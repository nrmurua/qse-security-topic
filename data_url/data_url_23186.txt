@ Samuel:
To get done with bringing this code version to the release 0.9.2 (before attempting FPGA modifications), we should implement a more efficient workflow. I suggest that I start using PyRPL like before, i.e. by ignoring the GUI (only using the scope, network analyzer and specan display) in order to get it running independently (and fully configurable with a text editor, since I believe this is much faster). I suggest you take care of bringing the gui to a level that does not scare off potential users at the first error message (as it is the case now). That way I believe we will both be working for >1 week before we can think about publishing the code
done a lot, API will stay as-is more or less
