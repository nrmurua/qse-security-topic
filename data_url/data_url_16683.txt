Anti-contolled gates with 1 or 2 control qubits aren't displayed correcly
In the Jupyter notebook cell execute code
The result is

I'm not sure where the issue is: in the visualization part, or in the gate part.
Update 1: I wrote an additional test. The controlled gate is formed and computed incorrectly. A code below generates a standard "CNOT" gate instead of anti-controlled not:
A circuit and results:

With the anti-controlled not only '01' should be measured.
Interesting, I can confirm this issue, but decomposing the circuit yields the correct result -- both in the diagram and the simulation. Maybe this comes from the fact that the open-control gate is called 'cx' which is a default name used in the simulator and not further decomposed.
It is indeed a bug in the text drawer. Fixed in #4184
