I am compiling a sequence for simultaneous randomized benchmarking using OpenQL v0.3 (old deprecated version).
@imranashraf as this is for an old version I will verify if this also still happens on the 0.5 version I am testing at this moment.
I add single qubit gates for both qubits followed by a  k.gate("wait",  [0,2], 0) instruction to ensure that the measurement on both qubits is simultaneous.
I get a qisa file as output that clearly shows no scheduling has occured as both ALAP and ASAP should put the gates simultaneously.
Below is the first part of the program
Tested in version 0.5.1, this problem no longer occurs.
