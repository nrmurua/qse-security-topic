The following parametric defgate example of comes from the docs (but swapping a PyQVM for a WavefunctionSimulator):

Operating System: macOS Mojave 10.14.6 (18G103)
Python Version (python -V): Python 3.6.8
Quilc Version (quilc --version): 1.12.1 [2953a23]
QVM Version (qvm --version): 1.12.0 [9b26c1b]
Python Environment Details (pip freeze or conda list):
I would personally lobby for not fixing this, and instead deprecating PyQVM and NumpyWavefunctionSimulator if we have the opportunity to do so (without alienating users etc). At the very least I think we should funnel people towards using the QVM via QuantumComputer.
I basically agree. I filed this in part because I feel like collecting bugs to document what's missing / broken helps make that decision easier when/if the time comes.
