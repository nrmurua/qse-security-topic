It is possible to implement a ramp using qc.Loop sweeping a parameter and adding a wait time but I think there is some merit to discussing whether this is the way it should be done
qc.Loop(gate.voltage.sweep(0, -10, 1)).each(qc.Wait(1)).run()
What are people's thoughts on this? It seems like something everyone would use, how should it be implemented and what would the ideal syntax be?
@giulioungaretti @WilliamHPNielsen
Do you imagine ramp just being a set of set, every x unit time ?
If so then it could implemented in the base instruments, else it can't only implemented in the driver.
I'd want it to take whatever value ask it to set the paremeter to and use some preset minimum step (in magnitude and time) to keep setting the parameter until it is at the value you want it. I feel like @MerlinSmiles used/did this at some point but I might be imagining it?
I was only doing this in matlab previously...
A feature like that would be nice, also then the need for:
@nataliejpg  so let me rephrase, does the ramp needs just time from the outside ? or you do need to query the instrument ?
@MerlinSmiles async, for now please forget. I mean qcodes is just not ready anything like async, there is simply no notion of concurrency ( before being confused  with the idea of using parallelism to "achieve" concurrency ).
@MerlinSmiles and yes, also interesting, but again there is no notion of channels for now
@giulioungaretti yeah sure, just wanted to say that before someone makes something which wont be possible to transfer at all... but will keep silent :promise:
@giulioungaretti it's needs to know what value the parameter currently has in order to calculate what to set it to next in the ramp... Whether it uses the 'last known value' or queries the instrument is up for debate.
@nataliejpg  ok so how about this ?

@nataliejpg  see edit above, or you'd rather have an example ?
@giulioungaretti I'll try it out today, thanks :)
@giulioungaretti üëç works, is there, maybe we can add 2 lines to the tutorial with it in use just so that it's 'idiot proof' (or maybe we want to stop people like me who don't bother to read the docs like me from using it...) :P
let's wait for @alexcjohnson new parameter and examples, and in case add the example there!
In that case I'll reopen as a reminder and we can close when it's done.
@WilliamHPNielsen  I can't remember if Alex actually wrote the docs or not, probably not.
Would be terrific if you could go through the docs and if not there write a small example!
See #601, which aims to solve this issue.
