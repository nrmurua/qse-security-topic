When combining two templates in AtomicMultiChannelPulseTemplate.__init__ I get the following error message:
The first template I created directly, the other is a concatenation of multiple templates.
The numbers in the error message appear equal, so I investigated.
The comparison that fails is this one: https://github.com/qutech/qupulse/blob/master/qupulse/expressions.py#L269
It looks like the equality check for an ExpressionScalar fails for number which are almost identical, except for some finite precision rounding errors. For the comparison of the duration of pulses I think the comparison should be less strict.

It seems that the == equality operator in sympy does test for exact structural(/syntactical) equality, not for mathematical equality [1], so maybe we shouldn't be using it when comparing expressions where we are more interested in whether they evaluate to the same result.
We should consider rewriting the __eq__ of Expression as
or
(or something like that, I don't know what's quite correct here, refer to [1] again).
I'm not sure this is going to resolve the rounding problem above, so maybe we additionally need to not check only for exact equality but diff < epsilon (but I'd try out the above first).

Thanks for the analysis so far. It might be helpful if you could also provide a minimal test example that reproduces the error so we can include it in our test suite.
@lumip can you resolve this?
I will implement the option to postpone the duration equality check to instantiation: #402
Nevermind, I need to touch this part of the code anyways.
@eendebakpt can you check whether #403 fixes your problem?
Please reopen if it doesn't.
