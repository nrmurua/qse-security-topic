Related to #882 but I see that issue as an optimization of the simulator as opposed to defining a channel.
Is this for measurement and reset?  Or for actual destructive measurement?
Channel for measurement and reset to 0 has
A_0 = [[1, 0], [0, 0]]
A_1 = [[0, 1], [0, 0]]
(you can also reset to different basis, so it might be useful to build the correct primitive version of these that are basis dependent).
If it is a real destructive measurement (qubit disappears, like a photon) then probably then the channel goes to a one dimensional space
A_0 = [[1, 0]]
A_1 = [[0, 1]]
