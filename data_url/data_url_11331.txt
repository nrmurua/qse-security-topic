I added an alternative version of the routine for creating the Fermi Hubbard hamiltonian. In this version the repulsion term U n_{i,\uparrow} n_{i,\downarrow} is replaced by  U (n_{i,\uparrow}-1/2) (n_{i,\downarrow}-1/2), which is unchanged by a particle-hole transformation. This version has the advantage that at chemical potential and magnetic field equal zero, the ground state is always the one at half-filling and the energy is symmetric with respect to chemical potential = 0. This is more convenient for benchmarks than the previous version. Look at the energies for a 2x2 lattice:

For now it is a separate routine.

This looks like a valuable contribution. However, I think we should aim to add this functionality to the existing Hubbard model code. For instance, have an optional input parameter (False by default) which if True, creates the Hubbard model you are interested in here. The goal would be to duplicate as little code as possible and only add the minimum number of extra lines required to create the functionality you want when this flag is true.
Otherwise, the contribution looks pretty solid. You might need a few more tests and you do need to sign the CLA if you haven't done so already.
We found a Contributor License Agreement for you (the sender of this pull request), but were unable to find agreements for the commit author(s).  If you authored these, maybe you used a different email address in the git commits than was used to sign the CLA (login here to double check)?  If these were authored by someone else, then they will need to sign a CLA as well, and confirm that they're okay with these being contributed to Google.
In order to pass this check, please resolve this problem and have the pull request author add another comment and the bot will run again.
I updated it such as now there is only one fermi_hubbard function with a particle_hole_symmetry Boolean option set by default as False. Will add more tests.
CLAs look good, thanks!
