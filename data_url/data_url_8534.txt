There seems to be a failure in how Qobj.istp checks trace-preservingness for superoperators acting on composite systems. I think there's an exception raised inside the property accessor which is being downgraded to istp == False; I'll investigate and fix it soon. In the meantime, I've written a brief test case that shows the problem.
