Hi
The method draw() draws the circuit using text symbols. Gates that are supposed to take place at the same moment are supposed to be represented in the same column.
Executing the following script:
The gates applied to qubit q2 take place in moments 0 and 1, yet they are represented to take place in moments 4 and 5.
The expected representation should be:
Below is a screenshot of the queue moments matrix, showing the gates correctly allocated to the right moment:
