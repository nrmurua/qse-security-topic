This is a proposal which will make Yao.jl a meta package of several concrete package for quantum information science like DifferentialEquations.
By separating each different part into several packages, it will be easier to maintain mature part of the package, and develop new features in separated repo rapidly.
All the package will start with Yao to enable tab completion for convenience.
In the future, Yao.jl will only provide a few eye-candy and ester egg and re-export the above package as a meta-package.
Please don't change the name of CuYao, this name has been used in my slides and my recent paper. Not all packages in GPUJulia start with GPU, right?
So, please remove the statement "tab completion for convenience", this is not a reason.
CuYao will become a meta package as well to make it easier to install, since we don't have conditional dependency in Pkg. (Ref: JuliaLang/Pkg.jl#977)
CuYao will contain the following:
