We have 2 overloads of the cudaq::from_state function. The first, which I believe should remain the same, returns a kernel given a state vector. The second accepts a kernel, a set of qubits, the state, and returns null (cudaq::from_state(Kernel kernel, QuakeValue qubits, ndarray state) -> None). It would make much more sense if this second overload was a member function on the Kernel/kernel_builder type. See:
This sounds good to me.
