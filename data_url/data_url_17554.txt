Running:
always returns {'is_swap_mapped': [], 'is_direction_mapped': []} for the results.  It looks like the pass only populates the values as properties of a PassManager.
The results should tell me the result of the check.
I'm not sure I fully following you. I tried:
The check map has a results attribute that one would assume holds the result, but does not. I see from your example that this is not actually used.
oh! I see. the attribute was left there by mistake. It's going to be removed in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/pull/1767/files#diff-b2fb08d7a3de675a90136cd23b548ea0L36.
