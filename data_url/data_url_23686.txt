Tell us what should happen
The modules should import and allow me to create a driver for a new Oscilloscope
Tell us what happens instead
The modules don't import and I receive the error message as in the title.

I am trying to write a driver for a new oscilloscope (LeCroy WaveRunner 104xi) based on the existing driver for the Tektronix TPS2012 oscilloscope (qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.TPS2012 module) for reflectometry measurements. While trying to import the LeCroy driver, I receive the error message given in the thread title. Is this issue something you have come across? How do I go about fixing this?
The following is the code for the LeCroy driver (still unfinished but I want to see if it works so far):
#!/usr/bin/env python
import logging
import binascii
import qcodes
import numpy as np
from pyvisa.errors import VisaIOError
from functools import partial
from qcodes import *
from qcodes import VisaInstrument, validators as vals
from qcodes import InstrumentChannel, ChannelList
from qcodes import ArrayParameter
log = logging.getLogger(name)
class TraceNotReady(Exception):
pass
class ScopeArray(ArrayParameter):
def init(self, name, instrument, channel):
super().init(name=name,
shape=(2500,),
label='Voltage',
unit='V ',
setpoint_names=('Time', ),
setpoint_labels=('Time', ),
setpoint_units=('s',),
docstring='holds an array from scope')
self.channel = channel
self._instrument = instrument
class LeCroyChannel(InstrumentChannel):
class LeCroy(VisaInstrument):
"""
This is the QCoDeS driver for the Tektronix 2012B oscilloscope.
"""
Please let me know if there is a fix for this.
Many Thanks,

Hi Arvind,
I assume that you mean:
and not InstrumentList I.e your title of the bug is correct but there is a typo in your list below?
The InstrumentChannels and ChannelList was added in the latest version of QCoDeS along with a new version of the TPS Driver that uses the channels. How did you install qcodes? and do you have the latest version?
Hi Jens,
Thanks for the quick reply. I installed qCoDeS via "pip install qcodes" but that was several months ago, has a new version come out since?
You are correct about the typo in the list below, I'll change that now.
Yes we did a release in both June and July. The Current version of the TPS driver (Which I guess you found here on Github?) only works with the latest release as it uses new features not in the old releases
I've updated my one to the latest version of qCoDeS via "pip install --upgrade qcodes" but it's still giving me the same error. Do you know why this might be the case?
And you are right, I found the current version of the TPS driver on Github.
Can you double check that you have the latest version by doing
from a python prompt. That should print 0.1.5
It's still on 0.1.3 however it says the latest version has been installed on cmd.exe
Is there a step I am missing between pip install/upgrade and being able to use the latest version?
There should not be. Is it possible that you have multiple python installations and you have upgraded the version installed in one and is using the other. Does the output of pip list show the right version?
Yes, that was exactly the error. I upgraded qCoDeS on the correct Python installation and now can import/use the new TPS driver.
Thanks a lot for the help, I appreciate it.
Cheers,
Arvind
Great I will close this then
