This is a long-term feature request.
It would be nice to have a function that does the opposite of match_template, that is, provided a dictionary of parameters and a template, create a program with template variables replaced by the parameters from the dict.
already exists, just do blackbird.load(templatefilename)(parameter1=value1, ..)
