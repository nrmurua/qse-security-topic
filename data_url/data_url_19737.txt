Feature Request:
For Quantum Process Tomography, the ProcessTomographyFitter initializer takes a job.result(). However, if I want to experimentally perform QPT on a 2+ qubit system, there will be many circuits, so I have to split across a few jobs. It would be nice if there were some functionality for combining job results into a single result object. For now, I hacked around it by creating a new result object and manually initializing its attributes by iterating through the constituent jobs.
Perhaps I should make this feature request in qiskit-terra?
There's really no reason it can't accept a list of results (it would be a small tweak to the code). However, terra does have some built in functionality to take a big job and automatically put the results back into one result. @ajavadia
This is addressed in #410 but I'm not happy about the hack I used there. I could not find the functionality Dave mentioned so I went around it. @chriseclectic, can you point me to Terra functionality for creating unions of Result objects, or at least verifying a result has the counts for a specific circuit name without forcing it to raise an exception?
Fixed in #421
