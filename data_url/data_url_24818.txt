Issue #20 resulted in a (prototype of a) PulseHardwareUploadInterface which enables the implementation of the upload_waveform(..) method of the PulseTemplate class hierarchy.
Implement and test upload_waveform(..) for TablePulseTemplate, SequencePulseTemplate.
Part of #13.
Afflicted by #27 . This issue then refers to the implementation of build_sequence().
build_sequence and requires_stop have been implemented for SequencePulseTemplate and TablePulseTemplate.
For SequencePulseTemplate, the parameter mapping has to be regarded. I encapsulated this in a private __map_parameters method which is called from build_sequence and has yet to be implemented.
@j340m3 Since you know more about how the mapping works in detail, I'll leave that to you, as we have discussed.
Tests will follow in the respective issues #30 and #32 .
Done.
