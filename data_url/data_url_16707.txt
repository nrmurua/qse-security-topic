Currently pulse drawer outputs channels in the order of qubit index [d0, c0, m0, a0, d1, c1, m1, a1, ...], however, the control channel index and qubit index doesn't need to be identical. This may confuse users. The order should be [ (drive channels) d0, d1, ...], [(control channels) c0, c1, ...], [(measure channels) m0, m1, ...], [(acquire channels) a0, a1, ...]. Not only the channel arrangement, the drawer is cumbersome because we need to manually write many options for each call to get nice visualizations, for example
This may be a good opportunity to update the drawer to be more user friendly for the next release.
The interface should be updated to something like
In the new interface, redundant options are moved to style sheet class and Qiskit provides a user with several call back functions to create different preset styles. Arrangement of channels is also able to be controlled with the style sheet such that
(function names are temporary)
In addition, lengthy pulses such as measures and long delay should be automatically truncated to avoid writing plot_range everytime (this is also stylesheet option). This output is something like
In the new interface, we can get nice visualization more easily
Since this may change current drawer interface drastically, we may want to define drawer2.0 under different name and deprecate existing one.
I'll soon write RFC.
Could you please split this into an epic with subtasks? I think everything here proposed here are excellent features for users.
Sure. I'll try to think of the new framework based on some existing drawing libraries and split it into several subtasks. thanks for the advice.
