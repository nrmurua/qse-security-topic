We have a user at Juelich Supercomputing Centre who wants to use libcp2k but I'm unsure how exactly we provide an installation of this. Is it enough to provide libcp2k.a in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and libcp2k.hin the CPATH? For a Fortran user do I just add libcp2k.mod in the CPATH or would I require additional .mod files?
We use EasyBuild for our installations, if you're interested the relevant rules for CP2K are at https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks/blob/develop/easybuild/easyblocks/c/cp2k.py
After building libcp2k explicitly using make ARCH=local VERSION=sopt libcp2k, it should be sufficient to put libcp2k.a in the library path and the header and the libcp2k.mod in the include path, yes.
for further support, please use our Google Group
Should we add a section to INSTALL.md or rather create a dedicated wiki page?
I should add here that it looks like libcp2k.a and libcp2k.h are all that's needed for C interfaces but if you want Fortran you will need a number of the .mod files, it was too much effort to figure out which ones (and probably a moving target) so we just included them all.
Yeah, the .mod files reference each other. I'm not sure there is a good solution for it :-/
So, it seems a short paragraph in INSTALL.md is sufficient then. Do you want to send in a PR?
I could..should I target 2s or3c as the place to make the addition? (Left to my own devices, I probably would choose 3c)
Yes, 3c is good.
