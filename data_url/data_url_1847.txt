Hello,
I al trying to install cirq for Window 10 and Installation was completed successfully. However I have some import error:
What is the problem?
Sorry I tought I added images but I cannot upload any images via GitHub
Here my error images: https://ibb.co/6vMRK6n
Ok I don't know what is this problem and how I can fix it but I log in Windows 10 with another user so It is for me ok
This seems to me an environment issue, somehow scipy gets installed in a way that is corrupted. I think it might have nothing to do with cirq. Can you do pip install --force-reinstall -U cirq and try again?

How did you install things? If different users have different experience, then it might be that the original installation ended up in some sort of privileged location that not all users have access to. Does the user that works have admin rights? Does the other one not? Anyway, this clue points to an environment issue as well.
Another thing I would try is the --user flag with pip install.
I hope this helps, please report back the results - I'd love to capture the learnings in our getting started guide for Windows!
Finally another clue - as this is scipy related maybe forcing a downgrade will help based on this SO thread
