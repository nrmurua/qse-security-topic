When the user tries to view logs from UI, they experience a noticeable delay in response time.
Enable logging from settings, and set the log level to Info. Now try run different workflows, which will increase the log file size( more than 50 MB). Then read logs from UI.
Once the user tries to view logs, the response should have low latency so that it doesn't affect the user experience.
