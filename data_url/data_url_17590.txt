A recent merge into master (I think probably #1705) is qiskit-aer master to fail because it reorders measurements past barriers.
One of the Aer tests is a non-local measure noise: if I measure qubit 0, apply a noise operator on qubit 1. To test this the circuit has to ensure measure of qubit 0 happens before measure of qubit 1 and looks like
Before this would ensure the output qobj had instructions:
But now it reorders the measures past the barrier returning:
Measure instructions should respect barrier placement
The full failing test is:
And it should have target == counts up to statistical error on the counts. Instead, because measure of qubit-1 is being put before measure of qubit-0, the noise to qubit 1 is being applied after it has already been measured returning final counts {'0x0': 2000}.
