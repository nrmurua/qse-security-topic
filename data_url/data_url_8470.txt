The function spectrum_correlation_fft(taulist, y) accepts all kinds of (non-linspace) taulists with corresponding correlation values y.
However, y is passed to scipy.fftpack.fft(y), which assumes the values to be linearly spaced in time. If 'taulist' is not a linspace, the result of spectrum_correlation_fft(taulist, y) will seem realistic, but in fact be totally off.
This behaviour is especially critical, because it is often advantageous to use non-linear taulists for the calculation of correlation values.
I guess this limitation is indicated by the fact that it uses a fast fourier transform, but I think it should be indicated more clearly, at least in the docstring.
P.S: Thanks for the great module! I quite enjoy working with qutip.
Indeed, that should be checked.  Will do soon.
Addressed in #696.
