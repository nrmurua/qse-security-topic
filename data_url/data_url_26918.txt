Many of our strategic decisions are based on assumptions about our user base. Unfortunatelly, we have very little hard evidence in this regard. I therefore propose that we conduct a simple survey among our google group subscribers.
Possible questions could be:
That's a good idea. One could also add the questions which features are missing or should be improved in the first place.
Yes, my "biggest weakness" question was kind of aiming at that, but I guess it's too vague. Phrasing survey questions is an art.
I can imagine to state CP2K's vision in front of the survey (there should be a vision anyway). It makes it clear that development is not democratized on a per-feature basis but inspired by the most demanding needs of the user base. Perhaps the survey can be also help to eventually prune code or focus efforts.
Ok, here is a draft. Any comments?
@hfp, I don't think we have to be worried about of raising false expectations.
Maybe ask if the attendee allows to talk back in case of a question. For instance, "What kind of simulations do you run?" may have an ambiguous mapping to CP2K.
Thanks, that looks good, but it is also quite technical. The questionnaire appears for me as a mixture of German and English, but that is possibly due to some of my settings. We could add the question "How did you learn about CP2K?: friend/colleague/supervisor; google; journal paper; lecture; conference etc." .
@mkrack, I added your questions. The language mix up is most probably due to browser settings.
@hfp, I added "...with CP2K" to the question. When I send out the survey invitation, I'll mention my email in case of questions.
Done, results sent out to cp2k dev list.
