I ran the following code from the docs in the simulator:
When doing sim.run(), code then excutes in an endless loop with the following error:
Using Windows 10, Python 3.6.4 and latest version of Cirq.
It looks like using multiprocessing on windows requires guarding code with an
check (see here). It seems like that would rule out any interactive use of the simulator, which is not good. @dabacon, have you tried the multiprocessing simulator out on windows?
No I haven't tried it on windows
@askolik were you running this interactively or was it a python file you were running?
Looking around I don't see good workarounds for multiprocessing working in interactive mode in python for Windows.  We may need to guard the import by detecting windows and interactive mode (main.file doesn't exist in interactive mode and platform.system() can tell us if we are Windows) and then not allow multiprocessing in this case.
I was running a Python file.
This issue has been sitting around for too long. We need to assign someone to look into this and get it fixed.
@dabacon you're most familiar with the simulator code and multiprocessing; do you have a windows machine you can test on?
@Strilanc Any luck on this bug?
@askolik if you are just running a python file can you see if the main block works?  I.e. if you change the file to the following do you still get the error?
Sorry, I keep putting this one off by one more day and it's become a ridiculous amount of time :(
@dabacon Yes, it works with using the main block. :)
Fixed by crossfire from other bugs (simulator defaults to threads instead of multiprocessing).
