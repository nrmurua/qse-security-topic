If you have a feature request feel free to freestyle.
We should simplify the axis labels to be in Mv, thus jettisoning the extra digits and de-cluttering the plot.  This should be done only (obviously) where our precision begins 3 digits out. Stick with Volts where it makes sense.
Axis is labeled as "0.000X" Volts (for example)instead.
Samples are attached.
