The Husimi Q function for spins gives incorrect output for the states |J, -J>, for all J.
Generating a spin-coherent state with some theta and phi, and then calculating the Husimi Q function for the same theta and phi should always give 1/pi, but this value tends toward 0 the closer to the bottom of the Bloch sphere you go.
A similar problem exists for the spin wigner function, where a the spin-coherent state |J, -J> has some negativity in the wigner function.
Could you please post a code snippet to reproduce this? I am working with the Husimi Q and Wigner functions now and could look into it more.
This shows the main problem, if you also calculate the Husimi Q function for all theta and phi, it will be equal to 0 at every point.
A similar problem occurs for the spin_wigner function.

|θ,φ>=exp(−iϕSz)exp(−iθSy)|S,S>

I discovered the issue originated from this commit da642a3
This prevented the Husimi Q function being correctly calculated for non-integer spin systems. There is a remaining factor of 1/pi to be included as well, which I might treat as an option when I update the code.
