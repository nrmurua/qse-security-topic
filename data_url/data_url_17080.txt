some gates have a hardcoded matrix associated with them.
some have definitions in terms of more elementary gates.
the equivalency of these two should be tested for all gates.
I did this for ch in #2837. Others need to be added in test.python.circuit.test_gate_definitions
Hi there! I'm interested in this issue, and wanted to know if I can work on it.
Hi @drholmie, great. Please wait for #2837 to merge, and then you can build on the test there.
Alright, thanks! I do have a few questions about it, will ask after the merge if that's alright.
Congrats on the merge! Wanted to ask a couple things about it. Firstly, I'm assuming this is an implementation of issue #1741 and wanted to know if I should continue with changing other gate definitions, following the issue's suggestion of other shorter gate definitions, or if I should just focus on writing tests for gates.
Secondly, are tests to be added for every gate in qiskit.extensions.standard ? If so I'd like to tackle the issue by splitting it into multiple PRs, where each PR is a test for a certain gate(or a small set of gates), thus allowing for easier reviews. Do tell if this is okay with you, and please do correct me if I'm wrong in my understanding of the situation.
Hey there! I don't really know if this issue should be closed. Was actually working on the other tests as well since I was advised to split this issue into multiple PRs. I apologize for the delay, I was busy with my college examinations. Is it still okay for me to submit the other tests and continue to reference this issue?
