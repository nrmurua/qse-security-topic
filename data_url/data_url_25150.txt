When the start time and end time are the same for a dispatch, the run time is just blank. It seems that the dispatch finished in less than a second ( run time in lattice sidebar shows - 0s ), and hence the run time is blank.

Run a very short dispatch.
It can be something like below.
Even if the dispatch finishes in less than a second, the run time should be there. Either as 0 seconds or the milliseconds.
