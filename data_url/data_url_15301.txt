When drawing a circuit with circuit.draw(idle_wires=False) the circuit is somehow mutated to fail on future drawing or qpy serialization events.
Using the circuit below. Message for QPY file.
Circuit should draw twice.

The immediate cause of this is the circuit drawer doing qubits = circuit.qubits and then mutating its qubits list when deciding what to display.  The root cause is that QuantumCircuit exposes its private, mutable data store (_qubits: List[Qubit]) directly via the qubits property, which is what allows this kind of error to occur.
As a simpler example that's effectively the same behaviour:
I can squash this symptom, but fixing the QuantumCircuit interface without performance degradations or backwards-compatibility breaks is rather harder and may not be practically possible right now.
