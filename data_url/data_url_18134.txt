Should work.
Quantum volume circuits constructed using the method from the recent blog post:
https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/05/quantum-circuits/
fail to compile on the ibmqx5 backend with the error:
MapperError: 'swap_mapper failed: layer X, sublayer Y, "cx q[0],q[9];\n"'
where X and Y depend on the number of qubits and depth of the circuit.  However, the error is always with respect to a cx between qubits 0 and 9.  The error occurs only when the number of qubits is not  n=16, which is the max for the ibmqx5.  For example n=16, depth=11 is successful, but n=15, depth=11 fails.  Others like n=10, depth=5 also fail with the same error, while n=16, depth=5 works.
Run the code with the above mentioned examples.
QISKit 0.5, OSX
Closing this as the fix has been merged.
