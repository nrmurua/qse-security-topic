It turns out that computations of grid coordinates are done more conveniently using numpy integer arrays than 2-tuples of python ints. However, when offsets thus computed are used with GridQubit exception is raised. For example:
It'd be nice to be able to say q + d instead of having to write q + tuple(int(v) for v in d) or similar.
