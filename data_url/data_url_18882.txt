The missing qubit syntax can be provided as follows:
The bit syntax is more complex in qasm3.g4 and I have not quite figured that out yet.
Once the live specification is updated, qasm3.g4 will be updated.
The paper introduced features that are not in the live specification, such as new gate modifier negctrl, option of ctrl gate modifier for multiple-qubits, extern (replacing kernel), primitive types without precision specification, and so on.
I guess that they will be added to the live specification soon. (@taalexander, please correct my comments if they are wrong)
Well, @hhorii , I think I just added the feature :)
I also have PRs open on the live specification:
I'll add a clause to the live specification to #189

The missing qubit syntax can be provided as follows:
Why do we need two different - and contradictory - ways of declaring the same thing?
My expectation - as a compiler writer - is that a declaration of the form
has different semantics than a declaration of the different form
If they have identical semantics, why are both needed?

Then I would suggest that we do not need both forms of syntax to represent the same exact thing. We can preserve the OpenQASM2 syntax in OpenQASM3 for backwards compatibility without introducing a new syntax form.

I would agree with you, however, the footnote to the syntax promulgated in OpenQASM 3 says
The qreg and creg keywords may not be supported in future versions of OpenQASM.
In any case, if the change is desirable, you have my PR #189
This seems to be subsumed in #190 ... when that PR is merged, we can close this issue.
We should follow what the paper says. Declarations for qubits are qubit[size] q or qreg q[size]. The two are inconsistent because qreg needs to be that way for backwards compatibility. See pp. 8 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14722.pdf. These are both addressed in #190
Closing as #190 has been merged.
