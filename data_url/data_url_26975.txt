The geometry optimization in multi-GPU version of the latest version fails for some reason. See the attached .zip file for CUDA serial and multi-GPU output files of a test case.

Hi @Madu86, I tried out the calculations with quick.MPI and the problem still persist. You can find the outputs from all cuda, cuda.MPI and MPI calculations here.
Hi @akhilshajan, can you please provide me a smaller example that can be used to reproduce this issue? The one I have (attached above) is too big for debugging.
Hi @Madu86, I have tried out few examples which takes ~40 iterations with serial, MPI and cuda.MPI and it works out fine giving same results. I was not able to find something that would be helpful for debugging. I am still working on few other molecules there is some discrepancy I will update you.
@akhilshajan Any update on this?
Hi @Madu86, I apologize for my delayed response. I have tried out some molecules and it appears that the issue we are experiencing with MPI arises when using the D3BJ keyword. I did not encounter any errors when running the calculations without this keyword. Attached is the input file I used to test benzene molecule, where the SCF calculation failed.
