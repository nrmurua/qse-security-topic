Started today. See https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/actions/runs/3092172859/jobs/5003479363
Seems that the CI is getting rate-throttled by GitHub?
@MarkDaoust @lamberta Is tensorflow-docs on Pypi? I can't find it.
@vtomole No, not on PyPi but you can pip install it from the Git repo, see https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/tree/master/tools/tensorflow_docs/tools
you can pip install it from the Git repo,
@lamberta That's what our CI does now, but apparently Github might be rate throttling us. Hence this issue.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/': The requested URL returned error: 429
I think we can install tensorflow_docs from its git archive tarball,
that should have lower demands than cloning a git repo.
Let me prepare a PR for that ...
I think using github tarball as a dependency is causing CI failures?

An oversight on my review: We are attempting to upload tensorflow-docs as a dev requirement because the existing setup.py doesn't remove it. Filed #5886.
