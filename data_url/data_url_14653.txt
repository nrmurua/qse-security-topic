With introduction of pulse ScheduleBlock  (see #5679), the software implementation of the qiskit pulse was drastically updated while minimizing the impact to user API. However, the unittests are still based on the old codebase structure and there are many redundant/duplicated tests.
Basic changes based on the ScheduleBlock are listed as follows:
I suggest to reorganize test.python.pulse as follows:
We also need further discussion for granularity of unittest classes. These classes are prepared for a specific method, collection of methods (some behavior), or subclass-wise, i.e. seems no standard rule. This may make us easily miss important testcases and raise the bar for contribution. Perhaps need some guideline? Welcome suggestions :)
sounds good to me
