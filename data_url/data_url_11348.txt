For some reason coveralls has a habit of commenting multiple times on pull requests, even when there is no new activity. I've used coveralls before but never seen this problem outside of our recently configured repos. The main reason I care is because I "watch" the repo and receive emails updates on all activity. It is somewhat obnoxious to have coveralls emailing me two or three times for most PRs. Here are a couple examples:
#3
#5
coveralls has mostly behaved in the last few days so I will close this for now.
I explicitly fixed this by having coveralls not make posts to the PR.
