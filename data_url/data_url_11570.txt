Raises the following value error:
ValueError: Qiskit circuit Initializer cannot handle non-positive statevectors.
Since the state vector has a global phase ( i ), the result should be just as if it the state vector is real, which I get:
{'00': 0.7026039736224098, '01': 0.5945717997012638, '10': 0.39093737509990006}
Pass the if statement that works only if the statevector is real:
I agree. Commenting out this check allows the code to work. Furthermore, the class in question, qiskit.extensions.Initializer explicitly allows complex coefficients.
