Here we see the issue: instead of being simultaneous, the marker is AFTER the measure pulse. A whole bunch of the QGL test waveforms fall into this scenario. Could be a plotting issue, need to investigate further.


I think it's real, it should be fixed in the master branch: #189
Indeed. Cherry-picked fix from #189. Closing.
