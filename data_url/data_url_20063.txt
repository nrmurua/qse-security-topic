I decided to enable strict ELF checker in ALT Linux when building liboqs package, and it reported that liboqs.so have executable stack:
verify-elf: ERROR: ./usr/lib64/liboqs.so.0.7.1: found executable STACK entry:   GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000 0x000000 0x000000 RWE 0x10
This is output of readelf --wide --segments -- ./usr/lib64/liboqs.so.0.7.1 and executable stack is marked with letter `E' in flags column.
Executable stack is rare occurrence these days so you might want to fix it somehow.
After some investigation it seems related to compiling asm (.S) files which does not contain proper markings.
It helped locally to build with -DCMAKE_ASM_FLAGS= with added -Wa,--noexecstack.
Thanks for the issue.  I've tried to add this option via #1161.  Can you check if that resolves the issue?  I don't have the full toolchain installed to easily check.
