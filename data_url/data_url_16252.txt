Only PauliOp has commutes method among all OperatorBase.
I notice that there are some problems with PauliOp.commutes thanks to qiskit-community/qiskit-aqua#1415.
output
The second output False is not expected because X.to_matrix_op() is essentially equal to X.
It would be good to deprecate PauliOp.commutes because of the following reasons.
If users want to check commutation of Pauli operators, they can do it by using the primitives as follows.

or using #5299. (see https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/issues/1416#issuecomment-723728545)

Sorry, my is_commutative is not for this purpose. (I made a mistake in the previous issue)
To check the commutativity of Pauli, PauliTable.commutes is useful.
(note that PauliTable will be deprecated.)
Do we need this issue anymore - can it be closed?
What do you think of this topic? Should we keep PauliOp.commutes? May I deprecate it in terra?
If the method is not required in opflow in Terra can it not simply be deleted? Is this not used though by the test abelian grouper to make sure all Paulis in the group commute with one another? If this is not fixable in a way that makes sense, then either a name change or just move the logic over to the test and delete it seem like options? Thoughts. I'll move this issue to Terra anyway since it seems that something should be changed there in any case.
Yes, it makes sense to delete it. Because I used PauliOp.commutes for unit tests of test_abelian_grouper.py (this is the only use case of PauliOp.commutes in Qiskit), I need to replace it.
I ask Hamamura-san to delete PauliOp.commutes and update test_abelian_grouper.py as part of #5537 because it introduces commutator function and related to this issue.
