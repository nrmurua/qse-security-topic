Running valgrind over text_kex currently returns this error (among other similar errors):
I investigated the problem and noticed the following:
A block of 48 bytes is malloc'd here, then passed here, then passed here (as the forth parameter), finally it is passed here.
In the function:
oqs_sidh_cln16_fpcopy751(oqs_sidh_cln16_felm_t a, oqs_sidh_cln16_felm_t c)
It is treated as if it has type oqs_sidh_cln16_felm_t which is defined:
typedef digit_t oqs_sidh_cln16_felm_t[NWORDS_FIELD];.
Looking at this section it seems that the type should be of size 96 bytes (4 * 24 or 8 * 12).
Is the original memory allocation here incorrect?
@christianpaquin: Any suggestions?
Just committed a fix (pull 70). Could you run the tool again to see if it works?
@aparent When you run the tool again, can you also briefly document your process on the wiki (https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Code-analysis) so I know how to do this too?
It looks like the issue is fixed with that pr. Thanks!
