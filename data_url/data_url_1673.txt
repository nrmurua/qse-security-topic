Description of the issue
Identities cannot be added to PauliSums. This might be related to cirq.IdentityGate not being a cirq.Pauli.
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
0.11.0.dev
In lieu of a fix, users can wrap identity gates in cirq.PauliStrings before mixing them into PauliSums to avoid this issue.
Another shorter workaround is
but I was also wondering if cirq.XPowerGate(exponent=0) acts same as IdentifyGate or not. (Seems no except global phase difference).
The PauliString class maps sets of qubits to Pauli gates. This representation makes an implicit assumption that the operator corresponding to any given key-value pair in the dictionary acts as a scalar multiple of the identity on qubits which are not members of its key. This has a special case for scalars: scalar is an operator that acts as a scalar multiple of the identity on all qubits, hence the empty key.
This gives us another workaround for the issue:
which actually works fine at the moment. I think that the above code snippet and
should have the same effect once the issue is fixed.
