Hi,
I followed the instructions here
https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/linux-package-manager/ubuntu18-04/sdk-current
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/command-line?view=qsharp-preview
but had issue on various linux versions (you can reproduce with ubuntu:18.04 or centos:7 from dockerhub) with the following error
The following SO issue help me fixing it (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49579153/unable-to-load-dll-microsoft-quantum-simulator-runtime-dll) by installing libgomp1
Maybe there is a way to improve the framework or mention this dependency somewhere in the doc.
Thank you for reporting this!
I've transferred this issue to the documentation repo https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-pr/issues/335, since it's not really something that can be addressed on the katas project level.
