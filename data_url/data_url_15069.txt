For a register of state qubits $\ket{x}$, a target qubit $\ket{0}$ and the basis 'Y' this circuit acts as, the operation $Y$ of a linear  rotation on a zero-input qubit is:
$$\left|x\right\rangle _{n}\left|0\right\rangle
\rightarrow\left|x\right\rangle _{n}\left(
\cos\left(\frac{a}{2}x+\frac{b}{2}\right)\left|0\right\rangle
+\sin\left(\frac{a}{2}x+\frac{b}{2}\right)\left|1\right\rangle \right)$$
Such a rotation can be realized as a series of controlled rotations as follows:
$$\left[R_{y}\left(2^{n-1}a\right)\right]^{x_{n-1}}\cdots
\left[R_{y}\left(2^{1}a\right)\right]^{x_{1}}
\left[R_{y}\left(2^{0}a\right)\right]^{x_{0}}R_{y}\left(b\right)$$
However, given the documentation: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.LinearPauliRotations.html , we find:
$$|x\rangle |0\rangle \mapsto \cos(ax + b)|x\rangle|0\rangle + \sin(ax + b)|x\rangle |1\rangle$$
with $\frac{a}{2}=$ slope and $\frac{b}{2}=$ offset. I guess you should replace a and b respectively with slope and offset inside the last formula or use the first formula written above.
This is also why within the code at link: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/3763e61f16f97598cb0fa317277ad85fa15db738/test/python/circuit/library/test_functional_pauli_rotations.py, we can see how correctly multiplied by a factor of two both a and b:
@Cryoris, do you mind confirming the mistake? The math is over my head.
Thanks for spotting this.
I agree there's a problem here, though I think you might have got your suggestion slightly muddled too (or I misunderstood what you're trying to say with the replacements).  I think our documentation is off by a factor of 4, whereas your suggestions are off by a factor of 2 with respect to the slope and offset arguments.
The  output from LinearPauliRotations(slope, offset) in the $Y$ basis is definitely $\lvert x\rangle\lvert 0\rangle \to \cos\Bigl(\frac{\text{slope}}{2}x + \frac{\text{offset}}{2}\Bigr)\lvert x\rangle\lvert 0\rangle + \sin\Bigl(\frac{\text{slope}}{2}x + \frac{\text{offset}}{2}\Bigr)\lvert x\rangle\lvert 1\rangle$ (since it's implemented the same way as your first formula):
If we substituted $a/2 = \text{slope}$, $b/2 = \text{offset}$ into your first formula, we'd have the cosine as $\cos\bigl(\text{slope}\times x + \text{offset}\bigr)$, and it'd be the same if we replaced $a$ and $b$ with $\text{slope}$ and $\text{offset}$ in your second formula.
I think the correct fix is to keep the formula in our documentation the same, but fix the variable definitions to say $a = \text{slope} / 2$ and $b = \text{offset} / 2$.  Julien can also check my maths, though.
Yep I agree with the above üëçüèª This comes orginally from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06893.pdf, where in Fig. 2 you can see that it has the factor of 1/2. Fixing the variable definitions seems like the easiest way forward! üôÇ
Thanks Jake and Julien for your time. I agree that the easiest way to fix this is using the variable definitions as $a=\frac{slope}{2}$ and $b=\frac{offset}{2}$. üòÑ
Thanks both!  Mattia - would you be interested in making the PR to fix things?
Fixed by #9891.
