Looks like the cached image of the repository somehow got invalidated, and building the new image keeps timing out... We'll keep looking into why this is happening; as a temporary workaround, try using the following link https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/QuantumKatas/drop-prebuild?filepath=index.ipynb - it might take 10-15 minutes to build but so far it hasn't timed out for me.
ThanksÔºÅ
Love the idea if one build, everyone share XD
We've updated the Katas to the release 0.10.1911.1607 (thanks @bettinaheim!) which should fix this issue. Building the Binder image the first time after master is updated now takes ~25 minutes and it is a lot less likely to timeout on any individual kata.
