A minimal example is included below. The DataSet.complete returns while the loop is still running.

Yeah, this is a confusing situation... you need to explicitly enable the DataManager too, then it works:
Without the DataManager there's no way for the background process to sync data back to the main process.
I suppose we could change the run flags so you only need one of them to enable multiprocessing. I wrote it this way because there are reasons you might want background and no data manager or vice versa, though they're kind of edge cases. So perhaps a better way, if you're going to be running this way most of the time while the new architecture is still being developed, would be to set config.core.legacy_mp = True which turns them both on by default.
One thing we could do is throw a warning if you use background=True without data_manager=True. That would help any legacy_mp users to get to the right settings.
