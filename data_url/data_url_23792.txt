By default instruments are started in a different process (using the multiprocessing framework). When I kill my current ipython session (this happens on both windows and unix, but I am not working in the notebook), then often these processes are orphaned. I am then left with a process connected the instrument that I have no access to anymore. Starting a new session fails, because the instrument is already busy.
My only option is then to go the the task manager and kill all processes involving python. This is not acceptable, since it kills not only the orphaned process but also other programs using python.
Are there already solutions for this? An option would be to add a construction to every QcodesProcess that regularly checks whether the process should be aborted or not. (using sockets, ZMQ, files on disk or something)
#120 ?
Indeed the same issue, not sure why that one didn't show up. Closing this one.
