Describe the bug
When constructing an EnsembleProblem with a SchrodingerProblem and using the EnsembleDistributed algorithm to parallelize the simulations, several workers cannot run simultaneously due to a lock on .CondaPkg. The error message produced is the following:
To Reproduce
Here is a minimum working example:
Running this code with julia -p 2 minimum_working_example.jl produces the issue.
Version Info
Update: I think that PythonCall is the issue. The bug can be fixed by avoiding the Bloqade init through replacing using Bloqade with using BloqadeExpr, BloqadeODE, BloqadeLattices.
A quick fix is to only let the master process import Python Call, and only allow master proc to plot
So if we modify the following part in src/Bloqade.jl :
