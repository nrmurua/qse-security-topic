This would be useful for testing circuits. Particularly for circuits that happen to be classical, since then a single run of the simulator can be used to test every case by comparing amplitudes in the output vector to the amplitude it should have come from in the input vector.
So by state you mean individual amplitudes, rather than initializing to a classical bit-string?
Yes.
An alternative approach, for this use case, is a "PermutationSimulator" which only allows classical gates and then spits out the final permutation.
Ok the idea was actually to use the cheat function for this. Unfortunately, the default pybind export of std::vector performs a copy each time a switch between Python and C++ is made, which is why this currently does not work. At some point, we should implement a custom version of this and update the C++ export.
Oh and we'll definitely need a permutation simulator.
I'm currently working on testing out different initial states for the VQE so being able to initialize the ProjectQ Simulator to a specific state would be very useful!
I'll add an extra function over the weekend since I currently don't see a quick fix for the pybind issue with cheat.
This feature has been added to the Simulator in the develop branch, see
