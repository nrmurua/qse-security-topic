Running the verify_wheels script from master (just to get #584) with the wheel from pypi results in errors and it doesn't run:
The script works, it's there to sanity check releases.
Fix the issue and release a 0.4.1 package with it fixed. Additionally, we should switch our compile jobs to both run verify_wheels.py and build in the manylinux docker image to prevent this kind of issue in the future.
Ok, this seems like a problem with different versions of Numpy being installed/selected at runtime, now that we can reproduce it consistently will fix it soon.
Fixed by #609
