Description of the issue
We have some uncovered lines that I discovered while extracting cirq.google.
It's kind of amazing that only 199 lines are uncovered, but maybe we could cover them / mark them with # coverage: ignore.
I think I could do that.
Hey @unaiic - I don't think adding # coverage: ignore is the answer necessarily everywhere, we only add that to cases where we know it's impossible to cover with unit tests. I much rather we actually implement unit tests that cover these lines. But that's a lot of work...so not sure yet what to do here. I am leaning towards leaving it as it is, and as things change around these parts, we'll be forced to add coverage anyway. For larger refactorings that touch these lines, it might be okay to just ignore the errors and merge with Admin rights.
@balopat Okay, you'll know much better than me. I could keep the PR to add some unit tests (if we know which ones to implement), delete it or leave it as it is now. Do what you think is best.
