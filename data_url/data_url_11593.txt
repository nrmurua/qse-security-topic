In responding to a post on Qiskit Slack, as below, I see that CplexOptimizer raises an error but does not give any information in the error message about this being an optional install. This is done elsewhere in Aqua and should be done here too.
I am getting this error CPLEX not installed every time I run optimizer = CplexOptimizer()  to solve a Quadratic Problem . Did I miss something during the installation of qiskit or it has to be downloaded from somewhere else?
Can we make sure any other places, particularly those that may have been added recently, which process whether an optional install is present or not, include such information should it not be present (e.g. reading/writing LP files in QuadraticProgram)
