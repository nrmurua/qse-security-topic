Dear Sir,
I am trying to measure quantum register in loop. And, it will try to access backend again n again while in loop. My question is : is it possible to measure quantum register in loop only after getting access backend at once. Otherwise, after one measurement it displays: gates are blocked...error...
Please give solution or any tutorial handling it..

Hi,
Please tell us the QISKit version and Python version.
Also, posting your code, if possible, will be helpful.
Python 3.6.5
QISkit 0.5.6.
from qiskit import QuantumProgram
data =set[:100,:10]
labels=set[:100,10]-1
qp=QuantumProgram()
no_qubits=4
qr = qp.create_quantum_register('qr',no_qubits)
cr = qp.create_classical_register('cr', 1)
qc = qp.create_circuit('test', [qr], [cr])
p=initialise_params(7)
one_time=np.zeros(len(labels))
def eva_amount(data, labels, p):
for k in range(len(lables)):
for j in range(data.shape[1]):
qc.ry((2*data[k,j]),qr[j])
print(k)
for j in range(no_qubits):
qc.ry(p[j],qr[j])
total_amount=eva_amount(data, labels, p)
print(total_amount)
After executing it ...it displays as (I got output at once, when it tries to get backend in loop then displays Gates are blocked...
I need to calculate total_amount till the loop fails..

Hi,
Thanks for posting the code. Still the code is not clear and I cannot repeat the experiment.
We do not use QuantumProgram anymore since qiskit version 0.5. Instead, we can create QuantumCircuits and execute them directly.
I do not see you import Qconfig and register your APItoken to use the remote backends. What is the backend you used in the above?
Here you go:

Hi @amandeep1988 , I'm not sure what you are trying to do from your code, but on the IBM QX devices, we currently lack the ability to use measurement feedback or feed forward. So once there is a measurement in a circuit, you can't implement any further gates. See https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/reference/algorithms/iterative_phase_estimation_algorithm.ipynb for an example of how to work around this restriction.
I think @attp answer is correct @amandeep1988 please reopen if you still have problems.
