The current plan is to write the driver in two stages.
Stage one only includes a straight forward translation of the Loop program into a seqc program which is compiled and uploaded to the AWG. The aim of this stage is to get a driver that "works" without caring about optimizations.
Stage two involves optimizations using the extra capabilities the device offers like run time sample rate variation and user controlled registers. This involves deeper program analysis and should result in code that can be used for the other AWGs as well.
@StefanieMeyer Eugen will start with the first stage immedeatly, because he needs to use the device asap.
