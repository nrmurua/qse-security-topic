It seems that currently one can not select the color of cp (controlled phase) gates when drawing a circuit using matplotlib, and it would be useful to have that capability.
It appears that this can be achieved in one line by adding to qcstyle.py the following
           'cp': (other_color, black_font),
after line 118, that is, by adding the cp gate to the self.dispcol dictionary of the class DefaultStyle.  I suppose for consistency this should also be added to the other style classes as well (BWStyle and IQXStyle).
Thanks very much for considering this improvement!
As of terra 0.16.0 you should be able to do this with something like:
This was highlighted in the release notes: https://qiskit.org/documentation/release_notes.html#release-notes-0-16-0-new-features (it's the 3rd bullet point in that section). Additionally in the upcoming 0.17.0 terra release you can now create custom style sheet json files and use them interchangeably with the default, bw, and iqx styles.
Thanks very much for the reply!  What I mean is, I think that the cp gate was left off the list appearing in qcstyle.py, so its color cannot be changed successfully.  For instance, when I run the following, the color of the h gate changes, but not the cp:
I believe I am using the most up-to-date version of terra, 0.16.4.
