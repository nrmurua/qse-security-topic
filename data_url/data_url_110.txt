We run a python formatting check in the CI with yapf, but it appears that it's not actually being enforced. This can be confirmed by pip install yapf, then pulling down CUDA Quantum main and running yapf cuda-quantum/python/tests/unittests -r -i. For main to be passing the CI, yapf should produce no changes to the code. Instead, it has to reformat multiple files -- indicating the python formatting step isn't throwing an error when it should be.
An error should be thrown in the CI if the python files have not been formatted through yapf.
Not a regression

Hi @anthony-santana,
I believe the style should be enforced, but certain folders, like the tests, are currently excluded for the style check. You can see which files are excluded here. I don't remember why I excluded them; it might be that they can be properly formatted, or it might be that some tests make that difficult.
