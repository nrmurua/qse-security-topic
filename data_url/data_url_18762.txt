In the openpulse waveforms example, a number of extern functions are introduced for various waveforms. In these extern function declarations, not only the argument type appears but also the argument name.
In the extern function calls  documentation, it indicates that only a list of types is supported.
In the provided parser only the latter definition is supported, and e.g. openqasm3.parse("extern f(int) -> int;") succeeds while openqasm3.parse("extern f(int x) -> int") fails.
IMO the addition of the argument names substantially improves the readability and usability of the extern function definitions and should be supported. If it won't be supported, then we should fix the openpulse documentation.
@PhilReinhold can you provide a PR that would model the desired change?
I would support making argument names optional for extern functions.
