I am trying to create a Qobj of type 'super' with a matrix of my choosing. My understanding is that this should work (based on the API doc for the type keyword: str – Type of quantum object: ‘bra’, ‘ket’, ‘oper’, ‘operator-ket’, ‘operator-bra’, or ‘super’.):
However, x gets type 'oper' with input-output dimensions 4:
Am I misunderstanding something, or is this a bug?
Aside: I have this work-around for now:
Hi, sorry for the late response, you need to specify dimensions when you create a super operator.
Try the following code:
I am looking at this right now, and while I agree with @sahmed95, it should also be possible to make the correct dims internally if type='super' and no dims are passed.  This would only be valid for unipartite inputs, but is probably sufficient.  Will do soon.
Thank you for the helpful replies and the quick patch. I agree that defaulting to a unipartite system is what most users would expect.
