In atom_kind_orbitals.F line 1315 the disassociated pointer ap is referenced as in
"sgp_atompot%a_nonlocal(1:n) = ap(1:n)"
This is running any of three test cases:
QS/regtest-kind/H2_upf or H2O_upf or CH2O_upf
I double checked by prepending CPASSERT(ASSOCIATED(ap))
Applying the commit by juerghutter the bad reference disappears.
