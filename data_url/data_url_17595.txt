Since a few days ago, appveyor checks are not being displayed in PRs or master commits - however, the hook seems to be in place and the builds seem to be triggered:
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Qiskit/qiskit-sdk-py/history
Have the appveyor checks show in the github interface again.
@diego-plan9 did you do something to fix this? I'm seeing the results from appveyor being displayed on PRs now.
Not really - I guess the credit will go to AppVeyor's team or a combination of mysterious factors  ðŸ˜¬ ! Thanks for noticing and reporting that the ticks are finally back, which means we can close the issue.
