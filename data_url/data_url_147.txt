There are a couple of queues in the runtime, e.g., BasicExecutionManager::instructionQueue and CircuitSimulatorBase::gateQueue.
Currently, we don't enforce any max queue size mechanism to safeguard these queues. This could lead to memory bloat when the circuit is very deep, especially with CircuitSimulatorBase::gateQueue where we store the gate matrix in the queue.
A contrived example:
That'd result in a large memory footprint although we only use 1 qubit :-)
There might be more practical use cases, e.g., Trotter circuits.
I guess the best way to address this would be to just periodically flush the queue, even if we haven't hit a measure / flush point.
