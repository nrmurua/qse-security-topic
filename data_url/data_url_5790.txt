Currently all the default configurations of AerSimulator are the same.
However, optimal configurations for fusion are different based on its method.
Before 0.8.0, C++ implementation sets different default values for method.
Especially, density matrix simulator uses fusion_threshold=7 and fusion_max_qubit=2 for default values.
Currently, their values are 15 and 5 for all the methods.
