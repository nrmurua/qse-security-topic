Write function that takes in OpenQASM 3 string as argument and returns the int circuit depth.
Similar to qasm_depth() but for qasm3 instead of qasm2, and which does not use any external libraries.
@ryanhill1 , I found that the qasm_depth gives the following error when executed as follows -
I feel some of the assumptions used in qasm_depth aren't correct -
@TheGupta2012 Thank's for pointing this out!
I agree that parsing for q is not the right approach. This accounts for most cases, but like you mentioned, the qubits can be named anything, not necessarily q. So we'll want to adapt the function to get the qubit names and use that in the search.
I think that incrementing the count pertaining to a qubit is the best approach. In the function, before entering the loop to start counting, we exclude any lines that define custom gate definitions (i.e. lines that start with "gate") so that we don't miscount:

But there may be other edge cases where qubit names are mentioned that are not currently excluded. So we can definitely look into that more as well.
@TheGupta2012 Following up on this, I added a new qasm3 depth test that uses an alternate qubit syntax:

It currently fails, so is being skipped. But all OpenQASM 3 generated from Amazon Braket circuits (as of v1.54.1) use this new qubit syntax. So they are a good test case. E.g.
@TheGupta2012 I've updated the qasm_depth() function to account for all edge cases I could find in https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03429, see test cases. The implementation can definitely be improved, but seems to be working. Regardless, the updated qasm_depth function should at least now provide a decent outline for re-implementing qasm3_depth() without qiskit dependency. If you're still interested, I'll leave that one to you!
Thanks @ryanhill1 for the updates! I was working on the contiguous qasm issue and will pick this up now.
