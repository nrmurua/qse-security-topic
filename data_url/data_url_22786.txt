Hi,
I bumped into KEYERROR when trying out the Cirq interface. I think in the Cirq interface section in the README, setdevicegraph needs to be called before setprogram. Otherwise the mapping dictionary is empty and would trigger KEYERROR. I also have a question about the mapping. It seems like the qubits type in the input device graph and the input quantum circuit needs to be the same. Can I input a circuit in Cirq with cirq.devices.LineQubit and a coupling graph with cirq.devices.GridQubit for the solver?
Best,
Sitao
