Running this as a startup kernel on 2.0 (KC705)
results in
extOverride is just a TTL channel, and the value in parens is umsg->type (I've patched that in for debugging).
12 is MESSAGE_TYPE_RPC_BATCH, but the IR doesn't seem to show anything out of the ordinary:
Surely I'm just missing something obvious? Needless to say, setting that TTL worked just fine on 1.x.
The "batch" message type is sent by the attribute_writeback function in ksupport.c, in this case, but I'm not sure why it is unexpected. This seems like a race condition.
It's unexpected because it is not essential. startup_kernels and idle_kernels shouldn't do them or they should be ignored.
Ah, I completely missed the startup kernel part.
@klickverbot This is rather easily fixed, but also should be inconsequential in this case.
Okay, good to know. I stumbled across this while trying to figure out what broke during our upgrade to ARTIQ 2 and why, and wasn't sure whether it is relevant.
Probably it would be easiest to just ignore these for the startup kernel or log a message that writebacks are ignored? It rather unintuitive to see an ERROR in the logs when everything is in fact okay.
Ideally artiq_compile would not emit any typeinfo tables, which would also make the startup kernels smaller, but I'm not sure if any more 2.x releases are planned.
sure.
