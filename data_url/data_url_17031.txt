%qiskit_backend_overview is failing while trying to reach ibmqx4
RequestsApiError: 500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api-qcon.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/Network/ibm-q/Groups/open/Projects/main/devices/ibmqx4/properties?access_token=...&version=1
It seems like a temporary error on the backend side. Is this persisting?
You are right it was temporary. I am closing it. Thanks
