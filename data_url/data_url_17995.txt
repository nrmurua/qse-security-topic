The test test_simulator_online_size checks that a timeout error is triggered for big programs when q_program.execute is run. Currently, the test takes 1 minute to run, because that's the default of _wait_for_job (in qiskit/backends/ibmq/ibmqjob.py). This creates a request every 5 seconds, checking if for the status. This creates a lot of load in the backend and some time waste during testing.
I suggest the fix in #790 .
After talking to @atilag we agreed on removing this test. It is not only unnecessary big, it is also stressing the simulator backend unnecessarily, possibly consuming huge amounts of bandwidth and it is not actually testing Qiskit but the backend. @1ucian0 do you mind to get rid of it? I'm changing the title of this issue to reflect what we are doing.
I totally agree. Let's remove this test.
