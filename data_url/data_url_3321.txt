When running the code in the attached example notebook incorrect circuit renderings result.
Problem 1:
SITUATION: a 2-qubit gate acts on qubits that are not given in increasing order, such as XY(np.pi,2,1)
BUG DESCRIPTION: the gate will connect the wrong gates (see the first code snippet below).
Problem 2:
SITUATION: circuit includes CPHASE
BUG DESCRIPTION: CPHASE is not correctly represented (see the second code snippet below).
Please see the code snippets below.

v4 tag because we need to ensure that this is working ahead of the v4.0.0 release
This is not what this has come to mean. We may in fact target this fix for v3
