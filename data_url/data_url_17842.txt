The circuit_drawers have options that do not make sense to every drawer:
I suggest:
where options is a dict to feed the kwargs of the drawer.
Ideas?
Personally, I really dislike the options dict thing we do in other places. It's opaque to python and then we have to manually enforce the interface we define which is easy to mess up. Also, it means that we don't provide any helpers to people who use IDEs or text editors that introspect the modules to give a dynamic list of options and autocompletion when writing code (personally I use jedi-vim and it's very helpful to get a list of kwargs when calling a function). Also, python kwargs is already a dict and you can literally just do:
circuit_drawer(circuit, output='latex', basis='id...' **options)
and it would work exactly like you want.
I prefer the way @mtreinish gives an in the help we can just list the extra ones by the output type.
Ok, I think we'll just stick with using explicit kwargs then.
