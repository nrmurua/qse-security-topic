The circuit
gives the error
This looks like expected behavior, as the transpiled circuit will be output in terms physical qubits, but it's not entirely clear to me what is the intent of the example code. (What are q and c in the example?)
If you wanted to measure each qubit into the clbit corresponding to its position in the final layout, one option would be to write transpiled_qc.measure(transpiled_qc.qubits, transpiled_qc.clbits).
The q and c are n qubit quantum circuits, respectively.
This is not my own code, but a bug I was helping someone with in an upgrade. So it works on an old version of Qiskit, just not on more recent versions.
I see what you are saying about an error here being expected behaviour. If the circuit has never seen q or c, it shouldn't be expected to know what to do with them. Nevertheless, the error message here is not at all illuminating. Something along to point out that the registers aren't in the circuit would be of more help to anyone upgrading.
Agree, maybe something like "CircuitError: Attempted to add an instruction ('measure') with a qarg ('qr[8]') not found in circuit qubits ('q[0]', 'q[1]', ...)"?
