We have discussed about the definitions of Pauli gates with regard to the overall phase. On our side, we define gates differently:
R_x(t) = [[cos(t / 2), -i sin(t / 2)],[-i sin (t / 2), cos(t / 2)]]
R_y(t) = [[cos(t / 2), -sin(t / 2)],[sin (t / 2), cos(t / 2)]]
R_x(t) = [[e ^ (-i t / 2), 0],[0, e ^ (i t / 2)]]
The reason why we use this convention is as follows:
R_j(t) = exp(-i t / 2 sigma_j) = I - i t / 2 sigma_j - 1 / 2 (t / 2)^2 I + ... (Taylor series)
= cos(t / 2) I - i sin(t / 2) sigma_j
Thus, there is no place for the overall complex phase (although it could be added somewhat artificially). In addition we think that getting this phase represents an extra computation step.
What do you think about it?
I opened a PR that updates our rotation gates to follow the conventions proposed here. If there are no objections with these matrices we can merge that.
Regarding the overall complex phase, I agree that it is better to drop it. The only question of preference is whether we want to have Pi coded inside the gates or given by the user. In the PR I follow exactly Adrian's proposal, so the user has to include Pi when giving theta, eg. RX(np.pi / 2.0).
Hi Stavros, I think Sergi may have some other thought on conventions.
Regarding the Pi or not Pi. I prefer adding Pi everytime, so I have more intuition on the behaviour of the circuit, but that is only my personal opinion.
Lets make a decision. @igres26 do you have strong motivations to include pi?
I don't mind either way as long as it is clearly stated in the documentation.
Then I think the #53 can be merged.
Then I think the #53 can be merged.
Since everyone agrees then yes, please review and merge this if it looks okay. Note that now pi is not included. Also, the CRZ gate was renamed to CZPow and follows a different convention than RZ. Everything is stated in documentation.
