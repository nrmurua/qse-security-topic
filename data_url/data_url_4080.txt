Since every event should be assigned a timestamp before issuing it in QuMA. It is required there is a waiting time before the first operation. Otherwise, the hardware will run into a buggy state and the timing of operations cannot be maintained.
The simplest way to do this is to make the pre_interval value of the first bundle none zero.
In the following example, the first quantum bundle  bs 0 prepz s10 can be changed to bs 1 prepz s10.
Now the first pre-interval is 1, as can be seen below:
