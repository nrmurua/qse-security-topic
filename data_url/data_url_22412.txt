I have created an argument using:
It returns an integer if I don't change the value in the GUI, but it returns a float if I do change the value in the GUI.  This is kind of annoying, since then I have to cast it to an integer e.g. for use in for loops:
I suggest either forcing NumberValue to always return an integer when ndecimals = 0, or creating a new IntegerValue object.
