Used to work in Qiskit v0.34.2, tested to not work in v0.37. Appears to have been broken by commit 3591fa6
We used to be able to circuit.initialize([0,1], qr[0]) but now that raises an error TypeError: 'Qubit' object is not iterable
Changing to circuit.initialize([0,1], [qr[0]]) works as the qubits parameter is now a list. Prior to commit 3591fa6 the QuantumCircuit._bit_argument_conversion() function was called on the passed in qubits param. Should that still be called?
Unless there is a need to not convert single Qubit into a list automatically, I would have expected the circuit.initialize([0,1], qr[0]) to work.
It appears QuantumCircuit._bit_argument_conversion() still exists. Maybe adding the qubits = self._bit_argument_conversion(qubits, self.qubits) call back to initialize() will restore the expected functionality?
I've created a pull request that fixes this issue, please let me know if this works and if something else should be done.
Should this be in qiskit-terra 0.21.2 and Qiskit 0.37.2? By the commit dates and release dates I thought it might be, but it isn't in the release notes and I still see the error. I'm guessing I should wait for the next release?
It's not in 0.21.2 because we didn't backport it (commits have to be specially chosen to go into patch releases).  We usually try to be quite conservative with changes in backport releases - I don't remember the exact reason I didn't add it to the backport batch, but it might be because the original form of the PR before the review made fairly wide-reaching changes to helper methods of QuantumCircuit.append, and there was a very simple workaround.  (It could also just be that I forgot to do it...)
It'll get released for sure in 0.22.0, which is scheduled for early October.
That makes sense. We can wait for the October release. Thank you!
