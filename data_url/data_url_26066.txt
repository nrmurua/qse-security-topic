Currently, transpiling a qiskit RXX, RYY, or RZZ gate to cirq or braket defaults to the corresponding unitary because cirq and braket don't have explicit support for these gates. However, cirq and braket each have some flavor of XX, YY, ZZ gates, which can be used to construct equivalent rotations. Carefully paying attention to the matrix representations across gates in each package, find decompositions of the above qiskit gates using built-in gates from cirq and braket, and add RXX/RYY/RZZ support to cirq/utils.py and braket/utils.py. Once complete, update the transpiler documentation with your solution.
Bonus: Build support going the other direction as well. In other words, when transpiling a cirq or braket XX/YY/ZZ gate, how can built-in qiskit rotation gates be used to create an equivalent representation?
