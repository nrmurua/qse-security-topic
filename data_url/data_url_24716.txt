The first cell of the Detailed Sequencing Walkthrough notebook already uses some deprecated (?) features. This seems mostly centered around LoopPulseTemplate. Moreover, importing SoftwareCondition works only as
The same goes for Example 98 (also out of date in declaring measurements as far as I can see).
All 9* examples do not work or are outdated and are therefore not in the documentation(doc\source\examples\examples.rst). I kept them in the repository so one does not have to dig through old commits to find them.
It would be nice if you could make them work.
Examples starting with 9* now either have a more up-to-date counterpart in the non-9* examples or are there to document outdated features. "Fixing" them or trying to "make them work" therefore does not really make sense. I propose keeping them for reference purposes but leave them unchanged.
