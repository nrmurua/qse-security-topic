The weight of a Pauli operator is a useful quantity, and should be accessible is a method to PauliTerm objects.  Currently there is no method to directly access this quantity.
What do you mean exactly?
For some applications (e.g., calibration of readout imperfections), it is useful to count the number of non-identity factors in a Pauli operators -- this is often referred to as the weight of the Pauli operator.
For example the weight of XIIYYZ is 4, while the weights of ZZIIIII is 2, etc.
Ok, that sounds like a reasonable request. Can you provide a reference where they call it "weight" though? That seems like an incredibly unintuitive name for what you described.
