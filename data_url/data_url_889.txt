The AQT service hosted at gateway-portal.aqt.eu has been deactivated and is replaced with a new solution by AQT. Usage of the current version of the cirq-aqt module is therefore no longer possible! Accordingly, the documentation at https://quantumai.google/cirq/hardware#aqt-hardware is outdated.
The new service offers improved access to AQT's quantum computers and can be used through the API described at https://arnica.aqt.eu/api/v1/docs.
The qiskit-aqt-provider may help as a reference for adapting cirq-aqt module to make use of the new API.
Adding AQT owners.  Can you help maintain this integration please?

@dstrain115: thanks for assigning @pschindler and @ma5x, but they are probably not the right persons to take care of this. We from AQT can help maintain this integration but it would be beneficial if the process is driven by the Cirq team. At the moment I am not able to tell when and who will be able to invest some effort into this, but we can assign the issue to me in the mean-time and preferably to someone suitable on your end.
Hi @fg-aqt.  Thanks for the update.  We can definitely help with this integration, but we would strongly prefer that someone from the AQT drive the process.  Fixing the integration after a breaking change in the AQT API definitely qualifies as maintaining the service.  AQT folks are going to be more familiar with the changes that happen and will have more access to credentials to test the service.  This is really something that has to be driven by the AQT team.
If there is anything we can do to make the code contribution process easier or any questions about .  We also have a bi-weekly cirq cync that we would encourage someone to join that meeting.
Hi @dstrain115, sure. We're just finalising a fix internally and will submit a pull request shortly. You can happily assign this issue to me in the meantime.
