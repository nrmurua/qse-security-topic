Run find tcirc. We can see 3 lines: tcirc = transpile(circ, simulator)
tcirc is never used.
No unused variables.
Probably on the next line the simulator should run the transpiled circuit:
result = simulator.run(tcirc).result()
Yeah @iuliazidaru I think it is a small typo of not using tcirc It haven't  showed any error because circ is already defined and have not any problem with the code.  Thanks for Pointing out. I am now making PR for this
