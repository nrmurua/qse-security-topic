If the test backends are correctly formed, then the configuration files for faulty backends do not update the number of active qubits.  This leads to inconsistencies where the users sees ,e.g. 5, qubits but the coupling map supports (at most) 2.
Returns 5 but then errors with the messages:
TranspilerError: 'Number of qubits (5) in circuit-2 is greater than maximum (2) in the coupling_map'
The user has no way to know this ahead of time.
I would expect the numbering to be constant.
