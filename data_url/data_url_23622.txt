The following code (where ix is an AMI430 driver):
ix.ramp_rate(0.001)
produces an error:
TypeError: ("'str' object is not callable", 'setting ix_ramp_rate to 0.001')
In instrument_drivers/american_magnetics/AMI430.py line 367, change:
raise ValueError(f"{rate} {self.ramp_rate.unit()} "
to:
raise ValueError(f"{rate} {self.ramp_rate.unit} "
Thanks for pointing that out, I agree that it seems to be the correct fix.
