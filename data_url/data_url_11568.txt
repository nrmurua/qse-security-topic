Printing an instance of a CircuitOp mutates the underlying QuantumCircuit object.
Now print the "primitive", that is, the QuantumCircuit, then the CircuitOp. Printing the ``QuantumCircuit` again shows it has been mutated.
The problem is due to the following line.

The call to the reduce method should be removed, or else a copy of the primitive should be made before printing.

(I am unable to test with Terra master branch, because of a new bug or incompatibility.)
I am not sure why reduce in circuit_op does not return a reduced copy (like other operators) but rather self modifies which seems against the philosophy of opflow. Indeed the comment there on reduce even notes its doing this with a warning.
Either which way it would seem for most users that printing something different (a reduced version) instead of exactly what is there is misleading. Maybe it was done so that when things were done on command line etc the circuits looked better without identity gates etc - if so that really would seem to me not enough of a good reason to be breaking to the philosophy.
