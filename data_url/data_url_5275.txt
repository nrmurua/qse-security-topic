Currently, the Mac OS X build on Travis.CI is allowed to fail because the execution of the examples scripts after the build steps fail with error messages similar to this:
$ python3 examples/BV_algorithm_constant_mpi.py
/Users/travis/.travis/functions: line 104:
89579 Illegal instruction: 4  python3 examples/BV_algorithm_constant_mpi.py
The command "python3 examples/BV_algorithm_constant_mpi.py" exited with 132.
According to a quick search of the web, the 132 error code is linked to failing to failing to import a Python module.
This is supported by the fact that the examples that do not import the hiq module do not fail. As far as I can tell from the logs, the installation of the hiq module seems successful. I also cannot seem to reproduce this issue on my own machine (MacBook Pro with Mac OS X 10.14.5).
NB: This was first introduced in PR #6.
Fixed in upcoming Travis CI configuration.
