We need to improve the way we generate measurement samples with the ITensor MPS visitor.
We need to hook this into the AcceleratorBuffer.getMeasurementStrings or just getMeasurements. Basically we should add the bit string to the existing boost::dynamic_bitset<>
Mengsu's fork implements this, need to merge it in.
