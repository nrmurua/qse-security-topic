At least not JSON-serializable.
This is a high priority request for cirq.google workflow tools. It's important to be able to save a record of the device you ran on when performing an experiment.
Making this serializable will require getting rid of the lambdas that come in via _GateDefinition.can_serialize_predicate.
We should also migrate away from using _GateDefinition for gate containment checks and use the new cirq.GateFamily and cirq.Gateset framework, which is now serializable.
I see no reason not to accept this item - having such a contradiction of class name and behavior is very silly.
We can probably deprecate this class after the new device spec goes in.
This class has been deprecated and is now defunct.
