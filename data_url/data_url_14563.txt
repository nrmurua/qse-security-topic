Raises an error when using measurement error mitigation for ground state energy calculation of LiH:
Run below minimal example (adjusted from the example code in the qiskit-nature README.md).
When changing the molecule definition from LiH back to H2, everything runs fine.
Automatically choosing the same qubits for measurement error mitigation run and production run in order to get the ground state energy output.
Share the list of used qubits between VQE solver and measurement_error_mitigation fitter.
Or give the user some kind of (documented) interface to pass the list of used qubits.
Note: Usually I use the BOPESSampler for calculations, i.e. the basic circuits and their mapping aren't easily available to pass to the mitigation code by hand. So, some automated way would be preferable.
It seems the measurement error mitigation code is part of qiskit ignis, but I don't know where in the code with all the qiskit-nature stuff the adjustments must be made. So, I'd be thankful if you moved it to qiskit ignis if you think it belongs there.
I just found a similar(/the same?) issue at qiskit-terra/issues/5730.
So, should this issue be closed here in favor of the one in qiskit-terra?
I just verified that this issue still occurs with the CompleteMeasFitter class being migrated to Terra:
qiskit.utils.mitigation.CompleteMeasFitter.
I will attempt to transfer this issue to Terra because this is not Nature-related.
EDIT: I do not have the permissions for such a transfer. @woodsp-ibm @manoelmarques @dlasecki can anyone of you do that?
moved from qiskit-nature as per @mrossinek request.
