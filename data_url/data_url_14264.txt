We have a pulse_optimize flag on 2-qubit unitary synthesis which is able to reduce the number of single-qubit pulses by quite a bit when the basis is CNOT (i.e. it uses virtual Z more and physical SX pulses less).
This falls short on 2-qubit cliffords however where there are often a lot of opportunities to remove non-virtual single-qubit gates but this does not get discovered. One example:


In fact it turns out that Qiskit's 2Q random_clifford are decomposed on average using 4.5 pulses whereas optimally they should be around 2.5 pulses (in the CX basis).
