should allow the widget to get squeezed vertically
e.g. at the expense of expected signals widget
also: lockbox widget - as a free window - is always in front of scope or pyrpl widget. this makes it nearly impossible to use pyrpl on a single screen with simultaneous scope diagnostics during lock tuning (e.g. with remote desktop).
I added a button to show/hide the signals of the lockbox (similar to iq drawing).
The only problem is that since I don't save the info about the visibility anywhere (I don't dare to put it in the module section, and it is cumbersome to store it in the "pyrpl" section), I just hide it by default to make sure the window is not oversized at startup---> This is not very intuitive for new users...
done by adding sliders, too
