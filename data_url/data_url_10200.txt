What
Currently there's no endpoint to query in order to know how much time is remaining for a particular account. If there is an internal endpoint that already exists, would it be possible to gain access to it. Otherwise it would be great if an endpoint like that could be implemented.
Why
We're currently working on an app that lets you play games against the QPU but we don't want every user to create a separate account and get their own api token. We have our own account with monthly 10 minutes of access and are planning on implementing our own system where we distribute tickets to each user that get consumed when they run a problem against the QPU. In order for our backend to figure out how to distribute these tickets we would like to know how many minutes are remaining so that it can adjust how the tickets are distributed weekly/monthly.
Knowing how many minutes are left might be useful for our own api service in terms of how we hand out tickets to users.
