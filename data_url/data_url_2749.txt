The function two_qubit_matrix_to_native_gates cannot be called/is not defined even though there is documentation for it. The related single_qubit_matrix_to_native_gates can indeed be called.
Thank you, this is a good catch. We didn't update the documentation when we moved this class out of cirq.google and into just cirq.
I see. The function has also been renamed to two_qubit_matrix_to_operations.
This shouldn't be closed until the doc is fixed.
Oops sorry!
