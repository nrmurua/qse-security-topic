Hello all,
I am trying to build CP2K using the default toolchain script and it gives an error at the point of spfft installation. I am not able to trace the source of the error. Any help on how to address this is greatly appreciated. I am using version 6.1.
Thanks,
Anne

Are you sure about the version? AFAIK SpFFT was added in v7.1.
To get more details about the build failure, please take a look at *.log files found in build/SpFFT-0.9.8/build-cpu/. If unsure, generate an archive of the builds logs using
and attach them to this issue.
Hi,
my best bet is that their is a problem with the environment. Could you give the output of the command  export in a shell. Also,
I also think you are compiling cp2k 7.1 not 6.1.
I have the same issue with 7.1, attached is my logs.as @dev-zero  requested
logs.tar.gz.
Unfortunately the logs are missing. We only have the setup files.

Apologies! I have edited my original comment with an update logs.tar.gz file.
it is a problem of compiler. you are using a version of gcc that does not fully support c++11. the problem is here
The CXX compiler identification is GNU 4.8.5
Are you compiling gcc yourself with the toolchain or rely on the gcc installed on your machine. If it is the later then update your compiler (or load the relevant module), if it is the former then I have to adjust the scripts accordingly.

It is the latter, I loaded an updated GCC and it has worked now! Thanks for your help.
That's good.
Any compiler not supporting c++11 at least will fail to compile SIRIUS or spfft.
