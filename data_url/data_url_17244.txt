The pulse module currently uses np.complex128 for SamplePulses. This resolution is excessive for modern AWG resolution and np.complex64 would be better suited.
Thoughts @ewinston and @dcmckayibm?
When it gets converted to list of list for qobj, it is going to be two doubles anyway since that is the precision of python floats.
Actually I guess you could if you wrote out the int32 dtypes directly to the json.
That is a good point. Python+JSON makes this difficult.
Closing following @nonhermitian's comment on Python floating point precision.  If we move away to a structured data description format in the future with stricter typing we should reconsider.
