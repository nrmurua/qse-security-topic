Scheduler and mapper both use ddg.
Ddg is an example of common functionality.
Passes can be given options, common functionality not.
Ddg has options to support commutativity etc.
How do we represent those?
One way is to make them pass options of the passes using the common functionality and passing those options upon construction in decoded form to the common functionality.
