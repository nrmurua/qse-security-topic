Besides the protocols based on SCPI and DLL, there is a large group of devices in the industrial process control field that take Modbus TCP as their primary communication protocol.
I'd like to know if there is any best practice that could adapt the Modbus TCP driver, e.g. https://github.com/riptideio/pymodbus, into Qcodes framework?
Speaking on behalf of the core dev team, this is not something that is very high on our agenda. It simply doesn't come up in our day-to-day life. But if someone from the user community is up for contributing some solution, we can definitely have conversations about it.
