Docs are failing on read the docs for both the latest release and stable release, v. 011. A look at the build logs says that they were killed by RTD due to excessive time to build, 926 seconds.
This needs more details to be made actionable. Do you know why RTD sometimes times out?
The title is now updated. The latest failing build log can be found here: https://readthedocs.org/projects/mitiq/builds/15173588/
It cites Command killed due to excessive memory consumption and the last file listed in the log not labeled as a successful build is Executing: /home/docs/checkouts/readthedocs.org/user_builds/mitiq/checkouts/stable/docs/source/guide/guide-observables.myst 
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
