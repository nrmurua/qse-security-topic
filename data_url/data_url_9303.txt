#607 is missing a compat bound for SimpleNonlinearSolve because this package is expecting old SciMLBase=1 to be compatible but it is not, it requires SciMLBase=2 in latest version.
But this is not a direct dependency of the package? is there any reason why the compatibility is not handled downstream?
because they didn't specify the upper bound of that minor version in a new patch, which makes sense as a human being but it is why it's not working
I think this patch version is yanked FYI
