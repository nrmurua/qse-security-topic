The convert method of the gradients takes a params argument specifying for which parameters the gradient should be computed. The error messages and supported input types of that argument vary between Gradient, NaturalGradient, QFI etc. For instance, Gradient.convert supports ParameterVectors but for the others the parameter vector must explicitly be unpacked in a list.
Also the error messages if the argument is missing can be improved. E.g. not passing the argument for the QFI merely raises
Hi @Cryoris, can I take this?
Maybe params should not be Optional in convert, if the error is raised for None.
I agree it probably shouldn't, feel free to work on this! Make sure that you make the changes to Terra though, the operators are in qiskit.opflow ðŸ™‚
I think we wanted to add a default behavior that all parameters are used but that requires that they are sorted, which we don't have at the moment. So for now let's just make it not optional.
