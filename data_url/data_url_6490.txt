Cirq v0.15.0 has been released and it seems to be incompatible with the current qsim version (0.12.1).
Is there a plan to release a new qsim version soon?
Yes, qsim v0.13.0 is slated for release as soon as blocking issues with the macOS build are resolved (link).
Thanks for the information!
qsimcirq 0.13.0 has been released, and should be compatible with Cirq 0.15.0.
