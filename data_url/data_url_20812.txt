I've been having some weird crashes while using my pqcrypto_mceliece crate when it's doing the larger mceliece sizes. Doing release builds instead of debug builds appears to help.... it's weird. Can't reproduce it in pqclean either....
Might be due to the asm code...
Nope, it's also happening in the vec code...
It appears to have been caused by the default stack limit. PQClean's test framework is on the stack now, and in the past it's probably been the compiler that figured out "oh, it's so big, let's start with a larger stack".
So this is just inherent to the McEliece code.
Solution:
