Update (Jan 22, 2019): I was thinking of possible applications of single and nested loops in quantum languages. Implementing the Trotter approximation and the algorithm commonly referred to as QAOA, with a single loop are 2 obvious applications. Implementing the Trotter-Suzuki approximation would require not just one loop, but several nested loops. Last night, I wrote a simple jupyter notebook investigating further the implementation of Trotter-Suzuki with nested loops. Here it is

Forgot to mention, Grover's algorithm can also be implemented with a single loop
