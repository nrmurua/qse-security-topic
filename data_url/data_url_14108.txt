When choosing a low values for qubit_readout_error in a ConfigurableFakeBackend a Noise_Error will be thrown inconsistency. This does not happen with higher readout error values >10%.
This also seems not to be happening when the errors are defined with a list qubit_readout_error=[0.001, 0.002, 0.0001]
Throws
NoiseError: 'Invalid probabilities: [1.0060265594601663, -0.006026559460166213] contains a negative probability.'  ~70 % of the time
In qiskit-aer 0.13.0 additonally the description error from qiskit-aer/issues/1987 is thrown.
As long as a valid probability is provided, no negative probability should be returned.
No response
Regarding the NoiseError:  In ConfigurableFakeBackend when qubit_readout_error is provided as a float then qubit_readout_error is used as the mean of a Guassian (normal) distribution to generate a list of nqubit readout error values.  The default value of the standard deviation, std, for the Gaussian is std=0.01.  So the probability of sampling a negative value from this distribution is significant which results in the NoiseError since the readout_error must be >= 0
configurableFBE = ConfigurableFakeBackend('test', 3, qubit_readout_error=[0.004,0.004,0.004])
configurableFBE = ConfigurableFakeBackend('test', 3, qubit_readout_error=0.004, std=0.001)
