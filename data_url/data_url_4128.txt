Is perceval package capable of sampling input state defined as a StateVector object? I want to sample an input state like $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|1,0&gt;+|0,1&gt;)$, so I type the code:
However, it reports:
NotImplementedError: Could not find signature for with_input: <StateVector>
It seems that I can only input a BasisState object for sampling tasks, and I don't know how to get probability amplitudes and make superposition of them (there is only sampler.probs() which is not correct for superposition).

Hello - this is indeed a missing interface, and we will add it up - but you can workaround this way:
Thanks for replying, the SVDistribution method works!
