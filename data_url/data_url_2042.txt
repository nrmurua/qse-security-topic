Go through existing open source packages for quantum information science in python and see whether we can partner with one.
Context: #2763. See that issue for some basic info about qiskit and qutip.
If we don't find one that easily interoperates with cirq, we will instead implement some basic functionality in cirq.
I think we have decided to roll our own?  In my own investigation I preferred qutip.
Yeah, I prefer the rolling on own so we don't add another dependency.
