When Quirk is running in a context where history modification violates the same-origin policy (e.g. when running locally from a file:// uri), it shows the error box every time the circuit is modified due to an exception being thrown when touching the history. Instead, it should fall back to a 'current circuit' link.
Fixed by falling back to location.hash
