The portfolio optimization code at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-iqx-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/advanced/aqua/finance/optimization/portfolio_optimization.ipynb works with the dummy data, as provided, but not with the Quandl-accessing code on https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-iqx-tutorials/blob/63f6d52747716d90c8f43eb16d110bcdd39dda05/qiskit/advanced/aqua/finance/data_providers/time_series.ipynb. I am using a valid Quandl key and Quandl has replied that they do not directly support Qiskit.
Swap out the RandomDataProvider code with either the WikipediaDataProvider (which is no longer supported by Quandl) or ExchangeDataProvider code. I am using a Quandl-provided key and stocks = ["WDAY", "ILMN", "ORLY", "FOXA", "NFLX", "AAPL", "MSFT", "AMZN", "FB", "GOOG", "SBUX", "AMD", "NVDA", "AMAT", "MKTX", "STX"]. Side note: there is no error message for trying to use a ticker that doesn't exist; it states that your Quandl key is invalid until you troubleshoot your ticker list.
I expect the results to look the same as using RandomDataProvider but with real stocks and real market data.
I think the data coming from Quandl simply doesn't match with what Qiskit is expecting. Either all 3 work -- ExactEigensolver, VQE, QAOA -- or none of them do. Plus, WikipediaDataProvider should be removed as it is not supported by Quandl and it is not being updated with new data.
@jmarecek Can you handle this issue along with Stefan
Hi, I also am having problems with the Wikipedia data provider my quandl token is not being accepted and was wondering if it was possible to use pandas data reader to pull yahoo finance data since they have no restrictions on how much data you can pull and doesn't require a token for usage. Thanks for all your recent contributions by the way.
