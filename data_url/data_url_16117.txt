I am going to design a quantum circuit which includes single, two and three controlled y rotations. Sometimes control is on qubit 1 sometimes on qubit 0.
I know that i can define with matrix block method in python. But when the number of qubits are high it is quite hard to write matrices. How can i design single, two and three,... controlled y rotations?
There are two convenient ways to do it, the first is to use the RYGate from Qiskit, which has a control method to create controlled versions of itself. Then you just need to append it to a circuit. The first qubits are the controls and the last one is the target, so if you want 3 controls and 1 target you can do the following:
The second method is to use the mcry method of the circuit. This method is a little outdated and still requires you to deal with QuantumRegisters, we don't use it a lot anymore. Note that the circuit is shown in more fundamental gates, but it implements the same as above ðŸ™‚
thanks a lot.
Sure no problem! ðŸ™‚
