Would the use of plotly to make the 3d plots better looking and reactive? I'm no expert but it seems very nice especially for 3D visualization in the browser that got integration with Jupyter notebooks (Another app that natively runs in the browser is Bokeh, but that may be more oriented toward data science visualization, while plotly seems more general).  It also seems that plotly surpassed mayavi in recent times, with more users, features and more actively developed. This could be relevant for notebooks especially when on My Binder, etc.
I haven't tried, but Plotly seems nice. On top of Plotly's interactive features, it would be cool to have users hold and grad the qubit state across the Bloch sphere. Plotly's dragmode(https://plotly.com/python/reference/#layout-dragmode) might come in handy here
@araza6, this looks interesting.
Do you want to take ownership of this issue and be assigned to it, for completion over the Summer?
It is not high priority (that's the project), but it merges well with autodiff visualizations. I am happy to chip in and contribute too.
This could be structured as follows:
Sure, I can.
For autodiff visualizations, however, can you think of something that we can do better with plotly?
Note that I have been working on some stuff, e.g. here https://nonhermitian.github.io/kaleidoscope/tutorials/interactive/bloch_sphere.html
Currently requires Qiskit, but for the interactive plots this is not true.  I just haven't had time to redo the requirements and travis builds yet.
I've rewritten some of the plots in qutip-doc using plotly.

@0kd very cool!
I'd like to contribute here! How may I get started?
