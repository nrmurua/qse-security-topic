The word "parametric" is overloaded in our documentation, and causes confusion. Here are the three different things it means (as far as I am aware):
This is undoubtedly confusing and could use some work.

P.S. In 2018 we published a paper about our "parametrically"-activated CZ gate, which is itself not a parameterized gate (although it is a special case of the parameterized gate CPHASE). ðŸ˜›
Do you mean to say something like DECLARE theta REAL[1] rather than DECLARE ro BIT ?
@jlapeyre either counts as a declared memory reference, but you are right that we typically think of something like DECLARE theta REAL as an argument to parameterized gates rather than DECLARE ro BIT
