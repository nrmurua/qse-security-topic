Let's resurrect @kessler-frost's  asyncio approach but while also supporting synchronous executors. Some immediate beneficiaries include:
From discussion with @venkatBala , there is a question of where to run the event loop. Each workflow is currently managed by its own thread from the WorkflowsPool. The linked PR runs an event loop in each workflow-level thread to dispatch all the tasks from that workflow. Would it be better to instead use a single event loop to manage all the tasks from all workflows?
Would it be better to instead use a single event loop to manage all the tasks from all workflows?
I don't think so because if one of the workflows is really time consuming then other workflows will also be affected by it. Furthermore, I think we should eventually move towards the new-threadpool-per-workflow and new-proc-per-workflow approach to maintain independence.
Edit: After discussion we've decided to eventually go with the single event loop path.
