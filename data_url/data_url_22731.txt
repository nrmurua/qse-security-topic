Ideally we need three sets of FPGA binaries (bitstream/BIOS/runtime): KC705+QC1, KC705+QC2, Pipistrello+QC1. A solution may be to build and package each set separately. If this is excessively complicated, maybe we can stop packaging for Pipistrello for now.
We should not abandon Pipistrello builds. Support of this low cost board is a great way of marketing ARTIQ to groups that want to give it a try.
After some tests, it looks like the entire build can last up to 120 minutes ( https://travis-ci.org/fallen/travis-test/builds/76436045 ) so I think we can add KC705+QC2 without exceeding that time.
Is there (and will there be) any difference in bios and/or runtime from QC1 builds to QC2 builds?
BIOS no difference, runtime there is a difference.
If someone can test with KC705 QC1/QC2 when this build has finished https://travis-ci.org/m-labs/artiq/builds/76490192
To see if artiq_flash.sh -c nist_qc1 and artiq_flash.sh -c nist_qc2 are working correctly or not.
In FMC terminology, "carrier board" is the KC705.
Ah yes, sorry about that, fixed, thanks!
According to Joe's test, they are not working correctly. Runtime is not flashed:
Remember that it should also be usable as artiq_flash.sh -d . -r to flash runtime.bin from the current directory (e.g. when doing runtime development)
It should work now, @jboulder can you test again please?
I'm closing this, please reopen if there is any issue.
Raghu has been testing the AD9914 using nist_qc2 configuration. The bit
file programming appears to be working correctly.
