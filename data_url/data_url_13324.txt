Implement the get_slack_matrix_from_circuit_mask() and get_slack_matrix() function described in the RFC for dynamical decoupling.
They are necessary to determine the size of slack windows (holes with idling qubits) in a circuit, in order to fill them with ddd sequences.
An implementation skeleton with pseudo-code is present in the RFC but, of course,  a different approach can be used.
