It looks like this code is intended to make qdarkstyle optional by catching the import error exception, but then it calls qdarkstyle.load_stylesheet() any way:

Maybe @dwang429  or @grace-harper-ibm  can handle this? just default stylesheet. Actually, I think the default should now be the custom one i wrote based on qdarkstyle.
qdarkstyle is a dependency which now is within environment.yml.
We an close this.
