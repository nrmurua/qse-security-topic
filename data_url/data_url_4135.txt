I was excited to install and use it, but it failed at the pip install stage.
pip install pip install perceval-quandela I got a message containing:
I assume that cmake is needed. Which version to use?
Hello, yes you do need Cmake that you can simply install with brew on macOS (https://brew.sh) - it should work with version 3.4. Current default version installed by brew is 3.22.
Let us know if you have other installation problems !
@stared did you manage to install perceval ?
we'll be releasing binary wheels for Apple M1 soon
@jsenellart @mario-valdivia Yes, I installed it successfully, and it works!
