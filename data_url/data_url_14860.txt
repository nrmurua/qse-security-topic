schedule() command fails when the circuit includes 'measure' with the error message
The command works when specifying the default instruction map
schedule(qc, backend, backend.defaults().instruction_schedule_map, meas_map=backend.configuration().meas_map ) 
default instruction and default measure maps should be defaultly taken into account without having to explicitly specify it in the schedule() command

@patdenim ,
I am unable to reproduce the error as shown by you.
This is what I am getting instead!
Could you please confirm if you are getting the same, I would like to work on this issue :)
I have checked it, the same is the problem with qiskit verison 0.44.2 with qiskit-terra version 0.25.2.

@fvarchon , am I allowed to work on this issue?
@MozammilQ Yes for sure :)
@fvarchon , sir, please see if my efforts a good enough :), please let me know if any additional changes are required :)
Thanks @MozammilQ, you've got the point !! fails only when backends are V1.
@to24toro, @nkanazawa1989: was this fully closed by #10988 or is there more to do?
@jakelishman
I think we can close this issue.
