In preparation for the 0.6 release, some housekeeping items:
These are non-blocking for the release, but nice to have.
Per the comment before, assigning to 0.6 milestone, low priority.
I've checked the PR for the warnings in tests and all are closed. I've marked the subtask as done but Ali, do you mind to double-check?
Actually, we have a couple of  methods in the wrapper (local_backends and remote_backends) that are marked for deprecation. Can we check if this is a good time to fully remove them?
@delapuente yes looks good.
@diego-plan9 yes good time to remove those too. I'll do those in a PR i'm submitting.
Closing as this is basically done from the Qiskit side, now we have to wait for the API to update. Then we can go in and remove all the FIXMEs in ibmqbackend.py.
