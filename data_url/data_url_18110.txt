Implement the QObj in qiskit-core as the format used for communication with the backends. Please note that for the full implementation to be completed, we need changes outside the core (online backends, api, etc).
#676 For polishing efforts.
#413: previous issue with 0.5 planning
#283: discussion of qobj interface
#415: WIP for the QObj class - will be reissued with a simpler version
@diego-plan9: seems like the "proposed implementation" section of this belongs to another issue and is included here by mistake.

Yes, thanks üòÅ
Updated the issue with two new sub-taks (#664 , #663 ).
is this done for 0.6 @delapuente and @diego-plan9
I think so - the only remaining item is already in its own issue ( #649) and it's basically for tracking (and after 0.6), so it makes sense to close this one. Thanks everyone for the big effort on introducing Qobj, it has been quite an accomplishment for the whole team üéâ
