Header-only libraries should install headers into include/.
Also it's best to install many headers into a dedicated directory under include/, for example include/qpp.
@yurivict It should. When I do
cmake .. && sudo make install
I end up with the library installed in /usr/local/include/qpp (under Linux/BSD/OS X), and C:\Program Files (x86)\qpp under Windows.
It was added after the last release.
Thanks!
