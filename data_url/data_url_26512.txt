At the beginning of compiling cp2k v9.1 (gcc: 9.3.0/system: CentOS7), I come across testing slowly, finally it has been solved by make -j1 ARCH=local VERSION="psmp" test TESTOPTS+="--maxtasks 4" #2074 without warning: jobserver unavailable, and all tests pass.
But I found three tests are skipped (TMC/regtest_ana_on_the_fly, QS/regtest-rma and QS/regtest-rma-3D) like Skipping QS/regtest-rma-3D because its requirements are not satisfied, so I add TESTOPTS+="--mpiranks 4" and --mpiranks 8 (as make -j1 ARCH=local VERSION="psmp" test TESTOPTS+="--mpiranks 4 --maxtasks 8 --restrictdir QS/regtest-rma") to test QS/regtest-rma and QS/regtest-rma-3D. Then two both FAILED (TMC/regtest_ana_on_the_fly passed).
There are reports:
I wonder why it goes wrong.
Very likely the problem is on the OpenMPI side (we found several issues in the path with RMA and OpenMPI). However, those are functionalities which are not enabled by default, so you don't need to worry about them.
Thanks a lot.
