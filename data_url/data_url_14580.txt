Terra has unit tests that have a mostly flat structure. It prevents from running a bunch of file tests (and only them) at once if they belong to a package not represented in tests hierarchy. The enhancement is to mirror the structure of packages from the source code in unit tests.
I think this makes some sense and could also be useful as the package grows. However, in cases where the test subset may not match the source code hierarchy one may be able to use unittests' wildcard option.
