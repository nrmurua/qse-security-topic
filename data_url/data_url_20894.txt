We might want to make sure that all input byte arrays (keys, ciphertext, message
etc.) are not aligned to catch if code makes any kind of assumptions about data
alignment. Could simply align one byte more and OR address with 1.
Not sure I understand.  Would we artificially add a single byte prefix to each input? Or would we change the function API so that the first input is a dummy uint8_t?  Either of these seem like they would yield code that isn't a true implementation of the algorithm.
If we changed the canary in functest.c to have odd length, would that suffice?
