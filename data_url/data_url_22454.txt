I get a RTIO sequence error with the following code,
But if I do them one by one with a delay between them it's fine. Should one be able to initialise multiple dds' simultaneously?
It's not currently possible to initialize DDSes within a batch.
Why not? It seems like if you can write frequency tuning words to it simultaneously you should be able to write the bits to get it running as well.
I cannot see any reason for doing that other than "it can be done".
