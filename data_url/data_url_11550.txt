Part of the circuit factory deprecation
Deprecate the circuit factory uncertainty models in favor of the circuit library objects, introduced in Qiskit/qiskit#5068.
The variational distributions can be replaced by parameterized circuits and the finance specific distribution (the gaussian conditional independence model) is moved to finance/applications.
