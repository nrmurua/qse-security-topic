So I carefully read and applied the pdf, and got the node runnig in gentoo.
What bothers me, is that at the end of the pdf it is written to contact to get fake money.  Is this wallet still a testnet wallet, or can I safely transfer some "real" quantas out of an exchange, and into that wallet?
So this would confirm that I should not transfer my QRL coins from bittrex to the address I see in the wallet from this git
Thanks a lot for rapid and precise answer ;)
