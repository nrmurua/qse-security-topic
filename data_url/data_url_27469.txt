Just going to tack this on here, maybe we should rename the SIM GUI because we might not always use SIM voltage sources. In fact I'm not using it right now.
I suggest Voltage Source GUI, or more succinctly VDC GUI.
Yeah, DC GUI is good. I was just sticking to TLAs (Three letter acronym).
@maij is this resolved now with your changes?
Yes!
