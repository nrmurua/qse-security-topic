The kernel-host attribute synchronisation behaviour is not apparent to new users from reading the documentation.
The code below is intended to demonstrate the current behaviour:
This prints:
I've been aware of this behaviour for some time. However, I can't quite decide if it is intended behaviour or a bug. It also raises the question of why kernel_invariants need to be explicitly specified (given that attribute changes outside the compiler are not synchronised to the core device).
Attribute writeback happens only when the kernel terminates, not before/after RPCs.
I haven't looked at the docs for this in a long time, maybe they could be improved.
kernel_invariants is for modifications done by the kernel, where assuming values to be constant enables compiler optimisations. (Currently, this isn't taken advantage of nearly as well as it could.)
