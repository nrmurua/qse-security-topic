`pathfinder' sometimes breaks if starting point inside multiple bounding boxes (eg. a qubit which has multiple cpw routes already running to it).
Using pathfinder() with the start location inside of multiple bounding boxes. Can avoid issue by including jogs which makes the start of pathfinding be outside of said bounding boxes.
The routing would find a route.
Likely due to pathfinding using the bounding box, which takes the extreme coordinates of a component, such that a cpw could have a very large bounding box, but be mostly empty space. Alternative approach to the bounding box for routing could work.
