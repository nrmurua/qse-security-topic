In Zero noise extrapolation on logical qubits by scaling the error correction code distance, we use show how ZNE can be used to reduce the effective logical error rate, even at circuit depths at the edge of or beyond classical simulability (for non-Clifford circuits, although the example in the paper demonstrates the technique on random Clifford circuits).
The example in the Mitiq docs will demonstrate a simplified version of the workflow followed in the paper, showing how to use Stim, a fast simulator for quantum stabilizer circuits, with Mitiq's ZNE module.
