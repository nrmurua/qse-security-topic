Current Problem
Currently in penalty model, the gap is set with respect to the lowest energy state specified by the user. (This "ground" is usually zero). However, what happens when the user specifies multiple energy states ranging from [-1, 1.5] (arbitrary numbers)? Should the energy gap be with respect to -1 or 1.5?
Since the user has specified that the energy states <=1.5 are valid, the energy gap should be with respect to 1.5. (i.e. All unspecified/invalid states should have energy states >= 1.5 + energy_gap, otherwise there is potential mixing between valid and invalid states)
Proposed Solution
Set the gap to be with respect to the HIGHEST energy state specified by the user, rather than the lowest.
