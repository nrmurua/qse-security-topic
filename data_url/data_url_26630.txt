The test result of QS/regtest-pod/hellium-pbe-5A.inp shows a large deviation since a while with the Intel compiler compared to the GNU based regtesters. An attempt to stabilize the test numerically (see #1401) caused a large change of the result compared to the reference. The test result might depend on the number of threads.
The large variation of the test results stems from inappropriate SCF parameters causing an unstable convergence behaviour.
