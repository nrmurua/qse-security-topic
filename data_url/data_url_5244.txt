Currently measurement on the density-qvm forces a particular measurement by way of a coin flip. This is correct behavior for the measurement instruction
However, it's not correct behavior for a bare measure-and-discard. This has the syntax
and class quil:measure-discard. In this case, we should produce a mixed state on |0> and |1>. This can be accomplished by defining a transition method on density-qvm and quil:measure-discard.
