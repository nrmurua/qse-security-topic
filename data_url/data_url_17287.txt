The backend configuration does not support open_pulse: True.  See:https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/f66351785116b4c6533de868ca3874214f6cc5cb/qiskit/schemas/backend_configuration_schema.json#L308
Try and validate a pulse backend configuration with open_pulse: True
open_pulse: true should be allowed.
Closing as while confusing the schema is actually correct.
The linked line in the initial issue only applies to the coreconfig and enforce open_pulse is false if only the core config is present. open_pulse = True is still allowed by the oneOf statement which includes the coreconfig and the openpulse_config
