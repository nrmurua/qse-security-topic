If compiling CUDAQ with OpenBLAS, when running the test_domains test. It will cause a segfault.
An example backtrace looks like
This is very similar to this bug report, i.e., the BLAS symbols exported by libcudaq-ensmallen.so is incompatible with the one shipped with NumPy.
Compiling CUDAQ on a system having OpenBLAS installed.
Not 100% sure, but I believe this issue only occurs if the offending Python packages, e.g., Numpy, are installed in binary form (i.e., not compiling Numpy from source). For example, the above backtrace showed that python3.8/site-packages/numpy/core/../../numpy.libs/libopenblas64_p-r0-2f7c42d4.3.18.so came with Numpy.
Run test_domains (compile CUDAQ with Python, install openfermionpyscf, etc. for the test to be included)
CUDAQ can be used with OpenBLAS.
Not a regression
Please see #185
