Filing for discussion and implementation tracking of occupation basis representation for the LinearOperator introduced in #1299, see the PR for context.
Rationale: Hamiltonians used in quantum simulation applications tend to have an efficient representation in this basis
Caveats: The above suggests that LinearOperator with this representation should not automatically compute its standard or Pauli basis expansions.
If we go down this direction it seems like we should consider it as part of a generic addition of support for  basis expansions outside of the pauli basis (all hail the hegemony of the Pauli matrices!)
