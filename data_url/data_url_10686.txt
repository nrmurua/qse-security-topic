Commit 6fc4505 introduces DFS on composites' children to infer structure.
The problem is children are not necessary composites, i.e. they might not have children of their own.
For example:
This behaviour pre-dates the changes made in #191, embedding composites in general fail when passed unstructured children.
You could alter the above to
or
I have made a PR (dwavesystems/dimod#500) to raise the correct exception in child_structure_dfs when a sampler is provided.
We will need to restore the InvalidComposition exception to fully restore the previous behaviour.
Although embedding composites over unstructured children would eventually fail, this bug is a layer on top of that - because DFS is assuming every node it traverses has children, which is generally not true (i.e. samplers don't have children).
Ok, in that case, this is closed by dwavesystems/dimod#500
