I'd like to add a Grover Optimization method to the optimization stack, specifically the code used to implement https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04088, which was written in collaboration with Stefan Woerner. I've already discussed adding the code with him, just creating this enhancement request to track alongside the PR, as requested in the contributing guidelines.
Working with @stefan-woerner to consolidate optimization changes on another fork. Closing this issue and moving the code there.
