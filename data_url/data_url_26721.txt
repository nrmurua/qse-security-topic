Dear developers,
I compiled cp2k-7.1 in centos 8 with gcc-8.3.1 and openmpi 4.0.2, which all is installed from yum.
The input which run correctly in cp2k-4.1 and cp2k-6.1 failed in cp2k-7.1 sopt and popt version
cp2k-7.1-install-and-input.zip
one more, if I comment out the broyden mixing or change to OT algorithm, the input can run correctly.
