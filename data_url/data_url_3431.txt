Trying Grover's search algorithm and get timeout with a larger search string:
If I have 1 bit less, it is OK
The same error comes when executing rigetti's grover algorithm for the SEARCHED_STRING
Hey @ninjab3381! If the connection to quilc is timing out like this, you can reach into the connection object and change the timeout attribute of the compiler connection Client object by doing qc.compiler.client.timeout = NEW_TIMEOUT. This number defaults to 10 seconds, as typical compiler jobs take less than that, and we don't want the compiler to spin its wheels forever in the event that something goes wrong. Hope that helps!
@karalekas How do I make the change?  I looked into the man page of quilc but could not find anything.  Is this a command line option?  Pls advise.....
@ninjab3381 apologies for not being clear! If you put that line (qc.compiler.client.timeout = NEW_TIMEOUT) in your Python script above, after the get_qc line, that should do it!
For example:
Tested @karalekas' fix. Closing, but going to open another issue to investigate the implementation of / improve the documentation of timeouts.
