Travis builds on macOS seem to be hanging -- see https://travis-ci.org/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/builds/408072468.  Looking at the logs, it looks like there is a huge output log related to installing clang-format.  We don't actually need to do the clang-format style checks on all Travis builds.  In fact on nist-branch, we now only do the clang-format check in one Travis build (see the environment variable CHECK_STYLE in .travis.yml and .travis/style_check.sh on nist-branch).  We could probably resolve this build issue and speed up our Travis tests on master by taking the same approach as nist-branch and only doing style check in one build.
This is actually already done on master-new-api so it will be resolved when master-new-api is merged into master.
