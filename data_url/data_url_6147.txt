Building Qiskit from master branch on specified platform succeeds in the order
and then fails on qiskit-aer.
From basic installation:
This fails as shown in the attached file install_aer.txt
Aer builds.
Wrestle with the C/C++ code.
Yep, we need at least a compiler which supports C++14.

Thanks, @atilag ... do you happen to know what level of gcc would that be? I was able to build 4.9.2 but not 4.9.4.
Building gcc 6.30 now on the P9 Centos platform ... I will see if that works out ...
Thank you, @atilag qiskit-aer builds and runs (edited) fine on the specified CentOS 7 platform with gcc-6.3.0.
Hi @jwoehr, do you build it from source code? I am also trying to install Aer on Power9. The installation doesn't give me any error, but I can't find a folder called aer under .conda_venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/qiskit/providers/ where it supposes to live. I tried to install from wheel but none of these wheel files are built for power9. I wonder if I can find some wheel for power9 somewhere.
@chnzhangrui I did not use Anaconda. I used python -m venv
I build from the master branch of all the source components.
I had to build gcc 6.3.0 to get everything to work.
Hi @jwoehr, thanks for the quick reply. After you installed everything, are you able to import qiskit.providers.aer? This line gives me
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit.providers.aer'
which points me to the fact that aer is not properly installed although no error during the installation.
So how you eventually use aer?
Yes, everything is installed correctly in my environment. Perhaps you are executing from outside the virtual environment you installed qiskit into.
OK, thanks for the feedback!
