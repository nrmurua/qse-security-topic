It would be nice to access scan objects like RangeScan through indexes such as RangeScan[0] (which now is available as RangeScan.start) etc.
This seems doable by defining a __getitem__() method for the scan classes?
If the sequence is predefined/allocated in the constructor then there should be no performance worries.
If the sequence is created on the fly then maybe random access through __getitem__() is problematic?
ARTIQ objects should be pythonic - users expect sequence[n] to work...

Iterators in Python (not only ARTIQ scan objects) are not indexable, so this isn't an argument.
