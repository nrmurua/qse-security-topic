The circuit drawer does not compile the latex code but instead throws an error using Jupyter Notebook:
WARNING Unable to compile latex...
...
CalledProcessError: Command '['pdflatex', '-halt-on-error', '-output-directory=C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Temp\39\tmpjmga_cb4', 'circuit.tex']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
For any quantumCircuit object use quantumCircuit.draw(output='latex') or quantumCircuit.draw(output='latex_source'), e.g.
When using
the output is
When I delete the "\\" in the 4th to last and 2nd to last line and manually input the code into a latex compiler, everything works fine. I.e. I insert
where I also fixed the indentation.
As I understand it, the circuit_drawer( ) in qiskit.visualization.circuit_visualization uses the _generate_latex_source( ) function, where it then uses the imported _latex.QCircuitImage( ) function. I think this last one is imported from latex using the latex-package for python, and I did not find the corresponding repository there. This is why I opened this issue.
A possible bug fix would probably be to manipulate the qcimg string in the _generate_latex_source( ) function and manipulate the string such that the "\\" are deleted. I would try to do it between the following 2 lines, but sadly can not test my idea at the moment.
This sounds likely to be some issue related to your LaTeX installation - for what it's worth, my local install can compile the original LaTeX code fine.  Are you able to share more of the LaTeX error you see?
Because of your answer, I also tried it on my home device. There, the 'latex_source' command gives the same (faulty) output as before, but for 'latex' the code snippet never finishes/throws an error. On my home device the installed latex is
which is the same as on my work device. I sadly cannot find the error.log file on my work device (which I do not have admin access to). And the error given as output when executing the code I already copy-pasted above.
But if I'm the only one having this problem feel free to ignore this issue as it's really not that important. I thought everyone had it.
It's odd that the existing form doesn't work for you, but if removing the redundant line breaks fixes things, I feel like that's something we could teach Terra's visualisation modules to do.
I wonder if your failures are related to your version of qcircuit.sty or xypic.sty in your TeXLive installation - I see you've got TeXLive 2017, but my version of qcircuit.sty is dated 2018-04.  Perhaps an update made it a bit more permissive?  If you've got control over your LaTeX distributions, you might be update to update the package.  I've tried the compile on Linux, Mac and Windows without seeing the failure, but my versions of TeXLive are a bit more recent than yours.
