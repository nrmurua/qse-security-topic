Hello, I wonder that do you have any open source qasm code for shor algorithm, grover algorithm or deutsch algorithm? I'm doing some projects related to qubit allocation so I need more benchmarks to evaluate my ideas. Thank you very much.
Hi @tilmto. We do not currently have OpenQASM code for that. However, I would suggest you take a look at this chapter of the Qiskit textbook (https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/index.html) which outlines Qiskit code to implement these algorithms. You can translate that to OpenQASM code via this method: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.html#qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.qasm
