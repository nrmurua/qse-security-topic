This is to capture all improvements required for copy_from_pqclean:
This supports issue #689
@dstebila If you have other items to add, please do so via Comment. Thanks in advance.
There's no need for the code copied from PQClean to be pretty-printed using our style.  But files we generate using the copy_from_pqclean scripts should be pretty-printed using our style.
Enable "implicit OQS_init" (assert-style feature-check initialisation in all liboqs calls) along the lines suggested by @dstebila
Fixed by #703.
