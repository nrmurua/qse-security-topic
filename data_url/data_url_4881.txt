The applyPhaseFunc function (and its related utilities) currently suffer an unexpected performance drop-off at around 16 qubits (from memory). This affects derivative functions like applyQFT. Tentative investigation could not isolate the problem to branching or override iteration.
See distributed manuscript for non-branching good-caching implementation
