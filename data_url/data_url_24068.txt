Add a Layer ID# to the qgeometry table that is paired against Layer #.
Enable the layer ID#
As in GDS, there is both layer # and ID #.
Currently we are only using layer #, and having it as a base Metal option. Adding layer ID as a base option could prove useful, as gives the user/designer more control, and could allow for more variation in options, such as with rendering or the potential 'layer stack' approach.
This could tie in with the layer stack ideas, we can try discussing this more in January on how to best make use of additional information/higher level of control from the component designer.
