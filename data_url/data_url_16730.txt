When pip installing having pygments 2.3.1 installed which satisfies the requirements set of >=2.2 trying to import qiskit.compiler.assemble results in this stack trace:
Build an environemnt with pygments 2.3.1 and try to import from qiskit
You can import without an assertion error.
Increase the minimum version of pygments to a working version, or if 2.2 works and 2.3 doesn't exclude 2.3.
Testing locally 2.4 works. I've got a PR in progress bumping the minimum and also making pygments optional since it's a visualization requirement (albeit a text visualization) and we typically do not make that a hard requirement for users.
2 days before I just do:
pip install qiskit
import qiskit
in my colab
and it works well!
But now from 2 days it is always showing me AssertionError: wrong color format 'ansibrightred'
Please help me!
@mtreinish @ajavadia
Solved by running pip install qiskit-terra[visualization] and restarting the runtime.
Thank you so much @jul1u5 .
Its working!
@jul1u5 I have one more doubt in forest version. Can you help on it?
@jul1u5 This problem is in my colab.
This is the link where you will find the ipynb file : [https://gitlab.com/qosf/qml-mooc/-/blob/master/forest_version/01_Classical_and_Quantum_Probability_Distributions.ipynb]


Please have a look!
Sorry, I have just started learning Qiskit and Quantum Computing and I can't help you.
This issue is now closed and unrelated to the problem you are having. So you should post an issue in the repo with which you are having problems (probably qml-mooc).
As far as I can tell the notebook can't find an executable called qvm. Perhaps you didn't install it.
