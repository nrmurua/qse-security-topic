ptb64 format is the only one that requires known number of shots ahead of time. This is going to introduce unnecessary API overhead for reading files. And the nature of code operating on this format is that it needs to assume shots is a multiple of 64 anyways...
Basically this would involve refusing to write ptb64 data when number of shots was not a multiple of 64, instead of padding it with 0s. This is a breaking change, though. Maybe would be better to pad up to a multiple of 64.
It is done. By #242
