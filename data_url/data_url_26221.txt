It might be better to remove setup.py as metadata from pyproject.toml is used by pip. This installation is not installing all the required packages.
Force use of pip and poetry where pip uses a better dependency resolver.
Pytest's documentation also advises against using setuptools for testing.

Not a good idea to remove setup.py as it is needed for PyPI. Closing this issue.
