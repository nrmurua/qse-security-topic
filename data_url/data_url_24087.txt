Currently, when saving a QDesign using the save_design method, throws an error saying ERROR WHILE SAVING: 'NoneType' object is not callable.
When the save_design error is fixed using suggested solution (implementing getstate alone), then, another error appear when load_design. The error is RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded.
Saving design
After fixing saving design
Saving and loading design is successful
Adding __getstate__ and __setstate__ method to the Components class seems to fix the issues.
Closed as per discussion in #911.
