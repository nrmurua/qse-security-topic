I've noticed that the Qubit class appears to only be a place holder for the measuredValue which is calculated external to the class and has no correlation to the Complex numbers that the Qubit class holds. Looking through the code that actually computes the measured value of the qubits it appears to do the entire calculation outisde of the class and then set the measured value at the end so that the API can function. This dosen't seem right and it's very difficult to follow the undocumented blocks of code that actually perform the calculation.
Is this going to be resolved?
The reason for this is that the calculations can be done in different Execution Environments. The Qubit class itself can be used independent from which execution environment is used, but if the flow logic was implemented inside the class, it would be much harder to add different implementations. Does that make sense?
You are 100% right though about the undocumented blocks of code, that needs to be improved.
Thanks!
Indeed, that is the correct analysis
No problem, your issue actually made me think it would be good to enable github discussions here. I created #119 so that I won't forget :)
