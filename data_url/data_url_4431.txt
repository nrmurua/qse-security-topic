When using pytest, we are unable to run tests for only one test file.
As @stavros11 mentioned on Teams, this seems to come from the flag --pyargs qibo in pyproject.toml
Yes, this is expected, you should launch pytest from outside the qibo directory.
Before I was always able to run it either from the local cloned repository or directly from the qibo/src/qibo/tests/, which is in line with what was presented in the Documentation presentation that was given a couple of months ago.
Now it's only possible when removing the aforementioned flag. What's the right way to do it?
@renatomello this behaviour is being fixed in qiboteam/qibolab#301 and will be ported to this repo too.
I see. Thank you.
