A 36Q circuit targeting Aspen-M-2 which consists of 6x 6Q independent, parallel circuits fails to compile on Quil-C 1.27.0 as deployed on the new DockerHub image. A reproduction recipe in notebook form depending only on pyquil is provided:
quilc_compilation_issue.zip
In some cases "docker run" on the container exits to the command line with no messages. In some cases the following log is emitted, and we observe high CPU load and increasing memory usage prior to the crash:
I have also attached the dictionary representation of the current compiler ISA, which is also sent to Quil-C, in case the issue depends on the current topology.

The issue does not occur if we roll back to 1.26.0; with the earlier version, compilation completes in a few seconds.
Possibly related to #860 (as a reminder to myself)
@mhodson-rigetti A workaround is probably increasing the heap limit when building QUILC. But we can still look into it.

@stylewarning I watched process memory sail past 3.2GB. I can't imagine why you need that much heap and more than five minutes to compile a circuit that is native bar the RY decompositions? 2.6.0 did it in seconds.
@mhodson-rigetti I don't think it should need that much memory either, of course.
