Inconsistent results depending on where a noise model is specified, in the initialization of QasmSimulator or in the execute function.
Noise model in QasmSimulator
Noise model in execute
Noise model in  both QasmSimulator and execute
FYI: No noise model
That calculated fidelity values are the same no matter where the noise model is specified.
Unknown.
I guess that you can get consistent result in the case "Noise model in execute" by setting basis_gates.
Thanks heaps, that solved the issue, that is really quite subtle!
If QasmSimulator(noise_model=noise_thermal) does not change its basis_gates, the original scripts generate the same result. noise_model is for simulation and basis_gates is for transpile. They are currently independent.
