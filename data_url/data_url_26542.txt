Hi,
I noticed that if user sets ADMM_PURIFICATION_METHOD to values except MO_DIAG and NONE, geometry optimisation will fail but the log file does not provide an error message.

Inspecting the admm_methods.F at line 2033 shows the source of error as forces are not implemented otherwise.

Sorry, for the late reply. Yes, PRs are always welcome!
