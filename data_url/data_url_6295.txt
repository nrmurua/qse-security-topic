QUnit::CINC() is currently failing a unit test, along with other ALU tests. The change seems to have been precipitated by work with TrimControls(), although QUnit ALU methods relied on a different method for an equivalent function, which wasn't as good.
The QUnit ALU code was written maybe 3 years ago, about, or more, with no major application to test the code since then, or ever. It likely has undetected bugs, as it is very infrequently applied. The unit tests themselves were marked with [travis_xfail], reminding me that they might have always had issues, possibly with the same bad pointer access we're seeing now.
These methods need some TLC, but, first, I want to completely eliminate bugged edge cases in QUnit elementary gates. We're close, but this will be addressed only afterward.
The issue seems like it might have been related to a bug identified in the QUnit::INT() protected ALU method, which has been fixed.
