I was using fidelity() function to with two density matrices as arguments. However, even if I use two exactly the same DM, the function returns <1.0 value (0.70710678 to be precise). I was hoping for two same DMs fidelity should be 1.0.
Attached is the density matrix.

This is a strange density matrix. Non-Hermitian.
