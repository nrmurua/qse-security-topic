The Kyber768 crypto_kem_dec function always returns zero, even though decapsulation fails.
See tests added in 3144967 and the result https://travis-ci.com/PQClean/PQClean/jobs/172380776
Yes, this is a result of the CCA transform; decapsulation failure results in a uniformly random key, but it's unclear what 'failing' means in the context of a C function here. I cannot immediately think of a scenario or example in which any decapsulation should return -1. We should discuss what we actually want to check w.r.t. that return code requirement.
@mkannwischer and I briefly talked about this earlier, and concluded something very similar applies to key and signature generation.
Yeah, @joostrijneveld also pointed that out â€“ but then it is slightly unclear what 'failure' means and we should probably clarify that in the API description.
