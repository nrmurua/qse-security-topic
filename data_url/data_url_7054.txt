At the moment, the orange highlight makes it harder to see the values. So you want to hover to see the tooltip, but that makes it harder to see the animation. Probably need to go with an outline instead of a highlight.
Also, the resize tab (when added) will cover the bottom row of values. That needs to be handled somehow. Probably by just putting the display over the tab, but still showing the resize cursor when 'over the tab'...?
