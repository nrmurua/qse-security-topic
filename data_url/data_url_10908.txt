Hello,
I found in "main.c" the declaration of many global variables. This is usually considered as a "bad practice". I would suggest to create a global structure where these variables are all embedded. What do you guys think?

I agree this opinion. By this problem, the patch can not be developed easily and the users can not make small pull requests.
