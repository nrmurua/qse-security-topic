When Terra tries to load Aer provider, with numpy 1.15.4, which was default on our Aqua build, and conforms to > 1.13 we get this
We have tried locally and get similar error with 1.15.4. (I was running 1.16.3 which seems ok, and latest 1.18.1 seemed fine too)
Just for the record, this is a bug in Cython 0.27, not a NumPy issue. It has been fixed in 0.28 and later.

Hi @nonhermitian, I have the same error here but my Cython is 0.29.2. Do you have any idea? Thx
Yeah. They said it fixed but it is not. Numpy needs to be updated.
