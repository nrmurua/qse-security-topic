ConstrainedReschedule raises TranspilerError with reset.
output
If ConstrainedReschedule does not support reset instruction, it would be great if the error message is more comprehensive rather than "Unknown operation type...".
No response
Thanks @t-imamichi. It seems that running ConstrainedReschedule on circuits with resets became disallowed in my PR #10007, in particular due to the following code:
I don't know whether resets cannot be supported, or whether resets behave like Measure, or whether resets can start at arbitrary time.
I agree that the error message is not very helpful.
Thank you for your information!
