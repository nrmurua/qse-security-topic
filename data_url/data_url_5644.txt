Aer Estimator fails on complex circuits when reference Estimator works well.
A similar issue is filed here: Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime#809, I think they are related, but the circuit in that issue can be executed by Aer Estimator.
The Sampler primitive is subject to the same problem, I think.
Run the script:
I get a stack trace:
If the line # qc = qc.decompose(reps=3) is uncommented, I get a slightly different error that might shed a light on the problem. Here is this stack trace:
No error is risen.
Thank you for your reporting. Please try the latest main branch because 269fbce fixes this issue.
Updated my environment to Aer from the sources. The problem is still there. If I uncomment # qc = qc.decompose(reps=3) the issue is still the same. Unfortunately, I cannot reopen this issue.
