The GCC build on OS X was broken because Travis had problems adding gcc through homebrew. When that's been fixed by Travis, revisit this.
There's some commented out code in the travis.yml.
Testing OSX gcc build again: https://travis-ci.com/thomwiggers/PQClean/jobs/172100687
Ok, the Brew issue seems resolved, now to solve the missing import issue.
It's now building on OSX though there are some other issues. Time to go home.
