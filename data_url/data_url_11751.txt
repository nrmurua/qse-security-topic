Currently, when running the aqua tutorial declarative_approach.ipynb in the qiskit-tutorials repo, I experience this error: ImportError: Invalid provider name 'AccountProvider'. I only experience it when trying to run the notebook with an IBMQ device. Running on the Aer statevector_simulator worked fine.
I am using the new API to load my IBMQ account. I use the open account provider: <AccountProvider for IBMQ(hub='ibm-q', group='open', project='main')>. I tried using both ibmq_16_melbourne and ibmqx2,  but received the same error with both of them.
Here is the full stack trace:
Run through the declarative_approach.ipynb aqua tutorial on a real IBMQ device. Load your account using the new API.
