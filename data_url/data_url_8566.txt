Hi,
I think the import order is not correct in setup.py, importing numpy at the beginning of the file, before giving a chance to setuptools to actually install it (because it is in required packages). This line is faulty https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blob/master/setup.py#L34 and results in
Then, instead of pip install qutip, one has to pip install numpy; pip install qutip.
Note that the same holds for Cython:
EDIT: And qutip installs well with pip even if scipy is not installed (or matplotlib). This results in an ImportError at first import (or warning). But once installing manually the dependencies, all is fine.
This does look like an issue.  Will look into it.
This has been dealt with.
Thanks!
