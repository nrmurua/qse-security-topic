I suppose this is because the more recent wheels don't support Alpine's musl?
docker-library/python#341 (comment)
Based on reading the thread above, it looks like this issue can't be resolved?
This looks similar to #537, which tells me your guess about musl is likely correct. I vaguely remember running up against the manylinux vs. musllinux issue there.
@pavoljuhas, could you investigate whether it is possible to add a musl wheel to our release?
The cibuildwheel which we use should be in theory capable of producing musllinux wheels.  To be worth the effort, we need to make sure that qsimcirq dependencies can be installed on a musl-based system as well.
@rht - can you please check if you can install all packages from qsim requirements.txt?
I tested on
and found out that Numpy doesn't support musl yet: numpy/numpy#20089. There were 19 test errors when they tested the musllinux wheel.
I suppose this is a no go at this time.  Feel free to reopen when numpy wheels are available for musllinux.
OK, thank you. I will let you guys know once that Numpy issue is closed and the wheel has made it into a release.
