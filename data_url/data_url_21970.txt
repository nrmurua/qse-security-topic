Trying to flash the nist_qc2 gateware 3.3 py_3+gitb92b00a1 on Windows 7 64bit, I get the above error message (see below for full output), while trying with an older release (3.2 py_8+gitaa64b8ad) works and outputs this in the same place:
I've also tried having the latest commit built, but that failed:
http://buildbot.m-labs.hk/builders/artiq-board/builds/1177
Full output of artiq_flash -t kc705 -m nist_qc2:
Do you have several boards plugged in?
No, just one.
@sbourdeauducq Any ideas? This was before any of my artiq_flash rewrite changes...
Any difference in openocd versions?
You need the last commit.
@whitequark could you look at the lit failure?
You need to manually install openocd-0.10.0-1 or wait for 3.5 to do that for you.

I also have this problem:
openocd: openocd                   0.10.0                        6    m-labs/label/main
Open On-Chip Debugger 0.10.0-00013-gbb7beda (2018-02-13-15:56)
Iirc you didn't have this problem before. That code hasn't changed over the last months. What's different? Is that a new board? Has it worked before? What's your bscan-spi-bitstreams version?
And could you file a new issue? This one was specific to 3.x.
@jordens I'll do it after I verify for 100% that we don't have problems with this board.
After a random artiq_flash (...) load all subsequent flashes work (altough still can't start ARTIQ, silence on tty1).
