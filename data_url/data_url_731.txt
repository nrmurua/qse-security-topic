Why bother to multiply the randH(D)  by 10? Did I miss something? Since all the elements in the matrix are of double data type, I seem unable to see the merits of the adjustment of the factor of 10.
I did a test. It produces the same final results with or without 10.
@DevelopDaily Absolutely true. The 10 there is from an old MATLAB code from Toby Cubitt http://www.dr-qubit.org/matlab/randRho.m Most likely it had to do with numerical stability, although it's not documented.
