There seems to be no easy way to get to landing home page from toc, maybe add home page to TOC

Clicking the Docs link takes you back to the landing page (index.html)

Do you still want a separate link in the left panel?
I think it might be nice to add Home to the top of the docs. It took me some time to find that I can click docs. Might be user friendly
Direct link to https://qiskit.org/documentation/metal, otherwise the build will call it a circular link and not build in the link.  I'll add this after the site goes live so there isn't a dead link in the meantime.
Branch after-docs-live contains this implementation.
