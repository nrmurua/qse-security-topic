This bug can be recreated with the following snippet (also in the quantum chemistry tutorial):
Preliminary problem setup is shown below,
The bug occurs, when we run the following,
For high enough values of the parameter intervals, the code runs without ever completing. In my case, I found that intervals = 4, more or less (but not always) completed.
Now, it is entirely possible that this bug is due to Dask which will be removed after the OS redesign.
I propose that we run this tutorial after the refactor is completed in order to see whether the removal of Dask fixes this. At that point, we might be able to simply close this issue or dig deeper into understanding the root cause.
This is a duplicate issue.
