Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Currently we use a gray scale color for lattice plot, which is not the most ideal setup.
Describe the solution you'd like
add an option to the lattice plotting function to produce different themed lattice plots, e.g dark mode, light mode, etc.
