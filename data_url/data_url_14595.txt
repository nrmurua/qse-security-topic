Summary: Change qiskit.result.get_statevector() to retrieve any statevector saved with save_statevector() by specifying the label used.
Users can save the statevector at a midpoint in a QuantumCircuit run in a simulator by calling save_statevector(label=label). However, retrieving the saved statevector from the qiskit.result object after simulation is not as straight-forward. The user is forced to retrieve the raw data field of the qiskit.result object and extract the saved statevector by using the label as a key. Once the statevector data is retrieved, the user must also then post-process the raw data manually or by calling qiskit.result.postprocess.format_statevector().
The get_statevector() function handles the process retrieving the statevector and postprocessing the data. However, get_statevector() only retrieves the final statevector, not any arbitrarily saved statevector.
I propose that the get_statevector() function be modified to retrieve any saved statevector. This can be done by adding an option label argument. If label is not specified, then the get_statevector() function will return the final statevector as it does now.
