I created a parameter with setpoints Y which depends on setpoint X.
Then I created another parameter Z which is independent from the other two.
I measured Y and Z in the measurement context, then convert the result dataset to an xarray.
I expect that the Y would be a data variable that depends on X, and Z on index, as inferred from the paramspecs.
All parameters became data variables that depended on index.

Run the following snippet
If I modify the setpoint to the following, the issue disappeared and the result dataset is as expected.
