Sometimes a kernel runs with a LLVM IR parsing error saying error: value for 'column' too large, limit is 65535. It typically happens in a kernel following another long-running kernel.
We have an experiment that raises a LLVM IR error when we choose parameters to run many repetitions in the self.run_kernel() function. The error happen in a separate kernel function to reset the dds states after the experiment finishes. The experiment does not fail when the number of repetitions are small. Only relevant code is attached as the entire experiment is too long and complicated to be attached, and I don't have a MWE for the error.
Finishes with no error.
With certain parameters, it raises the following error:
The error is deterministic with the parameters we choose.
I am able to confirm the same problem on the latest ARTIQ-7 (9aa81e1) with the corresponding firmware. We see the same problem on three setups (2x Kasli 2.0 and 1x Kasli-SoC). This error happens typically when running a kernel after a long kernel function as described in the above message.
The latest ARTIQ-7 saves a LLVM IR (BROKEN) DUMP file though. The dump file is attached here: tmpikxl060q.ll.txt. The error is related to line 68660: !1272 = !DILocation(column: 65580, line: 1, scope: !8).
We found that the error was due to a code mistake. When calling self._reset_ad9910s(params_used_ad9910s), params_used_ad9910s was incorrectly set to a very long list (~thousands of elements) with a lot of repeated devices in the list elements. After fixing the problem the code works with no issue.
The error message is not clear for this problem though. At least this issue may help future users if someone make the same mistake as I did.
Do you have a minimal example to reproduce the issue? The compiler should not behave like this.
MWE on Kasli 2.0:
Error message:
