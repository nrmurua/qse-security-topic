Please be as descriptive as possible, including: what is expected, why is this feature needed, what is the objective, etc.
While adding component using the drag and drop feature in the future, we can click on any of the pads and a transluscent transmission line will appear, we can then long-press the shift key to get a straight line, otherwise, the TL will follow a meandering path to the pad on the other qubit. We can also press the left mouse button along the route to add anchor points along the route. After placing the TL, we can right click on it to change the feature like asymmetry and fillet.
This will help reduce the lengthy process of coding the TLs. It will be an enhancement for the GUI and user friendly.
Thanks, that's a good request
