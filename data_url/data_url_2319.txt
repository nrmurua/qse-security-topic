Running check/pytest-and-incremental-coverage on my linux workstation pops up a matplotlib figure window but instead of showing the plot, it just has whatever was drawn on the screen before the window popped up. It stays there for the duration of the test, but does eventually go away. Taken with the lack of output on the command line, it gave me the strong impression that the tests were hung; although they did end up completing.
This is another reason we shouldn't call show inside plotting functions (#1890).
This is due to the call to results_1.plot() in cross_entropy_benchmarking_test.py, which triggers a call to plt.show(). We need to either remove the call to show, or gate it behind a parameter.
Did the recent change to a headless backend during tests fix this?
seems fixed for me
