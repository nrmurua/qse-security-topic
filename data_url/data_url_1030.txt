Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
The Bloch sphere visualization in PR #4171 currently only supports 3D visualization output for environments which allow Javascript. I'd like to go ahead and allow JPG/animated GIF to be supported in the visualization as well.
Describe the solution you'd like
All that's needed from an Typescript implementation perspective is the code to generate the scene with the Bloch sphere on it, take the screenshot/screencast, and display it in a format compatible with the environment. The Puppeteer package, which is already included in the typescript dev environment, should be handle both the screenshot and screencast output.
From the Python perspective, the user should have a choice on whether or not to display an interactive 3D Bloch sphere or a static 3D bloch sphere. This can look like so:
Additional context (e.g. screenshots)
Screenshots/screencasts should be taken from the programmed starting camera angle in the Bloch sphere's scene.ts file. It should look like so:

Asethetic/sizing changes to this feature will be included when resolving issue #4257.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters
