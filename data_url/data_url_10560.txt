Current Problem
I want to use some of the the low-level utilities provided in dwave-cloud-client directly from a third-party sampler.
For example, I'd like to validate that my problem is compatible with a device's graph. This functionality is available in the DWaveSampler's underlying Client, but not directly from the sampler; I have to access the low-level Client. However, a third-party sampler does not have an underlying Client, so it becomes impossible to use this feature.
Proposed Solution
Expose useful lower-level utilities through the Sampler interface.
I think there are two specific features we'd like to support:
if you have a StructuredSampler.
One solution might be to add a sampler.check_structure(bqm) method to the structured sampler ABC.
When you say StructuredSampler, do you just mean that the Sampler implementation should subclass both Sampler and Structured (I don't see a StructuredSampler class; will that be added)?
Yes, it should subclass both, like the DWaveSampler.
To @speller26's point, adding StructuredSampler with relevant utilities, and then subclassing it in DWaveSampler makes the most sense to me (see dwavesystems/dimod#832 (comment)).
Something like:
