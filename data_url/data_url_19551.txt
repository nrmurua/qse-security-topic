Should be: set BB_INPUT_TYPE to * I. See the user guide
But I've not tested this myself.
Thanks.
I tried like this but there is error.
If I use float it is fine.
Tried something like this with BB_INPUT_TYPE but it did not work.
If we change *I to *R and change dtype int to float, then it will work.
