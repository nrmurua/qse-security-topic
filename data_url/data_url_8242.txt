I am installing on Mac OS Catalina using the following command:
python setup.py develop --with-openmp
However, I am getting the following error:
clang: error: unsupported option '-fopenmp'
error: command 'g++' failed with exit status 1
could you please elaborate?
It looks like a compiler (g++, gcc)-related issue with your environment. It doesnâ€™t look like a bug of QuTiP.
The default Apple clang version doesn't recognise -fopenmp out-of-the-box, because Apple don't ship an OMP library with macOS.  You'll have more luck (with most C/C++ projects!) if you install a fully-featured compiler and environment.  On homebrew you can find both clang/clang++ and gcc/g++, both of which can be installed with OMP support.  Make sure your set PATH/CC/CXX environment variables are set up correctly after you've installed, so you're calling the compiler you've just installed, not just the Xcode versions.
This isn't a bug in QuTiP, although we could remember this when somebody's working on modernising the distribution - in C/C++ land, tools like automake run through a big list of things to check during build configuration, and one of them is if OMP appears to exist.  That way the error message is a little clearer (although in this case it's reasonable clear if you're used to C compilers).
