Inspired by @warrench feedback:
Ability to "attach" T splits to a drawn feedline
Currently, once a feedline is routed, there is no way to "split to add CPW_hanger_t" onto sections of the feedline. Instead one would have to chop up the line to interleave portions with said component(s), thus making cpw total length calculations hard, and slowing down the design process.
