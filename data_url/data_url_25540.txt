The dispatcher address is improperly overwritten when the server is started.  I'm not sure if it also happens to other values in the config.
A user's config file should take precedence over any default values.  In addition, the server always seems to start on localhost, which is hard-coded into covalent_ui/app.py, even though it should really reference the config file.  E.g. in my case I want it to start on 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost.
