According to the official docs:
"The action of a __slots__ declaration is limited to the class where it is defined. As a result, subclasses will have a __dict__ unless they also define __slots__ (which must only contain names of any additional slots)."
All subclasses down the inheritance chain (Qubit, Clbit, AncillaQubit) ought to define:
__slots__ = ()
The omission of __slots__ = () from the child classes doesn't make the field entirely useless (the defined slots are still used, avoiding the hash-map lookup), but it is ensuring the creation of an instance dictionary that never gets populated with anything, which is a little slower and more memory hungry.
I'm happy to accept a PR fixing this.
