Hello there. I have cited your library in a paper currently under peer review. I am trying to validate use of Qrand with simulator backend on qiskit client. The sampling does not appear to return random values, although it works with a live circuit backend.
array([-7.42778876e-09, -7.42778876e-09, -7.42778876e-09, -7.42778876e-09,
-7.42778876e-09])
It also generated a bunch of qiskit printouts as follows (repeated for each sampled number):
I expected the sampling to generate 5 unique numbers when running the simulator backend
This might be related. I was running some code from a qiskit book and it appears that some kind of convention may have changed for their library in a recent update with respect to representing qubit counts .configuration().n_qubits for various backends as strings instead of integers. Wondering if a simple type conversion somewhere could resolve .
