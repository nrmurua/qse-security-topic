Dear QUIMB organizers,
I tried to plot the last tensor network as shown in section: 2.8. ‘Publication style’ figures, but I get below error:
node_shape={tag: 'h' for tag in tags} | {tag0: 's'},
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'dict' and 'dict'
I am using the Python 3.8 via Anaconda 3. How can I resolve the problem?
I could plot other tensor networks.

I could solve this problem by adding few lines as follows:
d1 = {tag: 'h' for tag in tags}
d2 = {tag0: 's'}
d = d1.copy()
d.update(d2)
.....
node_shape=d,
....
The union operator for dicts was added in python 3.9 I believe. While supporting python 3.8 in the actual code-base is still desirable, my feeling is this doc is fine as-is going forward.
