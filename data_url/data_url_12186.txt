We should have an index for the tutorials, so that people can look up all notebooks that implement Shor's algorithm, or all that use the command initialize, etc.
I suggest adding a new markdown cell to all notebooks in which keywords are given. For 'quantum_emoticon' for example, we could have something like.
Keywords
Topics: Bit-string, superposition
Commands: QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit, h, cx, execute
Then anyone interested in bitstring encoding, or seeing an example of a superposition, would know that they could look there. Note I wouldn't expect every notebook that uses QuantumCircuit to list QuantumCircuit, etc. Only the commands that are really featured would be listed (and for the 'hello world' folder, that means the most basic.
Once we have these keyword cells, we can write a simple script to scrape them and generate an index. This could be a .md file living at the top level and linked to in the README.
Anyone have any thoughts?
I think it's a good idea, but the index could get very cumbersome and because of that, people might not use it. Perhaps we could try it out and see how it would look in one of the community folders first?
That's a good idea. We can set up the experiment there.
In what way do you think it might be cumbersome? Probably we should try to limit the number of notebooks indexed for each keyword. In that way, it should be as like a typical back-of-textbook index.
After some experimenting with the script, I think it might be best to hide the keywords in the source of the notebook. Then it will be easier to obtain and parse for the indexer. Whether we include the information in a way that the user can see can be a separate issue.
