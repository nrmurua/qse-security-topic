I'd like to know the total time given qubit was driven when circuit was executed on real HW (ibmq_quito).
I have constructed a circuit, transpiled, submitted the job, and asked job for the circuit after the submission - I still get no output. How can I trigger the scheduler to attach the info I want?
This are key lines form my code:
circ=...
circT = qk.transpile(circ, backend=backend, optimization_level=3)
job =  backend.run(circTL,shots=1000)
circSL=job.circuits()
print('submitted JID=',job.job_id(),backend ')
print(circSL[1].qubit_duration(1))
The result is:
...
submitted JID= 629ebde5a38471bafc4529b4 ibmq_quito
...
Traceback (most recent call last):

I could provide a demonstrator
get the total length of few usec
I don't know if this is the cause to your problem. But note that calling run sends the circuits to the device, and your program continues in parallel to the execution on the device. So, when you call qubit_duration, it is possible that the execution on the device hasn't terminated yet (actually it's probably still waiting in the queue). You have to call job.result() in order to stop your program until the device finishes, or monitor the job.
I'm not familiar with qubit_duration. I suggest to ask in the public Slack channels, for example https://join.slack.com/share/enQtMzYzOTcwOTA2OTQyOC03NWZmMzRmYmRmNjljOGFjNGVhYmFhNTkwOGZiZjMyMjI1MzI3ODA3OWFiOWNiOWVmMjMzMDNhNjg1ZTg1OWQy
@balewski The suggestion from @yaelbh to ask in a Qiskit Slack channel is good. If there is a problem to report, I think it should be reported in https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra. I don't see anything in your examples that is specific to qiskit-experiments.
HI @balewski .qubit_duration only work with "scheduled circuit". So you first need to schedule the circuit. That can be done by specifying scheduling_method option in transpile. Please change your code like
and you can get the duration even before running the circuit.
