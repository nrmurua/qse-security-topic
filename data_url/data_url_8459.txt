The implementation of the trace norm (as called through the norm function) produces incorrect results for non-Hermitian operators. For an operator A, the trace norm is defined as
However, qutip currently provides the following behavior:
Aside from the discrepancies above, there is also the problem that an operator should have zero norm if and only if it is the zero operator. This mathematical requirement is not satisfied by the current implementation of norm.
Based on a cursory inspection, it appears the issue arises from the following lines:

Hi, Thank you for bringing this to notice. I guess there should have been an isherm check to determine the trace norm using (a*a.dag()).sqrtm() instead of just summing over absolute eigenvalues based on the operator. Let me open a PR to fix this.

This was fixed in #751.
