See #757 for documenting the 1st major step of CDR. This issue is for documenting the 2nd major step - i.e., performing  regression given a set of {(noisy expectation value)_i, (noiseless expectation value)_i}, and how to use the optimal fit to get the error-mitigated value returned by CDR. This doc should show the available regression types in mitiq.cdr, as well as how to define a new regression type.
