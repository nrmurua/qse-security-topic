Before raising this issue, I have already checked that I am:
Hello!
I am trying to use openqaoa to solve a maximum-cut -type question. Based on the tutorial here: (https://openqaoa.entropicalabs.com/problems/maximum-cut/#maxcut-in-openqaoa), this is the sample code given to solve a small Max Cut question:
However, after installing all dependencies and running the code, I get the following error:

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Metadata/ solution should be produced, not the error above.
@robliou, thanks again for raising this issue! This seems like the case of outdated documentation that needs to reflect the new changes in the codebase. If you look inside the problems folder in openqaoa-core, you will see that each problem class is defined in their individual python files. Therefore, the correct syntax to import MaximumCut now, is the following:
from openqaoa.problems import MaximumCut
P.S. We will fix this on the website
@vishal-ph
Awesome, yes, using this new syntax, I am able to get the program to finally run. However, it looks like at 100 nodes, I may be exceeding the maximum allowed dimension? If so, I will open up another issue for this,
In the meantime, feel free to close this issue and thanks for your help with this!
Best,
Rob
