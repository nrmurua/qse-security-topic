Am I correct in thinking this version of python is supported?
Yes, thanks for catching this. I'll release a package with the correct constraints. (And I guess delete the old one, since otherwise 3.5.1 will just grab the bad one.)
Fixed by #715
From the python 3.5.2 release notes it looks like the change to allow @overload outside stubs was already present in that version (https://docs.python.org/3.5/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-5-2-final). Was there another reason to skip 3.5.2 and require 3.5.3 instead?
Nope. Was just being safe and fast.
