I have been successfully building and loading my own firmware.bin and top.bit for several days now. My recent builds involve a more elaborate .json file that's used in one of the production lab setups. With my most recent builds using this .json the runtime boots but then hangs after 7 seconds. In the output below you can see repeated calls to artiq_coremgmt log that are successful followed by a final request made at t >  18.962370s that returns nothing.
The board continues to respond to ping. The Err led is not illuminated. How should I proceed to debug this?
I see the same behavior on a second kasli-soc with an identical time-to-hang.
Actually, it's the logging system that's failing. While artiq_coremgmt log is unresponsive I can still use artiq_run. Then sometime later artiq_coremgmt log has emissions which reappear but are truncated. Here's an example.
I've seen this pattern repeat twice now between reboots.
I've tried several times to reproduce this error but it no longer appears. Closing.
