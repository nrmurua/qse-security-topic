Patch sayma_amc as below:
DRTIO link 0 stops working (no link detected on the master nor on the satellite, no ClockAligner).
When commenting out those two lines:
functionality of channel 0 is fully restored.
And when connecting the rest of the drtio1 properly, the breakage persists.
When commenting out those two lines:
functionality of channel 0 is fully restored.
Er, scratch that - it is still broken, it just worked one time by chance.
So, simply adding a second channel to the GTH breaks the first channel.
2896dc6 should fix that. (I tested with Master and Satellite with 2 data lanes)
Confirmed that enabling multilink no longer breaks channel 0.
The other channel (second SFP) is also OK, including the DRTIO protocol.
Thanks.
