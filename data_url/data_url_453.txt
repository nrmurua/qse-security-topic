I think we should allow plugins to fail and if they do just throw a warning and continue loading the rest of the plugins. No reason that a plugin failing to load should mean you can't use the framework at all.
I would like to work on the issue
Can you share more info
I think this is referring to the initialize method in this ServiceRegistry implementation.
Basically, we need to make the "Load plugins" loop handle the loading of plugin share libraries a bit more graciously (e.g., via try-catch, etc.) since some plugins are not mandatory and warnings are sufficient.
Please assign me the issue , i will start working on it
@amccaskey Have you done any work on this one? @anushkrishnav wants to work on it :)
Nope. Please go ahead.
Awesome will start right away !!
A simple try-catch should be enough
or is something more expected? a task list would be really helpful
