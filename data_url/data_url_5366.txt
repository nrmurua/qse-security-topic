Description of the issue - include code snippets and screenshots here
if relevant. You may use the following template below
Expected behavior: (What you expect to happen) AdjointJacobian<T>::adjointJacobian should work for all compilers.
Actual behavior: (What actually happens) It throws std::range_error in some compilers (especially in MSVC)
This is because we reference an iterator below std::begin(). I will make a fixing PR soon.
