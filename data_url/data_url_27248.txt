The conversion between unsigned char* arrays and digit_t* arrays causes this issue.  Not sure of a clean way to fix this without changing the function interfaces in several places.
Support for big endianness is not a high priority at this point. But thanks for the recommendation. I'll keep it in mind for future updates.
