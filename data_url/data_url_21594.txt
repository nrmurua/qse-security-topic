After updating from 4 to 5, artiq_run hangs whenever zotino.init() is called.
We are using kasli-hub and flashed the gateware after installing artiq 5. We tried with nix and conda versions of the packages.
The device database doesn't match the gateware.
Use the (matching) template from https://nixbld.m-labs.hk/job/artiq/full/device-db-kasli-hub/latest-finished containing the correct RTIO channel numbers.
we should really add this kind of thing to the artiq FAQ.  @jordens what do you think about tagging this as a documentation issue and leaving it open? I'm happy to spin up a doc PR at some point for this and a few other things that come up all the time.
Sure. That works.
thanks, the new device db worked!
In addition to adding it to the FAQ, I'd suggest a note to the "Upgrading ARTIQ" section of this document (that's where I looked for help):
https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual/installing.html
The release notes already list breaking changes. We should simply make sure that those changes that require a device db modification are listed.
