I want to make a controleld gate but source qubits are not only 1 state, for example C-Swap (n qubit controlled);
let consider that we have |phi> state;
qs: |0001>  -> H [qs.[1]]; H [qs.[2]]; -> |0001>+|0011>+|0101>+|0111> = |phi>
and apply SWAP(0,3) gate with controlled |10> for controlled qubits 1,2; (if qubit[1]=1 and qubit[2]=0 then apply SWAP(q.[0];q.[3]) gate);
U |phi>  -> |0001>+|0011>+|1100>+|0111>
(or controlled |1010> for controlled qubits 1,2,3,4)
Can i do this, how do i ?
There are several ways to do this. The easiest is to create a new gate with the exact Unitary matrix of the multi-controlled gate you want. For example, Toffoli is done with:
Another way is to use the Cgate (or CCgate) gate that adds a control to an existing gate (or one you've already defined):
Notice the use of AddControl  which will add any number of controls to another gate (the parent).
Now comes the question of how to do "0" controlled gates. Just create the gate (by either method above) with "1" controls and then create a wrapper gate with an "X" before (and after) the control gate on each line you want controlled with a "0". Here's a sample wrapper gate from inside the Shor algorithm:
In the WrapOp function you can put as many X gates as you like. This should give you everything you need to create your new gate.
thank you for your help. I could not think of the X gate before Cgate(and after).
I think you misunderstood what I meant. The X gates go outside of the control gate. For example, change your code to this:
and what you get for output is:
which I believe is what you wanted.
After I wrote what you wanted to say, I understood and I deleted the other question. I first noticed X then X event later. Thank you so much for your help again. My problem is solved.
