I am unable to build on Windows for Python 2.7: build reports "fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'chrono': No such file or directory".
Apparently,  requires at least MS VS 14 compiler; however, MS VS versions above 9 no longer support Python 2.7.
One solution is to replace  with boost time&date.
I built in Python 3 using MS VS 14 standalone build tool's compiler. (I can build for Python 2.7 on a unix platform.)
Maybe for building this tool, Windows support should be limited to Python 3 (and stated in the README)?
AppVeyor is able to build on Windows for Python 2.7, e.g., https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dwave-adtt/minorminer/build/1.0.123
Maybe compare what you're doing with what's being done here: https://github.com/dwavesystems/minorminer/blob/master/appveyor.yml
I was looking here: https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers

But there are so many versions of 14 it could be the one I'm using.
Hmm, closing for now, since it is possible to build this (as AppVeyor does), and we're not expecting many users to build from source.
