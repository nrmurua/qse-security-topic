Application
It looks like sphinx-builder has a bug that <BLANKLINE>, which should be used by the doctest builder, is instead rendered by other builders. So inserting the <BLANKLINE> directive doesn't help pass doctests and appears in the HTML output. Not using the directive messes up the HTML:

Proposed Solution
If there isn't a blank line the problem goes away
Alternatives Considered
Putting in <BLANKLINE>, skipping doctests, and hoping a new version of sphinx-build fixes the bug
Additional Context
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html: "Note that like with standard doctests, you have to use <BLANKLINE> to signal a blank line in the expected output. The <BLANKLINE> is removed when building presentation output (HTML, LaTeX etc.)."
BTW, in the problem description above the <--BLANKLINE--> directive is rendered invisible so it's hard to read the description :-) Update: fixed that rendering problem by backslashing the directive
Good news! This was removed in #427 , upgrading to dimod 0.8.7 should resolve the issue
It does, thanks!
