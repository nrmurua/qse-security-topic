Multiplying two instances of TPBGroupedWeightedPauliOperator fails.
The multiplication should go through and produce an instance of TPBGroupedWeightedPauliOperator.
My guess is that on Line 226, it should read maybe:
so that the resulting TPBGroupedWeightedPauliOperator is produced using one of the available grouping functions (either from self or other).

Yes, you are right! I'll change it to take the grouping from self and note that in the docstring. (The prior method seems to have the same problem too). BTW thanks for providing these samples that show the failure - they are super helpful.
