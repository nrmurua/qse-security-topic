Hi, Why do some gates not have qc_name like "ZPhase" and "XPhase" and some like SWAP, CX are given "undefined" as names in those fields? I think swap is swap in qasm.
I recently changed how this naming works, so it might be I made some errors there.
But if I'm not mistaken, since the baseclass Gate defines qc_name="undefined", ZPhase and XPhase inherit it from there, while SWAP and CX inherit from CNOT that redefines qc_name, hence why they need to explicitly state that the name is undefined.
@jvdwetering I checked it again, and all is as you said. Now for SWAP in .qc description, it prints "Z" and ZPhase and XPhase raise errors. But if I am correct, .qc means latex code, then why ZPhase and XPhase do not have latex names?
I basically only filled in the names for the gates for which I knew the correct .qc name. If you have a source for what I should make the names of the other gates, then I'm happy to add them as well.
Dear all,
I have some problems with gates following a conversion from qiskit to qasm.
Here is the begining of the file (the whole can be provided if needed).
Do I mess something or this is just some missing gates.
Thanks
`OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q0[15];
creg c0[1];
ry(1.5707963267948968) q0[0];
ry(0.9272952180016122) q0[1];`
What error does it give? It looks correct to me
Thanks for this swift reply
TypeError: Unknown gate name: ry(1.5707963267948968) q0[0]
Hmm, then it is probably because I haven't programmed in a ry gate. For a quick fix you could change it into a rz/rx gate with the appropriate S or V gates around it.
I will do ! Thanks
I'll close this since the original issue was solved, and I've made a new issue for the implementation of the ry gate in #90
