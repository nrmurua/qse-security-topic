Hi,
I was testing the ansatz generated by unitary_cc, and want to know the parameter size for a built ccsd circuit.
I saw a function uccsd_singlet_paramsize( n_qubits, n_e), is this my expectated function, namely, return the size of a parameter vector which later is used in optimization?
Following is the code I used

yup! that's the number of parameters for restricted UCCSD.  The function definition is pretty clear (
