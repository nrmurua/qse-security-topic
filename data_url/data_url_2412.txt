Since circuit += op_tree works, I propose to let circuit + op_tree work too.
Makes sense to me. The __add__ method should be modified so that it produces the equivalent of the following circuit:
... That may actually be the correct implementation.
I am willing to take this up. I have read the contributor's guide, and set up my local environment. This is the current implementation of add in circuit.py
@gauravMann Go for it!
Ah right, I forgot about the device inter-compatibility check. That's important to keep. The validation of moments in other can be delegated to copy.__iadd__, but the validation of moments in self would stay.
Hi @Strilanc I apologize for the delay.
