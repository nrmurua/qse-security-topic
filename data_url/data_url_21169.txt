Can probably do this by disabling the DAC clocks.
My current model for programming is:
disable channel
program channel
trigger channel
I take it what you now want is to
program channel
trigger channel
blank output & reprogram while trigger remains valid
re-enable output at completion of programming
without re-triggering
I also assume that this only applies to reprogramming waveform memory
No, I mean during initial programming of the FPGA bitfile. Garbage data is coming into the DACs and the clocks are running, so there is all this garbage output. Various customers expressed concern with this behavior.
I am wondering of the programFpga() method aught to disable the PLL-chip outputs to the DACs before programming. This won't "zero" the outputs since they will have some random offset voltage, but at least they won't jump all over the place.
Got it missed the hardware label. I'll see what I can do in programFPGA()
On power-up, before we talk to the device, this is hopeless.  Once we talk to the device, this isn't a problem.  Leave as won't fix.
