Take a NA trace in the gui, with
input='out1',
output_direct='out1',
start=1e3,
stop=50e6,
points=1001,
rbw=1e4
press stop and resume -> this has a notable effect on the acquired curve / introduces > 10dB discontinuities
=> so many new bugs!!!
I doubt this is a new bug... I will take care of it tomorrow. I will probably transfer all the acquisition logic from NAWidget directly to the NetworkAnalyzer class as I did it with the Scope. It helps a lot clarifying things...
