Any help?
ERROR: Failed building wheel for qutip
Failed to build qutip

Many thanks
You'll find it easier installing from conda-forge, since we distribute binary releases there: see the installation guide here.
If you want to install from source using pip, you need to configure your C++ development environment correctly - you'll probably need to enable the XCode command-line tools (see e.g. this).
Thanks @jakelishman for solving it. @pifparfait feel free to reopen if necessary.
