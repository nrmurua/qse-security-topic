The QPU/ISA format currently allows users to specify the target gate-set of individual hardware components. A chip-specification in CL-Quil / quilc also contains a notion of a "generic compiler", which is used as a fallback when local compilers don't do the job (e.g., when compiling a n-Q gate, n â‰¥ 3), and this field is not currently programmable. Expose its configurability to the user along the same lines of the individual components.
