Seems needed as they are broken basically every time I run them.
Done. They're still broken since either there is no loopback or there is no JTAG.
I see many failing ones that are not due to JTAG.
No, they are due to JTAG, because the fix is in master but was not flashed yet. Except one test that I asked you about on IRC.
(I've deliberately not flashed it manually so that we have an indication of flashing by buildbot starting to work.)
lda, analyzer?
Ah yes those are due to the missing --no-localhost-bind option. Not sure if we should add that or update Python.
I would monkey-patch asyncio if python version == 3.5.1. Earlier versions are not supported and later ones should be fixed (patch is committed).
What about the analyzer test failing? It seems the buildbot could not connect to the analyzer port on the core device.
