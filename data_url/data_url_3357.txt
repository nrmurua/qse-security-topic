I'm wondering what's the correct way of adding measurements to the program?
I'm trying to run the VQE().expectation() function, as explained here (I literally copypasted the code from that page and ran it.)
When using the statevector representation (i.e. samples = None), everything works as expected. However, as I change samples to any integer, I get the warnings shown below.
What is currently the correct way to add measurements to the program, so that I could use vqe_inst functionality without warnings? Adding a measurement as explained here only removes one of the warnings but not another.
Thanks

Hey @mavzolej. Those warnings are coming out of Grove (which is now unsupported). The warnings shouldn't materially affect your program, and can be ignored.
