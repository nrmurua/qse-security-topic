When calls are made to as_dict() an error pops up saying that such method is deprecated.
Run any cell calling that method. For instance the last cell in qiskit/advanced/aer/2_device_noise_simulation.ipynb.
A dictionary with the information about the noise model is printed out.
Change the call to to_dict().
