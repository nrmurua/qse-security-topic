Allow to pass density matrices to timeevolution.mcwf instead of only Ket vectors.
This is a feature present in QuTiP and the solution comes (I guess) from the Blunt et al. (2014) paper. That would be very helpful for some simulations.
Sorry for the late response.
I can't find the function in QuTiP, could you send me a link to the specific part in the QuTiP-docu?
Sorry I must have been mistaken somehow. I cannot find it anymore ðŸ˜…. It can be a nice feature though!
I have found an alternative to what I was trying to do at that time.
You may just write a disrete distribution for you mixed state by using StatsBase with function Weights(). And for every trajetory, you choose an random initial state from this distribution.
