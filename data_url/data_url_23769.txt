qcodes Logo
some suggestions:



@spauka what's sydney uni's official color?
also, let's agree to settle either on QCoDeS, qcodes or Qcodes..
Had to take an interesting journey through the university's 152 page brand
guidelines to figure this out...
The primary color is "Masterbrand Red" rgb=(230,70,38). Since this is quite
similar to CPH, the secondary color is "Masterbrand Charcoal"
rgb=(66,66,66).
I also vote qcodes as the one true capitalization.

See #264 for name. @spauka it is and will be qcodes .
The  question being do we want to keep a reference  to do universities colors and stuff ?
@giulioungaretti not sure if everyone agrees. I prefer Qcodes.
color-wise, please go ahead and make a different suggestion.
@guenp  the capitalization was decided during the github issue closing marathon. The new org and repo already refelct this.
Color wise, I'd love to have it as general as possible, but I also have no time now to think or do anything ( except asking a few fellow designers ).
It was more of a general question, do we want to reference the three universities in the logo or not ?
@guenp I like the logo! Not sure about the font though - I'd suggest something nice and round like

(that font is Avenir, FWIW)
re: colors - I like the idea of keeping the university links (especially since we're dropping the internal capitalization) but just to be clear - the orange color isn't KU, it's QDev, so @spauka if you guys have a color for the quantum groups we could use that (though all I see is eQus blue that pretty much matches TUD/QuTech blue). I do like the orange + blue + gray - 66,66,66 is a little lighter than what you put there I think @guenp ?
@alexcjohnson did you check the license of that font? Cant find anything that says its free to use.
@MerlinSmiles no, good point. But anyway that was just a suggestion of a direction to go with the font. If we like round, google fonts shows some options like montserrat, quicksand, questrial... OK, I'd better stop before I waste too much time on google fonts :)
@alexcjohnson I like sleek and simple fonts too. maybe MS has one so we can show some MS-pride somewhere? :D
this is Century Gothic and (66,66,66) for the gray

Hmm, Century Gothic also seems to require payment. Of some others suggested as replacements, I like didact gothic
@MerlinSmiles nice idea, though I wasn't able to find any MS fonts that looked similar, let alone free ones... But if you can find one great :)
this is didact gothic:

stylized with smallcaps:

other color combinations (using MS colors, B&W, station Q):
      
Just FYI, Matt from Microsoft is taking care of this as we speak :)
