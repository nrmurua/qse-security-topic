Hi! Recently, I performed a Ramsey experiment in the IBMQX2 backend, using the following code (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/docs/guide/wwwq/decoherence) and obtained this figure:

However, Qiskit won't let me measure more times, and I like to observe the fringes' decay at long times. To do so, I tried to perform the same experiment on another backend, Burlington, but I just get gibberish like this:

What am I doing wrong? I'm just changing the backend's name, but I assume that is not the only thing I have to do. Could anybody tell me? Also, I know I can do it on Armonk with pulses, but I'm not interested on that. If there's another way to observe the fringes' decay at long times, I'm listening.
This could be related to additional coherent noise playing a role at long time frames. Are you running an echoed sequence? See here for more detail on how to estimate T2
Yes it should be valid for real backends as well. There is a difference between T2* and T2 times, and you may be running into coherent noise.
I'm replacing 'qasm_simulator' for, say, 'ibmq_essex' , but it yields an error. I'm also trying to use the backend lines of code from the cod I posted first, but it's no good either. What's the problem? Sorry if my questions seem to be very basic, I haven't been using Qiskit for too long. And by the way, thanks for your help!
Could you please post a stack trace of the error and how you are calling it? You likely are providing unnecessary settings to execute that are simulation only.
This is the code:
And this is the error:
Yes, please remove the noise model. It is only for an Aer backend. You want something like:
I see. The noise model is not necessary since I'm performing experiments on real backends. Thanks to your comment, I was able to make it work and measure T1 for Q1 on ibmq_london! However, I run into some troubles while measuring T2*: I use the following formula to calculate it theoretically from the T1 and T2 values for Q1 which appear in the backend's .csv on https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/:

According to that, T2* should yield 292 us for Q1 (according to Jul 17 9:21 calibrations, T1=49.639167544994976 T2=74.09267435485005). However, the T2* fit for the code returns T2*=15.7 us. Is something wrong in the code, or is it that Qiskit uses another formula to calculate T2*?
Also, the tutorial shows figures for estimating "T2 CPMG", what's the difference between that and T2 echo? Could it be related to my problem?
Here is the code, for which the fit returns T1 just fine:
I ran this following code three or so more times to obtain more statistics:

However, I plot T2* then and it yields a value different from my expected one:
Again, I run the following code for more statistics three more times or so:

IIRC, IBMQC  is reporting T2 in the calibrations and $1/T2* = 1/T2 + 1/T2_phi$ where parts of T2_phi are echoed away by the Hahn/CPMG sequences.
So you're saying the T2* in the definition I'm using is not the same that Qiskit uses?
Ok, I solved what T2* is the code measuring thanks to this source code: https://qiskit.org/documentation/_modules/qiskit/ignis/characterization/coherence/fitters.html
Anyways, I got the answers I asked for. Thank you very much for your help! I'd like to ask a few more questions, but I guess I'll have to open up another issue and close this one.
