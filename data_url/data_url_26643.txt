The SIRIUS regression tests fail with armv7l-gnu since the toolchain update to libxc 5.1.0 and elpa-2020.11.001. It seems that there are memory access issues:
Can you check where the memory access issues occur?
I tried valgrind, but there is no more information than in the regression output file. I will rebuild the whole toolchain. Maybe, sirius was built with the wrong libxc version.
A rebuilt of the toolchain resolved the problem.
I'm trying to add an MPI-enabled executable to the cp2k conda package and I'm seeing the same error Access to an undefined portion of a memory object in the regtests of the MPI executable on OSX (linux runs fine, also osx openmp-only runs fine, see here).
Any ideas what might be the cause?
archfile used:
Hm... I wonder whether the threaded -framework Accelerate plays well with MPI?
