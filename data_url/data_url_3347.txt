Newer linux distros (eg Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS) have libffi7, not libffi6, installed. Your linux packages appear to be built using the older version, and so the binaries cannot be run on the newer systems, eg

Hi @davemehringer, @adamglos92,
This has proved somewhat frustrating to fix in a way that will satisfy all users, and is somewhat low on my priorities of things to do. In the meantime, I recommend you use docker which will provide you a compiler that will work independently of your OS. You can run the compiler in docker with the command docker run -it -p 5555:5555 rigetti/quilc:latest -R and likewise for the QVM docker run -it -p 5000:5000 rigetti/qvm:latest -S.
Sorry for the delay in getting a fix out, and I hope the above suggestion will keep you going in the meantime.
