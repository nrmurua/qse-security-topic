At the moment, Strawberry Fields explicitly depends on tensorflow>=1.3, and this is stated as a requirement in both setup.py and requirements.txt.
However, due to the way tensorflow is distributed, and some deficiencies in how pip handles dependencies, this will conflict with the version of tensorflow compiled for gpu support, the tensorflow-gpu package. See here for more details: tensorflow/tensorflow#7166
Some suggestions in that thread include:
Option (1) complicates the installation slightly, and option (2) works better if tensorflow is an optional requirement of Strawberry Fields, and this is not the case.
Instead, I propose with each release version, we release two packages:
This allows the user to install the version suited to their needs.
In the meantime, if you would like to use tensorflow-gpu with Strawberry Fields, the best approach is to clone the GitHub repository, and install Strawberry Fields from source. Alternatively another workflow that should work is installing tensorflow-gpu, installing strawberryfields, and then uninstalling tensorflow.
Separate pip installable strawberryfields and strawberryfields-gpu are now available, mirroring tensorflow.
