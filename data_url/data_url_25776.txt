After starting all the services, the ui backend contacts the result service to get all the previous results, but that fails with the following error:
since the query is done multiple times, the logs are filled with this. It also leads to the following error happening when a dispatch is made:
There is a related issue with unpickling results objects. What we have found is that when the pickle object is created in a local conda env and POSTed to the results service, the service breaks if the service env differs from the local envâ€”which will happen in nearly all cases. That issue is tracked in #313
In summary
#335 (this issue) tracks the fix for GET /results
#313 tracks the fix for POST /result
confirmed fixed in #398
