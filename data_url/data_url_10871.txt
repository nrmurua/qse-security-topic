The FreeBSD package builder uses the --record {plist-file} command to record the plist. The recorded plist differs from the actually installed files:
As I don't use FreeBSD, I can use your help in correcting this.  Is there some change I should make to QMASM's setup.py file to pacify FreeBSD's package builder?
If you could you send me a pull request, that would be great.
You can run python setup.py install --record plist.txt and observe that the files there aren't the same that are installed.
Yes, that does provide the information.  Clearly, it's due to my executable scripts being distributed as filename.py but installed as just filename.  How should I fix my setup script to handle this case?
