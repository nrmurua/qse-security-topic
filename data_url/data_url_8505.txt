We have some problems with some of the conda-forge builds. It could be that there are conflicts with setuptools versions. Reading:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25337706/setuptools-vs-distutils-why-is-distutils-still-a-thing
Suggests that we should be able to all we need with setuptools. The general view is that it is 'better'.
Might be a bit of a fiddle, but could be worth the effort - maybe?
This will take a bit of work.  Especially since the docs are not so easy to read.  Just changing the setup import does not work as we use numpy.distutils for the configuration.
It seems that the work done #489 covers what we need. As in we use enough of setuptools already.
setuptools now included in conda-forge packages and building fine.
