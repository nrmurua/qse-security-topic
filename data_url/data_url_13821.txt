To represent a one-qubit Z-measurement, I create a green phaseless spider with one input / one output and set it as a ground. At first glance, PyZX can handle this just fine:
However, if I compose this graph with itself (zx.draw(g*g) then the second spider is no longer a ground:
I've verified this as well for larger examples where the two graphs are different:
Can you try #178 ? That should fix it.
