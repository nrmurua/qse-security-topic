Since the topic of the RFC template came up at the start of the meeting, I think it would be better to gather up all the accepted RFC's in one section.
Option 1 : List all of the accepted RFC's with links in this section of the docs where the template exists.
Option 2 : Wiki page
Feel free to add another option as well.
+1 for Option 1.
option 1️⃣
@purva-thakre , @andreamari, @amirebrahimi we can start by linking accepted RFCs on this issue.
Sure, RFC for REM is #1387. Did you want me to create a separate PR adding it to the documentation, @Misty-W? And is there a preferred format for the docs (e.g. bulleted list)?
We're just looking to collect the accepted PRs in this issue. Once they're all here someone can add them all at once. Thanks for linking yours!
Two additional accepted RFCs:
Dynamical decoupling RFC
Calibration generic plan RFC:
Learning-based PEC RFC
I will take this issue
