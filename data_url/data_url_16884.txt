The problem is seen in the two screenshots below: The cRz with theta=pi does not behave correctly as a ctrlZ in the phase kickbacks. I have experimented a little bit and noted that cRz(2pi) appears to work as a ctrlZ in the kickback scenario, and that cRz(pi) does appear to work as ctrlZ in a simple H->Z->H type circuit. Thank you.
cRz:

cz:

Here's the code for the two circuits.
crz(pi) circuit:
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[5];
creg c[5];
h q[0];
x q[1];
crz(pi) q[0],q[1];
h q[0];
measure q[0] -> c[0];
cz circuit:
OPENQASM 2.0;
include "qelib1.inc";
qreg q[5];
creg c[5];
h q[0];
x q[1];
cz q[0],q[1];
h q[0];
measure q[0] -> c[0];
The crz(pi) circuit result should agree with cz circuit result.
Hi, @gfpaulik. This is not a problem. The crz(pi) and cz are totally different gate, and the results you got are the expected results.
The definition of crz(lambda) is diag(1, 1, exp(-i*lambda/2), exp(-i*lambda/2)). So crz(pi) != cz. (diag(1, 1, -i, i) != diag(1, 1, 1, -1)). Although rz(pi) equals to Z up to global phase, it does not mean crz(pi) also equals to cz (because of the difference of the global phase in the subsystem).
Dear @itoko ,
Thank you for your response, but I am surprised to see your definition of the crz(lambda) gate. My understanding is that the control version of an rz(lambda) gate is diag(1,1,1,e^ilambda). This differs not only in the the interpretation of the phase argument but in the (3,3) diagonal value as well; the control version of a gate should not alter the functioning of the original gate. (I do not know why this font is in italics all of a sudden. It is not my intention, sorry.) An rz(lambda) gate is diag(1,e^ilambda), an rz(pi) gate is the Pauli-Z gate, and the controlled version should behave the same when the control is a "1":


Do you agree? What is interesting is that the crz() gate does not behave properly in the phase kickback circuit. Thanks.
In (the latest) Qiskit, the gate diag(1,1,1,e^i*lambda) is named cu1(lambda). The cu1(pi) = cz as you expect.
You can find the Qiskit's definition of gate matrices at
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/qiskit/fundamentals/7_summary_of_quantum_operations.ipynb
It says the definition of rz(lambda) gate is diag(exp(-I*lambda/2), exp(-I*lambda/2)).
That's the reason why rz(pi) = z up to global phase but crz(pi) != cz.
Note: Excuse me, I used big endian indices for matrix whereas Qiskit uses little endian. That's why the gate matrices in my previous comment apparently look different from those in the qiskit tutorial.
Dear @itoko ,
Ah, now I understand, thank you! At first, I was confused by your explanations because for some reason your gate definitions repeat the -i, as in diag(exp(-Ilambda/2),exp(-Ilambda/2)), when you obviously meant diag(exp(-Ilambda/2),exp(Ilambda/2)) or diag(exp(-Ilambda/2),exp(+Ilambda/2)). This definition explains the different results I was seeing: The gate has the same eigenvectors but different eigenvalues. Thank you for your help!
