Does cqm = ConstrainedQuadraticModel.from_dqm(dqm) correctly create the CQM equivalent of an existing DQM with fixed and/or varying bounds?

ConstrainedQuadraticModel.from_dqm() does correctly create a CQM from a DQM as stated in the docs. I do not understand the question about fixed and/or varying bounds. Discrete variables are categorical, rather than integral which means that they do not have bounds.
