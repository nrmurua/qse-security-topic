A lot of structural information about a program is lost during nativization / addressing: operations with simple matrix presentations get decomposed into long strings of suboperations with quite nasty parameter values. It could be that this is obscuring the compressor's ability to perform instruction elimination.
One might try to perform a compressor pass before nativization happens. The main obstacle to doing something like this is along the lines of #23: the compressor is not currently built to withstand many-qubit instructions, and without nativization we will have many fewer guarantees about the structure of the input program.
One would also have to write more generic rewriting rules, e.g., a limited variant of CZ-on-wf-with-partial-support that applies to controlled gates more generally.
