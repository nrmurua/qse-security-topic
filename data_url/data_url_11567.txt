Opflow has several places where its conversion to matrix is gated via a massive param that defaults to False e.g here https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/008337ec340946f5ef5872a60b5975096a6ec9bc/qiskit/aqua/operators/list_ops/list_op.py#L283
This is fine perhaps if directly working with opflow - however when coming from algorithms, such as VQE, such calls are inside the implementation that calls upon opflow such that the user sees ValueError getting raised but there is no way they can alter massive that the error suggests.
It maybe too much to expose such a param directly on these algorithms etc in Aqua - maybe having some global setting in opflow (or via Aqua using aqua globals) that allows control over such matrix conversion limits might be a more accessible solution that allows users to change this such that internal conversions can proceed (subject to memory etc which is the reason it was gated in the first place).
@woodsp-ibm , do we have an understanding about the priority of this issue?
