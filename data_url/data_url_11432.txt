We plan on integrating auto-differentiation but when it comes to a real quantum hardware, we need to get the gradients from an experiment.
In this issue we can discuss how to implement the following gradient computing methods from the recent work: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10299.pdf
The algorithms are outlined very nicely in the paper as:


We should also be able to allow for the simulation of noisy gradient computing/optimization.
