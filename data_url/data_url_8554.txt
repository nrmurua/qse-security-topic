The new random Qobj functions rand_ket_haar, rand_dm_hs, rand_dm_ginibre, rand_unitary_haar and rand_super_bcsz need to be explained in the Guide as well as in the apidocs.
For QuTiP 5 the random generators were reorganized. There are now fewer of them (without loss of functionality) and they're better document. We could probably still use a tutorial on them, but closing this for now.
