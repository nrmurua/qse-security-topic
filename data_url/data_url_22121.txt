Using the master branch, I cannot build a NIST_QC2 gateware that meets timing - this seems to be the case since the DMA core was added.
I am using the same build of Vivado as the build-bot (Vivado 2016.2).
The Vivado timing report is here
Any suggestions on how to get this to meet timing?
(I am actually trying to build a custom gateware with a similar number of TTLs as QC2, but without the DDS channels and get similar timing errors).
With Vivado, meeting timing or not is pretty random. I've just started a build on the bot to see if also fails there...
Considering where the timing fails in your case, I would consider adding a register or small FIFO into the data path to relax the timing and move the average performance that Vivado gets further from the timing failure point.
Yup, works on the buildbot. http://buildbot.m-labs.hk/builders/artiq-board/builds/553
I have now tried building this 5 times in a row, and all met with similar timing errors.
Do you know of anything that could make the build work on your build-bot and not on my system?
Generated the Vivado input files on the buildserver:
test_nist_qc2.zip
Double checking if those meet timing there, can you also compile them and check?
Turns out I also get the timing error when run manually, but not when buildbot runs it ...
Anyway, the proper solution is to relax the timing as explained above.
Fixed in 838127d.
