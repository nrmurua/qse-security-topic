If there is interest add this I can make a PR. I have the basic code below.
Application
Multiplication circuits have a common overall structure but could target different implementations of basic constraints, eg the CQM or a translation to k-SAT before encoding to QUBO
Proposed Solution
Factor out the large scale multiplication circuit structure from the implementation of the basic building blocks using the Builder pattern.
Something like:
Additional Context
This would simplify dwave-examples/factoring-notebook#22
