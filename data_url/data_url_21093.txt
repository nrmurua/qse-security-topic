Hey @peternijhuis
Thanks for raising this issue. We'll be removing the current web wallet very shortly, which will be replaced by our new portable wallet https://github.com/theQRL/qrl-wallet
Given it's slated for removal, we won't be working on a fix at this time.
We're publishing a blog post to introduce the new QRL Wallet very soon!
