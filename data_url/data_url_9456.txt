I'd like to discuss what should be included in our v1.0 version in this issue.
for those who aren't familiar with semantic versioning, v1.0 means the first release version, and all v1.x versions should be forward compatible. This should be tagged before we provide Harvard or other external users.
regarding CUDA, #23 is a non-breaking issue, so we can work on that in post 1.0 era.
currently, this interface should work on time-independent (Krylov based), time dependent (ODE solver based), CPU/GPU emulation. I'm not sure if we want other feature.
Thanks Roger. Please add your comments and thoughts on the discussion here. We would aim to discuss this Thursday/Friday or early next week. @GiggleLiu @corbin737
For longer conversation, of course we can use #software channel in Slack.
Some comments and thoughts from me.

I'm gonna close this since we have better organized list of todo now
