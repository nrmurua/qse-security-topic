Description of the issue
https://quantumai.google/cirq/operators_and_observables#noisy_channels has an output cell with this error message below the result:
it's in the expectation values section:

#4004 was seeking to address this. Also #4009.
This seems to be fixed and the warning no longer shows up on the page.
