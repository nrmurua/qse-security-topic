I would like to see what the Layout from virtual to physical qubits is without having to construct and run a PassManager.  i.e. I want to be able to easily plot something like this:

Even with a PassManager this is a bit unreliable right now, need to resolve #2066 and #1831 first and make all mappers consistent in how they use Layout.
During the transpilation process a few things can happen that can make the above visualization hard to achieve:
Yes, I should have been a bit more specific in my title.  I would like to extract the initial layout that is chosen without actually doing a full transpile.  i.e. I want to see the difference in qubit selection between DenseLayout and NoiseAdapativeLayout without transpiling both.
After #2736, the layout is saved as circuit.layout after transpilation. Is this solving this issue?
yep
Reopening, because #2736 was kinda reverted by #2928
Is this a 0.9 issue @ajavadia ?
This can be closed.
