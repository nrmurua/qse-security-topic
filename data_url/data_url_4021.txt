I find that the duration of the readout in my program is incorrect by 1 or 2 clocks.
Below is an example. 3 numbers of the config are relevant to understand what happens.
mw_pulse_duration = 20ns
flux_pulse_duration = 260ns
readout_duration = 2000ns
These numbers are ints in the configuration file.
I use this to generate some program of which there is a snippet below. I have added comments prefixed with # to the snippet to highlight what is wrong in the specified qisa.
Hi Adriaan,
I could not reproduce the bug based on your description. I tried to reproduce it with the following:
and I get this:
which seems to be according to what you are expecting. All buffer_buffer delays are zero in my configuration file. can you see any difference in the above compared to the code you are testing? OR can you share your configuration and code so that i can reproduce it?
