Rebooted 15 minutes ago. Is it helping ?
I still cannot connect to arroseur. Are we sure that ddns is still working?
i simply tried ssh arroseur.ddns.net
I believe the update of the dns that should run on my raspberry pi is down. I am working on it right now...
I think it should work now ?
It seems to work now
arroseur is still down, so repo master branch still indicates "build failing" while the code is provably okay...
