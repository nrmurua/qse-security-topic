Thank you for NixOS-QChem. This was a deciding factor to reinstall our HPC cluster using nixos/nixops with slurm. (25 nodes, 1G ethernet, NFS)
I am learning nix(os) on the fly. I managed to install slurm-tools using NixOS-QChem as a nix channel. I have failed to install anything with mpi, however, as I have no clue how to define that openmpi should be used for mpi.
I have found your PR and a seemingly relevant discourse thread, but still could not figure it out.
Please help me with a beginner oriented example and I will add a relevant section to README.md.
Glad to see that Nix is picking up steam in the HPC community.
To build an application with MPI just put mpi in your buildInputs. It is set to openmpi by default in upstream nixpkgs.
A relatively simple example is scalapack: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/d600f006643e074c2ef1d72e462e218b647a096c/pkgs/development/libraries/science/math/scalapack/default.nix
Maybe you can elaborate what problems you had with your MPI installation?
Has this issue been resolved?
Yes, this is solved. After a long suffering period I realized that it was a bug in 20.09, which caused an infinite recursion error when overriding mpi. I just did not assume the problem could be with nixos.
