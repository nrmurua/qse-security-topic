Implement algorithm from here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2975
The canonical implementation of this algorithm is in Haskell and is GPL-licensed, so cannot be used within Qiskit.
This would be useful e.g. for using the T gate simulator in Aer, studying error correction, etc.
Hello @ajavadia! this project looks interesting. Is it being currently worked on? I was interested in trying to work on implementing it.
Hi @PriyanshuPansari. Thanks for your interest. I know one person is working on this right now (can't find them on Github to tag).
I'd like to work on this too if possible, If that's okay with you, can you guide me a bit on how to get started? I am new to open source, although I have good experience in python.
I think this one is one of the harder open issues. It involves a lot of number theory and requires a compiled language for performance. So I think it's better to wait for the other contributor to make a PR first and then we can see what else needs to be done on top of it.
This is now implemented by @Jonathan-Ackerman in this package, and needs to be integrated with Qiskit
