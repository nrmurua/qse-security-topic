Hello, I'd like to use ScaffCC in my research, but I found some problems when executing braidflash.
First of all, ScaffCC/braidflash/Makefile is not working because it contains argparse.cpp file as SOURCE,  which is not existing on the directory.
So I tried erasing the argparse.cpp, leaving only braidflash.cpp as SOURCE. However I found another problems that ScaffCC/scripts/gen-lpfs.sh does not generate .lpfs and .cg file, which is necessary for executing braidflash.
Lastly, I tried to rename the files that are generated by the command
../scripts/gen-lpfs.sh ../Algorithms/Square Root/square root.n10.scaffold
to this.
square_root.n10.flat010k.simd.2.1024.leaves.local =====> square_root.n10.flat010k.lpfs
square_root.n10.flat010k.simd.2.1024.local.time ====> square_root.n10.flat010k.cg
but braidflash emits messages like Physical error rate is higher than the code threshold. Terminating.. which is quite suspicious.
Thank you for your awesome work. I hope my problems are treated soon.
