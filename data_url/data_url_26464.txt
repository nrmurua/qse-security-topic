I think this change is unintentional? As this option is still available for the toolchain script, but after 68e7d5f this option simply does nothing.
I can see that it could be an oversight because you are using up-to-date wget and therefore did not realize the necessity of --no-check-certificate. The truth is that the majority of clusters are running ancient version of linux and therefore pretty outdated software (my cluster even runs git 1.8, which is completely unusable). I do know that latest wget can be easily obtained by conda install wget, but I guess there are certain amount of people just don't do that. Please add this option back, Thanks.
