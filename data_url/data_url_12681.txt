There is also no check that the values are numeric until it hits the database causing an internal server error. The only safe guard is the HTML form that is easily edited.

Does this mean there should be a custom error page if the user manipulates the html and inserts text to metrics causing an internal server error?

A simple redirect to main page should be fine. Preventing anyone from causing errors is the important part here.
