Hey @AdityaRaj23 thanks for your interest in this! Apologies for the delay in replying. I see that you mentioned that you didn't see this error when you ran the suggested code which is interesting ðŸ¤” . Did you pull from develop and installed using pip install -e .? Because even though in the issue it says it failed on Covalent version 0.220.0, I still see the issue now on latest develop (which is version 0.229.0).

Hey @AdityaRaj23 , thanks for this but please create a PR so that we can discuss your particular implementation there itself ðŸ™‚. It will also make sure that it doesn't break anything else, since several checks are run automatically, and it'll also make it easier for us to comment on any of your changes. Thanks a lot!
