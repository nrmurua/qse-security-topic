If the config json file is not found, the python interface raises the wrong error.
Below is the traceback of running some tests (in pycqed).
The file not found error is correctly printed form the C++ running under the hood, however this does not "raise" the error (only logs it).
The error that is finally raised is
[openql] [x] error : ql::hardware_configuration::load() : eqasm compiler backend is not specified in the hardware config file !
Traceback below
Yes, it was because message was printed in C++ without throwing exceptions. Therefore, the next error message was also printed and the corresponding exception was thrown. Its fixed now in DiCarloLab-Delft@dd2df62 and I have also added a test to test missing config file in tests/test_exceptions.py.
