Heatmaps are often useful to visualize error metrics for qubits and couplers on the google devices. When selecting a subset of qubits to run an experiment on; it's useful to consult heatmaps of error metrics. We should add an option to the cirq.Heatmap and cirq.TwoQubitInteractionHeatmap so that we can pass in a list of qubits and highlight it on the heatmap. For example:

This can be done right now by manually specifying a different edge width and color for the selected qubits. For example:
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
Hello all, Is this still a needed feature?
@kris524 Yes, the feature is still needed and we would appreciate help!
Awesome! I will take it
Just to make it clear. We want to get something like this:
to reach the objective, correct? Also, what will the default values for edge_colors, linestyle, linewidths inside collection_options  be? Will they be None or those grey, dashed, 2
I think it has to be None because otherwise, we will always have this grid (without the red bit). But let me know what you think
One last question: Could you suggest a method for PolyCollection or something that could help me get the data in collection_options? This is for testing purposes (I want to compare the expected vs returned contents of linewidths edge_colors linestyle)
