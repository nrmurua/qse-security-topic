It would be nice if the qsim Cirq simulator tried to decompose gates it doesn't support into gates that it does, so that more general circuits can be passed directly to it. Is this a reasonable feature to add?
The qsimcirq interface should already decompose unknown gates to those supported by qsim:

There are a couple of cases where this is known not to work - some discussion of this is in #163. ControlledGates are a notable example of this.
Ah I was running an old version of qsimcirq. Oops. Thanks!
