Hello,I meet a question about [cp2k@7.1] Failed to execute the self-test case.
All my test cases fail, but I don't know the cause. It may be related to the missing part. You should check the related test configuration during the test. Can you help me check it?
[root@centos8 spack-src]# spack debug report
@Tom-python0121 this is definitely something which should rather be reported for Spack itself here: https://github.com/spack/spack/issues
But can you attach the file /tmp/root/spack-stage/spack-stage-cp2k-7.1-es7yeqm3jxfy7l353jj2zdu4mepc6g64/spack-src/regtesting/linux-centos8-aarch64-gcc/popt/TEST-linux-centos8-aarch64-gcc-popt-202-02-08_21-53-15/error_summary ?
ok, since this was reported for Spack itself closing it here
