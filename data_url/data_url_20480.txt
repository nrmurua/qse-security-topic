Any reason why Dilithium5 is not enabled in the https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh/blob/OQS-v8/oqs-template/generate.yml#L262 file? On purpose or oversight?
I don't recall any particular reason... unless we had also not enabled Dilithium5 in OpenSSL due to the constraints on the number of active signature schemes at one point in time...?
As far as I recall it was a random choice when doing #97: I enabled algs such as to get maximum test coverage while not adding too many algorithms (as I also think there's a limit in number of active sig algs): Thus, Dil5AES got enabled instead of Dil5. PR #132 changes this now in line with NIST decisions (also for Sphncs+).
Fixed by #132
