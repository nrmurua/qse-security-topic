When combining parfor with brmesolve and a time-dependent Hamiltonian, the compilation of the Hamiltonian seems to interfer with the correct functioning of parfor. The call results in an error, that the coefficient file is too short.
I guess this could also happen when using parfor with other solvers.
parfor should wait for the compilation to finish and then start the parallel processes.
No response
This won't be easy to fix, if the compilation is in the task, parfor cannot know about it to wait for it.
The simplest would be to have only the main process able to compile. This code will still raise an error, but the solution would be in the error message.
Otherwise communication between process would be needed and this can get tricky.
Also parfor will be removed. It says in its documentation to use parallel_map instead since v3.
@christian512 Perhaps we should try replace parfor with parallel_map in the notebooks and see what happens?
@Ericgig Should we just drop parfor in v5?
Yes, there is no reason to keep both parallel_map and parfor in v5.
I updated the notebooks to use parallel_map instead of parfor in qutip/qutip-tutorials#31.
I guess we can close this issue?
@christian512 Could you remove the "pre-compilation" of the Cython files from qutip/qutip-tutorials#31? Then if that works we can close this issue.
I removed the "pre-compilation" and it worked in the tutorial. Since we will change from using brmesolve to BRSolver in that notebook (see qutip/qutip-tutorials#31 (comment)) I will close this issue.
