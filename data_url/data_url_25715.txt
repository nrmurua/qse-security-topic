The SDK needs to be enhanced to support both local and cloud dispatching.
Check the diff between the latest SDK (v0.100.0 or somewhere near there) and the develop branch after the migration for a guide of what needs to be done.
There will also need to be some CLI updates.
One aspect of this is a change to how PyPi packaging works.
I'm proposing a change such that the local dispatcher is a separate PyPi package, i.e. cova-dispatch. Then that package is required by the main cova package, which only directly packages the SDK code. This way we can easily remove the local dispatcher as a requirement in the future when users pip install cova to connect to the cloud.
Before pushing any changes to the covalent repo, we need to document what changes should be made in this epic. Use the diff described above as a guide and write down what gaps should be resolved.
We want to always retrieve SDK via pip install cova if possible.
If not possible, documented exactly why and what we need to do differently.
We are not worried about running outside containers at this point.
We now have cloud dispatching with pip install cova==0.102.1rc0
The scope of this is now limited to documenting the gaps in the stable SDK release and designing what would need to happen in order to get cloud dispatch working with pip install cova. That can be changes to core microservices or changes to the SDK. We will document this now and add it to the cloud roadmap. No implementation should happen now, unless benchmarking is completed and we have time left in the sprint to take on low priority work.
