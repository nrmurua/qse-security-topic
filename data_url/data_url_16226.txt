When appending an object to a circuit there is a hasattr check for to_instruction to allow custom classes to define conversion to Instruction objects. This is used by many quantum_info operators for example.
This method doesn't need to be part of the public API for classes and could be replaced with a magic method such as __qiskit_instruction__ like other python class conversion is done for basic types and numpy arrays.
Hi @chriseclectic I would like to work on this issue.
I just did a basic text search in "qiskit-terra" and found total 100+ 'to_instruction' occurrences. So we have to deprecate "to_instruction"?
On second thought im not sure this is suitable for this case since other python magic methods are usually used in place of initializing an object (eg obj.__cls__() is equivalent to cls(obj)). Instruction however doesn't have this behavior from its __init__ method.
