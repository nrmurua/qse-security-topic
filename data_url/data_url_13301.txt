That's a good question, sorry it wasn't a little more clear! I think it depends on how you write the docstring and rename the function. If you put up a PR we'd be happy to provide some feedback directly on code!
@natestemen Sorry for the later reply. I have just renamed the built-in test for now. You can have a look at the PR above. I'll make any changes asap, specially if you dislike the name.
