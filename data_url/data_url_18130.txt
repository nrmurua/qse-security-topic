circuit_drawer() working on Windows machine
I tested the function tools/visualization/circuit_drawer under Windows and got an OSError at the conversion step from pdf to png using the poppler tool pdftocairo. Apparently pdftocairo was working properly, but what threw the error was Image.open and os.remove using just the filenames instead of a full path.
I could fix this by using the full paths to the .png images, i.e.
execute circuit_drawer() on Windows machine
@alfrisch - we have just merged #543, which I believe should fix the issue. Feel free to reopen otherwise!
