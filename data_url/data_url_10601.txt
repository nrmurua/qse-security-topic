The anneal_offset parameter "[should be] an array of anneal offset values, in normalized offset units, for all qubits, working or not." This is similar to flux_biases.
We should allow the user to provide them as a sparse dictionary rather than a list with missing values.
yes!!!
A dict would indeed be preferable. Eg., {qubit_name: offset}, where qubit_name is the variable name in the BQM and any qubits not included in the dict are inferred to be zero.
Ok, I took a deeper look, it appears that we currently only accept flux_biases as a qubit-linked list. But we do the abstraction in VirtualGraphComposite.
Proposal
Move the flux_biases abstraction to DWaveSampler and apply it to anneal_offsets as well.
