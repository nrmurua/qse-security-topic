When running on a QPU, measuring the same qubit 2-or-more times results in an IndexError in pyquil.api._qpu._extract_bitstrings.
Measuring the same qubit multiple times is admittedly a slightly odd thing to do, since QPU programs are restricted to protoquil, i.e. all MEASURE instructions must come at the end of the program with no gates interleaved.
I only noticed this while staring at the implementation of _extract_bitstrings in order to port it to a lisp project that needs something similar.
The crux of the issue is that we compile a list of ro_sources for the program, and then use that in _extract_bitstrings to munge the results returned by the QPU into the expected shape. The docstring for _extract_bitstrings describes ro_sources like so:
but then in the body of _extract_bitstrings we find
so when buf.ndim == 1, buf is reshaped into (num_shots, 1), but if qubit was measured more than once, meas_idx might be > 0 resulting in IndexError.
For example, for the program given below, ro_sources will be [(0, 0), (0, 1)], but buffers["q0"] will be a 1-element array.
