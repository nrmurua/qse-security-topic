ignis.characterization.calibrations.ibmq_utils.update_u_gates creates Y90 pulse with opposite sign.
original cmd_def with cmd_def.get('u2', qubits=0, P0=0, P1=0)

updated cmd_def with cmd_def.get('u2', qubits=0, P0=0, P1=0)

difference of FCs is because Y90 pulse is created from X90 pulse with FCs in updated one. but polarity of created pulse is reversed because FC phase are defined as a negative value in cmd_def.
Updateing cmd_def by Y90 pulses with the same polarity.
Reverse all FC phases to create Y90 pulses.
u3 has no problem.
