In #984, @jlbosse has improved our functionality for creating PauliTerm and PauliSum objects from their string representations. However, there were some underlying issues with the pyquil.paulis module before he started. He captured a collection of strings that do not work as part of the unit tests he added. One of them is the following, a pauli string which is just the operator without a coefficient. I think the behavior should be changed so that this is a valid string, and the coefficient should be assumed to be 1.
