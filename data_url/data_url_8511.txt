Hi,
Sometimes it is useful to write an hamiltonian in a charge state basis. This requires the basis to be able to run through integers from minus infinity to plus infinity. This is typically the case in this Qutip example notebook.
In this notebook, the author manually creates a numpy object and cast it to a Qobj. What about offering an analog to qutip.basis for such states?
Thanks
We do have the charge operator.
Indeed, it is in the code.
However, I cannot find any reference to them in the documentation.
EDIT: Ok, my bad, documentation and official pip releases are 3.1.0 and it seems to have been added recently :/
