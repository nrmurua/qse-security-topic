based on discussion #560, it will be easy to extend different types of variation if we had a common underlying implementation of variational forms. We had done that for the FeatureMap class, a general implementation of PauliExpansion.
For the current RY and RYRZ, they follow the same pattern:
a layer of single-qubit gates --> an entanglement block --> a layer of single-qubit gates ...
If we can simply build the structure and then let users choose what single-qubit and two-qubit gates they would like to use. Then, users can freely configure the variational forms within the scope of this structure. like Donny suggested my_vf = ShingledVarForm(1q='ryrx', 2q='crz')
Nonetheless, what is the common structure we should choose?
Closing as this is now a feature of the circuit function as moved to the Terra circuit library.
