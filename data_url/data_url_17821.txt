Trying to access the header of a Result or ExperimentResult object leads to AttributeError.
The backends (both Aer and IBMQ) should copy the header straight from qobj into result. Qiskit should use that to construct the header of Result and ExperimentResult.
After that, we should also get rid of the copy_qasm_from_qobj_into_result function. That info is already available in the header.
Hi @ajavadia,
thanks for clarification - it makes sense. When can I start to use job.qobj() ?
At the moment it produces this error:
jobObj=job.qobj()
AttributeError: 'IBMQJobPreQobj' object has no attribute 'qobj'

@balewski this is not available yet. It needs to be addressed at the cloud API level, and then Terra will support it as well. Probably a few weeks.
This is fixed now.
Hi,
I just run my code against ibmQX4 and still see jobObj=job.qobj() crashes.
Can you point me to documentation how to access
ran_qc=jobRes.get_ran_qasm(circuit_name)
Thanks
Jan
jobRes=job.result()
jobData=jobRes.get_data()
pprint(jobData)
print('Get circuit as executed on backend=%s'%(backendName))
jobObj=job.qobj()
job done, :

@balewski this issue was just about the job header, and that is working correctly.
The issue of getting job.qobj() so you can access a job's payload after submission is something we are working on. It may make it to the shortly coming release (0.7), but if not it will be in the next minor one (0.7.1).
I opened a new issue to track that: #1529
