Description of the issue
the order of tags in GateFamily._default_description() is not guaranteed to be consistent, because both _tags_to_accept and _tags_to_ignore are frozensets which get passed to list() in the f-string. Because this description is included in GateFamily._value_equality_values_(), this can lead to (what should be) identical GateFamilies being evaluated as not equal.
How to reproduce the issue
might require some repetition/modification to reproduce on different platforms, but this usually works me:
which will print the something like
where the two descriptions show the accepted tags in different orders and so the gate families aren't equal

Hi! Is this fix still needed? Could I please be assigned?
Thanks!
@chinmayee-vw Yes, this is still outstanding.  I've assigned it to you.
Yeah, we should only include the user-provided description in _value_equality_values_, which may be None, not the generated default description since that can be ordered differently.
@chinmayee-vw Do you still plan on working on this issue?
@tanujkhattar yes! still working on it.
@tanujkhattar I can take this issue up.
