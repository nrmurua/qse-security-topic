The README recommends the --user flag for pip install. This is generally a very good idea, but it seems like an attempt to avoid the generally accepted "right" way to isolate installed python packages from the system python, namely with virtualenv.
We actually provide a docker image which is a preconfigured virtual environment essentially. I'd like to hear some other opinions on this one because I am of the opinion that we want to avoid unnecessarily complicated install instructions, especially for those who are avoiding a develop install and are likely to be less sophisticated users. In other words, I think that most people who know how to use virtual environments aren't going to need our install instructions in the first place.

Agreed. It's unfortunate that virtualenv is still unnecessarily complicated, but I guess that's the reality of life.

be less sophisticated users.
So, in that case, why recommend the --user flag in the first place? Is that to avoid having to sudo?

Well, see issue #38...
Yes, its so they don't need to use sudo (we certainly don't want that). Regarding #38, I think the solution is to (as you say) remind people to first upgrade pip. I will do this on my next pull request sometime this weekend.
