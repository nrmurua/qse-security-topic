Code for Sensitivity Analysis in c3/optimizers/sensitivity.py is broken since it has not been updated with the rest of the codebase.
python c3/main.py test/sensitivity.cfg will throw a bunch of errors due to stale config files and stale code.
Implementing SET as derived from C3 might either involve making a new class derived from the base Optimizer which is then derived by both C3 and SET or leaving C3 as is and just deriving SET from it. This will depend on how different the two classes are.
