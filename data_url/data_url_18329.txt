The Quicklisp version of cl-quilc no longer compiles.  Here's a failure log:  http://report.quicklisp.org/2023-11-06/failure-report/quilc.html#cl-quil
Would it be possible to patch the 1.26.0 release to fix the problem?  The following pull request applies the needed patch to branch bump-version-1.26.0:  #906
After applying the patch, you'd have to make a new release or move the 1.26.0 tag.
