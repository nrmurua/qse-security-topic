Hello @1ucian0 please assign me here. Separate PRs for removing code & removing tests (if needed)?
Assigned. Better doing those in the same PR

@1ucian0 I located code as seen in screenshot for 'line 200' example. When you say 'remove deprecated code', do you literally mean erase lines 200 thru 219, or do I need to implement changes to 'def get_bit_reg_index()' function according to the commented section? Once completed, what is the best way to search for tests checking related deprecation raises which need to be removed?
Thanks for your patience and help on this.
In this context, "remove deprecated code" means remove the decorator (that deprecates the argument reverse_bits), the argument (line 201), the documentation line (line 208) and its "usage" (line 215).
Thanks for the input I'm going to revisit ASAP when I get a moment.
Sorry to delay - new CS teaching job & family keeping me very busy but working on this now, hope to send PR before end of weekend.
Lining up my solutions here before PR if I did something wrong please let me know
I located the deprecated code to be removed, removed the deprecated code, and now I need to remove deprecated tests if they only check the deprecation raise. I believe this happens in 'qiskit / test / python / visualization / test_utils.py' (lines 65-84) or 'visualization.py' (none). Is this correct? Are these the only locations to search for deprecated tests with regard to 'utils.py' 'visualization.py' and 'reverse_bits'?
It's hard to track suggestions as comments. Would you like to try with a PR?
Yes setting up now and doing this issue today/tomorrow send PR. I want to do it via Linux Terminal so going over some stuff for that now. I used nano to run a Qiskit program to generate a Bell Pair for the first time directly in Terminal that was fun. Lastly, I'll work out testing and send thx.
