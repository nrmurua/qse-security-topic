This is a follow up to #316, #1130 and #1158.
At the moment, CompositeGate is not used any more by the simulation and standard extensions. However, still lives in qiskit/extensions/quantum_initializer.py.
Well, it is a pity it is no used..
I wonder if there is another way to have automatically the inverse of a circuit and to control a big unitary composed by other unitary.
What is the right way to do that if it is not CompositeGate?
@Scinawa we are working on making a nice circuit interface that will address the needs that you describe. For now you have to write your own gate class derived from the Instruction class.
You can use the templates in here (see circuit_factory and controlledcircuit).
I think this can be closed via #1816. Feel free to reopen if that's not the case.
CompositeGate is deprecated and will be removed in v0.9.
Any Instruction can now be composed of other sub-instructions.
To build them, you construct a circuit then use
circuit.to_instruction().
