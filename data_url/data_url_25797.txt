The auto-generated supervisord.conf assigns the following port numbers:
queuer: 8001
dispatcher: 8002
runner: 8003
data: 8004
results: 8006
ui_backend: 8005
However, the results service is actually listening on port 8001.
Results service should actually listen on the port specified in supervisord.conf
I tried changing the default results svc port to another one (like 8008) to no effect; the results service still listens on 8001.
