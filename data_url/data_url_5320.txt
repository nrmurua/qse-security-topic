Qiskit has BackendV2 with some improvements on usability. We are currently using BackendV1.
The Provider page summarizes the changes.
The BackendV2 class re-defined user access for most properties of a backend to make them work with native Qiskit data structures and have flatter access patterns.
If necessary, using  might be a short-term fix, but we should upgrade to the new backend interface.
Also allows us to drop the "ugly" QasmQobjExperiment interface in the QFR and just provide the QuantumCircuit interface as the sole means for communication for exchanging circuits.
