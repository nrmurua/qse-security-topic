I have not been using qutip for a long time yet, so I apologize in case I am missing something stupid. I'm solving a simple problem with t-dependent Hamiltonian. I have simplified up to the point where the solution should actually just be a constant occupation of ground and first excited state. Here is the setup:
The crucial piece comes now:
I obtain two different results, the second one being wrong (and indicating that somehow 0.0*20.0 + 20.0 is not the same as 20.0).
There's a separate issue that I have run into but that's mostly harmless: to get consistent results, it seems that I have to choose the opposite sign for the coefficient function in the function-based version of including time dependence as compared to the cython based version.
Thanks in advance for any help.
Thanks for reporting this issue. It is a bug and I have created a pull request with a suggested fix: #216
In the meantime you can circumvent this problem by putting your string expressions within parenthesis (if they are more than one term in the expression), like this:
Fixed in #216
