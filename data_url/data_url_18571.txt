I had read the issue : #417
But it tell to install it from the link: https://downloads.rigetti.com/qcs-sdk/forest-sdk-linux-deb.tar.bz2
that i had done but the same problem came.
@notmgsk
Thanks for reporting this. I'll take a look as soon as I can.
@akshat-suwalka Can you try again with http://downloads.rigetti.com/qcs-sdk/forest-sdk-2.19.1-linux-deb.tar.bz2
@notmgsk Thank you so much Big B!
@notmgsk Can you give some explanation why earlier it doesn't work and now in this new version it is working and what changes did you make to correct it?
@akshat-suwalka I can try, though I don't know how helpful it will be.
Our Makefile has two interesting targets: make quilc and make quilc-sdk. The latter is like the former except that it disables some features in the compiler. In your case, it disables any dependencies on SSL. When we build and package quilc (and qvm) for the Forest SDK, we use make quilc-sdk because we don't want to introduce a libssl dependency for the user (you). However, I made a mistake in a previous commit to quilc that effectively meant that I was building and packaging the make quilc variant, and thus unintentionally introducing a libssl dependency.
You can see the fix here: https://github.com/rigetti/quilc/pull/636/files
Not sure how helpful that was. :)
