Evaluating gate sequences, e.g. ORBIT without giving an explicit initial state results in an error if there is no initial thermal state specified.
Run Experiment.evaluate_legacy(sequence, psi_init=None) without giving psi_init explicitly on a model that does not have "init_ground"in it's list of "tasks".

Use a ground state provided by the model.
