Currently the Result.get_node_result function would fail if Covalent is hosted on a remote machine as it calls Result._get_node_qelectron_data which in turn looks for the qelectron_db locally - which isn't there. We can fix this by pickling each node's qelectron_db over to the client together with the rest of the result object for now as a temporary solution. A more permanent solution would be taking advantage of the assets mechanism introduced in the upcoming memory improvements PRs.
