Extra single-qubit gates are inserted during KAK decomposition (when they can just be removed).
For some reason this does not happen in euler_basis='U321' but happens in other euler_basis.
It's just doing KAK on the CX gate in the CX basis. So it should just return CX itself.
However it returns this:
This is technically correct but inefficient. Those U gates can all just be removed.
If I change euler_basis='U321' then it works correctly and returns:
Those gates should not be inserted in the first place. They are hard to remove by subsequent passes as the transformation is not local.

Hey @ajavadia @levbishop ,
Just want to let ya'll know that we have run into this if that helps you figure out how to prioritize bug fixes.
