When running the last ibmq travis job (post-merge only) it will timeout because there is no output for 10mins. For example:
https://travis-ci.org/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/jobs/447516532#L958
Now that we've fixed the device name issue in the travis config just merge a commit. It will trigger this failure.
The test run will execute to completion.
ibmq is not tested in terra any more. So I'm closing this. Feel free to reopen if you think is still valid.
