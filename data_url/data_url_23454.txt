iPython version 8.10, qcodes version 0.42, Windows 10 Pro 22H2
It hangs instead of closing iPython. The terminal must be terminated.
I can reproduce this. Not sure what is going on but perhaps related to #3814
It would be nice to investigate if changing the monitor thread to be a deamon thread would also resolve this issue
Note that until this is resolved it can be mitigated by explicitly calling join on the monitor thread
I've tested turning the monitor thread into a daemon thread as you suggested, by passing the keyword argument daemon=True into the Monitor initialization. It appears to resolve this issue. I've also checked that the behaviour of the monitor remains unchanged by add QDAC2 voltage channels to the monitor, and it seems fine.
I don't know if there's any more testing required, but happy to raise a PR for this if you like.
@michaelc12qe In the long term I would like to come up with something slightly cleaner than deamon mode but I agree that in the short term using deamon is the best solution. So please go ahead
