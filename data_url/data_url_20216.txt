Hi guys! Love the project thanks for everything! I have been trying to build the Linux binary on Windows Linux (WSL Ubuntu Bionic Beaver), but for some reason it only creates 1 lib file "liboqs.a"
Where is the ".so" file?
Here is my build commands:
this creates a folder "lib" containing the file "liboqs.a" but no file called "liboqs.so"
EDIT
Nevermind I re-read the instructions for "liboqs-python" and saw that you have to use the -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON flag on the pre-build command cmake -GNinja .. to make the output not just the static library so the new command is cmake -GNinja -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
You guys can close this issue if you want.
For future reference, all CMake build options for customizing liboqs are listed in the wiki.
