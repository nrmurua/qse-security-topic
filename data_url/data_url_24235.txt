For qcomponent q0_q3d:
q0_q3d.edit_q3d_setup(setup_args=Dict(freq_ghz = 4.8, name = 'LOM_Sim', max_passes = 16, percent_error = 0.05))
The freq_ghz is losing the unit value (so it isn't GHz in the simulation setup, it is just left blank). This ends up breaking LOM analysis (as it looks for the Hz)
Explained above
freq_ghz  correctly updated during edit_q3d_setup.
