Hello, I read the '
Lecture 7 - Symbolic quantum mechanics using SymPsi - Semiclassical equations of motion' and re-run it's codes but I receive error in following line:
ops, op_eqm, sc_eqm, sc_ode, ofm, oim = semi_classical_eqm(H, c_ops)
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
 in ()
----> 1 ops, op_eqm, sc_eqm, sc_ode, ofm, oim = semi_classical_eqm(H, c_ops)
ValueError: too many values to unpack
what is this error?
This should be posted at the sympsi page not here.
