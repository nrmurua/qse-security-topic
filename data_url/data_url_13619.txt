As first point, just checking with @karalekas that the instructions were correct and precise, as you made the release. In case they are, the first item in the issue is ticked.
Checking over the instructions, they need a bit of updating. I've opened a separate issue (#388) to track that work.
With the two new issues that I just opened (#388, #391), this issue can be downscoped to just focus on automating the generation of PDF documentation.
I think we can close this now
This is the goal of this issue (@nathanshammah will complete for this sprint):
We could add a shortcut to the makefile with instructions to build the pdf, just like make docs from root is equivalent to cd docs/ && make html && doctest.
