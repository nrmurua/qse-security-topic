The __init__ method in the Trotter class at aqua/operators/evolutions/trotterizations/trotter.py accepts an argument called reps, but does not use it.
The code snippet below prints 1.
The code snippet above is expected to print 10.
The line super().__init__(order=1, reps=1) in aqua/operators/evolutions/trotterizations/trotter.py should be changed to super().__init__(order=1, reps=reps)
