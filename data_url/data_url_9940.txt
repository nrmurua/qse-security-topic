Description
I tried to install via pip but I got the following error even though boost is installed and BOOST_ROOT environment variable is set.
dimod/roof_duality/src/fix_variables.cpp(30): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'boost/graph/graph_traits.hpp': No such file or directory
Then I tried to install via source, but I got the same error.
This time I copied boost\boost_1_62_0\boost to dimod\dimod\roof_duality\src and it passed that stage, and after that it encounters a huge amount of the same syntax error, a sample of which you can see below:

How can I get past all these errors?
Environment
What command are you using to install?
Also, there is not yet a numpy wheel for python 3.9, are you installing that from source as well?
I'm using python setup.py install.
And numpy was installed after running pip install -r requirements.txt in the source folder.
If possible, I would recommend downgrading to python 3.8 until it is supported by more of the open source ecosystem and we can build wheels for it.
If you need to use 3.9, I'll need the full traceback to better diagnose.
I would really appreciate it if you did the diagnosis.
I have attached the entire log.

It looks to me like your compiler is too modern ðŸ˜„
If you change /std:c++latest in

It worked with std:c11, thanks!
(Although I suggest you add the same trick to the project's README or change setup.py altogether. xD)
Yeah, will reopen this until I can make a PR to fix the setup. Thanks for the bug report!
