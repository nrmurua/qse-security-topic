Should there be embed() methods for LazyTensor, LazySum, and LazyProduct that preserve laziness? The method would "embed" each of the component operators. For example:
To be honest, I thought there already was an embed for LazyTensor (but I guess I was wrong). Would be nice to have all of those methods, of course. Another thing that's also missing is an embed for directsum stuff, but that's a different issue.
I took another look. Indeed it seems everything is there, but something is going wrong: It looks like the identityoperator() method for the LazyTensor type is not working properly. For a LazyTensor O I get
LazySum is different:
Maybe we just need a parametric type in the first argument for the identityoperator() method for LazyTensor. For LazySum, we would need to add (tensor) products.
Mostly fixed in qojulia/QuantumOpticsBase.jl#51
