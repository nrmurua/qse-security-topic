In current master (even trivial) startup kernels hang, AFAICT after completing the run().
Tested with the phaser target at least from 708c25b to 15b48be.
This is not specific to startup kernels. The kernel CPU crashes in attribute_writeback and this happens with any kernel compiled with artiq_compile. You can reproduce the problem with artiq_run some_kernel.elf.
Thanks.
