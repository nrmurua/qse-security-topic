qiskit_terra-0.24.2-cp39-cp39-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.whl is missing in the qiskit-terra Download files.
qiskit_terra-0.24.1-cp39-cp39-manylinux_2_17_aarch64.manylinux2014_aarch64.whl exists here
look at pypi.org
Each release should produce the same set of download files.

It looks like the github action is still running to build it.
Thanks - we've restarted the wheel build.  Fwiw, if your AArch64 system hasn't been set up to be able to install Terra from source from the sdist, you probably want to specify something like
when attempting to install Terra to avoid this happening in the future.
The AArch64 builds are always going to take significantly longer than the other wheels to build, because we have to emulate the architecture in CI to build it, so there'll always be a period of at least a few hours between the sdist and most of the wheels hitting PyPI, and the AArch64 one hitting.  Even if our build succeeds on the first time (and it doesn't always, because sometimes GH times out the job), there's still a several-hour period where your CI is going to be unstable with your current configuration.
Starting from Terra 0.25 we're going to be deploying only CPython abi3 wheels, which will drastically cut down the number of wheels we need to build and deploy, which will make time-outs of the AAarch64 wheel-build job less likely.  They'll still take significantly longer than the rest of the wheel builds, though, so there's still likely going to be a couple of hours when non-ARM Linux wheels and the sdist are live on PyPI but the ARM Linux ones aren't for every subsequent release.  If that's a problem for you in CI, you'll probably want to put in some mitigation like the --only-binary option I mentioned above.
@jakelishman Thanks!  I'll try the option.
