A covariant feature map is described in this quantum kernel training paper. Include this circuit in the Qiskit circuit library.
It should likely live in the data_preparation package of the circuit library.
@mtreinish , we have discussed this issue. Feel free to assign me :)
Closing. The covariant feature map we had planned to submit is not general enough to justify including it in the library. Will revisit this when more examples of quantum covariant feature maps appear in lit.
