If the bug manifests in unexpected behavior (as opposed to a crash), confirm that you have consulted the
API documentation
The method hilbertspace.energy_by_bare_index raises an exception AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute '_parameters'
The behavior expected was for the output of hilbertspace.energy_by_bare_index(bare_tuple) to be the same as hilbertspace.energy_by_dressed_index(hilbertspace.dressed_index(bare_tuple)).
The error can be reproduced using the following code:
This code was also tested on the jk-ejectfit branch and produced the same error.
I can confirm that bug & will produce a fix.
Bug fix issued under 6790393.
@benmcdonough20 Please confirm that the newest master version eliminates the issue.
I checked out the jk-deprecations branch and I can confirm that the issue is fixed!
The newest master version still seems to produce the issue though. I checked the open pull requests and it seems like the changes haven't been merged into master yet, is this correct?
@benmcdonough20 Correct, still had to click on the "confirm merge" button. Done now!
