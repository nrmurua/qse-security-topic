Feature Request
The biclique embedding method  in busgraph_cache doesn't provide an option for chain_imbalance=(None or int) like the one found in the polynomialembedder for  tightestNativeBiClique and largestNativeBiClique. The new feature would allow:
The alternative right now means that the cache functionality and faster implementation in busgraph is only limited to balanced chains. And this is how it would look for Pegasus.
Using polynomialembedder
