Sometimes ZNE fits fail. This occurs more often when an asymptote is not chosen in PolyExpFactory or ExpFactory.
What should the right behavior be?
Raise an exception (like it does now, but perhaps with a clearer custom error).
Throw a warning and then default back to a linear fit using the same batched points. Linear fits are suggested as they are likely to give at least some answer without failing.
Something else?
Thoughts / suggestions? @andreamari @nathanshammah @tudorgt @yhindy ?
Sorry Will, could you paste a simple snippet with this instance so that I understand better?
Would it be fair to assume that users should be aware or held responsible of what they're doing? I'd throw at most a warning, but warning messages can sometimes be counterproductive, e.g., when occurring in loops they become annoying. A way to have both could be to include the possibility to suppress it (something like an optional argument like safe=True?).
Both options (1 or 2) are good for me.
Remark: the case without the asymptote is the only one in which we use a brute force non-linear fit. In all the other cases (even with order>1) the fit is obtained by solving a linear system and this is much more stable.
