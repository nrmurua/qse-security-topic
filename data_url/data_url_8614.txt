I think it would be nice to change the number of cpus to cpus_threads. I would image something like there would be a num_threads variable and then something like num_processes = num_threads_num_cpus, but that looks like it would require a lot of lines to be changed across many files?
I think that typically you don't gain much by using more processes than the number of cores, even if hyperthreading is available. In some cases you even get a performance degradation, so that's the reason why we dont default to cores*threads. However if you want to you can set the num_cpu flag explicitly.
