This is an issue
In CMakeLists.txt there are special options "BuildExamples" and "BuildInterface" that, once set to OFF, exclude the examples, respectively the interface, from compilation. By default they are set on ON and OFF respectively.
A cleaner option is creating different configurations (something like "full", "library", "debug") and call it with something like "cmake --full .."
I like this idea. I have created a new branch to develop a similar solution
Check if the CMake process uses features from version 3.15.
If not, lower the dependency to 3.11
This has been implemented
