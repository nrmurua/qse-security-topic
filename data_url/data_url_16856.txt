Hi @weiT1993 , thanks for reporting. I'm not currently able to replicate this. Can you post the full traceback along with your
qiskit 0.8.2 is a bit old, i'd try updating. though i don't recall this failing at that version either.
This is an issue caused by networkx 2.4 on qiskit-terra <0.11.0 (caused by chebee7i/nxpd#14). There are 2 ways to fix it either downgrade networkx to 2.3 or upgrade qiskit-terra to 0.11.0. I'm going to close this since it's already been fixed on the latest version of terra (by #3280), but please feel free to reopen if I'm missing something
