The manual should include information that answers the following questions:
-how are datasets persisted?  ie, do they go straight into git?
-is the dataset name the only unique identifier?  ie, can I overwrite an old dataset if I create one of the same name, or is there some timestamping being done to keep old versions around?
-what special characters can be used in the dataset name?
-are the all dataset-related functions in the artiq.language.environment module all available for use by kernel code?
