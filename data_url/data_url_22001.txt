More minimal example:
The call typechecks as the invocation of a user-defined constructor, but during ARTIQ IR generation, it is (correctly) recognized as a builtin and this odd-looking code path is taken: 
As far as I can see, we don't currently support string formatting on the core device, but this would be quite useful to have for diagnostic messages/… It seems like this should be easy to implement using snprintf and the existing polymorphic printing code – @whitequark?

I would much rather get rid of all C dependencies, they have been nothing but pain. And yes, polymorphic print code will have to be redone somehow, likely in Rust.
The miscompilation is now fixed, and I don't think str conversion should go into 3.2.
This issue is about the compiler crashing; string formatting is not supported and considering other projects that are funded and late (Sayma, DRTIO, etc.) we should not implement it for now. @klickverbot if you want it, please open a new issue.
