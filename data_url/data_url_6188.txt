Getting the noise model from a real device fails when the reported error rate is less than the error predicted by T1/T2.
Using device properties to generate the noise model:
noise.device.basic_device_noise_model(properties)
If the gate error rate is lower than the coherence limit, basic_device_gate_errors calculates a negative depolarizing error and throws an error:
NoiseError: 'Depolarizing probability must be in between 0 and 1.' 
Have a check for this condition and instead of throwing an error.  Then the easiest option is for the noise model to use only the T1/T2 error.
@sarah-sheldon did #243 fix this issue?
