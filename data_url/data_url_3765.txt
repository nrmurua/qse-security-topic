I am getting this error

I know that 403 Forbidden error means that accessing the page or resource I was trying to reach is absolutely forbidden for some reason.
Any clarification on the error and what causes it? Thanks!

Hey @andersy005 .
We've seen this error a few times from a few users, and so far, the problem each time had to do with either the name of the .pyquil_config file or the contents. Can you double check that ~/.pyquil_config exists (with no file extension), and that the contents are
where ABCABCABCABCABC_beta is your key? You can do a little test by just doing
instead of writing out a whole program.
Any update on this issue @andersy005 ?
@tarballs-are-good, Thanks for your help. I had configured incorrectly .pyquil_config file. I had named it .pyquil.config instead of .pyquil_config. The issue is resolved.
