You at least use pulp: https://github.com/lanl/qmasm/blob/master/qmasm/problem.py#L17
You need to declare them in 'install_requires' so that they will be always available, vs. only available by accident.
But as you see from problem.py, QMASM can work with or without pulp.  I don't want to require an obscure package like PuLP in a setup.py install_requires line because that would force it on all users, few of whom care about the QMASM functionality it provides (minimum-energy estimation).
I'm going to mark this issue closed, but do feel free to re-open it if you find other packages that should be listed by install_requires.
There are optional 'install_requires' statements too for the situations like this.
But aren't those essentially indicating "required if condition C is met" (e.g., a particular OS or a particular Python version)?
No, extras_require= is the optional dependency statement, and it is unconditional.
Usually, some features get enabled when they are present, or some default implementations in the code are replaced with external packages, like in you case, I guess.
So what are you proposing I add to setup.py?  Can you submit a pull request?
It's ok, no need to do anything.
