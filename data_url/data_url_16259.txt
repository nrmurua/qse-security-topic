Pulse duration accepts only integer values. The type check at constructor is too strict and always requires special care about dtype, i.e. parameter scan durations = np.asarray(16 * np.linspace(10, 20), dtype=int). This is very cumbersome and should be avoided. One approach is checking the number after decimal point and round the value with warning when rounded value exceeds some threshold, eg 1e-6.
