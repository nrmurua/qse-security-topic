Hi,
I just recently installed qutip on Canopy using a Windows Binary. When I try to run one of the tests, e.g. test_wigner.py, I get this error:
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
C:\Users\David Feng\Desktop\qutip-3.1.0\qutip\tests\test_wigner.py in ()
37 from numpy.testing import assert_, run_module_suite, assert_equal
38
---> 39 from qutip.states import coherent, fock
40 from qutip.wigner import wigner
41 from qutip.random_objects import rand_dm, rand_ket
C:\Users\David Feng\Desktop\qutip-3.1.0\qutip__init__.pyc in ()
60     qutip.settings.ipython = True
61 except:

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'settings'
The AttributeError also appears when I simply try to import qutip from the command line. I'm not too familiar with Python scripting so any assistance on the matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
It seems that you are running qutip from the installation directory. You should change directories first.

Thanks, it worked! I simply moved it to the library where third-party packages are installed in Canopy.
