I would like to simulate a circuit with the device noise model. I tried the following code
I got the following error
I tried the code on both the qcs and my local machine (with pyquil 2.1.1), and they gave the same error.
This is because there aren't noise models available for the Aspen-1 device. We need to generate and upload noise models (ideally) or provide better error messages (at minimum)
xref #726
any updates on this? I would like to run a simulation with the connectivity/noise model of the Aspen-4-16Q-A device but am getting the same error still
Hi @mpharrigan,
I can run the program below successfully on "Aspen-4-2Q-A-qvm"  but get a similar error message to the one above when I run it on "Aspen-4-2Q-A-noisy-qvm". Are there noise models available for Aspen-4-2Q-A? If not, does the noise model on 2q-noisy-qvm (which is working fine for me) use the noise model of the Aspen-4-2Q-A?
Thanks!
Zoe
