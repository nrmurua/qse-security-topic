Since the idea of qgrad is to extend autodiff capabilities using the existing autodiff libraries (like JAX) to a more general set of functions (quantum hamiltonians as Qobj in this case), a good first step is to produce a working tutorial of something in JAX that uses autograd. Pennylane qubit rotation tutorial seems like a good first step. Pennylane also uses autograd wrapper btw.
I am working on a notebook to cover this.
This may also be related, a notebook in Pennylane on VQE with quantum natural gradient, also showing it on the QuTiP Bloch sphere cc @quantshah.
Closing this on PR #10
