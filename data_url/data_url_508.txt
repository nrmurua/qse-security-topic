XACC deploy CI is failing, hence the DockerHub image is not being updated.
Root cause: some Theia dependencies require a more recent Node version.
Setting ARG NODE_VERSION=12.18.3 in the deploy/base Dockerfile fixes the issue. Looks like we also need to manually push this deploy/base image.
Ref: latest theia-cpp Dockerfile
