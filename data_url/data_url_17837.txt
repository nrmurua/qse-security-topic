Currently, running a circuit with a measurement (needed for a real device) does not work on the statevector_simulator.  The workaround would be to add a snapshot to the circuit and call the qasm_simulator.  However, snapshot is not recognized by the devices, and therefore one must construct two circuits in order to get a state vector returned and run the equivalent circuit on a device.
Perhaps just emit a warning that measurements are ignored in the statevector simulator.
I think it is bad practice to ignore instructions in the backend.
Why is it hard to do execute(circuit, statevector_simulator) and execute(circuit + measure, device)?
Actually if you want to drop instructions, I would modify the devices to ignore snapshot. That seems more "ignorable" than measurement. But I strongly prefer the first solution.
I think Chris and Jay also agreed but if you want to discuss this further please reopen.
