We are experiencing some intermitent failures at test.python.ibmq.test_ibmqjob.TestIBMQJob.test_get_jobs_filter_job_status (specifically, seems to happen at premium):

This seems to be because of the co-existence of different formats currently, and sort of accounted for - by 0.7, all jobs created and stored should have the same format. However, we should provide a cleaner way of dealing with pre-0.7 style jobs, revising the functions that retrieve them from the API (and emitting a warning if an old-style job cannot be parsed or similar).
lets just only work for the new jobs format
Per conversations with Ali, the root cause of #1372 seems to be a bug introduced by #1404. Despite Jay's comment of considering new jobs only, all the machinery for supporting the old format is in place. Fixing the root cause should be considered.
