Calibration data was recently added to the FakePoughkeepsie mock backend in #3060.
I had a quick look into this. I hope that was okay. :-)
It seems the algorithm of the NoiseAdaptiveLayout run is mostly correct.
At the step the algorithm fails in the above trace, the algorithm tries to find the optimal placement of a CNOT gate in the quantum hardware. The algorithm fails because it cannot find any such placement, since at this point all remaining hardware cx links are either occupied or have an error rate of 1.0. The algorithm regards a hardware cx link with an error rate of 1.0 as being completely broken and does not try to fit a CNOT gate into such a hardware link.
I suggest doing the following:
I can do 2.-3. but I do not know how to generate the JSON file that define the properties of a backend.
I added a pull request for 2. and 3. :-)
The pending part is the item 1 in #3124 (comment)
I'm tagging this as a good first issue
Are we waiting for @ajavadia to regenerate the backend properties for Poughkeepsie, or are you looking for someone to submit a pull request editing the backend properties file: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/test/mock/props_poughkeepsie.json with dummy values of considerably less than 1.0 edited in for the CX gates?
@1ucian0 On retrospective, this might not be a good first issue since the poughkeepsie backend can not be accessed by all new users...

I dont think poughkeepsie exists anymore, independently if you type of account.
The goal is to set some realistic calibration data. And to have a proper error handling in NoiseAdaptiveLayout.
Ok i updated Poughkeepsie's properties in #3226
