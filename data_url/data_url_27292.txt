This is low priority for now, but I am leaving this issue open to come back to later to include tensor product methods for multi-partite systems and partial traces for working with subsystems. Something like tensor() and ptrace() in QuTiP
Would be nice to also include rand_dm, rand_ket, and rand_herm
Also include a unit method to normalize a ket
QuTiP's tensor remembers the dimensions of the subsystem for partial traces
