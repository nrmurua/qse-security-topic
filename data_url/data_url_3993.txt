The uniform scheduler (also called balanced scheduler sometimes) is practically finished. It performs very well within its scope, but sometimes still gives some artifacts at the beginning of the executable. We could make a simple pass that, after uniform scheduling, aggressively cuts bundles above a certain threshold at the cost of added cycles. In that way we can guarantee that there are no spikes in the bundle sizes up to a certain threshold.
For cc_light on s7 and s17 and probably also for s49, this is not an issue.
In those, we would prefer having all Preps in one cycle as they could then be combined in a single instruction with a mask with all qubits set; this is done by the compiler after proper scheduling.
This would leave only a single instruction in a bundle.
We can leave this as a low priority task if the new found problem in the uniform scheduler will be fixed.
