I updated the kata with the instruction but when from version 0.11.2003.3107 to 0.12.20070124 but when I run the same code in the new notebook (after having updated iqsharp and installed it again) it returns Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Quantum.Standard, Version=0.11.2003.3107, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=40866b40fd95c7f5'. The system cannot find the file specified.
Looks like there are still some binary leftovers from the previous version. Can you try deleting bin and obj folders and running the notebook again?
Thanks, for the answer, had this problen before and I forgot how I fixed it.
