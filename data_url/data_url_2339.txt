This was an issue with the can_serialize_predicate from a dependency where the can_serialize_predicate didn't look to see if a certain parameter was a Symbol.  The gate set only allowed discrete values of the parameter, and so could not support serialization.
Closing now since this wasn't the code in Cirq's fault.
One question it does bring up is that there are gate sets that are serializable only when combined with information in a parameter sweep.
