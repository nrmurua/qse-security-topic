When using the Qobj.permute function for a specific state and specific permutation we encounter the isherm-property to be set to False, while the state is Hermitian nevertheless.
I attached the most minimalistic example I could built.
There we calculate a permutation of a small compound state that sets isherm=False, another one that works properly and a transformation (double transpose) that "repairs" the Qobj and sets isherm=True again.
A double transpose of the state is our current work-around. With isherm=False you cannot calculate the partial trace of the density operator describing the state.

Hi llorz1207,
Thank you for raising this issue.
Instead of doing the double transpose you can do permuted_Qobj.data.sort_indices().
Issue: Qobj.permute does not sort csr_matrix indice.
