I've come to think that use of radians for things like phase angles would lead to more readable code. Specifically, presence of pi in an expression acts as a "unit", hinting the reader that the quantity they're looking at is an angle.
Such values would also be directly comparable to expressions encountered in textbooks, papers, blogs etc.
OTOH, counting turns leads to values that are easier to mix up with other quantities. Also, it's generally unclear whether we count full turns or half turns.
This issue proposes to replace all turns and half turns with angles in radians, i.e. expressions like
would become
Thoughts?
Where do you want this? In the constructor of gates? Is is similar to the difference between XPowGate and Rx?
