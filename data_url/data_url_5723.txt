In https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit_aer.AerSimulator.html, there is a wild ~:

And a missing <p>:

There are also some missing options, like accept_distributed_results. Probably worth checking if all the options in all the methods are there
Can I be assigned this please?
Ive sorted the rogue ~
I found a missing fullstop
Im not finding where the missing < p > belongs, I see no reason there isnt a break when compared to the other parts of the code
Is there anyone that can help me find the definitions of the missing methods and help me idenify which need definitions, as I see mps_omp_threads does not have documentation but is in the method list. No worries if I do not know enough and cant assign or help me
@2003jblake We are always welcome for anyone to send PRs.
Can I work on this issue?
Hi, @1ucian0. According to #380 class SnapshotProbabilities is not relevant anymore after 0.11 release. Therefore, probably one of the option can be remove reference to this type from documentation at all or replace it to a new type such that https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/main/src/simulators/stabilizer/stabilizer_state.hpp#L50 (usage https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/main/src/simulators/stabilizer/stabilizer_state.hpp#L227).
Also I found a similar reference to SnapshotProbabilities here https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/stubs/qiskit_aer.QasmSimulator.html.
What option do we prefer more?
Regarding the issue
And a missing <p>:

The reason in CSS styles from qiskit_sphinx_theme https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit_sphinx_theme/blob/1.10/qiskit_sphinx_theme/static/css/theme.css#L10595. The best option just to wait until new version of qiskit_sphinx_theme will me merged to main branch by this PR #1822 which should fix current issue automatically see https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit_sphinx_theme/blob/1.12/qiskit_sphinx_theme/pytorch_base/static/css/theme.css#L10596.
@hhorii it looks like a PR has been accepted here, but it's not clear who should be awarded the bounty. Is this issue now complete?
Also, remember to assign the hackers who should receive the bounty to the issue so they can be awarded properly!
@1ucian0 or @hhorii, can you assign current issue to me? Thanks.
Hmmm, maybe due to configuration of this repository or organization, I cannot assign contributors to this issue. I would like to assign @Innanov and @TerraVenil to this.
@hhorii it looks like @1ucian0 was able to assign the hacker in #1632, so maybe he has admin privileges which allow him to do this?
hi @Innanov, can you comment on this issue so I can assign you?
yes, please, thank you
Should this issue be closed now? Our system does not recognize the bounty as complete since the issue is still open.
