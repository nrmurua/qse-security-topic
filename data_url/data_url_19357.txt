I am trying to run QAOA but my mixer Hamiltonian is more complicated as it involves multiple target qubits.
The above code works. However, if I create a more complicated mixer as follows
I obtain the following NotImplementedError: Unitary gate supports one or two-qubit gates when using custom operators, but 3 target qubits were given. Please switch to a different backend to execute this operation.
I hope that we can allow more complicated mixer hamiltonian.
@shangtai which backend and version are you using?
I just tried the example on the qibojit backend, version 0.0.4, and it works (since custom multi-qubit kernels were added in this release).
Hi @DiegoGM91 , thanks. I  tried qibo.set_backend("qibojit") May I know how do I set the version number for the backend?
@shangtai you cannot set the version numbers as these depend on your qibo installation. Did you install qibo via pip? If yes, then you can do
to get the latest versions of qibo and qibojit.
Note that you don't need to do qibo.set_backend("qibojit") as qibojit will be the default backend (if it is installed).
Also, note that if you try the qaoa.minimize() method, it won't work now because the mixer Hamiltonian has support on 3 qubits, while the problem Hamiltonian has support on 4 qubits. We will fix this issue in future versions of Qibo.
For the time being, you can solve this by adding these lines to your code:
