In colab.research.google.com in a python3 notebook run
!pip install cirq==0.5 --quiet
results in
ERROR: albumentations 0.1.12 has requirement imgaug<0.2.7,>=0.2.5, but you'll have imgaug 0.2.8 which is incompatible.
So this isn't coming from any of our pip installed components.
I get it in colab because they have a newer version of imgaug but also albumentations.
I imagine this has persisted into 0.6?
This still exists in 0.8:
ERROR: albumentations 0.1.12 has requirement imgaug<0.2.7,>=0.2.5, but you'll have imgaug 0.2.9 which is incompatible.
Correction, this no longer appears when installing cirq 0.8.  Closing
