This is an issue to contain tracking comments from the new nightly CI runs of the full test matrix.  Maintainers can subscribe to this issue to get notified whenever the nightly CI encounters issues.
Oversubscribed VM, nothing to worry about for us.
Oversubscribed VM again.
This failure looks like a potential transient failure in the new quantum Shannon decomposition in #7907.  Perhaps the test or the decomposition are slightly buggy.
Dodgy network connection on a VM - not an actual test failure.
The last five failures (while I was away on leave), numbered from oldest to newest:
This was only in Windows on Python 3.10, which is also tested in the PR CI and passed. We might want to keep an eye on that, in case it happens again.
Oversubscribed VM.
A stochastic failure on the Windows Python 3.7 job:
Strange build/install failures within matplotlib
Issues caused by setuptools 64.
This most recent failure is the same as point 3 in my previous comment, and I've seen it in several PR CI runs as well, so we definitely need a fix.  Tracked in #8577.
Oversubscribed VM.

The nightly azure jobs are failing now with Python 3.12 because pyzmq doesn't support Python 3.12 yet and is a requirement of the jupyter stack.
It also looks like the azure nightly jobs haven't been commenting here since the repo rename, there's probably a config issue around that.
The Azure nightly jobs use some particular path through the GitHub REST API to retrieve the correct thread to comment on and then to comment - I wouldn't be surprised if some component of that chain doesn't handle the redirects through the renaming.  Should be an easy fix, at least.
