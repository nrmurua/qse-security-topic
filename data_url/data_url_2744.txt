Qubit represented by integer/index rather than name or co-ordinates.
Used in pytket, can merge in if useful generally?
Implemented at ss2165@cd83e62
Thanks for the suggestion. We actually already have this; we just call it LineQubit instead of IndexedQubit.
In the future, feel free to make a pull request from your forked repo's branch into this repository instead-of / in-addition-to opening an issue. Maintainers love it when you state your feature request in the form of a pull request.
Since we have a similar class, I will tentatively close this issue. One possible difference between the two is that LineQubit implies (but does not enforce) nearest neighbor connectivity.
I was aware of LineQubit but thought of it in the same local sense as GridQubit (i.e. the identifier corresponds to a location) and wanted something more abstract like NamedQubit. But they do the same job, so I'll switch my implementation to use LineQubit.
