The new Materials lab at MDCC has requested a driver for a DynaCool PPMS.
The DynaCool PPMS is a cryogenic probe station controlled by a dedicated PC on which (almost) no auxiliary software may run. The dedicated PC runs a GUI application controlling the probe station.
I've spoken to one of the scientist about this, and we've agreed to write a python server that will run on the dedicated PC and make calls via Windows' COM interface to the application. The QCoDeS driver will thus interface with the server.
