Since serialized BQM et al. data is not compressed in dimod anymore, look into benefits of compressing in transit.
DQM.to_file() supportes compress, it would be pretty easy to add it to CQM/BQM if desired. Would need to measure the performance
That would be nice. If all supported compress flag, we could use it by default from the client.
Sure, made an issue dwavesystems/dimod#1235.
I do wonder what the memory/time cost of compressing the overall model rather than the individual parts in multi part upload. Obviously compressing the overall object should lead to better compression, but I would also expect it to be slower.
Benefits also heavily depend on network speed. On (very) fast networks, using anything except the simplest/fastest stream compression is probably not worth it. But we upload in parallel, so that tips the balance back... Hard to tell without some benchmarks. "Optimal" upload parameters will definitely be informed by benchmarks.
