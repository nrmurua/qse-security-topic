I just navigated to https://github.com/rigetti/grove/blob/master/docs/qaoa.rst to grok the QAOA module.  The page displays a bunch of LaTeX or markup unrendered, so it's very hard to see what's intended.  E.g.,
"can be written as follows: $$\sum_{e \in E} w_{e} \cdot \mathrm{Pr}(e \in \mathrm{cut}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{e \in E}w_{e}$$"
and
"interpolation between the two operators \begin{align} \hat{H}{\tau} = \tau\hat{H}{\mathrm{ref}} + (1 - \tau)\hat{H}_{\mathrm{MAXCUT}} \end{align} where (\tau) changes between 1 and 0. "
I'm using Chrome Version 74.0.3729.169 (Official Build) (64-bit) on macOS.
P.S.  Works the same on Safari.
Have you looked at the version at https://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
The math renders properly at ReadTheDocs.
I had not looked at the ReadTheDocs version; the fact that it renders properly is great.
I'm not sure how the ReadTheDocs .html version rendering properly makes up for the .rst file noted in the original comment not rendering properly.  To my way of thinking, .rst files are, by definition, intended to be visually correct, and that one isn't.  Isn't a better response to fix it to render properly?
