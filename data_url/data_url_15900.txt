Drawings of circuits with custom instruction using output mode text,
where the instructions are given bits in non-ascending order,
results in overflowing box representation.

Other output options do not support classical bits at all.
All instructions should look like the first shown in the picture.
Sort given bits for drawing (non inplace).
Hi @TimAlexisKoerner . I believe this issue has been resolved in PR #6242 . You should be able to see the fix in Qiskit Terra version 0.18.
Thank you for the notification, i will close this issue.
