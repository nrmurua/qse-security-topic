Using IBMQ Job Manager to aggregate a large number of circuit's return distributions for generating a data set to train on calculated fidelity. Circuits should return a histogram of outputted states, but only return 00000 as if there is hidden optimization happening.
The only gates used are H, Z, and CX, per the requirements of our project.
(Circuits all are themselves stacked with their mirror -> identity operator).

Get a distribution of output states for each circuit - implying the presence of noise.
Not sure.
Sorry for the late reply. Could you please paste the code you used ? I do not have access to your file in the IBM Quantum Lab.
We resolved this. Thank you!
