There is a current stopgap notion in CL-QUIL of an "environment", which is some kind of data structure in which gate definitions can be looked up. This has been partially supplanted by name resolutions and the gate-matrix field of an instruction, but I fear that this is probably not quite what we want. It is not uniformly treated well in the "old" (i.e., front-end) part of the code.
