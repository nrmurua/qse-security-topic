I've needed to validate input wavefunctions and density matrices in a few functions that act on input states (e.g. linalg.wavefunction_partial_trace_as_mixture, linalg.subwavefunction, ops.PauliString.expectation) but can't import to_valid_state_vector and to_valid_density_matrix at the module level without causing a circular import (sim imports from linalg and ops).
It might make sense to move these validation functions out of sim to clean up the dependencies here and for future functions that need to check the validity of an input state
xref #1975
These have been moved to the qis module.
