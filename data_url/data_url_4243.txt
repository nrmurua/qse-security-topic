Because most activity happens on develop, it's usually the one I want to be looking at / merging into / etc. For looking at specific releases I'd go to the release tab and see the tags.
Yes, but I think having the release branch as default makes it easier for less experienced users.
I suspect that most inexperienced users are just going to pip install projectq. If someone wants to check out the repo from github to run from source, they already need to know something about git, etc. In that case it's not too hard to checkout a particular tag if you want a specific version, but I would think the more common thing is you want to have the latest pre-release code.
I agree with Matthew. People expect a github repo to be centered around development of the code.
For example, sampling from ProjectQ's own dependencies:
Suffice it to say it's a pretty common convention. Apparently people go even further and call the development branch 'master'. Google also develops code this way, with everything constantly merging into a master trunk.
I do not care much what happens with ProjectQ but I feel very strongly that FermiLib should default to the develop branch.
We can just add a statement to the 'getting started' section for people who don't know github but can't use pip (might be blocked by the employer).
