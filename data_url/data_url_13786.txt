Folding functions should ignore measurement gates and continue to try to fold other gates. No unit tests currently check circuits with measurements in them.
We should think how to do the global unitary_folding in the case in which we have measurements in the middle of the circuit (final measurements can be removed and re-appended after folding). Maybe, in this case of intermediate measurements, global folding is just impossible and we should only raise an error.
Will and I briefly discussed the possibility of new theory for folding circuits with intermediate measurements, but for now I think raising an error is the right thing to do. (And to ignore terminal measurements while folding.)
I believe this was closed by #35
