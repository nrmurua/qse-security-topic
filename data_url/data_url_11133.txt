For instance, in number_operator. I think a True/False flag is much more intuitive and pythonic. @josh146 @babbush
That makes sense! I can't quite recall my original thinking, maybe I chose a numeric parity flag just in case (at some point in the future) OpenFermion decided to implement something more exotic, like anyons?
@kevinsung what is the status of this issue? I can make a quick pull request if it is not already waiting for a merge
Please, go ahead.
I believe this is changed.  number_operator input line is number_operator(i, coefficient=1., particle_hole_symmetry=False) @kevinsung should this be closed?
@ncrubin The definition of number_operator is not what you said; it's actually 
This issue has not been fixed.
@kevinsung LOL there are a bunch of number_operator functions.   Apparently I pasted the one you and Bryan wrote a couple of years ago.  4c0df2e
Oh, it looks like that one should be marked private, since it was defined for use in the file that contains it (and not exported).
