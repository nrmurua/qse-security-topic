other here is supposed to be QuantumCircuit object.
When qubit=None, clbit=None, this function should run successfully.
QuantumCircuit object has the attribute "num_qubits".
Or variable "other": QuantumCircuit be converted to DAGCircuit object which has an attribute "num_qubits", execute the process above, then reconverted to QuantumCircuit again.
I'm not certain what bug you're talking about here - I don't get any error when I run your code sample on Terra 0.18.3, and the circuit produces what I expect:
From the error message it looks like the input to compose was not a circuit but a QuantumRegister. I can also not reproduce this issue so I'll go ahead and close it. Feel free to reopen @rum-yasuhiro if we're missing anything here!
