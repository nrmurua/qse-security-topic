So how to get block template? On medium you claim
ability to mine in existing pools, using existing mining software.
There is no rpc documentation, after quick code search I see that there is no even a trace of this functionality.
Mining pool integration is something that we are working on at the moment.
What you are refering to is the complete feature set. We will have the JSON-RPC interface for the mining pools soon.
I noticed that you've been also actively developing mining pools. Maybe we can cooperate and help you with the integration. Feel free to contact us or join our Discord channel.
I am banned on qrl reddit, discord, slack... Just thought beta is beta, where feature set is already sealed. I have no plans in visible future to develop a pool for this algo, if you claim it will work with existing pools it will also work with my solo stratum which is available for free and will probably require only small changes. My policy is to charge exorbitant amount of money from ICO projects, never reached an agreement so far lol.
We will have the JSON-RPC interface for the mining pools soon.
How soon is now? There is literally nothing for devs not familiar with this code to play with rpc. Is it too hard to provide a markdown docs with 3 API calls described?
Here is the node-cryptonote-pool which has been modified to work with QRL codebase.
https://github.com/cyyber/node-cryptonote-pool/
Following is the customized QRL config.json file for cryptonote-pool (make sure to update pool address)
https://github.com/jleni/qrl_dpool/blob/master/config.json
Offtopic, how to join testnet from master branch or maybe launch a private one?
You need to wait for next hard fork. We have not yet hard forked network with latest codebase that supports pool mining. Although if you are interested, you can run your private network to establish the pool and setup all other stuffs related to pool mining.
That's what I am asking for, any documentation?
If you would like to start your private one, you need to override the configuration file.
https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/blob/master/README.md
This above link includes how to override config.json
Just override peer_ip list in config.json.
Use following command to start your testnet with much less pain.
qrl wallet_gen
cp wallet.qrl ~/.qrl/

I see no http endpoint changes in your node pool fork, definitely missing something. or I am getting malformed reply due to some weird qrl node state?
You need to run this grpcProxy.py
https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/blob/master/qrl/grpcProxy.py
This will support HTTP endpoint at port 18081
Consider different port for RPC, it's a conflict with Monero, there is no reason to copy rpc port if you decided to use same algo. It's confusing and annoying, some pools will definitely run both on same server.
We will make these ports configurable, nothing will be hardcoded, and sure, will look for other ports to avoid conflict.
So this rpc service is not a part of default application? You can really make many lives easier if mining rpc will listen on 127.0.0.1:PORT by default without tons of configs. There are tons of coins and every need to add their own "special things".
Yes for now the rpc service is not a part of default application. But will be added soon.
python3 qrl/grpcProxy.py
Why not /home/CURRENT_USER/.qrl ?
Missing payment_slaves.json is also confusing, where to get it?
Just remove the peer_ip in config.json
There is no config.json, there is config.yml in ~/.qrl. And there is no peer_ip param in it.
You need atleast two nodes, to set it up correctly.
One of the node will be a mining node, but will not be running grpcProxy.py.
You can directly start that node using command
qrl --randomizeSlaveXMSS
The another node should be a node with pool service enabled.
You may use following command into the 2nd node (running pool service).
qrl wallet_gen
qrl -r --host 104.237.3.185 slave_tx_generate
(make sure you enter access_type 1 )
move the newly generated slaves.json into ~/.qrl/
qrl -r --host 104.237.3.185 slave_tx_generate --otsidx 1
(make sure you enter access_type 0 )
rename this file from slaves.json to payment_slaves.json and move it to ~/.qrl/
Now run your node, wait for the 2nd node to start mining. As soon as it successfully starts mining, you need to stop the node. Override config mining_enabled to False
This will stop your node from mining alone.
Restart the node.
In order to override config. you can copy the config.yml from
https://github.com/theQRL/QRL
The default config.yaml is already mentioned there.
You can create the file ~/.qrl/config.yml
and override any of the above mentioned settings.
Once you have done this, there is no need to keep running the 1st node that you started. You can surely shut it down and let the pool continue mining.
But it still need '/home/.qrl/payment_slaves.json' and ignores current user.
I have mentioned above, how to generated payment_slaves.json
Read again, my last comment.
Haven't you see that it want /home/.qrl VS cirrent /home/ME/.qrl?
You can move that to /home/.qrl/
instead of what I mentioned above
Maybe it requires a fix instead?
Before the hardfork yes, processes will be simplified from what it is now.
Ok, I am done, 8 months after scamming people with ICO you ended up with defunct script.
Good luck

perhaps try send it valid json?
you're missing a brace at the end of what you're sending.
@barrystyle I am not missing a brace, only in my post it's not valid. I am using my existing stratum with this crap and it simply does not support reserve_size which is required for job distribution otherwise same job goes to miners and they will hash same job.
You can see 00000000 in a response, here you will put a nonce from miner, but another reserved zero bytes needed to set a pool nonce and then send this job to miner. So basically, current state of QRL is that you need to run a pool per miner which is just retarded.
This commit of him demonstrates that they simply have no clue theQRL/node-cryptonote-pool@2edca30
With extra nonce option nothing will work, without extra nonce pool is not a pool.
@sammy007 Aware of that, work in progress with it.
Okay cool. Thanks. I don't understand why you can't make grpcproxy a part of qrl already without any extra action, we need to test software and prepare servers. Any rush last moment is annoying for everyone, causes scandals.
@sammy007 We are looking to make that part of pip. Unfortunately, there was same change in setuptools, due to which, older pyscaffold was not working and so pip is not working right now. We had updated pyscaffold recently and changes to the project. Release will be done soon that will also include grcpProxy
I see some commits related to extra nonce over last 3 days, is it supposed to be fixed? If yes, here is my output using 6a35a6d:
reserved_offset: 0 is kinda strange. And I am getting unexpected keyword argument 'reserve_size' as well.
You need to wait for next hard fork & release.
@sammy007 you're aware several pools (including myself) were using that modified cryptonote repo with no issues? as far back as a week (or further) and successfully solving blocks..
the job of any stratum is to divide the nonce ranges to scan equally per miner; thats not purely up to extranonce itself..
OMG stop teaching me ok? I am talking about interface. I see it clearly that there is extra 4 bytes available now, hence 8 total.
Currently there is uint32 for extra nonce. I would like to specify reserve size of 8 bytes vs default 4 hence it will be possible to shard stratums with the same block template. That's how it works in Monero. I was just confused that there is no way currently to request more. According to @cyyber I assume it will be implemented soon.
It has been implemented, we were testing the pool. Commit will be available soon.
