It would really be useful to have qubit labels (q0, q1, q2, etc.) at the start of the circuit. Alternatively, this could also be done in a subscript form: $|1\rangle_{0}$ or $|+\rangle_{1}$. This could really be useful for keeping track of the qubits when executing two qubit gates that physically "span" across the size of one's display. For example, my current display shows 8 qubit, it is thus hard to keep track of two qubit gates between q0 and q8, q9, or q10.
This isn't really documented anywhere, but you can create lables by making a custom matrix gate with the matrix "1". The name of the gate will then be shown on the line with no box around it, which looks like a label.
