This test fails sporadically:
#1331
This code was not fixed correctly. Using set(...) to filter down the non-unique elements, before doing checks that the elements are all unique, has made the test tautological.
I'm not sure I understand. Is the problem that there is some probability that there are k<5, maybe even k=1, unique part_lens generated? If so, we could just bump up the number of randomly generated tuples until the probability of there being too few unique ones is acceptably small.
The problem is that, because you are iterating over set(items_to_test) instead of over items_to_test, it no longer makes any sense to assert that the items you are iterating are not equal (which is an implicit thing that equals tester is doing). Of course they're not equal, that was guaranteed by set. You're testing the implementation of set instead of the implementation of the equals method.
An equality method that was just return True would pass the test. We want such equality methods to fail the test.
I don't think that's quite right. The things whose equality is being tested are SwapNetworkGate(*args). For each (unique) value of args, two objects are created and those two should be equal to each other and unequal to everything else. So it doesn't seem like a tautological equality method would pass the test.
Ooooh I see, the set is on the parameters. My mistake.
