I have 3 questions related to our requirements:
Hi Andrea, regarding 3., I think it is recommended to have the versions pinned, for reproducibility, and upgrade them when needed. We could use a tool like Dependabot to upgrade them, https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/.
Regading 1 and 2 I have no clear answer, but I guess that maybe keeping them is fine as we'd like to point out that we are explicitly calling out those packages for some features (scipy for fitting and matplotlib will be called by #464).
I tried finding some documentation/best practice recommendations for this, and the best I found was this: https://realpython.com/lessons/requirements-files-best-practices/
Basically: always pin explicit versions, and pin all requirements, even if they are brought in by another package. Both kind of adhere to the Python philosophy of "explicit is better than implicit".
Secondly, what if in the future circ drops one of these dependencies, we would be in trouble if we dropped listing them explicitly.
My votes:
I took a stab at adding a simple dependabot action that each day checks if there are updates from pip available for any of the requirements.
Thanks everyone for your answers! Now all is clear to me.
I think we can close this now, feel free to re-open if there is something else to discuss!
