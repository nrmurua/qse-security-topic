Some of our compilation routines provide strong upper bounds on how long any sequence of instructions will eventually take after processing by the compressor. This information could be taken advantage of by the addresser to insert SWAPs at lower-than-expected cost: under certain circumstances where a HARDWARE-OBJECT has recently had instructions addressed to it, these preceding instructions will lower the threshold required to hit this threshold, so that the addition of a SWAP is liable to exceed it.
A first step toward employing this trick in the addresser is to store these upper bounds on the HARDWARE-OBJECTs for their easy access.
This is over-done in #395 .
