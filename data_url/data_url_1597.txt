Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
Immutability of CircuitOperations prevents users from accidentally defining self-referencing CircuitOperations, but it is still possible to intentionally construct such an operation.
Describe the solution you'd like
Before we enable the use of CircuitOperations in QCS, we must block infinitely-recursive CircuitOperations from being deserialized. The deserializers should include a check to guard against this.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P1 - I need this no later than the next release (end of quarter)
Part of #3634.
