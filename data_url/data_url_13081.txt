We currently have a  functions to change the qubit and bit registers in Qiskit circuits (see e.g. this). They are necessary for having consistent names in conversions.
However those functions touch very low-level (sometimes private) attributes of the QuantumCircuit class and are therefore subject to bugs, especially when new Qiskit versions are released.
In this PR #1421 it has been suggested to transform quantum and classical registers with
Qiskit transpilation passes. This method is probably more stable.

I think the same might apply to _add_identity_to_idle, _remove_identity_from_idle, and other circuit transformations. Even the "executor" itself.
Giving this a shot üëç
