This issue is to keep track of all changes needed for adding Identity Scaling to existing ZNE documentation.
The PR for the identity scaling functions is here and the RFC was approved in #335.
Changes for adding identity scaling in existing documentation are :
Hi @purva-thakre, thanks for this issue and sorry for replying so late.
Identity scaling is a new noise scaling method that is complementary to existing ones like fold gates at random or fold global.  I don't think we need to create all the docs sections that you listed above, as if we were introducing a completely new error mitigation technique.
What we probably need is just a short subsection in this ZNE options page where we mention the identity scaling function.
@andreamari Ok. That is fine with me for the sections not discussed in this comment. I was proposing changes to existing ZNE docs because there's a difference in how the number of layers are inserted. All the examples are using a unitary folding method.
I think in addition to the options page, the 'theory' might need some information about identity scaling and some information about decoherence.
I think 'What happens when I use ZNE' section will be the best for this but there needs to be a discussion on how the same scale factor would lead to different number of layers inserted for the two scaling methods.
@purva-thakre When reading this issue I had the wrong impression that you wanted to document Identity Scaling as a fully new technique. But I was wrong! Sorry for creating this confusion.  Updating the existing ZNE docs wherever you think is more appropriate sounds good for me.
