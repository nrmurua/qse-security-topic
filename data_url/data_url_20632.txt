Greetings,
Since a while ago, I would like to report that oqs-openssl seems to crash when sidhp751 is used as KEM. This occurs when you use the Microsoft's PQCrypto-VPN built with liboqs and openssl-oqs latest releases (after cross-compiling for windows aswell - the crash happens in the linux built as I have observed)

@pqfan, could you provide some repro information? Which version (commit) did you sync with? What build steps did you do? Which platform versions are you using? Thanks!
@christianpaquin This started to occur since liboqs 0.3.0 and openssl-oqs of that according version if I remember well. There is already a release of the PQCrypto-VPN where you can test this and possibly detect the same error as me (except the case my error is hardware related or something) from here or can be reviewed directly from Microsoft's OpenVPN build system which is the same engine I use to build the final custom version of PQCrypto-VPN. I am running on Windows 10 and running/building/cross-compiling on Ubuntu 18.04.
Thanks a lot for your time and project work so far Christian!
sidhp751 passes in our openssl tests. This could be an issue that only surfaces in OpenVPN; I suggest you open an issue there instead.
I thought that the failure could be due to some openssl crash, but maybe you are right since tests are checked on compile/build time e.t.c.
Will check with PQCrypto-VPN then, some implementation failure or openvpn protocol mismatch and so...
Closing this issue, thanks again.
