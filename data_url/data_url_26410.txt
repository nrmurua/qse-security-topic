Dear Group,
I found these possible typos in qmmm_links_methods.F, which corrects the position and force for added charges.

Lines 152 and 179 mistakenly assign added_charges%add_env(i)%Index1 to Index2. Dr. Hutter agrees on the matter and recommends verifying and correcting the code.
Here is the link to the correspondence in Google Group: https://groups.google.com/g/cp2k/c/Ein9ggGQdgg/m/yYuDuY1QAQAJ
Thank you very much!
