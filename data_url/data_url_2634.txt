This is a pattern I've been using more and more when writing docstrings, and it would be great if it was actually a link on the documentation website.
This sounds like a great improvement. As far as I'm aware this doesn't exist in devsite yet, but would be cool. We should make sure that this gets solved with a devsite compatible way. @lamberta have you seen anything like this working on the TF devsite?
In fact this is working from docstrings already on the new site. ðŸŽ‰  I thought first that this would be something picked up from regular text as well. I guess that would be a pretty large effort. Closing.
We support this when generating the prod site :) But doesn't work in previews, afaik.
If you wrap the complete symbol in backticks it will autolink to the reference page. The shortname for the module is defined in your build_docs.py script and should already be enabled: https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/dev_tools/docs/build_api_docs.py#L46
