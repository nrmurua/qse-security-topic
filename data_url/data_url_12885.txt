Please make sure you don't make changes that affect a large part of the code, and if you do, make sure that you have taken care of all possible repercussions by running unit tests.
For example, I just did a whole bunch of debugging to realize that the gate names in LLVM have been changed from llvm.X to llvm.X.i16. This is a pretty low-level change that affects many things. Many passes are broken as a result, which I will try to fix.
BTW, what's the rationale behind that change?
