Add a function to Circuit to support the inversion of a circuit.
Inversion of circuits is a basic feature for constructing quantum circuits. And it is useful in tasks like random benchmarking,
And as far as I know, the feature is supported by qiskit.
For a Circuit object c, c.inverse() will return the inversion of it by inverting each of its gates and putting them in a reversed order.
If c contains parametric gates, we may offer a parameter for users to decide whether gate parameters are independent or shared.
Qiskit:
This seems doable via inverting qir at least for noiseless circuit, should be done in this week.
have implemented in v0.2.2, pls upgrade tensorcircuit to see whether c.inverse() works for your case
