As far as I can tell, there is no reason to disable an interleave circuit because the first or last bits are classical. Sample minimal example:

Ah, good point. When a permutation has sets of qubits that aren't mixed into the others, it should be okay to have each set be measured or not measured.
The important bit is that sets that are measured should not be scrambled if there is a quantum control and the set isn't size 1.
This is fixed by a9205f0 in #404 and will appear in the next release.
I was surprised that there were some non-trivial permutation subgroups:
