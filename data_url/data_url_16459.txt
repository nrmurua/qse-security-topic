In https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.U2Gate.html#qiskit.circuit.library.U2Gate the given decomposition into RX(pi/2) and virtual Z gates does not match the matrix representation given (even up to a global phase).
I have seen Y90's implemented for Ignis experiments as U2(0,0), which would match the matrix representation in the docs (up to a global phase), so I'm assuming the matrix is correct and the decomposition needs to be updated to:
u2(phi,lambda) = Z_(phi + pi/2) X_(pi/2) Z_(lambda)
