Hi,
We are experiencing incorrect grid integrate computation results on Mi50 (rocm 4.0.1), running the unit test sample_tasks/general_tau.task
We are using commit b5a86d8:
ROCm environment:
In cp2k/src/grid, we have modified Makefile a bit to make it work with HIP. Then we just make to make the two executables.
In grid dir, running batched integration with sample_tasks/general_tau.task gives the following output:
Could you please take an eye on this problem?
Thanks!
Post your GNU version, toolchain command, and all the changes.

Hi, thanks for your response.
GNU version: gcc 7.3.1
The diff above is all our changes.
There is nothing to do with toolchain :) (Please refer to README.md inÂ cp2k/src/grid)

Sorry to bother but maybe you are more familier with this? Since recent commits about HIP are all made by you.
Thanks for your great work!
I wrote the backend but I can already see some issue with the options you pass to the compiler. You most probably need to indicate which gpu you are targeting (--offload option).
I never tested this code with rocm 4.0.1. The earliest version I can almost be sure the code works with is rocm 4.1.0 (latest version would be better). I am not excluding a bug in the code though (most probably a synchronization issue).
Question : Why do you use the makefile present in the directory ? it is for development purpose only since these programs are build at the same time than cp2k.
I just tested the latest version of cp2k on mi50 and rocm 4.2. It works as intended. Would it be possible for you to add this  -mwavefrontsize64 -O3 --offload-arch=gfx906 to NVFLAGS and run the app again.
In the meantime there have been several changes to the HIP grid code. @sanddb, do you still observe this problem?
