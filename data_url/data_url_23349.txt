Rhode & Schwarz SGS100A can come with different software/hardware options e.g. IQ modulation is a hardware option not available on all units. Currently parameters in the driver are added for settings that might not be available or hardware that is not present. Trying to set these seems to silently fail.
Example of relevant commands are:
The software option SGS-K22 means that pulse modulation is available in this unit.
Options '"SGS-B106V"', '"SGS-B112V"' means that IQ modulation is installed and the frequency range goes up to 12.75 GHz (instead of 6 GHz).
A common thing is that IQ modulation is not installed in which case all the parameters related to IQ modulation shouldn't be added to the instrument. (Note that this is not a complete list of options.)
Would be good to map out the options we are using and only add the relevant parameters in the driver if the options are present on a given instrument.
