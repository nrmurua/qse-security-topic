Currently there is no way for the data service to replace or delete an object. Because of this, every update to a results object uploads a new object and then points the dispatch id to that new object, creating many orphaned objects. This could be fixed by one of the following approaches.
PR #271 will allow the data service to delete objects. Also, the data service would be able to replace an object if not for these lines in the local storage backend. The simplest fix here would be to just omit those. S3 also overwrites the object  the object unless versioning is enabled.
