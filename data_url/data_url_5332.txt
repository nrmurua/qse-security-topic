After following the instructions, the resulting binaries like ddsim_simple from the build directory are dangling symlinks.
Hey Alexandru,
could you share your build log with us.
Did you build the ddsim_simple CMake target by calling cmake --build . --config Release --target ddsim_simple?
After make in the build directory the file exists, but
trying chmod on the link
As stated in the README you need to build the ddsim_simple target since ddsim is just the library. ;-)
Thank you. It is very confusing why the executable exists as symlink without being compiled.
Iâ€™ll fix it tomorrow! Sorry for the confusion.
