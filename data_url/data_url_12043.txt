Tried importing SecondOrderExpansion from qiskit.aqua.components.feature_maps which raised an Import Error.

ImportError: cannot import name 'SecondOrderExpansion' from 'qiskit.aqua.components.feature_maps' (/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/qiskit/aqua/components/feature_maps/init.py)
on importing the library using:
from qiskit.aqua.components.feature_maps import SecondOrderExpansion
SecondOrderExpansion should get imported.
This was DEPRECATED in Qiskit version 0.22.0 and has been taken off in this version. So instead of importing SecondOrderExpansion, one can import feature maps from qiskit.circuit.library. For example ZZFeatureMap can be accessed as follows":
feature_map = ZZFeatureMap(num_qubits, reps=2)  # Where num_qubts is the number of qubits being used.
