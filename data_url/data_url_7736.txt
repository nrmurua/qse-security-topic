There may be a bug in the antidiag_gauge function in tensor/tensor_core.py
When calling full_simplify(seq="AC") on the tensor network shown below:
I am using Quimb version 1.3.0 and Python 3.8.12 on Fedora 35.
Thanks for the issue! I believe this has been fixed at some point - at least, it runs for me with a recent version from github. Apologies that the pypi version is quite out of date.
I've updated the pypi version of quimb and will do so more regularly going forward - closing for now, but feel free to re-open.
