Would be helpful to return the found embedding to users. Thanks!
Currently the best way to work with the embedding is to use the FixedEmbeddingComposite.
The obvious way to expose the embedding would be in the Response.info attribute. We could always do this, or we could add a parameter to the EmbeddingComposite.sample method that toggles embedding returns.
I like the toggle parameter
I am still of two minds about this. While I agree the embedding is sometimes useful to have, it is somewhat counter to the idea of EmbeddingComposite. I do think the LazyFixedEmbeddingComposite #105 might be the best of both worlds. It will let users avoid having to use minorminer directly while also providing embedding information,
