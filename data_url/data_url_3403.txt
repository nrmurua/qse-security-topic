Possibly superseded by #1017.
It is occasionally confusing and unhelpful when python reports master pyquil's version as, e.g., 2.10.0, when in fact the code has features, bugfixes, etc. not in the actual 2.10.0 release.
One option would be to, upon release, update pyquil.__version__ to be the next expected release, perhaps with -dev appended.
There's some overly complicated stuff in PEP 440 if you're really bored.
Thoughts @karalekas @jmackeyrigetti?
Part of me would like something like branching model described here, but it may be overkill. It satisfies some personal need for separation of concerns.
closing in favor of using the solution in #1017
