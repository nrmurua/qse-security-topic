The CC-light supports the notion of "dummy" operation types as supported within the CCL.
Note that there is a difference between the actual type (MW, Flux, Meas) used in scheduling and the type in the CCL (MW, Flux, Meas, Dummy).
We should add this feature as it is supported in hardware and has concrete use cases. We currently have a workaround but we should solve this after M18.
@AdriaanRol Could you define the "Dummy" operation type, is there any documentation I can refer to ?
@Nader-Khammassi
I think this is something that you already know, which is configured in the control store. As for each operation, there is a field indicating the operation type (None(0), MW(1), Flux(2), and Meas(3)). I think what @AdriaanRol said by dummy is the None operation type.
The documentation is in the wiki page Microcode Configuration.
The reason of having this None or dummy operation is that, the experimentalists (I say Adriaan, you know) want to express the operation in the eQASM program explicitly, which does not trigger any codeword.
@Nader-Khammassi @imranashraf  Any update on this? I'd be very happy if I can turn the prepz into a Dummy operation rather than a microwave operation.
done.
