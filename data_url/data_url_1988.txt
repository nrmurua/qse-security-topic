All downstream clients now support v2.
All proto references to v1 are now contained to the google.api.v1 package.  Nothing in cirq references them anymore.  Docs (at least for the new site) have been disabled for this package.
In addition, references in engine and pyle have been reduced to only tests and necessary components for backwards compatibility.
Closing this issue.
