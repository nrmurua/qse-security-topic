Perhaps due to a planned change to deprecate the function, but there used to be a Program qasm() function (in program.h and program.cc) which allowed a direct dump of the qasm text to a string. This makes it very convenient to pass the string around via sockets instead of having to rely on a file IO type of solution. Am I missing some changes here?
Closing due to lack of activity
