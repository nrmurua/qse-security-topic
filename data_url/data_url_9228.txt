The quantum fft function was ported over from the python QIP project, but likely isn't entirely bug free (I was not able to write tests which I found satisfactory which also passed). This needs to be debugged and fixed, possibly also moved over to the common circuits directory.
Should be resolved before 1.0 release ( Issue #6 ).
