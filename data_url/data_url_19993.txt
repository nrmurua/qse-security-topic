At the git clone --depth=50 https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git open-quantum-safe/liboqs step, the Travis CI ppc64le job that is run when pull requests are opened fails every so often with the following error:
Restarting it once or twice usually seems to fix it. Perhaps we need to increase the timeout?
Problem happened again with #1339: https://app.travis-ci.com/github/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/jobs/592442495.
What about removing ppc64le from CI for good if its so unreliable? Do we know of anyone needing liboqs on that platform?
I asked TravisCI support now that the issue reoccured. Ideally I'd like to keep the ppc64le builds, I think there was a linux distro shipping the builds.
I got a notification that TravisCI deployed a fix for the issue. Closing the issue (reopen if it should re-occur).
