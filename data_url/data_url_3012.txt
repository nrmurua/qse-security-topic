optimization passes are done in place on a circuit, which makes sense as we don't want to recreate the whole circuit
when writing test code, or even in preliminary work using optimization passes, however, this means that you will lose the original circuit.
To fix this I think we need a copy method for Circuit so that you can copy before optimizing.
Ah I guess I can just use
Circuit(circuit.moments)
