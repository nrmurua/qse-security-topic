Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
I would like to partner with Google as I have designed a -1 to 1 virtual Quantum processor.
Describe the solution you'd like
I am looking for contact details for Google Quantum AI in Santa Barbara so I can send them the concept.
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
You can find my project offering at www.t-sum.com.
[optional] Additional context (e.g. screenshots)
The idea is a simple one and could be developed in a matter of 1 week for Google.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P0 - this should land no later than a week
Thanks for reaching out @technology-sum. This forum is specifically to discuss Cirq issues or potential cirq integrations. I'll go ahead and close this issue now because it's not clear to me that the quantum virtual processor product can be integrated with Cirq.
