When a change is made to /mitiq/interface/conversions.py testing will fail (and likely applies to any change where tests are separate from the code, i.e. code tested in /mitiq/tests/).
See the draft PR workflow runs from #1850.
We should make sure to ignore pyquil tests, and in draft PRs may want to either ignore the /mitiq/tests/ directory, or run it by default.
Nice to have, not sure if possible/practical: Codecov report (at least the “patch” coverage report) on draft PRs.
We removed the draft PR workflow in #2019, closing.
