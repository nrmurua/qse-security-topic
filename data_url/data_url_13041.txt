There is a new type of benchmark quantum circuits, rotated_rb_circuits that could be added to the benchmarks performed by the calibrator.
Add generate_rotated_rb_circuits to the calibration settings, like what is done here.
Possibly, one could list the benchmark circuits available also in the part of the user guide on calibration and/or in the calibration tutorial.
Discuss whether to set a seed for simpler CI.
API-doc for rotated RB circuits
Calibration in the user guide
@Misty-W happy to be assigned to this.
