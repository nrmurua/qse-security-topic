I'm currently having an issue when running indcpa_kem_keypair() using the aarch64 optimized versions of the saber family. The frame pointer appears to get corrupted when PQCLEAN_LIGHTSABER_AARCH64_asm_asymmetric_mul is called, and thus causes a segmentation fault when indcpa_kem_keypair() returns.
Line in lightsaber where frame pointer first gets corrupted:

I'm experiencing this issue on Ubuntu, both with gcc-10 and clang-10, and the issue also occurs on apple M1 using appleclang.
Any help would be appreciated, and thanks in advance!
Small update: After doing a little bit of digging, it looks like the saved stack pointer on the stack is getting corrupted after PQCLEAN_LIGHTSABER_AARCH64_asm_asymmetric_mul() is called. The frame pointer issue can be avoided by not using fno-omit-frame-pointer.
Hi @Martyrshot.
Can you perform a quick check if changing line 17 into ldr w27, [x3, #4] and line 20 into dup v29.4S, w27 solves the issue?
Will definitely be more careful on avoiding x29.
Thanks for spotting this,
Vincent
Hi Vincent,
This does resolve the issue I was experiencing. I have tested it on an M1, and an AWS Neoverse-N1. On the AWS instance, I have tested with both clang-10 and gcc-10.
Thanks!

Thanks @Martyrshot, @vincentvbh. We'll get that fixed upstream and will open a PR to PQClean later today.
