Currently, m_max_memory is determined by taking the maximum across all calls to m_memory(). Therefore, it's noisy and we've got several calls to m_memory() scatter throughout the code base.
Instead we should read VmHWM from /proc/self/status, which directly gives us the Peak resident set size ("high water mark").
