Relayed from @spauka :
When developing a driver, reloading a module doesn't update existing objects; this is standard Python behavior. This means that the old Instrument object stays around with the old definition, and the natural way to get to the new state is to stop and restart Python.
It would be nice if there were a way to easily find and delete the old Instrument object while reloading the module.
