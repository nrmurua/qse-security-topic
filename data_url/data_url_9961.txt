Description
The documentation at https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/dimod/en/latest/reference/bqm/generated/dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel.add_variable.html claims that dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel.add_variable accepts a vartype argument, but the latest definition of add_variable has dropped this parameter.
Steps To Reproduce
â‡¨ TypeError: add_variable() takes from 1 to 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
Expected Behavior
No output
Environment
pip install dwave-ocean-sdk from a fresh Conda environment.
This is an artefact of the way that our documentation is hosted - it only gets updated once the sdk has the new version of the package. I'll push an update and close this issue once it's fixed.
Hi Scott, here is the new, fixed, documentation https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/docs_dimod/reference/generated/dimod.AdjDictBQM.add_variable.html#dimod.AdjDictBQM.add_variable
Thanks!
