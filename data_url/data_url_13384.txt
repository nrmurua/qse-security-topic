If one downloads the latest (0.10) release on Read The Docs, the image is not showing in the first pages. See https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/stable/pdf/

This is not happening for other pages of the documentation that contain logos included in the readme.
Maybe this is due to the way the images are imported?
Mitiq Logo:
Braket logo
I'll also add that the contributor picture gallery is also not rendering:

The possible reasons I could see is that the png url has raw=true at the end, which may or may not be handled by latex correctly. This was linked externally as opposed to a relative reference bc that was the only way to get the readme and the docs to render it the same (afair).
