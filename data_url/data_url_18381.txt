During routine testing of cl-quil, e.g., via (asdf:test-system :cl-quil), you get about 36 warnings like so:
I think it would be best not to have warnings from a routine test run, since I feel it tends to make developers not notice when real warnings come out. This is one of the two warnings that routinely appear.  (The other isThe ISA "type" field is deprecated and will be removed in favor of the "gates" field..)
These warnings all seem to stem from code that looks like so in about 15 .qpu test files, such as Aspen-4-10Q-A.qpu::
Presumably, the warning and accompanying truncation action is good functionality, so If it's desirable, it should be tested for explicitly, rather than just casually by having it apply in a bunch of tests.
