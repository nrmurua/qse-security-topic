I haven't looked at internals, but I imagine measure is making some call to rand().  It would be useful for it to take an rng as the first argument and instead call rand(rng)
yes, it is a good idea to expose this API here indeed, it is quite straight forward actually.
It is defined here, we are currently using the sample from StatsBase
https://github.com/QuantumBFS/YaoArrayRegister.jl/blob/7a3cf82819f769faad244c72ca5b077741b2671e/src/measure.jl#L9
the new interface is added for measure now.
