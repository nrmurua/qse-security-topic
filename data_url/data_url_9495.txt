It would be cleaner to make most of pulser identifiers exported under a single namespace, enabling
It seems the number of identifiers exported by pulser is still very reasonable to consider this user experience.
This change does not break compatibility with existing programs.
This change does not require a new package structure.
Support from this change also comes from the best practice that identifiers should not be imported in a module alone, in a "dangling" manner.
On the contrary, one should favor importing modules and use identifiers from the defined namespace.
