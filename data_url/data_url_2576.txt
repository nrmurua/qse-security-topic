I have no idea why sphynx is omitting this particular package and not others, but it is. We need to figure out why and fix it.
@Strilanc Can i work on this issue ?
Definitely! Go for it!
I have figured what was the problem there in my case (python 3.7 on mac os):
the following workaround helped in my case:
pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.12.0-py3-none-any.whl
(I verified with pip search tensorflow that the latest version was 1.12.0)
What a strange reason. Good job finding it.
It looks like tensorflow is now supported by python 3.7. I have verified that it works to build the docs on python 3.7 on Linux after pip install tensorflow. Should we change the contrib requirements to tensorflow instead of tf-nightly?
@andbe91 Yes. Please open a pull request doing so.
@dabacon How long does it take for latest: https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html to update once merged? The problem is still persisting.
Oh, it was actually not working with tf-nighlty then. That probably means that the problem is elsewhere. Can we see the actual build log somewhere?
I wonder if the issue is that .readthedocs.yml reads requirements_file: dev_tools/conf/pip-list-dev-tools.txt, i.e. it doesn't even try to install the contrib requirements. However, that should also mean that requirements.txt doesn't get installed, and then nothing should work, so I'm not sure what is going on here.

Thanks. The logs confirm that the contrib requirements are not installed. I'm no expert on the config of readthedocs, but it looks like there is .readthedocs.yml and settings on readthedocs.org itself (which I can't access). Where do we want to configure this?
Are you referring to https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/.readthedocs.yml?
Yes.
