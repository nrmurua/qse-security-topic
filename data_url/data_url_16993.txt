Application of the optimized circuit gives a result that differs from the unoptimized circuit, or circuits generated using optimization levels 1 or 2.

Hi @ewoutvandenberg , thanks for reporting. How are you measuring the equivalence of the optimized and unoptimized circuits?
this might be an issue with qubit permutation (i.e. the counts are the same but unitaries are not).
we need a pass to restore permutation order if no measurements in the circuit. the TokenSwapping pass in #2860 can do this.
Confirmed with @ewoutvandenberg offline that this was resolved by #2539 .
