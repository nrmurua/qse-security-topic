Calling cudaq::kernel_builder::to_quake with nested kernel calls fails because the serializer can't find the innermost kernel symbol.
The output of the following program:
Is:
The code successfully serializes the first two kernels, and but fails to serialize the third.
The missing symbol is the same symbol used by the other kernels to describe the innermost kernel.
Note, the code is compiled without any additional flags on the latest docker image (ghcr.io/nvidia/cuda-quantum@sha256:92e55d523b5124a22868472ef5bf532a7647d6173f5d12a371dd0f46f8570330).
The above program shouldn't fail. Instead, the last "section" should result in an output similar to the following text:
Not a regression
No response
Thanks for filing this @orclassiq. I just issued a PR for the fix (#334).
