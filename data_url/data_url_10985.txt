We might want to consider making a new non-alpha release. Now that OpenFermion is out, if we are going to keep FermiLib around, moving it out of alpha makes some sense to me. @damiansteiger and @thomashaener, thoughts?
Of course we can make a first beta release or another alpha release, both are fine with me.
To move forward to a 0.1 release, we would have to invest considerably more time in my opinion to
Given my time budget, I don't see that happening in the next days (except another alpha or beta release).
let's move to beta then. I also do not have time to keep working on FermiLib (opposed to OpenFermion) except for very small things here and there.
Sounds good. We will make a beta release tomorrow.

I looked up again all the recent changes. There aren't enough new features to justify a new pre-release and we want to fix a few of the above things before making the next release. As users can always install the latest version from GitHub that should be fine.
