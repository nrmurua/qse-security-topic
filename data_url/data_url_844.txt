Would be solved by #485
Hi @shahakL thank you for your request. As you can see we are working on the migration but we do not have a timeline for when it will be ready. Please keep your eyes on #485 for the latest details.
Hi @shahakL, we're happy to let you know that Python 3.10 is now supported. We're exploring 3.11 but do not have a committed date yet for that.
Support for 3.11 is added by #572.
