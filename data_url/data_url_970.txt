Measurement keys of circuits and operations are referenced in the circuit construction process. Unfortunately, the methods for extracting measurement keys can be slow, especially in the presence of subcircuits, classical controls, and other complexity. We should see what we can do to speed these up and improve the circuit construction experience.
