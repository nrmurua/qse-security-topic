Core drivers reference artic.coredevice.sawg and .spline have unnecessarily complex argument types presented in documentation. For example sawg.config.set_clr().
In email, @jordens says
That's a feature of the compiler, not of SAWG. Feel free to raise an issue.
and @sbourdeauducq says
Getting sphinx to use str() instead of repr() on type annotations should fix this problem.
sphinx-doc/sphinx#3857
I have tested that the proposed change in format_annotation() does result in types being nicely printed.
We could also just overload repr.
ARTIQ does the right thing in returning an eval()-parseable string in repr().
I don't see this being used or strictly required anywhere.
... but either solution sounds fine to me.
@jordens It's used when debugging, because the user-readable representation can hide some details that may make inference fail. Of course that is not visible from source code.
This issue is back after a refactoring in Sphinx; the repr() calls are now in https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/7faeb793e2e16cde4e5759443fb7f84efddcd9ea/sphinx/util/inspect.py.
(Testing patch.)
We can also use an actual (not monkey) patch on Hydra, the advantage is it'll likely show clearly when it breaks. But users of unpatched sphinx will have the issue.
It broke again.
