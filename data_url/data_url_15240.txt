The NLopt installation instructions here https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/main/qiskit/algorithms/optimizers/nlopts/__init__.py are outdated and should be updated. I see NLopt is now on pypi (which it was not when that was originally written).  We can probably reduce the install instructions to saying to use pip install nlopt but keep the nlopt links in case they are needed,
This was originally noted here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74218587/unable-to-install-nlopt-for-qiskit
If this is to be updated, we can also update the brief installation remarks returned by the HAS_NLOPT optional checker documented here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/d030145fb467d090e49a85205cd988a2fdbc76ff/qiskit/utils/optionals.py#L101-L104 and defined here:

edit: If the NLOpt installation process is much easier now, it may be worth removing the NLOpt-specific callback in the lazy loader too.  I originally added that just to retain exact parity with the previous state of the library, but it may well not be necessary now?  That's a question for the algorithms team, I think - I certainly don't know the context.
ha, I've just spotted my mental localisation failures in the first code sample above - "nonlinear optimisation library"
