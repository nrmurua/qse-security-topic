When I run pip install qsimcirq then my local install of black gets downgraded from 22.1.0 to 20.8b1, breaking my local development environment, apparently because qsim has recently added build and test dependencies to requirements.txt, and hard coded the black version.
This seems not optimal. Presumable qsim does not have a runtime dependency on black.

Related: #516
This should be fixed with #516, as black is no longer in the main requirements.txt for qsimcirq.
