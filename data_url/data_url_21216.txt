Running an experiment triggers the idle kernel.
Idle kernel is triggered after being flashed.
Idle kernel is triggered only after the experiment ended.
Is it clear that this is undesirable? The ability to update idle kernels on the fly seems quite useful to me (though we don't typically use idle kernels for much, so this isn't a strongly held opinion).
