When using the auto-replacer with a restricted gate set, controlled single qubit operations are also allowed.
I think this should not be allowed.
For example:
This allows also controlled T-gates.
There is another thing I noticed: If I specify the TGate as an allowed one qubit gate it does not automatically include the invese of T.
Good catch, thanks!
We could add an additional parameter include_inverses or something similar.
