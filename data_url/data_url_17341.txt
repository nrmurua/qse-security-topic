I also think I should be able to draw a pass manager
pm.draw()
and it make a flow diagram of all the passes I have in my pass manager with the inputs going into them
Via #2079, PassManager.passes() returns structure with the passes and flow control in a pass manager instance. A drawer should take that structure and make flow diagram based on it.
I'm happy to do this if no one has started on it already? Are there any further ideas about what this should look like?
I was thinking in something like a flow chart in graphviz (we use it already for drawing the dag)... Let me know if you have questions about the PassManager.passes() structure.
I think the thing to show would be that blocks of multiple passes can have a "control" (do-while) and/or a "condition" (if). Otherwise just drawing each pass in a box, and showing the input parameters of the pass, seems ok.
