This is related to #1047 but the difference is I want to have a way that I can easily see that the provider is a valid provider for terra.
The idea is that it should return data that passes the schemas
Then I think terra needs to have some way to be sure that it is making a qobj that passes the schema
Then inside the IBMQ provider, we should have something that confirms that qobj from terra will work
Then we need something in the AER that does the same
Closing, only Qobj models left and let's track in a separate issue. @diego-plan9
