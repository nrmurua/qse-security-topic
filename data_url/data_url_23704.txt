The AWG 5014 driver has two distinct "parameters" in the hardware,
The recently updated 5014 driver introduces a 'parameter' ref_clock_source.
https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/instrument_drivers/tektronix/AWG5014.py#L160
This refers to using an internal or external clock and and has nothing to do with the reference oscillator, making this a confusing name.
Additionally there is no parameter that sets the reference oscillator.
The driver does contain some reference to these parameter under their proper name.

I would suggest the following fix.
@WilliamHPNielsen as author of the recent fix, do you agree with these changes? If so I will be sending a PR shortly.
totally agree with @AdriaanRol, have been meaning to flag this up but got distracted/waylaid. At the moment initialising the qcodes instrument seems to set the reference source to internal even if it the instrument previously was set to external but I hadn't dug into what the parameter was actually doing.
@nataliejpg have you seen #538 ?
