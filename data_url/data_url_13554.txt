In this section , if you want to run tests for pyQuil and Qiskit plugins make test needs to be changed to either make test-pyquil or make test-qiskit.
test, test-pyquil and test-qiskit are different targets in Makefile.
If the tests for both pyQuil and Qiskit plugins are to be run together, Makefile could be changed with a new_target executing both test-pyquil and test-qiskit. Then the documentation could be updated with make new_target.
If the tests for both pyQuil and Qiskit plugins are to be run separately, documentation could be updated by adding separate make test-pyquil and make test-qiskit respectively.
Good catch! The problem here is just that there is a typo in the contributing docs:

The codeblock should instead be
Note that make test-all can be used to test everything.
Ah. I'll make the edits.
Thanks @purva-thakre
