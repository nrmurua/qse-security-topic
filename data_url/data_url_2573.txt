Verifying #1206 , I have realized that there aren't release notes for Cirq yet. I suggest adding them, it would at least make it easy to track issues which might occur in different versions.
What do you mean? Under the github releases tab we put release notes for each version. There is a draft of the next version's release notes there.
Oh I see, thanks for pointing that out. Usually such things are a bit more "in your face", e.g they are called "release_notes" or "changelog" (like e.g. in one of Qiskit repos), which is why I was confused.
Should we close this or should we consider duplicating the github release notes into a file?
I'm going to close, though there might be consideration in documentation for pointing to the release notes more prominently.
