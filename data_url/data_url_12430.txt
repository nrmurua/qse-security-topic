In the documentation of some functions, e.g. PQC, Expectation, while there is a lot of nice description of the functionality, it would also be much more convenient for there to be a clear list of arguments, input shapes and output shapes, as is done in the regular tensorflow documentation. This might make it easier for an outsider to start using the codebase much faster, without needing to spend a lot of time parsing this information on their own.
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
