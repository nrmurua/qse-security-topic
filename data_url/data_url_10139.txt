A composite layer that rescales the Hamiltonian would add a lot of convenience.  It would rescale the input Hamiltonian to fit within specified ranges, then reverse the rescaling so the energies match the original Hamiltonian.
I currently use the following function to rescale Hamiltonians, with an additional feature that allows clipping large values so that the Hamiltonian doesn't have to be scaled down as much (the tradeoff being that the Hamiltonian is not a faithful rescaling if clipping < 1).
Out of scope for this library, migrated appropriately.
