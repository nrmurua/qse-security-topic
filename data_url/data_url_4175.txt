I'm getting an error when trying to use backend
File "/Users/projectq/setups/ibm.py", line 42, in get_engine_list
raise DeviceOfflineError('Error when configuring engine list: device '
projectq.setups.ibm.DeviceOfflineError: Error when configuring engine list: device requested for Backend not connected
What does this mean? How to rectify this?
The updated backend for IBM needs to connect to an actual device to get its topology. So you need to request a IBM device name in the setup (ex: 'ibmq_london') in addition of providing the IBMQ token:
get_engine_list(token='YourToken', device='ibmq_london')
Good news is that the setup accepts all 5 qubit device topology as well as the 15 qubit device 'ibmq_melbourne'.
If this is not answering your question could you please provide a sample of the code that you wrote?
If you are not using the version from the develop branch, you will have to wait for release 0.5.0 (which should be out in the next few days) in order to have a working IBM backend.
Thank you @dbretaud I can now run my code successfully.
