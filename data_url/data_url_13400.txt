We currently document here that you need to install other dependencies for particular executors/conversions. It would be good to have a pointer to this docs section when someone tries to import a Mitiq module that requires them. I know you get the package missing warning, but that might be confusing to some folks, and this is an easy to implement solution to help them use Mitiq with more confidence.
Add conditionals to importing the optional dependencies that would put a more informative error.
I can work on this over the weekend, shouldnt be harder, will look up some examples and get it done @crazy4pi314
I'm not sure if we should spend any effort here. It should be clear that mitiq.interface.mitiq_whatever depends on package whatever, and at some point in the error stack it will say ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'whatever' - I'm not sure how much clearer we could be than that.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
