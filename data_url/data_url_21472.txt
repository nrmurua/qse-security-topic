Underflows don't generate proper tracebacks using the latest master.
A traceback pointing to the line in the source with self.ttl0.on().
Latest master (thanks to @sbourdeauducq for reproducing at M-Labs).
Fixed after 6f3c495 & 5e1847e.
The line of code that causes underflow can now be seen on the traceback.
