Agilent E8257D Instrument Driver Bug in on() and off() Methods
The instrument should turn on or off.
Script throws a "status" error.
--> When the on() and off() methods were changed, the issue was fixed. I believe there is a syntax error when declaring the methods:
Original, throws error
Changed, does not throw error
It would be helpful to provide such information:
operating system - Windows
If you are using a released version of qcodes (recommended):
qcodes version - 0.41.1

Thanks @jiin-so as far as I can see there is no status parameter on the instrument so I am kind of surprised that any of the 2 ways you describe would work.
Hello, what then would be the correct way to address the instrument to turn it on/off?
I am not familiar with this instrument so I would suggest consulting the manual to see what the command is. Perhaps the intention is that this should switch output on off. In that case you should use output_enabled https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/main/src/qcodes/instrument_drivers/agilent/Agilent_E8257D.py#L125
That works, just checked with the instrument!! Thank you so much for your help.
@jiin-so Thanks could you have a look at #5496 that should fix on and off to call output_enabled
