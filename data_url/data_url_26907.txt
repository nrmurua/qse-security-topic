By using the github search in the repository, I see that there are
25 code results
https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/search?q=svn&unscoped_q=svn
Besides the legacy reference in some scripts, for example:
cp2k/tools/build_utils/get_revision_number
there are other scripts that can probably be removed, for example:
cp2k/tools/svn2cl
svn2cl is used in the auto_regtest script which itself seems to rely rather heavily on SVN.
@oschuett @ibethune ideas?
Yes, many of the auto_regtest scripts seem obsolete now with the dashboard and git in place. Maybe @mkrack can comment?
Though it seems the scripts in auto_regtest were developed based on my the autoregtester scripts which I am still using locally, I have neither contributed to the development or maintenance of these scripts nor I have used them in the current form. So these scripts might be indeed obsolete unless somebody else still uses them.
Oh, indeed they were committed by @ibethune. So, I guess we can simple remove that dir then.
As far as I am concerned, yes.
Yes, the auto_regtest scripts were what was running at EPCC, they can now be safely deleted.
