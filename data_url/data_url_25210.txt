Due to latest changes in SQLAlchemy 2.0.17, the covalent GUI APIs seem to break and hence no records are seen on the GUI.
The changes include Query pattern changes, response type changes and also declarative base class changes.
Adding a few links :
https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/changelog/migration_20.html#id1
https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/#sqlalchemy-orm
Run covalent on latest version on develop branch with SQLAlchemy version = 2.0.17
All the GUI APIs will fail and 'Something went wrong message will be shown' on the GUI.

To pin the upper bound of the SQLAlchemy version to 1.4.37 until the changes are made.
