Discussed at Mitiq meeting. All benchmark circuits should be defined in mitiq.benchmarks and have the option to output as a specific supported type (i.e., QPROGRAM). This is preferable to (re)defining them in mitiq_qiskit, mitiq_pyquil, etc.
@rmlarose Is this issue a clarification of #320? I think so, but either way I'm happy to take it on next unless you started on it.
