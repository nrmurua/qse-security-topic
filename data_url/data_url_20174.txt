Build seems to succeed, test_kem and speed_kem appear to work fine.
Tests hang regardless of what flags CMake receives.
ninja run_tests produces the following, and consistently hangs around the last line of the shown output:

Actually, your CI seems to show this problem too: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/993/workflows/87722dc0-7fe8-49b3-bc6d-de650d233a00/jobs/10102
dac58d4 might fix it.  Can you try
Thanks - much different. I've edited tests/CMakeLists.txt, and configured with env RUN_TESTS_PARALLEL=FALSE:
In case it matters - here's the build script I use, to simplify my life ;)
When I run your script locally on my Mac, it passes without problem.
I just pushed #825 which skips the Doxygen test on the macOS shared and that seems to pass CI.
Thank you!
I wonder - did you have to skip the Doxygen test? I seem to be able to run Doxygen just fine on my Mac (I installed Doxygen via Macports, you can probably do it via Brew as well), with the fix you merged.

It runs just fine on my Mac with Doxygen from brew.  I don't know why it fails when running in that very specific CircleCI configuration, but it doesn't seem worth the time investment to debug at this point.
Ah, I understand. Yes, you're certainly correct. If I stumble upon the answer/solution - we can revisit, otherwise it's good enough that it builds Doxygen docs on our "real" computers. ;-)
