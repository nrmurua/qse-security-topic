Got a 400 code response to /api/Jobs: {"error":{"status":400,"message":"Generic error","code":"GENERIC_ERROR"}}

The generic error 400 is a connection error. This indicates that the connection to the servers has been dropped, or cannot be established. This happens sometimes, and work to make it never happen is on going.
