In particular, the test cl-quil-tests::test-big-defgate is very slow for something so simple: it constructs a matrix a large identity gate (8 qubits) and compares this matrix to a MAGICL identity matrix. Maybe the matrix calculation is slow? No, it's the parsing that's slow:
You'll also note that the timings vary pretty widely. Weird! Is this because it's doing IO and it's being blocked? Dunno. Investigate.
nvm fake news
