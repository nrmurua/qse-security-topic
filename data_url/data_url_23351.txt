From the discussion in #1071 I would like to suggest the following improvement to the data base structure:
modularize the data discovery:
By this I mean, we only provide a get_by_id function in the data_set and further functions as get_experiment_by_name or get_experiments_by_tags can live in some sort of external DataProvider. This way we could fully separate the task of finding experiments out and have a very thin interface constituted by a single function (get_by_id).
For the database layout this would mean:
open path to integration of fabrication database
It would be beneficial if, instead of a sample name, we would store a sample id and have another table that could hold all possible sample properties.
