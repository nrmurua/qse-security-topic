I am using tfq.layers.PQC and tfq.layers.ControlledPQC extensively, but say I don't want to check the expectation value of the qubit state rather just want to check what's the output of the state (might be in tf.Tensor form). In tfq.layers.PQC (and tfq.layers.ControlledPQC) we have got an attribute by the name of operators which measures the expectation value of the qubit state in Z basis, if the operator is chosen to be cirq.Z(cirq.GridQubit))?
I tried using operators = [] but ended up having an error which is probably related to this operators attribute.
You can use tfq.layers.State to check the state
Is it possible that we can use the output of tfq.layers.State as an input to any of the tfq.layers? Also, how can we measure the output of tfq.layers.State using an observable?
I think state takes the circuit and parameters as input, so you would want to extract those from the PQC (you can check the docs to see if I'm right). If you want the observable, why are you using state? PQC and ControlledPQC computer observables for you. If you really must, you could of course just compute <psi|O|psi>.
