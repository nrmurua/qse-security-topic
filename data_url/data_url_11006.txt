HI, I am trying to run this notebook   :
https://github.com/rigetti/grove/blob/master/examples/Tomography.ipynb
I get error here
ImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)
 in 
12
13 from pyquil.gates import CZ, RY
---> 14 from pyquil.api import QVMConnection, QPUConnection, get_devices
15 from pyquil.quil import Program
16
ImportError: cannot import name 'get_devices' from 'pyquil.api' (/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyquil/api/init.py)
Any help ? I can't find a possible fix to it yet.
thanks
It looks like Grove is using an obsolete pyQuil API. Perhaps it might help you if you check out https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/blob/master/docs/source/migration2-qc.ipynb (specifically the examples regarding list_quantum_computers and get_qc) as well as the function list_lattices in https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/blob/master/pyquil/api/_devices.py#L54. I hope this helps
