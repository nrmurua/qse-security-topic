As we are transitioning from relative imports to absolute imports:
We are introducing code like:
... this code is telling me that I want a QuantumCircuit class from an internal/private _module, but QuantumCircuit is not internal nor private.
The concept of internal classes has been diffused during all this time, and I don't think we have this concept anymore, at least not in the vast majority of the files.
So in order to keep code cleaner, I'd suggest to remove underscore prefix from all the files that we have doubts about its domain and files we know they are meant to be used by other components (I'd say all of them).
This is somewhat of a large change, mostly style related so I'm labeling this issue as discussion just in case someone has different views.
I could do this, once said discussion has happened of course!
I'm fine with doing this, but my only concern is the external messaging. Personally I don't see an issue with a leading underscore with an import inside the same repo, to me having a module with a leading underscore means we're not providing an external api stability contract on that module. If we're going to change that for all the modules marked as private we'll have to change how we develop things. Otherwise we'll have to make it very clear which interfaces we're defining as stable and which ones we're not.
Currently, there are not that many:

Actually that grepping seems to be missing some files - we are at ~70ish currently.
What else is still pending here @diego-plan9 ?
Should be finally closed after #2095 ðŸŽ‰
