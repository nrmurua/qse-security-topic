As suggested by @nonhermitian, when digesting a schedule, times at which there is a discontinuity in the waveform (e.g. from a FrameChange instruction) should be added to the list of times for which the solver should do a soft-reset. As an example, this is already being done by the monte-carlo solver:

An update to this:
Update from the discussion in #811: the recurrent zvode error with exit status -1 means that the solver is successful but has gone over nsteps single integrator steps in the integration call. Perhaps discontinuities influence this to some degree, but I believe this is primarily a problem with fast oscillations in the solution or rhs (resulting, e.g., from things like CR driving - where a qubit is driven substantially off resonance). Increasing nsteps eliminated the throwing of this error and seems to result in correct simulation.
This issue was figured out with the last comment, so closing.
