As mentioned in #1039, using frequency0 instead produces a more reasonable waveform.
Could you elaborate on the difference to #1039 and #1022? That same test code works fine in #1022 .
And are both duplicates of #1022 ?
That same test code works fine in #1022
No, #1022 uses frequency0. The bug described here appears with frequency1.
Sorry. I created similar bug report before seeing this one. #1040

Not fixed by m-labs/jesd204b@25fd79d
Sawtooth looks good on my board with new JESD. I can post photos later if that helps, but accross a few loads, I haven't seen any glitches on the outputs.
@jbqubit @sbourdeauducq and anyone else who is working with Sayma v1.0: I strongly suggest that you reconnect the HMC7043 RESET line before doing any further debugging. We've seen that not holding the HMC7043 in RESET during init caused crashes on two separate boards (mine and @marmeladapk's). It's quite possible that other boards are affected in different ways, even if they don't crash.
one can reconnect it but either negator is needed or one needs to connect it to one of IO pins.
As @gkasprow said, looks like either HMC743 or Si5324 would be held in reset as they share the signal but have inverted reset logic.
That is true, but for the current prototype phase, missing clock recovery is easier to tolerate than random crashes. A "proper" bodge might be preferable, as Greg points out, if we all agree on which pin to route the reset to avoid having to use different firmware builds.
(Also see ac5c491.)
That Si5324 is only intended for switched DRTIO on the RTM FPGA, i.e. rf switch control etc. -it's a minor  feature.
And, unlike the HMC CPU interfaces and behavior which are a disaster, the Si CPU interface is well thought through. Case in point, the reset can be disconnected (like it's done on Kasli) on the Si5324 without consequences or obscure bugs popping up.
Reproduced:

Artiq: c28fe47, Misoc: 86c6fcb, Migen: 6425844, jesd204b: 25fd79d
@jordens Still broken using 4.0.dev+1132.g5b73dd86. Garbage output and kernel halt.
Did you rework the hmc7043 reset and update misoc?
update misoc
Yes, misoc matches that in updated YAML.
rework the hmc7043 reset
Unclear as to what was settled upon as to the rework.
In absence of this rework I don't see serwb or clock configuration errors during boot on my hardware. What modification did you make on HK Sayma? It's unclear from discussion on IRC if anyone has repeated tests of SAWG.
@jbqubit
@jbqubit the HK board working again and the SAWG looks OK now, you should test.
BTW make sure that the RTM gets proper cooling (good airflow with fans + I also added heatsinks on the FPGA and power modules).
@jbqubit Is this issue resolved with the board at UMD?
Yes. I've confirmed this at several specific frequencies using startup kernel. Kernel panics prevent sweeping across a range of frequencies so testing hasn't been exhausted. But please close this issue as I suspect kernel panics are a separate problem.
