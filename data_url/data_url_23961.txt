Give airbridges some buffer distance that prevents them from being drawn if they intersect w/ another component.
If you have a cavity capacitively coupled to a feedline, then you wouldn't want airbridges where there's capacitive coupling between the two. Having the airbridges auto depopulate in those areas would speed up the export_to_gds workflow.
