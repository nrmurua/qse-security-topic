As I see it, there isn't currently a way to run all the unit tests at once.
I would like the current unit tests to be compatible with the pytest framework which provides a way to run all the tests at once.
We can then set up a GitHub workflow to run the tests, linters etc. so that contributors can see the results of the CI run on GitHub itself.
@whitequark had previously tried to run ARTIQ tests through pytest unsuccessfully. Hence, I thought it's useful to run tests using pytest.  It's also one of the most popular Python testing frameworks out there.
https://git.m-labs.hk/m-labs/nix-scripts (see it in action on nixbld.m-labs.hk) already runs all the Python tests via python -m unittest discover and more, e.g. hardware-in-the-loop tests and tests in an isolated and reproducible windows VM.
Using pytest would potentially be ok, though unittest is included in the standard library and is good enough IMO; in fact, it's not clear to me what improvement pytest will really bring.
If you care about this, please send PRs here and in nix-scripts (I can create you an account on git.m-labs.hk if you want). I'm not interested in GitHub workflows which are non-reproducible and depend on proprietary software, among other problems.
