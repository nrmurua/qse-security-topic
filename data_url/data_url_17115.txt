The current CmdDef's, repr is based on its underlying dictionary. This quickly becomes complicated. Perhaps something like
CmdDef(commands=['u1','u2','u3','measure','cx'], qubits=[0,1,2,3])
is simpler to take in at a quick glance.
Maybe __str__ can be like you've written, and __repr__ can have enough detail to show which qubits each command supports? (e.g. u1 works on q0, q1, and q2, cx has (0, 1), (1, 2) etc)
Sounds good to me!
Here's a suggestion to this: #2962 For Tokyo I get the following output:
