I have an experiment with many arguments, and I'd like to be able to perform a 1d scan of a single argument.  Rather than use a Scannable object for each argument, I think it would be nicer to use a single Scannable object and a EnumerationValue object to select the variable, as in the example below.
What I'd like is to be able to set the options for the scan_variable argument and the units of the scan_range argument based on the current selection of the scan_type argument.  Is there a way to do this?
Not currently.
Use one Scannable per variable, the new "disable other scans" feature of the GUI, and perhaps the new MultiScanManager if you have a lot of variables.
