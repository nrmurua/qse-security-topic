For certain unrolled-loop test cases (like the one in the title), the compiler is injecting __quantum__rt__result_record_output calls even if if checks prevent measurements from occurring.
The compiler should not inject those calls for cases like this.
See this gist for the resulting QIR coming from the compiler at the time of this issue creation.
The QIR can also be generated like this in the dev image like this:
You can also run it on the provider hardware in order to see a test actually fail:
When run on H1-1E, the unit test should pass.
Not a regression
No response
No longer marked XFAIL.
