Hello,
I'm trying a very simple example (GHZ state), but I have problems using run_and_measure function.
QUILC returns a 404
and I have this traceback:
I installed pyquil using conda (conda install -c rigetti pysquil : using rigetti channel). The version is 2.1.1 and I'm using the SDK 2.2.2 for linux (rpm version).
Maybe there's still some API version mismatch, but I cannot find it.
thanks,
Fausto
Hello!
This bug was (supposed to be) fixed here 25515d9 , which is part of this pyQuil tag: https://github.com/rigetti/pyquil/releases/tag/v2.2.1 . Try upgrading your pyQuil to v2.2.1, and then let us know if the problem persists.
Sorry about the bug!
I tried also to install pyquil from channel conda-forge (v. 2.2.0) but it has still the bug.
So I tried to install directly from gitlab source (using "pip -e") (v. 2.3.0) and everything's fine.
Yeah the conda-forge build for 2.2.1 is failing for reasons I haven't had time to look into yet
xref #759
