I would like to suggest a change to the way SMEs are called in QuantumOptics.jl.
Consider the H object

which takes X and \rho as arguments. The first equation is what I am calling the "linear version of H".  Perhaps the default setting in "stochastic.master" and "stochastic.master_dynamic" should be with the expectation part calculated and one could imagine using flag to switch to the linear version.
Thanks for raising that point!
I agree that the implementation should be changed. Hopefully, I can get to it in the coming days.
@joshcombes I implemented the non-linear SME as default for all stochastic master equations. You can switch back to the linear form by setting the optional argument nonlinear=false. I will merge this soon.
@david-pl that is great and thanks so much! I will be eagerly awaiting the merge.
@joshcombes I merged the PR. I will leave this issue open until the documentation is updated accordingly. I'll hold off with a new release until then too. In the meantime you can just checkout the master branch
@david-pl I started playing with it in the new branch yesterday. I'll switch back to master and keep using it. Again many thanks.
Drafted a new release including the changes. Documentation is updated and on-line.
