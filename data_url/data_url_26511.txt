I have been hearing a lot of success stories around using fpm to build applications.  Although I have not tried converting a project, it is my understanding that it is fairly easy to do and powerful.  I will try to explore this a little, but those most familiar with the dependencies will know best.
Thanks for sharing. However, I don't think FPM is well suited as build system for CP2K because it's not a pure Fortran project.
The current majority opinion is that we should migrate to CMake. However, since that is a huge undertaking we keep using GNU Make for the time being. Some folks have also suggested that we go straight to Meson, which seems to be new cool kid in town.
