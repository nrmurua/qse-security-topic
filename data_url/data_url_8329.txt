Hi, I want to give different groups of vectors with different colors. How could I manage to do that? I use b.vector_color = ['b'] then everything becomes blue.

vector_color should be able to take a list of colors: b.vector_color = ['b', 'r', 'g']
Could you tell me which version of python you are using? I want to check if it is just me or Bloch() is not compatible with python3.7.
Thanks @Ericgig. I use python 3.5. I think it might be some issue with jupyter notebook. If you do not use jupyter notebook, Bloch() is good for me.
@Ericgig b=Bloch() QuTiP 4.3.1 and 4.4.0.dev0+5af8c1c5 on python 3.7.3 works on Mac, both from shell and Jupyter notebook. Also plotting is fine.
Simply running Bloch() in Jupyter notebook gives the error
but then plots the Bloch sphere, I don't know if it's a problem though or the correct functioning of the class. In shell it gives the object reference.
