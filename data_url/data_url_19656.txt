It should be possible to specify a list of circuits/schedule results, either by name or result object and pass them to the fitter, rather than just assume the fitter was created by Ignis with a specific name.
But this is a psuedo-validation, because the fitter knows what the data should be.
Yes, but it tightly-couples the circuit generation to the fitting procedure. Consider if someone wanted to write a circuit generation method for doing Rabis serially rather than in parallel. They would have to look into the fitter code and know the exact rabi strings to name the circuits with, essentially encoding information in the strings. If they could pass results with associated metadata it would be much more reusable as a standalone entity.
I think more metadata is good. I'd like to move to a model where the circuits/schedules returns list_of_circuits, metadata and then we can save that
Yes, I think that is good. I'm not sure I like the word metadata though, it lends itself to being an anything-goes location. Perhaps CalibrationConfiguration, or something like that.
