Right now they are just floats (missing type info).  Generally these should be parameters at is very common in simulation to want to run the channels for different noisy rates.
Any progress on this? Especially for AsymmetricDepolarizingChannel, a parameterization would be awesome.
@jfold no progress yet! We'd be happy to accept a mini design here & a PR.
