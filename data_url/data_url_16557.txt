If I make a schedule with only one instruction:
then when I execute it, it's type is Instruction and not Schedule, so execute wrongly sends it through the transpiler, thinking it's a QuantumCircuit. Since the transpiler is expecting a circuit, we end up with an attribute error as it tries to access circuit.qubits, which isn't a Schedule property.
The easiest fix is to replace isinstance(experiments, Schedule) with isinstance(experiments, (Schedule, pulse.Instruction), or perhaps more correctly: isinstance(experiments, ScheduleComponent). Would have to add tests and make sure there aren't other consequences of taking an Instruction as input.
This is just an instruction though. Should we allow executing a sole instruction?
Yes. I don't think it's very high priority though
