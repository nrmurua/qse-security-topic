In #152 we have discussed about the technical challenges related to the implementation of gradients for the apply_* custom operators. Given that we perform updates in place and thus gradients with respect to gate parameters (e.g. VQE) need to create and store a copy of the initial state, we decide to postpone the implementation until we have a better system to handle the resources updated in place.
