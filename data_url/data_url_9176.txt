Hello,
I'm packaging python-thewalrus on linux openSUSE Tumbleweed.
Testing thewalrus with pytest failed on i586 microarchitecture but pass on x86.

Hi @kevinsmia1939, I must say I am not surprised, we wrote The Walrus for x86 support first and foremost, and have not tested it on other architectures!
If possible, could you package it just for x86? In this particular case, I'm guessing the tests are generating a Hafnian so large that it's causing overflow on i586.

Thanks,
I will just package it for x86.
