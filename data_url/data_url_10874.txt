Hi,
first of all, thank you for this awesome tool !
I lost a bit of time during the installation because I didn't figure it was using Python 2. Using python 3, it just returns a bunch of strange errors that are not that revealing. I would suggest to add it somewhere in the README or to change the shebang to #!/usr/bin/env python3, so others won't fall into the same trap :).
Glad you like QMASM!
QMASM is supposed to work with both Python 2 and Python 3.  As you can see from the .travis.yml file, QMASM's continuous-integration testing tries running with each of Python 2, Python 3, PyPy 2, and PyPy 3.  However, the tests aren't especially thorough so it's possible you hit a case that hasn't been tested with Python 3.
Could you please post a QMASM command line that fails under Python 3?  I'll then try to reproduce and fix the problem.
Closing this issue.  Python 2 was sunsetted earlier this year so QMASM will henceforth assume that python points to Python 3.
