Problem:
Cirq currently only supports a single unrolled circuit.  Measurements results cannot be fed forward to influence the future execution of the circuit.  This leads to, for example, Cirq not being able to easily describe a teleportation experiment.  There are also use cases for simple feed forward in variational ansatz and simple quantum error correcting protocols.
Depends on feature: Classical data (#3231)
Rough requirements:
A previous feature request #762 was closed as intended because we didn't know how the hardware was going to support this. Do we have more idea now? Any specific requirements due to hardware constraints?
@95-martin-orion @smitsanghavi @MichaelBroughton Initial RFC here: https://tinyurl.com/cirq-feedforward. I'm reasonably happy with it as a first draft.
