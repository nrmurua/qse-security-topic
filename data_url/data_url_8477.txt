In all my recent PR branches many commits are shown. I think these date back to when we started Squash & Merge as our policy. The same policy is in use on our conda-forge/qutip-feedstock but I don't find this issue there. I did a lot of reading, but could not find a nice simple way to stop this happening. Do we know why this is happening? I see @nonhermitian has a similar string of old commits on his PR branches too.
I see we have a new 'Rebase and Merge' option for merging PRs now. Do we think we should be using this?
I think the answer to why this happens is that there are some commits in the origin/master that conflict with the upstream/master, even though the final state of the origin/master has no conflicts with the upstream/master.
A solution therefore is to (on the origin/master branch)
skipping any conflicting commits, then
Will confirm when I have tested a bit more
I managed to remove all the old commits by running
skipping any conflicting commits, then
on my feature branch. As evidenced in #745
But I still don't seem to have sorted out my master branch
The above did actually sort out my master branch - I just needed to run the commands on my laptop as well :-)
I did not need to rebase #746
So I am going to call this answered
