Description
Roof duality fails for very large biases. This likely has to do with the integer representation for the biases. We could consider representing the biases as floats but that would require a substantial rewrite. Probably coinciding with #519
Steps To Reproduce
The failing unittest
Additional Context
See #516 which was a PR to fix this behavior.
Roof duality also fails for small biases when sampling_mode=True:
bqm = dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel.from_ising({}, {(0, 1): -1, (1, 2): 3})
dimod.roof_duality.fix_variables(bqm, sampling_mode=True)
This BQM has no biases, so should not fix any variables in sampling mode.

No longer relevant after #829
