Currently the driver for the AMI430 magnet controller throws an exception if the user attempts to set the current_ramp_limit above 0.6 A/s, preventing the instrument from initializing. This should be a warning rather than an exception.
Should show a warning, but otherwise allow the instrument to initialize.
Throws an exception, albeit one that is of type Warning
