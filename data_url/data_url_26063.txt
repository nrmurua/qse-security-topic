Right now, qbraid.devices of the device_layer branch contains folders assigned to each qbraid supported circuit-building package. Each circuit-building package is linked to one or more QPU and/or simulator provider(s). Eventually, we will have a get_devices function local to each circuit-building package folder so that this global get_devices function can simply call on each, but for now, it will suffice to have all the functionality contained in this one function (we can easily break it up later). The ultimate goal of this issue is to arrive at an implementation of get_devices that pulls supported device lists directly from each qbraid supported provider. The steps toward this goal are as follows:
