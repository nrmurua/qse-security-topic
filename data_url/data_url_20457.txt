Hi Alex, I was thinking that it might be good to have a PRNG that is based on the new AES-NI code that you've added, since that might be faster for large amounts of PRNG expansion than the existing ChaCha20 code when AES-NI is available.  Would you have a chance to try that out?
Sure I can do that.  Want me to just implement AES-CTR?
That would be great!
