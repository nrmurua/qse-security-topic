Installing Terra 0.18.0 via published wheel file qiskit_terra-0.18.0-cp39-cp39-macosx_10_9_universal2.whl or building from source results in the following ImportError:
Install Terra either via pip or build from source native to macosx-arm64 and run code with packages in Terra.
No ImportError.
Building Tweedledum from source in a conda environment as described in Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1286 with the openmp fix seems to resolve this issue. Given that this issue is similar to the ImportError issue with Aer, it seems that it's likely a version issue with either Tweedledum or openmp.
Had the same error with my qiskit upgrade from 0.27.0 to 0.28.0 probably by updating terra (to 0.18.0?). The upgrade installed tweedledum 1.1.0 which failed as described. pip install tweedledum also resulted in a non importable tweedledum package on my M1, using Miniforge.
pip install tweedledum==1.0.0 (not meeting terra 0.18.0 requirements) installed an importable tweedledum (didn't test qiskit). Building from source indeed worked to get a tweedledum 1.1.0, e.g. by pip install tweedledum --no-binary :all:
