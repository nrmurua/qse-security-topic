Hi
The LIMA team have updated their specification to
a v1.1 variant available here...

This removes the problem with the rejection sampling
for encryption mentioned in an earlier comment. This
has been replaced with a standard decryption error
analysis.
The result of this is that parameter sizes for the
power-of-two rings can be made significantly smaller.
We have created new parameters, and the reference and
optimized implementations now implement these.

Won't fix since Lima didn't make it to Round 2.
