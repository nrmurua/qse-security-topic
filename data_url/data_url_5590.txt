Importing AerSimulator causes an import error with DiagonalGate.
qiskit==0.44.3, qiskit-terra==0.25.3, qiskit-aer==0.13.1
qiskit==0.44.3, qiskit-terra==0.25.3, qiskit-aer==0.13.0
qiskit==0.45.0, qiskit-terra==0.45.0, qiskit-aer==0.13.1
No error with qiskit==0.44.3, qiskit-terra==0.25.3, qiskit-aer==0.13.1
I made fix #2008 for this issue. I think to avoid this issue is to install QIskit 0.45.0 after installing Aer 0.13.1 currently.
Fixed by #2008
