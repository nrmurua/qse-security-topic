I received the following error message by accidentally swapping my user id and token, and attempting to call get_devices. I was unable to deduce that this was the problem from the error message - we should probably have a more friendly way of saying that something is wrong with the .pyquil_config file.
A similar error can be gotten just by appending a 1 to your key:
~/.pyquil_config no longer required
