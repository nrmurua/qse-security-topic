Compose fails when combining circuits with no measurements together with those that do, e.g.
gives:
CircuitError: "Trying to compose with another QuantumCircuit which has more 'in' edges."
while + works, but is deprecated in favor of compose.
I believe this behavior is by design, though I agree the error message could be more helpful in leading users to the correct behavior. compose requires self to be wider than other (so that the qubits and clbits arguments can always unambiguously index onto the bits in self), so in this case, the call would need to be qc.compose(ansatz, front=True).
Ok, it makes sense although a bit confusing.  Namely, I cannot add a measurement circuit onto an ansatz, but rather I must append the needed measurement rotation gates to the ansatz itself before adding the measurements to it.  It would be nice if this could work if self has no cregs given that there is no ambiguity in that case and it is a common situation to be in.
I agree with Paul. Adding a measurement circuit onto the end of a non-measurement circuit is something I do quite often.
For my own purposes, I just construct the non-measurement circuit with a classical register so that it works. But when writing educational materials, it wouldn't be great to say "here we put in a classical register just so Qiskit doesn't complain".
Yeah, I do not see any reason why this cannot be done, and it seems like a common situation to be in. I will do a PR for it.
