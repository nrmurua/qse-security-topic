python3 -c 'import qiskit'
successful import without warnings
__init.py__ is out of sync with the new Aer provider name and this needs to be corrected
Please see my comment on your PR: #3184 (comment) this was intended to be aer. For more background information you can also refer to the PR which added this here: #2842 (and the multiple issues that reference it later). The real fix for this warning is to abandon namespace packaging for qiskit. But that is larger in scope than just terra and effects all the qiskit packages so it's being tracked in the meta-repository here: #559
I'm going to close this accordingly, but please feel free to reopen this issue if you think that I'm missing something or there is more to discuss on this.
