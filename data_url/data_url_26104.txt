As noted in #374, toqito.perms module might not work as intended on macOS.  The following test fails on macOS which is why it is skipped in a Github workflow for macOS.

To fix this issue: Check functions from toqito.perms in a macOS virtual machine or an actual macOS device.
This could possibly be an issue in scipy and/or numpy. If this is the case, recreate the issue with a simple reproducible example without using functions in toqito. For more info, see numpy/numpy#25395 (comment))
If no one has taken interest in this issue and is not part of a  project, I'd like to take this one on.
I use a Mac on a daily basis.
Another pair of eyes would be great if you're willing to spare them on this, @Bchass !
Thank you, as always, for your interest and support!
