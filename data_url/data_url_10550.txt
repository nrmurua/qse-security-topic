In dimod 0.12.0, the CQM models started storing the variable info globally rather than in the objective. However, the serialization was not changed to match, see dwavesystems/dimod#1303.
This creates a situation where the serialized model does not have the same number of biases as the given model.
Failing example:

The correct fix is to implement dwavesystems/dimod#1303, though we could as an interim solution read the relevant timing variables off of the header of the serialized model.
