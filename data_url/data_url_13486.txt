Mitiq's about() function yields the incorrect version of Qiskit.
Using from mitiq import about and about() the listed Qiskit version is incorrect.
Recommend using qiskit.__qiskit_version__ and getting qiskit.
qiskit.__qiskit_version__:
{'qiskit-terra': '0.16.4', 'qiskit-aer': '0.7.5', 'qiskit-ignis': '0.5.2', 'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.11.1', 'qiskit-aqua': '0.8.2', 'qiskit': '0.23.6'}

This seems to be an issue with how Qiskit checks for versions. For more, see here.
I agree it would be good to display qiskit.__qiskit_version__["qiskit"] instead of the current https://github.com/unitaryfund/mitiq/blob/master/mitiq/_about.py#L44.
I thought it would make a good first issue, but probably too confusing if it stays open for much time.
