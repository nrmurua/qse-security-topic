Right now, if you are submitting a quantum program to IonQ, it goes through the braket_ionq_compile function to make sure the circuit uses only gates supported by Amazon Braket for IonQ. However, this requires the additional pyket-braket dependency. So we would like to add a keyword argument to the AwsDeviceWrapper.run method so that the user can specify not to go through the compiler step so that the additional dependency is not explicitly required to run on IonQ.
