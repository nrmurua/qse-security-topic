Mock Backends that are said to support Open Pulse doesn't pass assemble() stage.
The code runs without any error.
Real counterparts of those mock backends does not support open pulse. Maybe that's the issue here. However, this could be very handy to have 5qubits mock backends.
I believe this issue is not related to Aer.
@nkanazawa1989 told me that this issue looks similar to Qiskit/qiskit#5410.
This PR was merged in the last Dec but the latest terra does not contain it.
@mtreinish I guess this PR can be merged to stable-0.16 branch?
The issue is also very similar to #1047.
@vvilpas had that solution :
The problem is that when valencia_model is instantiated, some UchannelLO objects are created, but instead of having scale property as a complex number they end up with a list.
While we fix this, you can manually handle this doing the following right after valencia_model is created:
for uclo in valencia_model.u_channel_lo:
uclo[0].scale = complex(*uclo[0].scale)
This solved my issue.
Thanks.
