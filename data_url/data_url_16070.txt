The output of qiskit.version.QiskitVersion() is
When importing the FakeAthens, gettting the schedule for the u3 instruction and plotting an exception is generated.
Depending on this qiskit version I get different error messages. The version reported above yields:
A minimal example is:
print(qiskit.version.QiskitVersion())
The schedule should be plotted
None
@nkanazawa1989 I believe this was a bug introduced with the release of parameters + schedules. Would you mind having a look?
@taalexander @nkanazawa1989 The issues still exists on current master.
Investigating this a result of the implementation of partial which does not fully bind your argument but rather creates a new function with the partially bound argument as a keyword argument.
See partial docs for a description of how it works. In general I would expect any function with keyword arguments to have this issue as these keyword arguments would be treated as arguments for the instruction calibration, we do not support optional arguments in mapping circuit instructions to schedules as circuit instructions do not support optional arguments themselves.
Its a question of what the expected behaviour should be? The two options are:
Thanks for reporting the bug. Fixed in #6282. I just mistook the data type of .phase. This can be ParameterExpression (I assumed Parameter) which doesn't have .name property.
