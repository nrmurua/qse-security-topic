I updated some of the examples in qiskit-tutorial/community/terra/
beginners_guide_composer_examples.ipynb
fourier_transform.ipynb
topological_quantum_walk.ipynb
Would it be helpful if I continue updating other examples in that directory?
Yes, it would. Thanks very much.
Don't push yet as I'm about to try to merge terra with master but I'm not touching that section at the moment so you are all good. After the merge, I would pr your changes into master as I will close down the temp branch (will not affect your local branch).
Also if you are interested with @attp and others you should discuss how that section should be arranged in issue #285 as my goal is it should be a learning path to teach quantum information science using qiskit. Love to get your input.
Sounds good thank you.
#299  should make master the new structure.
I'm going to close this and in #285 we can track the updates.
