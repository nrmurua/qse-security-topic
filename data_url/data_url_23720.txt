No warnings should arise when defining set_cmd, get_cmd, and val_mapping.
When defining a val_mapping for a StandardParameter, a nonsensical warning is raised.
Note that the val_mapping works as expected.
Looking in parameters.py, the statement if get_parser is not None and not isinstance(get_cmd, str): does not anticipate that get_parser is set if a val_mapping is set.

maybe @alexcjohnson  can weight in ?
You're right, that warning is not true anymore and should be removed. I believe what happened was when we first introduced get_parser and val_mapping, people were worried that allowing all of these things to be used together would be confusing and unnecessary. Somewhere along the line that restriction was removed but the warning was not.
Okay, I'll remove it.
