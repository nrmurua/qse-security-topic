python_requires=('>=2.7,!=3.0.*,!=3.1.*,!=3.2.*,!=3.3.*,!=3.4.*, !=3.5.0, !=3.5.1') is easier to read as python_requires=('>=2.7, >=3.5.2').
Thanks @hugovk for the suggestion.
I believe python_requires=('>=2.7, >=3.5.2') will still match 3.0 - 3.4 because they're bigger than 2.7.
This simplification can only be done when dropping 2.7:
Got it. That's why it was like that.
