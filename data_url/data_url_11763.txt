When I try to run a VQE job I get the following error:
qiskit.aqua.utils.run_circuits:WARNING : FAILURE: the 0-th chunk of circuits, can not get job id, Resubmit the qobj to get job id. Terra job error: "{'status': 400, 'message': 'Generic error', 'code': 'GENERIC_ERROR'}"

@gvnjones The failure saying there is not the algorithm fails, it means the job somewhat failed; however, underly Aqua will recover/retrieve your job and then try to get results. You should be able to see the message like this, which means your job is complete eventually.
To resolve this issue, you can use the new API endpoint when you enable the account.
You can get the url here: https://quantum-computing.ibm.com.
After you login, go to your account to copy the url.
Then, modifying your code to
Please let me know if you still see this message after you switch to the new API.
Thanks.
Hi @chunfuchen, I now get a new error after following your instructions:
What is your qiskit version? Do you use the qiskit 0.10?
Btw, I can not run your codes with qiskit 0.10, there are few out-of-date parameters in your dictionary.
here is my testing env
I find you posted your env on the slack; however, it seems something wrong when you running your program. The batch_mode in algorithm and max_worker in operator are removed at Aqua 0.5.
Furthermore, the error message you had
but line 128 of this file at qiskit-ibmq-provider 0.2.2 should be
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/blob/0.2.2/qiskit/providers/ibmq/api/utils.py#L128
It seems that you still use qiskit-ibmq-provider 0.1
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/blob/0.1/qiskit/providers/ibmq/api/utils.py#L128
Thanks @chunfuchen. Your analysis helped.
I think the problem was that two versions of Qiskit were installed and they were in conflict. An older version was being inadvertently used to create dictionaries, and a newer version was being used to run jobs. I performed a clean uninstall ofÂ both versions, then after reinstalling Qiskit and generating a new dictionary it seems like the job is now working.
