When you add an identity spider with the magic wand, it looks like the vertex is added with just a slight vertical offset. This dissapears as soon as you move the vertex as it is then fit to the grid.
I'm not sure this is desired behaviour.
Accidentally added this issue to PyZX instead of ZXLive: Quantomatic/zxlive#78
