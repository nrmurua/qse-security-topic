Description
When MIP is used to produce a penalty model, the following warning gets printed
The code still finishes as usual, but the warning is unexpected. I suspect the warning is due to the following constraint in MIP
Previously, the lowerbound on gap was merely 0.
To Reproduce
The gap constraint with the min_classical_gap lower-bound is more difficult to satisfy than 0. Hence, it results to more infeasible models. PR #93 addresses this by finding infeasible models and ending the code earlier on.
