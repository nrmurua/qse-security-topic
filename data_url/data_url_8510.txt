Gitter is a networking platform with tight integration to Github. Its shows the latest activity (commits, PR, comments on issues) and can be a place for people to quickly connect with other QuTiP users and find solutions. For example, the gitter channel for Dipy is pretty active and helpful. (https://gitter.im/nipy/dipy)
Has QuTiP considered integrating gitter with the repository ?
I have not heard of this service before.  I have added QuTiP as a community:
https://gitter.im/qutip/Lobby
If it doesn't take off then we can always just close it.
Thanks for adding. I hope this becomes an active place for discussions in the community. Adding a link on the qutip website and the README on github might help.
