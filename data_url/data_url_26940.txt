quantum theoretically has the ability to preform a seamless rolling restart, given that the file descriptors can be passed during a fork-exec operation. According to the go documentation this is possible, so the idea would be to start a new quantum instance but pass in the file descriptors of the TUN and Sockets.
This would effectively allow for the current quantum instance to gracefully terminate, without losing packets.
