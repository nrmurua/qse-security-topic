pip install  qiskit-aer-gpu -v
I created a new conda env, and typed  pip install  qiskit-aer-gpu -v
I think it should works.
None
I think I got the reason, I have a higher python version that  qiskit-aer-gpu support
Just to confirm, I got the same error with python 9.10 I needed to go to 9.8 to install with pipenv
