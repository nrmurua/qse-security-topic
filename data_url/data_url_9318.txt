Describe the bug
The value of the C6 coefficient printed in the output description is a factor of 10 larger than what is expected for the Rydberg state considered (70S) which should be 2pi862690 MHz(µm)^6.
Please see the screenshot below.
Expected behavior
The exact value should be C6 = 2pi862690 MHz*(µm)^6

Version Info
Additional context
The problem is with the printing and not with the code of the simulation.
good catch thanks!
