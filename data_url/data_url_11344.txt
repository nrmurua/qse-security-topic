I want to add some code which optionally requires CVXOPT and GLPK (Gnu Linear Programming Kit).
The code will also work with scipy but scipy supports only the simplex method of linear programming, which is very slow for my application. The code will use scipy by default and raise an exception saying that CVXOPT and GLPK are not installed if one wants to use that but don't have these installed.
We should not add CVXOPT and GLPK to the requirements file (for PyPI to see) because GLPK might be difficult to install automatically for some systems. But we'll need to have it on travis so I can run my tests.
Does this seem like a reasonable plan?
Took care of this.
