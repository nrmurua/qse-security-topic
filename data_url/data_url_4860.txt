When I try to append circuit block on tf backend and use torch interface, I met an autograph error somehow related to MPS simulator. (Althought I am not using it.)
And I try to comment c.replace_mps_inputs(self.quvector()) in line 857 of circuit.py because my codes do not need MPS simulator. Then everything works well.
We have refactored the append and prepend method for circuit based on qir instead of replace_mps_inputs,   I have tested you script with GitHub master version and it works well with no error. I will release the new version 0.3.0 today or tomorrow :)
And just comment out replace_mps_input may gives the wrong result though no explicit error. So please use the new version of tensorcircuit (either from GitHub or until its pip release very soon). Or you can try pip install tensorcircuit-nightly which is a daily release for the GitHub master (remember to uninstall tensorcircuit first).

That indeed solves my problem. Many thanks!
