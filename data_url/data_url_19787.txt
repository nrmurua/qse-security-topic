pylint has mechanisms to detect usage of data members before they are initialized:
http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/messages:e1101
http://pylint-messages.wikidot.com/messages:e0203
However they do not work if the data member (qubit in our case) is accessed with self.
In other words, pylint cannot save us from this kind of error, regardless of our .pylintrc file.
I tried pyflakes and flake8, they do not detect it either.
Possibly editors like PyCharm can make it, I did not check this direction.
@mtreinish do you have any input on the above? The issue is that we had a class variable that was spelled wrong; is there a lint procedure to check that?
