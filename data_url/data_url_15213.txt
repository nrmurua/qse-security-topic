I have confirmed that this bug occurs with Qiskit Experiments 0.4.0 and Qiskit Terra 0.22.0 0.22.2 on my Mac. Using the current main of both Qiskit Experiments and Qiskit Terra, I get the output below. Is this the output you would have expected? If yes, then I would say this bug is fixed for the next release.
Edit 2022.11.16 15:42 UTC:
I can confirm that the main version of Qiskit Experiments and Qiskit Terra 0.22.2 works.
Doing a git bisect from main to 0.4.0 showed that the bug was “fixed” in Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments#898.
This is a bug in Terra. Let's export it as a Terra issue. The following is a minimal code to fail.
This error can be avoided by changing Clifford object to Instruction object by random_clifford(1).to_instruction().
That is the reason why the main version of Qiskit Experiments does not fail while the 0.4.0 fails. As @conradhaupt mentioned above, Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-experiments#898 changed to always convert Clifford objects into Instruction objects before appending to a circuit, that results in avoiding the bug.
@itoko: Ah! That makes sense.
This is related to #9159 as Clifford operations are not instructions.
Fixed by #8907
