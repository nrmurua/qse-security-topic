We have a use case where we query the statevector, which in our case is a basis state. If we use get_snapshot or the statevector snapshot, we obtain a vector of length 2^n. We would like to have the option to represent the statevector as a dictionary that maps basis states to amplitudes, where zero amplitudes do not have to be present.
Create a new snapshot, which will probably call vec2ket of utils.hpp.
This will be handled by the new SaveStatevectorDict instruction
