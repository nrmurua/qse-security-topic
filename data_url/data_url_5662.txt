Trying to run AerSimulator.from_backend on a backend with faulty_qubits leads to errors.
It builds a noise model for all qubits not in the faulty_qubits list
Ignore qubits that are in the faulty_qubits list
Currently, from_backend fails because some parameters (such as T1) are None. We may be able to set "None" means "Ideal" or "Error" but we need specification. At this moment, we will be able to ignore "None" and then run simulation without noise for these qubits.
