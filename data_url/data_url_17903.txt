Cloning a fresh copy of qiskit-terra and running from a clean venv (with just the requirements installed) fails with the following errors from the vcr/backend tests.
The tests pass without any errors on a fresh clone of the repo. For new developers it makes it very difficult to figure out if any potential changes are working or not if the tests don't work locally without any changes to master.
Is it possible the cassetes went out of date @1ucian0?
Sorry, took me too long to see this. Fixed in PR #1137
@1ucian0 I'm still seeing errors (on multiple machines):
Let me have another look. Thanks for checking!
on hold, waiting for a solution in #1203
#1203 seems solved. Removing on hold.
Pending PR in #1325.
