If the bug manifests in unexpected behavior (as opposed to a crash), confirm that you have consulted the
API documentation
In jupyter notebooks, editing any field in the Noise Params section of the scqubits GUI results in the following exception being raised: local variable 'i_text_widget' referenced before assignment
Expected behavior is to be able to edit the values of the textboxes in the Noise Params section of the scQubits GUI.
To reproduce this bug, call scqubits.GUI() in a jupyter notebook, navigate to the 'Noise Params' tab, and change the value of any of the text boxes by using the arrow keys or entering a new value and pressing 'Enter.'
@dkweiss31 informed me that he was unable to reproduce this bug on his system. The bug appeared in both my Linux and Windows setups, and I believe that he is using MacOS. This could point to the behavior being OS-dependent.
@benmcdonough20 In what line number of gui.py is the exception raised?
I'm unable to reproduce this error on my machine (Windows 11). This is a problem none of the pytests would catch, however. It is possible there's a platform or version specific issue. Shoot me an email, please,  so we can look into this together.
@sujoju That variable is local to coherence_text. The nested ifs there are hard to track...
@benmcdonough20 This actually appears to be related to a fix pushed under #167. This has been incorporated into the current master, but has not been released yet. Can you please check out the current master (if you did not when running into this issue) and check whether the same problem occurs?
@jkochNU My mistake! I didn't consider that the PyPi version would not be the most recent.
I cloned the master and the issue did not appear. Thanks!
Closing this as addressed by fix to #167 & to be included in next incremental release.
