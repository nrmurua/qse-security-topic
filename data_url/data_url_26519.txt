Dear cp2k Team
In a simulation with an asymmetric .xyz file, I get a warning that a few atoms are too close but they are on opposite sides of the y-axis. My guess is that there is a bug in indexing.
*** WARNING in particle_methods.F:684 :: The distance between the atoms  *** *** 16 and 21 is only 0.400 angstrom and thus smaller than the threshold *** *** of 0.500 angstrom                                                    ***
The .inp and .xyz files are attached. Note that this occurs on a local Haswell machine with 2 sockets with 8 cores each as well as at cscs.ch Piz Daint gpu node.

There is no bug.
You need to consider the periodic boundary conditions.
Please note that periodicity is the default: https://www.cp2k.org/periodicity
Thanks!
