I expected add_basis_gates() would append that string to the basis gates of the noise model.
It seems to me this may be a bug. The source code for add_basis_gates() has a warning message (view by passing warnings=True) saying that it's adding a non-standard gate to the noise model basis, even though nothing happens. Sorry if it's actually the expected behavior and I'm just using it wrong.
(While I'm here -- bigger picture I'm trying to define a custom error, and add it to a circuit as its own gate (quantum_channel), and run that in a simulator. I'm now starting to think this doesn't require any noise model at all actually, because the Aer backend itself already supports a quantum_channel, but while tinkering found the above behavior that seems like a bug).
Aer does not handle the predefined gates which are listed in backend_utils.py. Therefore, add_basis_gates('my_gate') does not add any basis gates (warning will appear if warnings=True is specified).
I guess that this document may help your work.
