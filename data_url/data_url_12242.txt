In the example script below, when circuit_drawer is called, does the image pop up? I just get stuck there and does not see any circuit image. If this is just my problem, is there anyway to save the image instead?
Example script:
Hi,
I am using macOSX. Replacing the last line with the following line gave me a pop-up image of the circuit:
The original line without show() works with jupyter notebook.
It does not seem to work for me. I cannot find the source code of circuit_drawer or qiskit.tools.visualization, so I can try to see how to save the image. Do you know where I can find it? (For plot_histogram there is pop-up.)
If you can use jupyter notebook, I suggest you plot the circuits like this tutorial:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/reference/tools/matplotlib_circuit_drawer.ipynb
If you use it in Jupyter notebook, please write %matplotlib inline as https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/reference/tools/matplotlib_circuit_drawer.ipynb
If you use it stand-alone, you can save a figure by calling circuit_drawer(qc, filename='circuit.png').
I think this issue has been solved. Please reopen it if the problem persists.
