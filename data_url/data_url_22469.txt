Following Installing ARTIQ instructions...
$ conda install artiq-pipistrello-nist_qc1
Conda successfully installs the bit file to the location specified in build.sh.
But this path is unknown to artiq_flash.
The following is needed but not documented.
That artiq directory is not the one where your artiq_flash lives. You have multiple artiq's installed.
Please reread my bug report.The conda script does not install .bit into a location automatically found in artiq_flash. I know how to make things work. The point of this report to point out that at present new users will encounter errors if they follow the conda installation instructions verbatim. Have you tried to reproduce what I see?
Is python -c 'import artiq; print(artiq.__artiq_dir__)' == ~/miniconda3/envs/pip2/lib/python3.5/site-packages/artiq/?
You can't mix and match a partial conda install and a partial pip/setup.py install the way you do it.
I see the source of the confusion. "pip2" is the name of the conda environment I setup for pipistrello v2.
Next time, please don't assert that you know what the bug is. This generally doesn't help.
If you get the bitstreams from conda but the artiq package from a locally installed (pip/setup.py or --user oder --develop) version, you have to play several tricks to make the "easy access" tools work.
