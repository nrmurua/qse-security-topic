0.0.0.0 is a special reserved IP and shouldn't be used to run the server. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.0.0.0
We should use localhost in docs instead.
Maybe the covalent start output can be enhanced so that it's more like Jupyter.
I would like to work on this issue. Kindly assign me
Also Please give some more context to this issue.  Need some more hints
Thanks
Hi @divshacker! Thank you for being so interested in this issue. I'm assigning this to you.
For more context:
Covalent's browser-based UI can be accessed via http://0.0.0.0:48008 (The actual port value might not be 48008). However, copy-pasting this address doesn't work for all browsers. I believe it works for Chrome, but not Safari. There are other browsers as well that don't support 0.0.0.0. The solution is to replace 0.0.0.0 with localhost.  For example, http://localhost:48008 would be supported in all the browsers.
In order to complete this issue
Hope that helps! :)
Just made a PR @FyzHsn
Let me know your views
Thanks
hi @scottwn, this is Misty from the UF team!
Checking to see why the "unitaryhack-bounty" label was removed from this issue- if it's because @divshacker 's solution is accepted, you can leave the label on and the unitaryHACK website will be automatically updated once the PR is merged.
Hey @Misty-W, we had discussed the bounties and thought that #605 would be a more interesting issue for unitaryhack. I opened a PR indicating the change this morning. I'm happy to put the bounty label back on this issue if that's better for y'all.

I see, thanks for the explanation @scottwn! Looks like you already have a participant who's working on a solution, so let's keep this as a bountied issue. I'll check with the rest of the team to see if we can add a bounty to #605 as well.
Good news, @scottwn- Covalent's bounty budget has increased by $25, so you can have both #202 and #605. I have a PR open on the UH website, should be merged tomorrow. ðŸª„ðŸŽ‰
@scottwn this can be closed right?
not until #670 is merged
