Description of the issue
See code below
How to reproduce the issue
Got error object of type '<class 'cirq.ops.gate_operation.GateOperation'>' does have a channel, mixture or unitary method, but it returned NotImplemented.
Cirq version
0.9.0
0.10.0.dev
The root cause appears to be that the has_(channel|mixture) functions allow decomposition, but the channel and mixture methods do not. (Notably, the unitary method does allow decomposition.)
Since PhasedXZGate implements _has_unitary_ but not _unitary_, it behaves as described above.
Recommended fix would be to invoke the lower protocols in channel and mixture rather than using getattr.
