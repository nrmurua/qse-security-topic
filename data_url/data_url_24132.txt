Qutip has been updated and now numpy does not need to have a constraint on the version based on information from Qiskit group.
Information from Qiskit group:
The new release of qutip also supports python 3.10, and since qiskit terra does now too, I also added python 3.10 support to dynamics in the same PR:
Qiskit-Extensions/qiskit-dynamics#82 .
(This also required updating black and pylint to newer version, and adding python 3.10 to be included in the test suite.)
The PR has many line/file changes, but the majority are just from the updated formatter and linter requirements
This should be done in two steps.
Merged and Metal is using 3.9 and 3.10 now.
