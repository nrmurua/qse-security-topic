When doing the pulse-level simulation with more than 3 measurements at the end of the circuit, it always crashes when shots >100; occasionally succeeds when shots < 10.
A minimum reproducible code is attached below.
It should succeed
My dirty-but-quick solution is to set memory_slots twice, as commented in the code below. Another more elegant solution is to count how many measurements are there in def _full_simulation(exp, y0, pulse_sim_desc, pulse_de_model, solver_options=None):. Either raising an exception if memory variable is not enough to hold all measurements, or simply increase it automatically so that it can hold all measurement results. Currently, this python function will call a C++ function write_shots_memory in qiskit-aer/src/open_pulse/pulse_utils.cpp which doesn't check for the size of numpy array, leading to memory write overflow.
Pulse simulator is being deprecated. Please use qiskit-dyamics and report an issue if you encounter the similar phenomena.
