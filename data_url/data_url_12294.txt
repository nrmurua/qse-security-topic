Hello, I'd like to update the notebook working_with_backends.ipynb with the latest backends.
What's the first step for me to make this contribution?  Create my own branch?
Hi, thank you for your interest.
We'd be glad to have your contribution.
The first step is to create your own fork (by clicking the fork link on the upper right corner).
Then you can work on the master branch of the fork (or, create a new branch), and do the updates.
After finishing the updates, you can issue pull request to merge your changes.
Please let me know if you need any other information.
Thanks.  That's enough to get me started.
BTW, do you know if they ever plan an bringing ibmqx2 back online?  It's been down for quite a long time now.
OK I created the pull request and it says some conflicts need to be resolved.  They look pretty minor.  Is that something I can do?
Changes merged.
