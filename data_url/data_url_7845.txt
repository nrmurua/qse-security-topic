The plot_spin_distribution_2d function allows to project a spin distribution function from the surface of a unit sphere to the unit disk. QuTiP uses matplotlib.pyplot.pcolor to perform this task and calculates a meshgrid X, Y to plot the function to. Due to some changes in matplotlib the current implementation is deprecated and will return errors in a few minor releases.
We could quickly fix this by passing shading='auto' to the call of ax.pcolor() in the visualization.py. However, this raises another UserWarning that the center points are not monotonically sorted.
The cleanest way to fix this bug would be to pass the edges of the quadrilaterals to pcolor(). But we can not calculate them exactly from the given points in theta, phi. Hence, we would need to redesign the interface to this function and to related functions like plot_spin_distribution_3d and spin_q_function.
I expect the same plot, but without the warning which becomes an error in the future.
