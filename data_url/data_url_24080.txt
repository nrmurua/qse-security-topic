It is useful to have the link to the project docs on the GitHub home page for this repo.
To fix this, go to the "Code"/home page of the repo. Then click the wheel on the "about" section on the right. Set the website to https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/metal/.

Thanks!
Thank you! Fixed it
Thanks! It looks like the link isn't being recognized. You may need to put / at the end?
Good catch, fixed! b
