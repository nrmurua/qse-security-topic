Looks like runtime.fbi isn't included in the latest conda 1493. Conversation moved to github for tracking.
It is in fact included, but now instead of being in binaries/kc705
it is in binaries/kc705/nist_qc1 (or /nist_qc2).
From now on we build both nist_qc1 and nist_qc2 FPGA bitstream (and runtime).
You can chose which mezzanine board you want to use when using artiq_flash.sh by
providing the -m parameter (see the help)
At present you must choose which mezzanine board you want.
However, the script --help says that the default is nist_qc1. Please
make the script execution reflect this default.
That problem aside it still doesn't work right. As of conda 1502.
About the default not working for -m it is very weird because it should already work: https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/frontend/artiq_flash.sh#L13
About the flashing issue, you have conflicts between your locally installed artiq module (installed by manually typing python3 setup install or python3 setup develop) and your artiq conda package.
Make sure your environment is correctly using all the conda installation:
$ which python should output the path to anaconda's python binary.
$ python -c "import artiq; print(artiq.__path__[0])" should print the path to artiq module within anaconda environment
Ah, the artiq_flash.sh script uses "python3", can you retype those 2 commands with python3 instead of python?
Hmmm this does not make any sense, can you open the file at echo $(which artiq_flash.sh) and uncomment line 6 which should be "set -x" https://github.com/m-labs/artiq/blob/master/artiq/frontend/artiq_flash.sh#L6 and run it again please? And then paste the output here.
Edited. Rerun.

#112 (comment).
Part of the problem is that the binaries directory doesn't exist.
This path is not the installed conda ARTIQ package.
The conda ARTIQ package installs in there: lib/python3.4/site-packages/artiq/
I think you must have done some python setup.py install while in the anaconda environment.
Please remove this .egg directory
OK. Looks like this fixed the problem!
So, going forward is there a way to make sure that artiq_flash.sh is looking in the right place for its dependencies?
