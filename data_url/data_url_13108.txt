Currently we have a function in mitiq.pec.representations called  represent_operation_with_local_depolarizing_noise. It would be nice to have something similar for amplitude damping noise.
After merging #701, a private function called _represent_operation_with_amplitude_damping_noise has been added which
works only for operations of cirq.Circuit type.
If applicable, provide some references that will help us better understand the request.
SGTM. If this representation requires a reset channel and a particular front-end doesn't support reset, it makes sense for this function to fail with that front-end.
(Out of curiosity, is there a different representation which doesn't use reset?)

Interesting question. Short answer: it is not easy to avoid the reset.
Long answer:
If we assume a basis of noisy operations with the fixed structure basis_circuit = [gate(qubit), noise_channel(qubit)], then it can be shown that, unless we have at disposal some  non-unitary gate(s) (e.g. reset), it is impossible to represent any ideal unitary operation if noise_channel is non-unital (e.g. amplitude damping).
The reason is any quasi-probability mixture of basis_circuit elements would be non-unital too and so can never be equal to an ideal unitary operation.
