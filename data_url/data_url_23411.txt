CookBooks should address the things more generally.
These were requested a year ago but like many other things ignored (#124).
It's a good time to fix this.
I'd certainly like to chip in on this.
@WilliamHPNielsen @Unga Are the cookbooks like the examples in https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/tree/master/docs/examples?
I think if would help to add a README.md in the qcodes/docs/examples directory with a list of the most important examples (Tutorial.ipynb would be on top of the list). Also I think the Tutorial.ipynb should be simplified and some examples in that notebook moved to other examples.
@peendebak  yes very similar but smaller, so that it's easier to digest them (or even copy paste).
Agree with the tutorial, it was never written for somebody that is really a beginner, as it has been show in qdev  ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
