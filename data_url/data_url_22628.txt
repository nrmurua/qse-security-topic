Observation: when one program ends, it also terminates adjacent scheduled program
I don't understand the logging output.
Looks like you are just running a series of 3 experiments that fail one by one to do something related to the core device.
Suggestions on how to debug this? What can cause the following exception?
artiq.master.worker.WorkerError: Worker ended while attempting to receive data
The relevant part is before. The core device closes the connection for some reason. Can you run the problematic experiment again, and then use artiq_coretool log to get the core device low-level log?
Or could it be that you are pausing from a kernel RPC? Does the problem also manifest itself when the experiment is run alone, or through artiq_run?
The proper way to use pause with kernels is to disconnect from the core device (self.core.comm.close()) before pausing, which precludes RPCing pause calls as well.
Otherwise, the core device will disconnect the paused experiment (which can cause this backtrace) when the preempting experiment connects.
@whitequark could you add support for non-RPCable functions (a flag on a function that causes a compile-time error when attempting to call it) and mark the pause function as such?
Will do
Done
Thanks!
