Ignis is not maintained for a year already. However, there are still some residual code mentioning it:
Let's remove them.
Are any of these already not slated for removal already. The stuff in utils is all deprecated and will be removed with the QuantumInstance with the exception of optionals. But, I'm not sure removing the import checker for ignis really buys us much, we typically don't remove optional import checkers even if we stop using an optional dependency. But, we can remove it too there is unlikely to be any users for it.
I think the optional can be removed. It recommends installing unmaintained code and enables parts of Qiskit that are not tested.
If the optional goes (and for the case of Ignis, I think that's fine), we should be sure to check the terminology in the rest of the optionals - I think there's a HAS_IBMQ as well, and there's a fairly decent chance that the documentation around them still refers to "Qiskit elements".
This is complete now on main the only reference to ignis in the library is the optional importer which is fine to keep around.
