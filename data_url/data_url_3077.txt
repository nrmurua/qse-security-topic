A Lark parsing exception is raised when attempting to add a delay on a 2 qubit frame. PyQuil allows the creation of the delay instruction, but it fails when attempting to compile or parse.
Relevant Lark line.
There seems to be some crufty-ness in the QUIL-T syntax for supporting this since multiple qubits and possibly frames are allowed today.
See attached notebook: frame_parsing_issue.ipynb.zip
Using standard QCS Notebook.
