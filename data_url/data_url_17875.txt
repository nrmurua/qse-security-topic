Running the test suite resulted in my public IBMQ credentials being removed from my qiskitrc file.  Note that I also have another account stored that appears to be untouched.
Can you re-check after #1000 goes through (pinging @ajavadia )? There seems to be a missing custom_qiskitrc() decorator in test_remove_account(), and that test is likely to be updated during that PR.
Just to point out, this is indeed resolved
