Hi all,
currently we are working on a time depended version of the SME solver. There is a strategic decision to be made. At the moment, the stochastic.py file is the second largest file in qutip due to variety of methods involved. So it is a kind of mess. We think it makes sense to create stochastic_td.py to contain all the related time depended cases for solvers etc. Should we do it or is it better to keep enlarging the stochastic.py file?
I believe that there are others working on similar things.  We have a relatively new guy named Eric, who works with @arnelg , who mentioned working on this.  I dont have his GitHub name at the moment, but I mentioned your issue to him.
Another thought would be that it might be good for you to be part of the QuTiP slack group.  Since you contribute fairly regularly, it would be good to be in the loop of things.
What is QuTiP slack group?
A chat app for devs that integrates nicely with github.  It us how we discuss things.
So, how can I join the chat?
Send me your email to my private address, nonhermitian at Gmail, and I will add you.  You will also need to get the Slack app for your phone and/ or computer.
The new version is merged and will be released soon.
