Error in a code comment in the ARTIQ Manual: "getting started with core language"
The final code snippet incorrectly states the playback advance as 50*(100+100)ns. It should say 100*(100+100)ns
The final code block in "Direct Memory Access" includes the comments:
"# execute RTIO operations in the DMA buffer
# each playback advances the timeline by 50*(100+100) ns  "
The second line of this is incorrect and should read:
"  # each playback advances the timeline by 100*(100+100) ns "
Each loop has a duration of (100+100)ns. 100ns pulse followed by 100ns delay. 100 such loops are carried out, therefore the full playback advances the timeline by:
100*(100+100) ns
Relevant code:
"for i in range(100):
self.ttl0.pulse(100ns)
delay(100ns)"
For most ARTIQ users this is trivial, but as a novice ARTIQ/Python user this caused some confusion.

NA, documentation error.
Fixed, thanks. By the way, for similar issues in the future, you can just click the pencil (edit) button on the page you linked, and submit a pull request straight from the web UI.
Thanks. Wasn't sure if that was good practice. If I come across any more like this I will.
