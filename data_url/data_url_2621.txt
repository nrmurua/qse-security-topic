@babbush @kevinsung @dabacon opinions?
On the one hand, Rz is more true to what the user said and what they expect. On the other hand, using Rz is a visual difference with no particular corresponding behavior difference and it takes more horizontal space.
I vote for Rz(0.5pi). I don't care if multiple visualizations map to the same unitary.
