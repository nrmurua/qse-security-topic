Using KC705 in Penning lab. Connected to legacy Penning hardware using FMC-LVDS adapter.
In test mode run DDS tests on AD9858. Generates all 1111's.
Happened whenever a DDS register was read - always returned 0xff. Might be a hardware problem, and this did not happen in previous tests.
Repeated pattern is not noise. Using Penning lab test setup.
Can you try with a single read, and check with a logic analyzer if 1) the FPGA provides a valid pulse on rd_n 2) following the pulse, the DDS system provides valid levels on the data pins after going through the SCSI cables, adapter, etc.
This "1111...." problem is not present on the AD9914, which uses very similar code there. Are you sure this is not just a problem with the notoriously unreliable adapter/cables? Is there a way you could connect a logic analyzer on this thing? Otherwise, maybe we should integrate miscope and enable it by default on the DDS pins... DDS debugging is a lot of tedious guesswork otherwise.
Just passed 100K cycles of ddstest on the AD9914...
Still not working right.
I no longer have access to this hardware to conduct further tests.  @kgilmo is the main ARTIQ guy on that hardware. My current expectation is that these errors are a result of the buggy LVDS bus used in this legacy system and not an ARITQ-specific issue. If @kgilmo doesn't want to take this on the issue should be closed.
