Just in case you are not aware: made a fresh install (dev branch) and got this test fail:
Others seem to pass.
Thanks for the heads up @pulkin. The approx_spectral tests are a bit temperamental, and the tensor_spectral_approx tests even more so -- I'll try and have a proper look round this soon.
My thinking on this is that the guilty functionality is fairly niche and probably best archived into its own branch and removed from develop, with the possible exception of the MPO approx_spectral functionality.
I think the offending test have now been stripped out.
