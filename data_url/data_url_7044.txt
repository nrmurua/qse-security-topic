The workaround for the android+chrome touch dragging issues seems to have broken windows+firefox's touch dragging issues.
This is probably because firefox doesn't have support for touch-action yet. Possibly some kind of polyfill is needed, or just to be more careful with the events. Should also check if this issue was happening before.
It seems like there's just no way to do this until firefox supports touch-action: none. Deferred.
