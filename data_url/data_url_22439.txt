I have the following experiment file,
If I try running it I get the following error message,
If I use,
self.setattr_argument("dds0_frequency", NumberValue(200e6, scale=1e6, unit="MHz"))
It's fine, but I can't scan. How do I structure it so I can scan the DDS frequency? I'm running this through the GUI on windows.
Scannables are iterables (see flopping_f_simulation for an example of how to iterate) and (for now) they can only be iterated on the host, not on the device. But you can pass the current iterator value as an argument to a kernel.
