Description of the issue
Circuits which are equal do not necessarily have equal all_measurement_keys output. Encountered in #3445, where it prevents the use of @lru_cache to cache FrozenCircuit details.
How to reproduce the issue
Run the following python code (partial copy from test_all_measurement_keys in cirq/circuits/circuit_test.py):
Cirq version
0.10.0.dev
It seems to me there's no meaningful sense in which all_measurement_keys should be ordered. I would suggest we change it to be a set, or at least document that the order is not meaningful. This seems similar to the parameter_names protocol where we return a set. I presume tuple was chosen in the measurement_keys protocol because it is immutable; for parameter_names we type the return value as AbstractSet which does not include mutating methods in the interface but gives us the flexibility to return either set or frozenset as desired.
The only reason I could guess why insertion order was preserved in the ordering measurement keys is to control the output ordering of cirq.Result...but I don't see any evidence of that from a cursory look. It is undeniably better to rely on sorting based on intrinsic properties of the measurement keys if needed at all - which the set semantics express much better. Thanks for reporting and the quick fix!
