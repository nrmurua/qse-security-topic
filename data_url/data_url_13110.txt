qiskit-ibmq-provider is now deprecated. https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider
This should be removed from dev_requirements.txt as a local editable installation via pip has raised some errors.
Migration guide is available here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider?tab=readme-ov-file#migration-guides
Note that dev_requirements.txt has qiskit-ibm-provider as a dependency. Somehow pip is also installing qiskit-ibmq-provider.
When pip install -e ".[development]" is used, both qiskit-ibm-provider and qiskit-ibmq-provider are installed probably due to qiskit-aer using qiskit-ibmq-provider as a dependency.

Edit: qiskit-ibmq-provider is not installed due to any of the other qiskit dependencies required for this project. I tested it out locally by installing these in a new virtual environment.
To fix this issue: figure out which dependency is still relying on qiskit-ibmq-provider
Closing this because the issue was related to not upgrading pip before using pip install -e ".[development]". ðŸ˜¬
In case someone else has the same problem in the future, there was also another issue with installing jupyter notebook before/after pip install -e ".[development]" in mitiq folder.
If I installed an older version of jupyter notebook, the notebook would not open due to a known error. microsoft/azuredatastudio#24436 (comment)
