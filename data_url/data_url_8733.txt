Hello,
I'm trying to use simulaqron with new networks being creating "on the go". So I tried this simple measurement of a Bell pair (see code below). When I run only one execution, most of the time it works (sometimes it fails with a timeout, but it's another problem I guess). But when I run two networks with Network.start and try to send EPR pairs on the respective networks, it always fails with a timeout. Any idea why?
Thanks!
Error:
Hi @tobiasBora! Could you check what your network.json file looks like after setting up the networks? You can find the path to it by running simulaqron get network-config-file.
