To whom this may concern,
I was just wondering if I could get some advise regarding my code for a dvr_VQE. I was wondering if you could also give me some advice for  :
Any help and support is appreciated thank you!

Hello @erdabravest2001, thank you for your interest in Mitiq!
If this is a bug report, please provide screenshots and/or minimum viable code to reproduce your issue, so we can do our best to help get it fixed. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can also ask us on the Unitary Fund Discord.
Thanks for opening this issue, @erdabravest2001!
From what I can see of your code so far, it looks like you're using the high-level Qiskit VQE functions. To apply Mitiq, you'll need to dig a bit deeper into the Qiskit code and identify the (or define your own) function that executes the quantum circuit and returns an expectation value, which is called an Executor in Mitiq terminology. That's the first step.
Once you have the executor and the quantum circuit, you can pass them as arguments to Mitiq's top level functions, such as execute_with_zne. That will have to be done inside the optimization loop, so it's probably best to call the scipy optimizer directly also, instead of using the Qiskit optimizer. We can address that after you have first part working.
Hey Ethan, wondering if you still need help here. Happy to provide some guidance, but a more concrete question or minimal working example with an error would be helpful from our side.
I'm going to close this out since we haven't heard back, but feel free to reopen if you still need help here.
