Error when importing Aer in trinket and Google Colab.
I've also seen people have the problems on Windows. I suggested installation from source, but they had no desire to take that step.
See the above links.
Aer should be importable.
Ok, so after tracking down the problem in these platforms, I just find out that Debian based distributions (which seems to be the distribution they use under the hoods), install python stuff in a directory called dist-packages, instead of site-packages, so our .so libraries were not being found at runtime by Pyhton.
While trying to find out what can we do to support these kind of installations, on Google Colab you can manually cp the .so files from  site-packages to dist-packages, like:
I don't know how to do this on Trinket, but another option that would work on both environments is to manually add the site-packages directory to the sys.path:
I have filed a new issue #66  to fix this, so closing this report.
Thanks @quantumjim !
