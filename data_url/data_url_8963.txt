As noted by @Strilanc here, after configuring with cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DSIMD_WIDTH=256 .  the stim binary uses AVX instructions, but the python module does not. This can be seen from the disassembly of FrameSimulator::H_XY, which has an XOR in the loop:
Try including ${MACHINE_FLAG} in the cmake target for the python bindings, similar to what's done for the stim target.
Yep, propagating the correct compile flags as suggested results in the same Assembly (upto relocation) being generated for both python bindings and stim executable. Added the fix into #334
incidentally, the python package built with bazel is using AVX instructions
