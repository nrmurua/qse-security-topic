The ZNESettings object (which specifies a set of experiments to run to find the best ZNE hyperparameters), is currently very barebones.

This has allowed it to be tested in code, but it's not necessarily as useful as it can be. @nathanshammah @willzeng @andreamari do you have comments here on what is/is not important to test here.
The list of explicit strategies looks great to me. Easy to understand and flexible.
We could do something similar for the benchmark circuits too.
For example,
About your code snippet, I see 2 potential problems:
Clarification: this issue is for determining which combinations of parameters we should use for testing and potentially add more built-in Settings objects to test.
