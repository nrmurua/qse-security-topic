Hello there,
since this post a few month are past ...
I had the same issue: #379
In our case we solved the problem by installing a new network driver:
In our PC is a RTL 8111/8168/8411 Ethernet controller from Realtek. But in linux automatically the driver r8169 is installed.
You can see these infos by typing into the terminal: sudo lshw -class network
Following the description of this website:

the Realtek r8168 driver can be installed.
This solved at least this problem for me.
regards,
Silas
