The Monte Carlo solver works with kets instead of density matrices. It doesn't allow superoperators as c_ops (error message: c_ops are not consistant with psi0). Since my master equation has lindblad dissipators (which are superoperators), I have trouble using mcsolve. The only way I can think of is converting the initial state to a superket. But that has type operator-ket and QuTip doesn't seem to want me do type casting. How can I circumvent this problem?
No, not yet, it will be supported in v5.
You could try to use photocurrent_mesolve which is very similar, but with a slower algorithm.
ps. There is an error in the formula in the documentation:
L_eff(rho) = L(rho) - C_dagCrho - rhoC_dagC + tr(C_dagCrho - rhoC_dagC)
