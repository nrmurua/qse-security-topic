As you can see in this gif, the descriptions of the parameterized gates on the right half are too small and not really visible. This looks like a bug. Could this be corrected? Thanks!
This doesn't occur on my machine.
What operating system and browser are you using? Also, since this may involve some kind of boundary size calculation, could you include a screenshot of the entire browser window?
Browser: Mozilla Firefox 67.0
OS: Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
