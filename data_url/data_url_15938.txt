Hi there, myself and @Elliot-Coupe, @kaiterm have been working on a Qiskit implementation of a variation of QAOA called ADAPT-QAOA based on this paper and would like to integrate it into the Qiskit library.
A similar ADAPT-VQE has already been implemented in Qiskit in qiskit.chemistry.algorithms. We think that an appropriate place to put ADAPT-QAOA would be in the same location as QAOA (qiskit.algorithms.minimum_eigensolvers).
If this is something that Qiskit is interested in having in the library, we would love to work on integrating this with @nathanearnestnoble and anyone else interested!
Hi @desireevl !
I don't know to what extent I can understand the paper, but would love to give it a try and work with your team in implementing this algorithm.
I closed #8441 and for the same reason will close this issue -see the comment there #8441 (comment)
