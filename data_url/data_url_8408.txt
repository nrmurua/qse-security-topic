Hi!
I was thinking to use Floquet Formalism to solve some time-dependent problem.
So I firstly try the case in Users Guide, but some unexpected errors occurred.
Here is the error informationï¼š
I have tried it many times. Any other functions in Floquet Formalism will still have this problem.
Here is my version information:

I would appreciate your reply!
Hi thanks for opening the issue. This seems to be related to installing on windows. Could you also please mention the conda,  qutip and Visual Studio version.
Please try updating your Visual Studio and conda and reinstall qutip with conda.
Thanks for your reply!
My conda version is 4.5.1, and qutip  version is 4.2.0.
I use jupyter in anaconda as my IDE, instead of Visual Studio.
I have updated the conda and qutip and it doesn't work either.
I have download other examples and they surprisingly work, so it is not the environment problem. The case code have its own problem, but I haven't found where it is.
Maybe I should learn some source code first. The Floquet solver is very useful and wish someday I can contribute my own code to it. This issue should be closed temporarily.
Dear @HtPsi , I ran your example code and I got the results as,
So it is definitely not an issue of the source code. I advise that you try to install the linux box for windows from the simple instructions for Windows 10 : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
Then, you can just install QuTiP again like a standard Linux user and run the floquet solver directly.
