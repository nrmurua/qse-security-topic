The starting state of each qubit always being 0 can be worked around by placing some "not" gates, but that's a somewhat annoying operation when you want to try out what a circuit does with different inputs. Add a simpler way to change the inputs with just one click instead of having to add and remove "not" gates with drag&drop.
The main reason I haven't done this is that I expect to forget I toggled an input, but not to forget I have an X gate. But I guess I can just make it visually stick out a lot.
BTW for trying out different inputs to a circuit, I recommend cycling through them with the dynamic counting gate, or even better the 'entanglement trick' for seeing the matrix of an operation:

I would also love to be able to easily toggle between |0> and |1> at the inputs. It's more convenient than dragging an X there, and it will allow fun quick experimentation with |0>'s and |1>'s with single clicks.
|1>'s at the input do not seem like total nonsense, e.g. Wikipedia's diagram for Shor's algorithm has one:

This is implemented in #404 by 1e14146 and will appear in the next released version.
