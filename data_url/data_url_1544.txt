This occurs because PauliString does not support symbols but DensePauliString does. Ideally, both of them should have identical behavior and we should discuss how to make it happen.
Note that only the coefficient of DensePauliString can be a symbol, and hence to fix the inconsistency, we'd need to support symbols in coefficient of PauliString.

Discussed on Sync:
Did a quick investigation, it looks like the only place this bleeds beyond PauliString is that we'll also need to parameterize GlobalPhaseGate.coefficient to allow for decomposition to work when PauliString is parameterized.
Everything else seems straightforward:
(Note that decompose doesn't work when parameterized anyway since it's not unitary, so we actually don't need to change GlobalPhaseGate)
