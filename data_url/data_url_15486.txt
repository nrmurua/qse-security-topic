I am new to this field. I have seen using .to_gate()  function in Deutsch Dozsa Algorithm and searched for it but haven't really understood the exact use after googling. Can anyone help me out
This is an instance method on the QuantumCircuit class.  It lets you build up a custom gate by constructing a circuit, and then turn the resulting circuit into a Gate object, which you can add to a larger circuit with QuantumCircuit.append.  For example:
In general, you're better asking this sort of question in our public Slack channels - this is a bug tracker for Qiskit, rather than a help channel.
Thank you.Sure,  I will post such questions on slack from next time!
I found this 'issue' before I found how to use qiskit.circuit.gate.Gate. Maybe a documentation update could help?
