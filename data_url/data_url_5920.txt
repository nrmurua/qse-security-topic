This is related to the issue here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53929599/cannot-import-aer-from-qiskit-0-7, summarized below:
from qiskit import Aer fails with error.

But from qiskit.providers.aer import Aer works
I'm not sure if this issue is reproducible on all platforms, but I'm attaching a screenshot of a minimal example demonstrating the error:

Since reloading qiskit fixed the issue, I figured changing the order of operations could fix it. I experimented with my local qiskit and found that editing this file: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/stable/0.16/qiskit/__init__.py by
Moving lines 82-86:
to before importing Aer in lines 55-64:
fixes both issues (removes warning on import and makes from qiskit import Aer work). However, I'm not sure if this the best way to fix the issue.
I also tried taking the from qiskit.providers.aer import Aer line in the __init__.py file out of the try-except block to trace the cause of the error. That causes import qiskit to fail with an error raised at this file: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/stable/0.7/qiskit/providers/aer/backends/qasm_simulator.py at line 25 from .controller_wrappers import qasm_controller_execute. Maybe this will be useful in resolving this?

Closing this, as it appears to have been fixed by the qiskit 0.23.1 update:
