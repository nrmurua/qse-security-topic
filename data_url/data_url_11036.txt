While building tests for shor.py, I realized that there are a few issues with the testing infrastructure in grove.
However, these imports are grabbing the module from the pip installed grove dependency, rather than the actual current pyqaoa file one directory above. This means that in order to accurately test the newly updated pyqaoa module, one needs to install their grove directory with pip install -e ., which may have broken changes due to updates you have made.
Additionally, that means if you try to create a new module with tests, those tests won't work until you actually update grove with the new module, which doesn't make too much sense from a test-first perspective. I think that these grove imports should instead use relative imports, which will allow tests to use the currently-defined grove files on your local machine without having to install the entire library using pip.
