Hi, unlike all other Kyber META.yml files, the one for Kyber512 does not list AES as a build prerequisite for the 'avx2' variant: 
This now led to a downstream error in liboqs (which uses this file to define build parameters).
Could you please check whether this is indeed an error and correct it (bring it in line with the other KyberXXX META.yml) or let me know whether Kyber512-avx2 can indeed do without AES?
The problem I see is that it depends on Keccak which in turn, if built with AVX2 support, also needs AES support; thus, Kyber-avx2 transitively also needs AES.
Thanks in advance for checking.
crypto_kem/kyber512/avx2 builds fine without -maes, as evidenced by the Makefile, and similarly the Makefile for common/keccak4x only uses -mavx2.
Do the import scripts in liboqs maybe somehow confuse kyberXXX-90s and kyberXXX?

No, they don't. The problem was indeed an 'over-eager' "sha3x4" build in liboqs (unecessarily requiring AES) in combination with my confusion about the different META.yml's between Kyber 512 vs Kyber768/1024 (as now fixed by #297 : Thanks @thomwiggers ). Issue resolved.
