I have installed the Quantum Resistant Ledger on my MacOS 10.13.2 as per the instructions provided in the following GitHub repository URL:
https://github.com/theQRL/QRL
However it is not starting up when I give the following instructions :
qml_wallet_gen
I am getting the following error while I am executing the command :
`Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread
Abort trap: 6`
Can anybody advise me to resolve this issue. Is this issue related to the local python version.
This is actually a python installation problem. This typically happen when you have several python distributions in the same system.. Like system+brew+anaconda, etc.
You are using to run the application a version of Python that is not binary compatible with the one that was in the path when you compiled the Python bindings.
I would suggest using https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html to create a virtual environment before installing.
This seems to be connected to this issue
