Correlation functions are trivially parallel and should be run using parallel_map if the kwarg parallel=True is set (which should be the default setting).  Otherwise default back to serial implementation.
I started working on this, inserted a parallel map, and then remembered that lambda functions cannot be pickled. I'm not sure how to proceed here.
The implementation of the correlation functions in QuTiP 5 now uses the solvers directly. Supporting for calculating the correlation using the Monte Carlo solvers could be added back, but that seems like a different issue to this.
