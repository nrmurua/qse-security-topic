Currently there are a lot of easily-triggered corner cases where our custom code, Sphinx, and its extension Napoleon interact in some bad way that e.g. results in indented text not being placed into a code block (and there being an empty code block just before it). We should improve this over time.
As Sphinx is going to be retired this issue should focus on reviewing all the sample code from docstrings on the new site under this issue.
We no longer use this pipeline.  Closing.
