Solve system of Ordinary Differential Equations using C++.
The idea is to implement a general framework where we can add different ode C/C++ libraries that best suit the different problems we want to solve.
At this time, our main goal is to introduce the library Sundials. This is a C library which provides several modules. The most interesting ones are CVODE and CVODES.  Both of them solve ODE systems, the latter including sensitivity analysis capabilities (forward and adjoint). The main drawback is that it doesn't support complex numbers natively. It can be adapted to work with them, although some functionality will be lost.
We are also testing OdeInt. This is a native C++ Boost library which handles complex numbers natively. It lacks some of the functionality of Sundials, like the sensitivity analysis. However, in very early and limited testing has shown a leap in performance, being an order of magnitude faster.
