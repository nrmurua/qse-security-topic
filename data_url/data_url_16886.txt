There is no link between qubit index and channel index for ibmq backend, but PulseBackendConfiguration forces to put identical index to them and it doesn't return control channel with index larger than maximum qubit number.
raises BackendConfigurationError when 20 qubit backends is loaded.
It should not raise an error.
Replace argument name by channel and remove error.
