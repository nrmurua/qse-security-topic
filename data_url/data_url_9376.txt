The Hamiltonian representation is shown as the sum of terms; an X term, an N term, and the Vij term. However, there is a "hidden" negative sign in the N term which is not well represented:

[ Hamiltonian definition as by https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.09372.pdf eq. 1 ]. Note the negative sign.
The Hamiltonian, written as a sum of N operators, should have an extra negative sign, eg +75.7 , -81.1 , etc. A simple way would be to add a negative sign above the phrase "Term 2" (and likewise a positive sign above the phrase "Term 3"), to emphasize that there is this hidden negative sign.
Thanks for filing this issue!
A follow-up on this is we should also make it clear in the documentation there is a negative sign in Hamiltonian. Let me just keep it here for a record.
It appears as though the formatting has changed to be less descriptive but more consistent with the Hamiltonian definition. I will close this bug.
