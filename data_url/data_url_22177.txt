smoltcp doesn't support PPP/SLIP or something like those.
This needs some sort of serial encapsulation, since we don't have a PPP implementation anymore.
@sbourdeauducq suggested SLIP. The argument for SLIP was that it's available on Linux and Windows, but that's not really the case; the last version of Windows that shipped with SLIP support was XP. Also the Linux tooling looks horrible from the quick look I made at it.
What I would prefer to do instead is to use a simple TAP interface on Linux, a framing with fixed maximum overhead, and a bespoke splitter on the host system, using the code already in smoltcp. This gets us several things:
I would make the case for dropping Pipistrello from ARTIQ 3.
Several prospective ARTIQ users had poor experience with Pipistrello due to it's second-class support. Agreed that it's better to drop support and focus on supporting Kasli in the future.
