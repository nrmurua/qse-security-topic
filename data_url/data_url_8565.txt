Hi,
I had to call sin and cos on operators.
However, sin(destroy(3).data) works. It seems that a method is not forwarded from the Qobj object to the underlying sparse matrix. Would it be possible to apply such a trigonometric function on the Qobj and still have a Qobj afterwards?
Thanks
Oops, was mistakingly thinking that numpy.sin of a matrix was computing the sin of this matrix. It is not the case actually.
Still, it could be useful to be able to compute such functions on Qobj.
EDIT: My solution at the moment is:
You can use 0.5*((1j * A).expm()+(-1j * A).expm()) etc to get what you want.
If this is a common enough requirement, I can go on and add cosm and sinm functions to Qobj that use @nonhermitian's example. That has the benefit over scipy.linalg.cosm that it preserves dims, type and other similar metadata (though we would not want to preserve isherm).
@nonhermitian Thanks, it's much easier that what I was dealing with!
@cgranade Indeed, conserving the metadata is a really good thing. For more (scientific) information, I am dealing with Josephson junctions with an hamiltonian of the form $\hbar \omega a^{\dagger}a - E_J \cos \varphi$ where $\varphi$ is proportional to $a + a^{\dagger}$. I wanted to try to analyze the full hamiltonian with QuTIP and comparing with some expansions.
Any news on this? I would personnally find it particularly useful to have cosm and sinm methods on Qobj class. I can submit a PR with it if you want.
If such methods are not to be added, I think this issue can be safely closed.
It is already in the latest dev version on github.

Indeed, sorry for the noise, I completely missed it when it got added. Closing the issue as it is no longer relevant. Thanks!
