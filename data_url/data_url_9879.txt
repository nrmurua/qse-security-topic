Description
I can not install dimod on M1 mac.
Steps To Reproduce
Old numpy 1.19.4 does not support M1 mac.
Therefore, You shoud use newer numpy>=1.21.1.
Expected Behavior
"pip install dimod." does not nead build numpy.
Environment
Additional Context
I'll look into this. The simplest fix would be to loosen the requirements in pyproject.toml. However, when using pip wheel in our CI pipeline, the installed numpy version is ignored so all of the wheels will be built with a newer numpy. Since wheels built against numpy 1.21 are not backwards compatible with older numpy versions, this would require increasing our minimum supported numpy version. I need to see if there is a way to force pip wheel to use already installed versions or think about whether we're OK raising the minimum supported numpy version.
For Linux/aarch64, an easy fix is to bump numpy==1.19.5 -- that's the latest release in the 1.19 branch, the last version of numpy to support py36, and the first version to support aarch64.
On MacOS, though, the first version of numpy that supports arm64/universal2 is 1.21.0.
(posting here just for posterity)
@29rou 0.10.8 has been released with universal wheels. Can you verify that resolves this issue?
It's still impossible.
Old numpy 1.19.4 does not support M1 mac.
Therefore, You shoud use newer numpy>=1.21.1.

Right, in this case the error is being caused by dwave-preprocessing, though it should be resolved by dwavesystems/dwave-preprocessing#38
Hi @29rou, I think this time we mean it ðŸ˜„ can you try again?
Closing this issue since I believe it has been resolved. Feel free to reopen if I am incorrect!
