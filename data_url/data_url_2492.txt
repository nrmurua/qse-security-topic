I have been playing with gates such as cirq.H**0.4 which is a Hadamard gate that is exponentiated:
I thought this should be an instance of HPowGate as defined here. But the above code returns False. Also if we run
the result shows 0: ───H───. What happened to the exponent?
Oops, the implementation of HPowGate._circuit_diagram_info_ was not updated when an exponent was added (a previous version didn't support exponentiation). Thank you for catching this.
So that's the repr issue i was referring to here: #1262. I'll take this.
@yudongcao With respect to isinstance,  Your g is a GateOperation and HPowGate a Gate I think.
isinstance(g, cirq.ops.gate_operation.GateOperation) works.
CC: @Strilanc
Re isinstance returning False above: @vtomole 's explanation is correct.
I see. So once there is a concrete qubit that the gate is set to act on, the gate object becomes GateOperation. What if I want to determine what type of gate a GateOperation represents, is there a way to retrieve that information? In other words, if g = cirq.H(q)**0.4, what can my program do to g to check for sure that it comes from an HPowGate?
Yes, like this:
See also #1472 for a possible new way being added.
I see. Thanks for your help!
