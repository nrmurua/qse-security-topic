Obviously there are many ways to check equality of Programs, but as a first pass I propose we check to see if they are equal line by line. Thoughts? @willzeng @stevenheidel
Agreed. Let's start with comparing the .out strings to make sure they're the same. We can always iterate in the future. Having program equality implemented like this would make testing easier.
