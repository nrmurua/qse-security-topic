One can presently make use of toqito to approximate the commuting operator value of a BCS game by making use of the NPA hierarchy.
For certain games, calculating this heuristic can be intractable. The user may sometimes simply wish to know whether a perfect commuting operator strategy exists (that is, whether the BCS has a commuting operator value equal to one).
According to arXiv:1606.02278, if one reprsents the BCS game as a solution group:

it is then possible to determine whether there exists a perfect commuting operator strategy for this BCS game by checking condition (3) of:
