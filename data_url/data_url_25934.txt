Currently, if you try to run a pytket circuit on an IonQ device, there is redundant conversion between pytket and braket.
If you submit a pytket circuit to the AwsDeviceWrapper.run method, it will first transpile the circuit to Amazon Braket like usual, but then in the compile step, it calls braket_ionq_compile, which will convert the circuit back to pytket, perform the compilation, and then convert it back to braket. In this special case, the first conversion from pytket to braket was unnecessary. So we want to revise the run method to remove this redundant conversion for this edge case while maintaining the same overall structure of steps.
