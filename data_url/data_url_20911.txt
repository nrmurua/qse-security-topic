Describe the bug
When sending a transaction with the QRL CLI bundled with the node, message_data isn't an optional field.
To Reproduce
Initiate a transfer without the message_data field.
results in a prompt for message data
After filling out the prompt, the transaction is successfully executed.
Expected behavior
Returned transaction information indicating a successful transfer without indicating message_data
Desktop (please complete the following information):
Click documentation https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/options/
prompt_required=False
If the option has prompt enabled, then setting prompt_required=False tells Click to only show the prompt if the optionâ€™s flag is given, instead of if the option is not provided at all.
I tried the attempt above, however, i get this error.
