I have installed qiskit-aer-gpu and MPI4PY using pip3 in order to run qiskit code on multiple nodes. My code is currently running on two nodes but independently. Below is the code I am running:
And the command is:
mpirun -np 3 -machinefile machinefile.txt python3  demo.py 
I am getting following output as result:
All processes have rank=0 and num_mpi_processes=1. My goal is to share GPU resources of two nodes in order to run computation.
Installation of MPI4PY and qiskit-aer-gpu
My expectation is that output should show num_mpi_processes=3 (for this particular command) and mpi_rank should be assigned according to process number and computation share the resources (CPU+GPU) of both nodes.
I cannot suggest any solution but I am concerned about installation of qiskit-aer-gpu? Is it come with support for MPI and GPU itself when installed it with pip3 or I have to build it separately with particular flags as mentioned in CONTIBUTING.md installation instructions
pip install qiskit-aer-gpu does not support MPI parallelization, but Aer should be built from source to add support for MPI parallel execution.
Thank you, Is there any link to guide for its build with all per-requisites?
Please refer to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-with-mpi-support
Thank you, I started that but I am getting Error at the very last step while building
Command I am running:
python3 ./setup.py bdist_wheel -- -DAER_THRUST_BACKEND=CUDA -DAER_MPI=True
Error is:
Should I need to install any particular version of pybind11?
Yes pybind11 is required to be installed on the system
