It seems like with RESTART in LINRES  the response functions are read in properly, but then most are not reconverged with the new atomic positions. For example I see:
81        PCG       T         0.11E+00      0.0000000000      339.36
82        PCG       F         0.66E-01      0.0000000000      343.21
83        PCG       F         0.11E+00      0.0000000000      346.99
84        PCG       F         0.11E+00      0.0000000000      350.88
85        PCG       F         0.13E+00      0.0000000000      354.62
86        PCG       F         0.63E-01      0.0000000000      358.47
The linear solver converged in   86 iterations.

It reconverges nmr_rxp.lr but it seems dxp are just read in but then not iterated and just written out again.

Yes, indeed, what happens if you set RESTART for linear response one gerts:

===== Routine Calling Stack =====
So perhaps it is a feature and not a bug, but it would be nice if it we recoverge starting with the guess from the previous trajectory step?
