The qiskit.circuit.Bit.index property was deprecated since version 0.17. However, I think this deprecation has an oversight.
For programs that mostly use the DAGCircuit instead of QuantumCircuit, accessing the index of a qubit from a DAGOpNode is quite inconvenient. Each DAGOpNode stores the cargs and qargs  for an Instruction.  Before Bit.index was deprecated, you could do something along the lines of some_op_node.qargs[0].index to easily access the qubit index. some_op_node.qargs already contains all the Qubit objects with their indexes. However now you have to use QuantumCircuit.find_qubit(op_node.qargs[0]).index which is verbose and requires keeping track of DAGCircuit and QuantumCircuit.
My suggestion is to implement DAGCircuit.find_qubit() to address this issue
This is actually a duplicate of #9389 and the PR adding this in progress here here: #10128
I'm going to close this as a duplicate, but please feel free to reopen if there is more to discuss or I'm missing something.
