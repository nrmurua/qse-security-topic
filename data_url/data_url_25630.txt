When we try to use the output of an electron for iteration, the covalent throws an error.
The graph generated by the Covalent is very huge compared to what is expected.
Please go through the following code segment.
The graph generated for the above code is as follows.

The expected output is a simple graph with only two branches (for two items in the iteration).
Expected graph:

This is because of incorrect use of pattern for ele in phrase: uses electron to iterate over. Note that while constructing the graph, none of the functions are executed. Thus one has no clue what phrase list is going to be. This means that one cannot construct this before hand. We only support static graphs and not dynamic graphs, i.e graphs that dependent on previous results are not supported. I am actually surprised this even produced a graph ! Curious to see how it did Tagging @kessler-frost
Closing it resolved for now.
