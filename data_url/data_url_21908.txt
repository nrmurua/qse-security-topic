Not a critical problem, but the error message should be better.
Well, the actual problem here is that your type annotation is nonsensical. ARTIQ Python only accepts type annotations from artiq.compiler.types.
That should be documented; at the minimum the error message should point that out.

Of course. I'm just explaining.
And there was a proper error message, it was just failing on this function for an unrelated reason.
