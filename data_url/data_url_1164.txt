See #1235 for the previous work.
The problem is with controlled_gate_test.  The two gates internal to that test, when repr is called, create a name of cirq.ops.controlled_gate_test which is not part of the cirq library (if tests are removed anyway), so this can create resolution problems when eval-ed as part of the consistent protocol check.
Passing the name to the globals parameter should fix this maybe.
From #1235
So, part of this is solved, but there is still an issue, since the representation on line 121 of controlled_gate_test still relies on an implicit import:
return ('cirq.ops.controlled_gate_test.'
'GateUsingWorkspaceForApplyUnitary()')
Since the internal Google build splits the library code and the test code, cirq.ops.controlled_gate_test is not part of the cirq import, so the problem still exists. However, the problem is now contained to those two gates within controlled_gate_test.
