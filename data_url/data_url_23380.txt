When using instruments that do not have an "IDN" method the Instrument.connect_message does not work.
I propose resolving this by adding the following method to the Instrument base class.
I think it is quite useful to have this method be part of the base class as we also want to see this message for e.g., Dummy instruments or things like meta instruments.
(nvm)
