The links in the examples/README.md are not working.
Current:
(https://quantumbfs.github.io/Yao.jl/latest/tutorial/GHZ/)
Expected:
(https://quantumbfs.github.io/Yao.jl/latest/examples/GHZ/)
Also, in the /latest version of docs, Grover Search and Quantum Inference example is missing.
Grover was removed for further polish, I'll bring it back later (#175) , if you want to read the old examples, check it here: https://quantumbfs.github.io/Yao.jl/v0.3/tutorial/Grover/
examples are not supposed to be there, sorry for the confusion, they are all in current docs now with Weave files, you can also generate whichever format you prefer with Weave yourself.
