Currently MatrixExpectation is used if AerSimulator has a name aer_simulator_statevector (is_statevector_backend()). However, AerSimulator uses this name if it works as QasmSimulator or StatevectorSimulator. Therefore, there is currently no way to use AerPauliExpectation with AerSimulator if method='statevector' is specified.
I expect that MatrixExpectation is used only when StatevectorSimulator is the backend.
