Inspired by Dave's question and @willzeng's response in the ARQC meeting today. I think this is a good idea.
The way I'm thinking about it, we could add a dictionary of gates with weights and count up to the desired scaling in terms of these weights.
Instead of num_folded += 1 after every folded gate, the "number" folded would be determined by the weight of the gate.
There's some more details to work out, but this is the general idea and I think it should be fairly straightforward to generalize to this.
Agreed! Good call capturing this in an issue
