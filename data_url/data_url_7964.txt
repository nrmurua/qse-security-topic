Hi @yurivict.
Could you give more detail?
I can't reproduce the issue and the error messages are not enough to understand what is happening.
Hi @Ericgig
I've ran the tests from the FreeBSD port's directory, and the errors above are what was printed.

Without more detail we can't help resolve this so closing it for now. Feel free to re-open if you can help debug. Tests pass in quite a few CI combinations.
