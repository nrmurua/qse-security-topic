When plotting the circuit, the barrier is not in the correct place when choosing the latex output.
Output of circuit.draw(output='latex'):

Reversing the bit removes one Hadamard gate on qa_2.
Output of circuit.draw(output='latex', reverse_bits=True):

Same issue appears on the documentation: https://qiskit.org/documentation/terra/visualizing_a_quantum_circuit.html
Output of circuit.draw(output='mpl'):

Please check the code for plotting latex image or the latex package being used.
This looks like a duplicate of #1724 which was already fixed on master. Can you test that #1727 fixes this for you? (it does for me locally)
Sorry, yes. The Hadamard gate appears now. The barrier still seems to be not in the exact right place. But that's not a big issue.

Btw, there's an incompatibility between versions.

Yeah, the barrier placement can be pretty finicky. It's a known issue (and there is limits to what is doable there) because the latex package requires manually offsetting the barrier horizontally so we have to try to account for every spacing in the python code when generating the latex.
As for that error, it'll go away when we bump the major version on the qiskit package. The versioning on the qiskit package doesn't allow for dev versions, there's probably a better way to handle that. But that's a separate discussion to have on the https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit repo.
I'm going to close this issue as already fixed by #1727 feel free to open new issues for the barrier overlap and/or the dev versions with the metapackage.
