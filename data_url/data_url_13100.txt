In a recent upgrade, pyquil and the Forest SDK now have native executables built for all operating systems that act as the local simulation and build toolchain. Right now in both our CI and local dev experiences we need Docker locally installed and running with ports configured correctly to make any testing or use of pyquil work. We should make a plan to migrate to the native executable install path for both our CI and the developer instructions for Mitiq.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
Looking through the pyquil installation docs, it seems like the downloads are all manual installations. Of course, one can curl/wget the resource, then use the instructions from the installations docs in our build.yml workflow, but that seems like it might be less stable than using the docker image. Is there another download that I might be missing somewhere?
cc @willzeng in case you're still plugged in here, and know of an easier download mechanism.
