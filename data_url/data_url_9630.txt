Adding the MW channel type for implementation of the XY Hamiltonian. Note that, unlike with the Rydberg and Raman channels, the MW channel cannot coexist with other channel types on the same Sequence, as it requires a specific initialisation procedure and works on a basis that is incompatible with the other channels. This will demand changes to the Sequence and Simulation classes.
