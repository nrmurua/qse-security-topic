The helper function TWIST-TO-REAL is now only called on gates output by BUILD-CANONICAL-GATE. It was originally written for a generic input operator. Is it easier to compute in this case? If so, is it worth dropping the generic version?
I'm never in favor of outright deleting more general things, and instead favor either keeping them with a -general name, or commenting them out with #+#:pedagogy or so, as in this code.
