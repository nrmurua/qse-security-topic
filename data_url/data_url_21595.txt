pythonDeps.pyqtgraph is out of date (v0.10.0 vs v0.11.0) in the nix-scripts path. I can't submit an issue there, so it has to be here.
Apply the following patch to nix-scripts with git am:
Tested the evaluation locally, currently trying to build llvm but my PC is too slow/old to build all of artiq-fast in a reasonable time.
Of relevance: NixOS/nixpkgs#104728 was just merged, so a separate pyqtgraph-qt5 shouldn't be needed anymore.
Thanks.
I have bumped pyqtgraph. The other changes do need testing - do you want a SSH account for a fast machine at M-Labs?
Your nixpkgs PR will only be in a release in about 6 months.
Yes, you're right. I forgot which version of nixpkgs that the ARTIQ branches are tracking, but I could try to backport that PR.
I'm agnostic about the SSH account, can go either way. I could also probably test it on a faster machine that's free at UMD.

That's probably easier.

Does NixOS accept upgrades like this on release branches?

Usually not, unless it's a good reason. However, pyqt4 hasn't been updated in ~5 years, so I think that might be a good enough reason.
EDIT: That still wouldn't backport it to nixos-20.03 (much less likely to accept a backport for a soon-to-be-outdated channel) which ARTIQ5 tracks.
Sorry I let this slide for a while. I had to replicate most of the Hydra ARTIQ build environment/source patches locally to get it to work, but I built all of artiq-fast & artiq-full/extras.nix last night. I didn't build any vivado/board packages.
Build log (again, building all of artiq-fast & artiq-full/extras.nix). I can share the full derivation file (./nix/artiqpkgs.nix).
Build fails due to missing vivado in FHS Env.
@drewrisinger Thanks, merged.
You're welcome. Thanks for the quick merge!
