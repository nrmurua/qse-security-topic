Running the tests, I get:
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt didn't help.
This is an issue with your test command. The discovery path for python tests should be test/terra the python code in test/benchmarks are not unittest code. What command are you using to running tests? (both using tox and stestr directly should work fine, but if you're manually invoking unittest run or some other runner you're probably not setting the discovery path correctly)
Thanks @mtreinish, indeed I'm using unittest.
