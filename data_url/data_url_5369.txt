The goal here is to have a reproducible way to obtain the latest version of the released package from git. When tagging with a given release, we should also create/update an additional tag latest to allow this to be used with dependent packages.
Expected behavior: (What you expect to happen)
Actual behavior: (What actually happens)
Reproduces how often: (What percentage of the time does it reproduce?)
System information: (post the output of import pennylane as qml; qml.about())
Please include any additional code snippets and error tracebacks related
