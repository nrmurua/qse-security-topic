When you run transpile function with a circuit list of only one circuit, then the output is the circuit, not the circuit in a list.
from qiskit import *
new_qc = transpile([qc], backend) #for some circuit qc and backend
new_qc
Right now, new_qc would produce a circuit not in a list, but I think it would be helpful if it would result as a list.
One suggested solution is to make a new variable in the transpile function called list_boolean, or something else, which would keep track of whether the input is a list or not, and in the conditional where the input list is length 1, one can check the value of list_boolean and if it is true, it returns the transpiled circuit in a list, and if false, it just returns the circuit.
It seems to me the current behavior is intentional:

However, I agree with you that it is counterintuitive. Fixing it is kind of trivial. But maybe we should try to understand deeper why it is currently like this. @ajavadia @kdk ?
From #2166, it looks like the intent was to support both
and
so I think returning a length-1 list for a length-1 list input is consistent.
I think the problem is that transpiled_qc = transpile([qc], backend) instead of [transpiled_qc] = transpile([qc], backend)
