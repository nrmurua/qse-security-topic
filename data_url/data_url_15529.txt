A Qiskit circuit that contains the ecr two qubit gate exports two definitions of rzx when converting the circuit to a QASM file:
Create a Qiskit circuit with an ECR gate, and then export that circuit to QASM.
Upon reading in the QASM file (QuantumCircuit.from_qasm_file) it will throw an error because rzx is defined twice.
No response
Thanks for the report.  In this case, this is a duplicate of issue #7749, which is itself a duplicate in spirit of #7335.  There's a bit more information in those issues about why this happens, and how our near-term plans will help fix this.
