Description of the issue
Given a circuit with multi-qubit measurements, cirq.transformers.measurement_transformers.find_terminal_measurements() will repeat the same measurement operator for every qubit it acts on. As a result cirq.synchronize_terminal_measurements() fails for circuits with multi-qubit measurements.
How to reproduce the issue
