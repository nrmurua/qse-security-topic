Currently the import of the IBMQ provider in init fails silently for ImportErrors.  I would argue that the primary purpose of terra is to run circuits on hardware, and as such this import should never fail silently.  It also makes things difficult for users to understand why IBMQ might not be there by hiding underlying issues with the injecting of the provider.
The silent failure is expected behavior so I am closing.
