I'm trying to bind parameters into my QuantumCircuit:
and an error has been raised:
what should I do?
the code above will reproduce this problem
I suppose values will be bind to the parameters in the circuit
I suppose this are related to #3008 #3014
but I still don't get it.
I'm not familiar with how thind "broadcast" and I don't really understand why and how deepcopy can solve this problem.
OHHHHH, I've found that changing my code from:
qc.bind_parameters({i.name: np.pi/2})
to:
qc.bind_parameters({i: np.pi/2})
might fix it. My bad!
But I'm still confused with deepcopy. Can anyone explain it?
Many thanks!
Hello @Marsmmz, I've done some research and I think that I can answer your question.
By the docs, it's expected to provide a dictionary mapping Parameter --> value or an array with a sequence of values.

I think that the documentation may be a little bit difficult to understand, since the first thought is to put a string there instead of a Parameter instance.
However, qiskit uses this approach because it's easier to manage the parameters, once within the parameter class there're some other attributes that control, for example, the index that the parameter has in the circuit.
Because of that, if you check the source code of parameter.py, you can see that the __deepcopy__, and __copy__ as well,  return the entire object

Using some code, you can realize that the pure object and that returned from deepcopy are the same

So, when you use deepcopy, or not, the code won't raise any error.

I hope it helped you to understand ☺️
assign_parameters and bind_parameters take the Parameter instance as the key, rather than the name (which is a human-readable version, not a complete UUID).  Your qc.bind_parameters({i: np.pi/2}) line is the correct call.
thanks so much! I've understand it now.
