I'm implementing quantum half adder on Jupyter Notebook.
When I try running my circuit on the simulator "qasm_simulator", Jupyter said
DAGCircuitError: 'bit mapping invalid: expected 4, got 8'
here is the code I've written. The error occurs on the last line of the third code.
I don't totally understand the error. I hope to troubleshoot to see the result.
Your immediate problem is that the line
doesn't include any classical arguments to apply hadder to, but it expects 4 (though they're not used).  Perhaps you either meant not to have the ClassicalRegister c in hadder, or you meant to write the above line as
On our side, the append call I pulled out should have raised an error.  I'm not certain why it didn't, but it definitely looks like a bug that it didn't.
