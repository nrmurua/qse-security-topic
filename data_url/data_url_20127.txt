I'm having trouble reproducing this locally, but on Github Actions for liboqs-rust I'm getting SIGILL in SIDH consistently.

For debugging purposes, I already pulled out the support CPU flags on Github Actions:
The difference with my local set of flags:
It's adx. SIKE's CMakeLists assumes that "BMI2" implies presence of both mulx and adox instructions. But there are Nahalem processors, like that GitHub actions Ivy Bridge machine, with mulx but not adox.
Great detective work 👏🏻
