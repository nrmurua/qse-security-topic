Running the following
yields ValueError: Unexpected extra qubits: {cirq.LineQubit(0), cirq.LineQubit(1)}. However list(reversed([q1, q0])) works. An Iterable type isn't handled correctly for some reason it seems like.
Not wrapping it in a list() works for cirq.Simulator() and cirq.DensityMatrixSimulator().
The expected type for qubit_order is cirq.ops.QubitOrderOrList, which is
so any Iterable on qubits should work.
The only difference I can tell so far between cirq simulators and QSimSimulator is that cirq simulators call as_qubit_order() twice:

then

but that shouldn't have done anything...

The root cause appears to be a reuse of qubit_order in some of the simulator methods:
