when using to_serializable, seems like it doesn't check the type of variable indices.
if np.int64 is sent it as variable indices, sampleset.to_serializable() remains not bson compatible.
would be nice if we can check that and convert during the process
Can you provide a failing example?
Returns
cannot encode object: 0, of type: <class 'numpy.int64'> 
Got it. I thought you were referring to the irow, icol.
I do agree that BQM.to_serializable should make sure that the variable labels are in a serializable form.  Which does make this a bug!
