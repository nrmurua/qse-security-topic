If I try to run the GUI from a Jupyter notebook, the Python kernel crashes.
Issue introduced with commit 185eabc ; previously the ParameterViewer and the DataBrowser were just frozen, while LivePlot was correctly working
Are you choosing the right Qt at the beginning of your notebook?
This fixed the freezing on the dipstick computer, where it runs perfectly fine in a notebook
Wow, thank you! Yes, apparently it was defaulting to the wrong backend. I will add a note in the readme for future users
