We have many notebooks submitted as entries to the 'Teach Me Quantum' award. These are made by lecturers, and provide some degree of self-contained material for self-study.
I suggest we follow the precedent set by the 'Teach Me Qiskit' award, the notebooks for which have their own folder in the community folder.
So that would mean creating a new 'teach_me_quantum_2018' folder and putting the notebooks in there?
Any comments, objections, etc? If not, I'll start processing the notebooks and making pull requests.
After talking to @attp, new plan is a community/awards folder to put these things in. I'll do a PR to make the folder soon.
