two_qubit_decomposition in transpiler.unitary_decompositions (now it is still in qibolab) fails when decomposing Identity.
It fails in decomposing any matrix that is not creating entanglement between the qubits.
backend = NumpyBackend()
gate = gates.I(0,1)
matrix = gate.matrix(backend)
c = Circuit(2)
c.add(two_qubit_decomposition(0, 1, matrix))
error:
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'u4' where it is not associated with a value
