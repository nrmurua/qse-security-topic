Should we tag a commit for convenient use at the IETF hackathon?  Commit d61d81c is passing all tests (except for BIKE constant time).
It looks like it might be a rush to get SPHINCS+ merged in the next few days and be sure that it won't cause problems.
What would be an appropriate tag?  ietf-116?
@baentsch @xvzcf opinions?
Created tag ietf116 on liboqs.  @baentsch I'll leave it to you to create a corresponding tag on oqs-provider.
@dstebila Thanks. Same tag added to oqs-provider. Also implemented open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos#192, providing ready-to-run docker hub hosted images for the software stack with these tags. Happy hacking, @xvzcf !
