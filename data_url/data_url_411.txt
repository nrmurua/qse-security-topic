Here is a test case (a slightly modified example code shipped with the staq).
The Verilog file toffoli_4.v
The QASM file oracle_example.qasm
Now run this. It will hang.
./staq  -S  -m  -d  tokyo  -f   resources   oracle_example.qasm
Note that I deliberately introduced the typo q[1],q[1]. When that happens, would it be better for staq to throw an exception or something, instead of hanging?
Thanks for the bug report! I just pushed a fix. staq should now identify these errors in the semantic analysis phase and throw an exception.
