Qrack set out trying to avoid all dependency, at its inception, but we have since allowed for a number of very useful optional dependency based features. BLAS/LAPACK would probably be a good optional dependency to add to our list, for CPU Apply2x2(). This would take the place of our "hand-rolled" SIMD intrinsics, but only with the optional build feature enabled.
Prior discussions determined that, despite all reasonable intuition, CPU-based methods would probably not benefit from BLAS/LAPACK over "hand-rolled" SIMD intrinsics! (If you would take issue with this, feel free to reopen the issue and consider showing us a better way to implement this.)
