The top of this list was fixed in #11294, which is the only item here that's part of this repo. The others come from https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime and https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-provider respectively.
I believe everything that can be solved here on Terra is already fixed so I'll close the issue, but please feel free to re-open, make a new one if that's not the case.
