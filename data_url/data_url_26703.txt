This looks related to cp2k/dbcsr#351, but the fix in cp2k/dbcsr@58ee970 doesn't look easy to backport to the dbcsr version included in CP2K 7.1 .
How difficult would it be to patch CP2K 7.1 to compile with GCC 10.2, is that feasible?
Looks like using -fallow-argument-mismatch is a viable workaround, so closing this...
