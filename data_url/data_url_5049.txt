In the worst case, can leverage #92
Oops, a much better idea (in lieu of implementing amp swaps in each backend, which remains optimal) would be to just:
CX XC CX
Needs unit testing
and also needs QASM decomp
Natively supported (by actually swapping amplitudes, requiring comm on distributed mode) in new_gates branch
