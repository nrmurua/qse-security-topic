When I run a variation of the QSVM tutorial found here, it will initially connect to a backend (typically ibmqx2 or ibmqx4), but then fails to fully connect. I was able to run this code a week or so ago without any issues, but now I'm receiving these error messages in a repeated loop. Occasionally, if I wait long enough, after 5-10 minutes the job will be able to connect and give me a result, but not always.
This is my code (the breast cancer function can be found here):
I am not sure why I am having trouble fully connecting with the backend; I have been able to submit simpler jobs (like a short Bell State) without any issues, but the QSVM has not been able to run without the Error 400 messages.
@TMaher13 do you try to run on ibmq_16_melbourne ?
I ran the same codes on ibmqx2 now and it works but I do get many status 400, too.
@chunfuchen I receive the same status 400 codes when running on ibmq_16_melbourne.
@TMaher13 do you mind refer to my comment here #584 (comment)?
Please let me know if you still encounter this issue when you switch to new API
@chunfuchen Following that issue and the version environment you used (Qiskit 10.4, qiskit-ibmq-provider 0.2.2, etc), I get a bunch of status 403 codes. I saw on the slack channel a couple people were saying that qiskit is doing away with the credit system though? This is the error message I'm getting:
Got a 403 code response to /api/Network/ibm-q/Groups/open/Projects/main/jobs: {"error":{"statusCode":403,"name":"NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES","message":"NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES","code":"NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES"}}
FAILURE: Can not get job id, Resubmit the qobj to get job id.Error: Got a 403 code response to /api/Network/ibm-q/Groups/open/Projects/main/jobs: {"error":{"statusCode":403,"name":"NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES","message":"NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES","code":"NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES"}}
May I know how do you enable your accounts?
Furthermore, from the message you get, you might submit too many jobs, do you mind waiting a while and try again later? Thanks.
IBMQ.enable_account(token, url='https://api.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/Hubs/ibm-q/Groups/open/Projects/main')
Where 'token' is the string of my API token taken from my IBM Q account. It finishes after a while of giving me the status 403 codes if I just let it run, same as the 400 codes
Hi, I will only get 403 error (about do not have enough credits) after using new API, I had let my job run few hours but still get 403 error only. Do you mind posting the error message after you switch to new API? Thanks
By new API do you mean updating qiskit-aqua to 0.5.2 from 0.5.1? I updated qiskit-aqua and then ran my code again. It gave the 403 code for about 30 minutes then gave me the results.
the new API I mean using this url 'https://api.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/Hubs/ibm-q/Groups/open/Projects/main'
Encounter 403 error code is normal since you did not have enough credit, you need to wait until you have enough credits. Do you still encounter the 400 error?
I don't receive the 400 error anymore, but I still get the 403 error even after I waited 24 hours to run something. I ran the same code on a different IBM Q account that has not ran anything in several days, and it still got stuck on the 403 error.
We ran on ibmqx2 as well to see if it's an issue with the specific melbourne backend, but got the same result.
@TMaher13 do you see any job is launched at this page? https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/results
You can consider the 400 error of old API is similar to the 403 error of new API.
@chunfuchen My page shows that my jobs submitted all had completed, even though some of them never returned the results to me.
The account column is blank for all jobs though, could that be why? That seems odd since I use the IBMQ.enable_account(token, uri) API call.
@chunfuchen My page shows that my jobs submitted all had completed, even though some of them never returned the results to me.
So some jobs are completed but Aqua keeps returning you 403 error? If so, I will try to reproduce and fix it.
Or you do not see any job after you encounter 403 error?
For me, after I encounter 403 error, then I will keep getting 403 error and no job is submitted (no new job are pending in the dashboard). I need to wait until my credit is enough and then try again later.
The account column is blank for all jobs though, could that be why? That seems odd since I use the IBMQ.enable_account(token, uri) API call.
I think blank column for the account is okay.
The jobs that I submit show up even when I encounter the 403 error, and sometimes it shows multiple result IDs for each job I submit.
I just attempted to submit a job using the same code for the first time in 3 days and still get the 403 error. When I look on the API dashboard, I see 9 unique IDs for my job all saying the status is COMPLETED (they show up in the Pending Results and then Latest Results once they are "finished").
@TMaher13 Thanks. I think there is a bug after switching to the new API. I will try to reproduce and fix it.
After multiple attempts, I still can not see any job in my dashboard (IBMQ website) If I get the 403 error.
Here is my log from Not available credits till successfully submitting jobs.
This should no longer occur in Aqua 0.6. Closing, if the problem that you experienced still continues for you either reopen or raise a new issue.
@chunfuchen  Hi, we are experiencing the same problem when using Qsvm as described above :  403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://api-qcon.quantum-computing.ibm.com/api/Network/ibm-q/Groups/open/Projects/main/Jobs?access_token=.... NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES, Error code: NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES.  with Aqua 0.6   :-(
We are using qiskit 0.12.0 and the following components version

We're running on Open device  (vigo or ourence) and after a chunk of about 280 error messages (NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES) that took about 15 minutes,  the jobs are successfully executed
I noticed issue Qiskit/qiskit#395 in qiskit referencing  "Error msg typo: NOT_CREDITS_AVALIABLES"
but seems to be related to the typo only ?? :-)
