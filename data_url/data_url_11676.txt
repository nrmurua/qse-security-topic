pip install qiskit-aqua==0.7.0 generates error.
There is no wheel for cplex (manylinux, armv7l - only x86 and ppc64) so there is no cplex to get - regardless of python version.
Try to install Aqua 0.7.0 on a Raspberry Pi 4.
That cplex should be an optional pre-req, and not a mandatory pre-req.
According to README.md:
"Note: there some optional packages that can be installed such as IBM CPLEX for Aqua and ab-initio chemistry libraries/programs. Refer to Optional Install information in the sections below."
Remove pre-req, or make it optional.
The readme referred to the commercial IBM CPLEX product that has been an optional install for an ising algorithm. The cplex requirement installed here, that was introduced this release, is different but related. The readme thus could be clearer. Having said that another issue #926 was raised here where making this cplex install optional has been discussed.
