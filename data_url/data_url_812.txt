In contrast to the rest of the SDK functions, the tracker does not work behind a web proxy.
If I get it right, it's because the http.request in line 37 of tracking/pricing.py will only get a response if a direct connection to https://pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com is available. In our company environment my dev machine where I run the Jupyter notebook has to go out via HTTP(S)_PROXY.
Hi @arthurhobspice, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We'll look at this when our roadmap permits, but PRs are always welcome.
