Current folding methods use library-specific errors when trying to invert a gate which doesn't have a defined inverse. In the future, when we decide on an underlying circuit representation & write/use conversion methods, we should define our own error to (1) reduce size of traceback and (2) not confuse users by, e.g., throwing a Cirq error when they input a Qiskit circuit.
