We run the 'slow' tests on a schedule, and LEDA appears to break them because it takes too long under valgrind: https://circleci.com/gh/PQClean/PQClean/4983
I am aware of this problem, see #193.
This got fixed, as #206 included a no_output_timeout: 2h change.
Nice job!
I'm also working on speeding this up using faster multiplication methods without variable-sized arrays. I was thinking about including this in a (hopefully more) constant-time "clean" implementation.
