Hi!
Thanks lot for the great package!
I have a following problem.
When calculating off-diagonal Pauli correlator for tensor_1d.MatrixProductState states, e.g.  Corr(X, Y) or Corr(Z, Y), I always get zero, no matter what state I choose.
Similarly, for some diagonal correlators I also get zero for a rather arbitrary state.
In the example below all correlators except of Corr(Z, Z) are evaluated to be zero.
I first noticed the problem when calculated off-diagonal correlators for TEBD evolution under a quite generic Hamiltonian.
Any ideas?
Please see the code snippet below.

Thanks for the issue. There are two problems here:
Its like writing
meaning the psi is only the first line.
However that might just be a mistake in writing out the issue! Cos there's also a real bug that in the correlation function that the bra is not being conjugated, giving off results for complex states. I'll fix that now.
Second issue hopefully fixed with aecb30a - let me know if not!
Yeah, indeed, you're right! I made a typo when typing expression for psi.
However it is irrelevant for the second issue.
Yeah, commit aecb30a fixes everything. I'm glad I found it)
