The following piece of code throws an exception (error message below) when being executed:

A deprecated WaveFunctionTrialResult is returned by the function, instead of the promised SimulationTrialResult. I believe this is due to version conflicts, but I am running on colab and am pretty sure that everything is up-to date.

The following error gets thrown (similar message even from a direct copy of the code and a fresh cirq install on Colab):
I am unable to reproduce this either locally or with a colab at HEAD.
This is a good question though: should we be taking care to keep examples in sync with last release and not HEAD?
How are you installing cirq on colab?  I used !pip install git+https://github.com/quantumlib/cirq and also tried !pip install cirq-unstable and both of those worked.
I was using the stable version of cirq and trying to run the demo on that, I am starting out on Cirq and was unaware that I should have run them on unstable/master. You are right, both those work.
Anyways, here is the notebook that did not work because I was using the stable version.  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uwJjOvRa1REHLIgIzhfxc_tg9Z9Yo9H2?usp=sharing
I am closing this issue since it does not exist on master.
@dabacon We already made the decision that examples should be up to date with HEAD.
@vtomole thanks!
