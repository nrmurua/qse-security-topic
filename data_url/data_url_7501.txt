I got confused about the select! function in the document. As the state like $|0\rangle |psi\rangle + |1\rangle |phi\rangle$ and just ignore the normalization factor,  I measure the first qubit and only keep the state when the first qubit is measured 0 to obtain $|psi\rangle$. How to realize this by using the function select!?
Hi, thanks for the issue. We will polish the documents later.
Since select! operations on the whole space. You can do not the following
I'm going to close this, but feel free to open a new one if you have other questions.
