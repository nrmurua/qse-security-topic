The functionality for computing expectation values that is currently available via the perform-expectation generic function in QVM-APP's src/api/expectation.lisp falls more naturally within the purview of the QVM.
In general, features that directly use an instance of a quantum virtual machine and can act as building blocks for higher-level APIs, belong to the QVM package.
This seems reasonable prima facie.
