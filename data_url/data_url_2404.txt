and the gates also change badly
These discontinuous jumps are likely coming from the new override code.
This happens because flipping the sign of the exponent in the special cases of phase_exponent=1, -0.5 also applies a global phase and can be corrected by adjusting the global_shift of the resulting XPow or YPow gate. This will break an awful lot of tests that assume global_shift never gets touched in the special casing.
