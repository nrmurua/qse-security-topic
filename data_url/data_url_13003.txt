Using the QASM file test.qasm
And the python code
I get the error LangException: Unrecognized gate: c3sqrtx.
It seems that the parser doesn't include the qelib1.inc file where the c3sqrtx gate is defined.
Thanks for writing this issue. We should address this shortly.
The qelib1.inc is handled specially by BQSKit since many qasm files include it but are not packaged with it. It is expected to be preloaded in a lot of situations. How we handle this is that we preload many gate definitions that go beyond the qelib1.inc and then discard the qelib1.inc include statement. We still support other include statements normally. To get this working, I think we need to define the missing gates and add them to the preloaded definitions.
Why not have the qelib1.inc file as part of the BQSKit as been done with classical compilers for stdio.h for example?
