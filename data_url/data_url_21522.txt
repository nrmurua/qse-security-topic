Conda install fails for Python versions 3.8 and higher.
I know we all love to bash conda's dependency "solver": conda install fails because of package conflicts, which it really shouldn't.
Should create a conda environment with python 3.9 and artiq...
Besides conda problems, binary packages that ARTIQ uses need to be recompiled against Python 3.9.
Python 3.9 is not supported with conda at the moment.
This also fails in exactly the same way for Python 3.8; is there a timeline to get the binaries compiled against Python>3.7?
Done for ARTIQ 6 and 7, they now install with Python 3.8 and the environment that comes with the latest Anaconda (2021.05). Note: conda (and windoze) is still a pile of junk, the only reason I could do such a major update in a few hours is thanks to WFVM and related infrastructure.
