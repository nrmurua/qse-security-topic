It is currently possible to initialize a Schedule with timed instructions like Schedule((100, Play(Constant(100, 1.0), DriveChannel(0)))). This should be deprecated in the next release so as to enable us to add signature information to schedules in future releases.
Hi again! I'd like to help on this one. I'll start taking a look at it later tonight, if that's ok with you.
Thanks :-)
Awesome, assigned ðŸ˜„ .
Hey, sorry for the delay!
I tried to understand usage of the deprecated constructor, and track it out as much as possible.
I had a few questions, and I thought discussing them on a PR was easier, so I added my tentative changes, and opened #5093.
Cheers! :-)
@taalexander I was thinking, what about if, while the decision is being taken about this change, I create a short PR just for those bugs I had found, and the tests added?
Edit: I created #5187, just in case.
Hi @mlarocca Are you still working on this one?

Hi @1ucian0 this was put on hold back then, so I haven't followed up on it. My guess, even more after seeing #5093 was closed, was that this is outdated now, and not needed anymore?
Otherwise I can pick it up again.
Thanks!
yeap. Confirmed with @taalexander . This one can be closed. Thanks!
