Currently the optimize_1q_gates collects runs of single qubit rotations, then simplifies them. But if there is no run, just a single identity, it does not do anything.
If a single gate evaluates to identity, it should be removed. If a u2 evaluates to a u1, it should be converted. Etc.
Im not fully sure when, but I think this is fixed via the introduction of the optimize_1q_gates pass in #1442.
Currently, with the code in master:
