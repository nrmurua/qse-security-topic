To promote "the same" behaviour unless needed explicitly.
For example, the ZIHDAWG8 driver - does anyone know why is this override needed? how is this instrument special to all the other instruments? (this code snippet is not from the latest main branch, but similar ones can be found in the repo)

Also, look at Parameter/Instrument/Channel/Station if there's consistency.
This is created as a substitute for #1830.
