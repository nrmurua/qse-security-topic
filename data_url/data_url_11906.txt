Dear Everyone,
I tried to implement Trotter Time Evolution by referencing this video (Time Evolution with Qiskit Nature & Opflow - YouTube). Thanks for someone providing me some information, I try to implement this method to do Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution as in this issue #1452, and I got 'name 'param_bind' is not defined'. I tried to import more modules such as qiskit Parameters, and the problem is not solved. I also tried other possibilities, which is in the attached pictures, they give out similar or same errors. What exactly is 'param_bind'? Is it a module or a class in Python?
