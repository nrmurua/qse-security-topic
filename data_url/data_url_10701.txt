Submitting a bqm with SPIN vartype and an initial state that has qubits belonging to the bqm set to 1 and (some) qubits not in the bqm set to 3, we get a response back without issue.
qpu_sampler is a DWaveSampler object.
However, if we set any of the qubits belonging to the bqm to -1, we get this confusing error:
Note that if we remove the "unset" qubit, we again get expected behavior:
As written this is a dwave-system issue, though it might end up generating an issue for dwave-cloud-client
Possibly related to dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client#293
Fixed by dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client#295. Once that is merged and deployed I will update the cloud client version requirements.
Version 0.5.2 of dwave-cloud-client deployed.
