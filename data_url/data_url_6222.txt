We need to have this framework in place for the 0.2 release.
I have filed a new Feature Request in ASV repo (airspeed-velocity/asv#803) that would be very useful for us. In the meantime, we will have to force benchmarkings to a specific platform/configuration.
Not sure, how is this related to the new benchmark library in Qiskit - https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/master/test/benchmarks
is it a separate thing/lib in aer? Additional benchmarks in the same lib? Try to add the features tested to existing benchmarks in the lib?
We are using the same python library for running the benchmarks, but we are measuring totally different things though. I've removed from the benchmarks the initial creation of the circuits and the compilation times. We only measure pure running time.
