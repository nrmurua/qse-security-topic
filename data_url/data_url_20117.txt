SIKE on the main branch fails to compile on Arch Linux with gcc 11.1.0. Clang 11.1.0 (apparently GCC has caught up with Clang in version numbers) is fine.

The problem appears to lie in -Warray-parameter=2, which is included in -Wall.
At level 2 the warning also triggers for redeclarations involving any other inconsistency in array or pointer argument forms denoting array sizes.  Pointers and arrays of unspecified bound are considered equivalent and do not
trigger a warning.
It also fails on -Warray-bounds
And on -Wstringop-overflow:
I notified upstream project maintainers.
Can we close this issue?
I think #1028 should first be merged right? Anyway, I can still reproduce on main.
Indeed, to be closed after #1028, which is failing CI. I need to investigate why; probably next week...
As I commented on #1028, it seems the portable code won't link anymore.
