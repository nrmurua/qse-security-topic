Measurement should run without problems
Saving the metadata as a JSON fails because it tries to sort the keys.
Problem lies in lines 338-339 of qcodes/data/gnuplot_format.py:
Remove sort_keys, is it really necessary to sort them? Alternatively, force all dict keys to be of same type. Some instruments (e.g. SR830) will need modifications
@jenshnielsen @WilliamHPNielsen @sohailc
I could be talked in to both solutions.
On one hand I don't think the sorting is particularly important
on the other hand all keys will be serialised to strings anyway when dumping to JSON so perhaps it makes sense to standardise?
It seems to me that that is a bug in the python JSON library that sorting happens before conversion to string but its the case in both the python 3.5 and 3.6 releases that I tested so I guess we have to live with that.
@jenshnielsen I guess pre-converting to strings would also work, though this can fail if the string representation would have a different sorting order, e.g. '2' > '1e9'
@jenshnielsen @nulinspiratie The same problem arises with the SR830 driver. A minimal example constructed from the driver:
@nulinspiratie @jenshnielsen The code works if I use import simplejson as json. Would this be a workaround?
Not sure why simplejson did work
@jenshnielsen @WilliamHPNielsen @nulinspiratie We have multiple users who cannot use recent versions of qcodes together with the SR830 driver. Do you have any idea when you can look into this issue?
I think we can live without the sorting. I'll make a PR soon ( ðŸ˜› ) to remove the sorting.
