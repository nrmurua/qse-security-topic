Instead of the qbraid.interface.draw it might be more elegant to add an abstract draw method to the QuantumProgramWrapper class. This way, all circuits/programs passed to the circuit_wrapper can be drawn in a unified format, including OpenQASM strings (#77). Can take advantage of buit-in functions/methods for each program type and/or add additional integrations with latex or other 3rd party quantum circuit drawers where it is convenient
Yeah, we also need to take note of an issue for cirq, which is it will decompose the gate after transpile, so we need to think of a better way to transpile those gates cirq doesn't support, like continue the work https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/blob/main/qbraid/transpiler/custom_gates.py.
