Consider the following minimal code:
Instead of giving the expected result, it fails with the error:
The problem seems to be that the IBMBackend simply does not preform a measurement (even when explicitly instructed to do so) on trivial circuits.
To convince yourself that nothing else with the above code is wrong, simply remove one of the Z | q1 and it will run fine.
Please make Measure set the probabilities also for trivial circuits.
Thanks for example, you are correct, there is a bug for the following code:
The QASM code generated is empty and hence does not get send to IBM. Therefore, when you later call Measure, it cannot give the result. We will fix this.
By the way, your circuit is invalid:
We can add some more checks in future to catch some of these.
You are right, I forgot to remove the with Compute when stripping this down from a more verbose example.
