When attempting to use assembler.disassemble on a Qobj with an mcx gate, the disassembler throws an error.
produces
a shorter version that doesn't break the argument number also hints at what's being passed being incorrect in some way:
(same input as above except qc.mcx([0,1,2],3))
correct disassembly into a circuit
I think what's happening here is that the signature for quantumcircuit.mcx expects a list  of controls, followed by a target; mcx(control_qubits, target_qubit, ...)  The qobj representation of an mcx gate is just a list of qubits, with (I think) the last being the target; L130 is unzipping the entire qubit list into the method, which does not match the signature.
granted, this might eventually be moot given #5897, but it looks like there needs to be another case in the disassembler for this gate and any like it that expect a list, or else a change in the gate def to accommodate this case.
@ColemanCollins If you're not working on this, I think I have at least a rudimentary solution. It appears that 4 QuantumCircuit methods, mcx, mct, mcp, and mcu1 use the control_qubits list. (There may be others if we look through all the internally created gates, but I think fixing these will handle the immediate problem). It's easy to treat these as a special case in the disassembler.
If you'd like, I can submit a PR to fix this.
@enavarro51 feel free! no feeling of ownership here and I wasn't planning on getting to it until the weekend
Thanks. PR at #6291.
