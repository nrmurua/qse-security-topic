This is the same as Qiskit/qiskit#1587, but I realized qiskit-aer might be the right place to post it instead of qiskit. Please feel free to close either of these.
When running VQE for the two spin Heisenberg model with the Hamiltonian H = -(X^X) - (Y^Y) - (Z^Z), whose ground state energy is -1. However, when I use a custom ansatz and run VQE with density_matrix backend, VQE reports an energy of -3, which is lower than the ground state energy.
I attach the circuit diagram of the ansatz below:

Note that this is a rather pathological ansatz, in that the final state is independent of the parameter theta. Perhaps that is a cause of the problem?
Here is the MWE to reproduce the problem:
This prints out the following:
VQE finds the energy of -1, which is the energy of the state 00.
If we uncomment the final line of the MWE (statevector_simulator computation) and run it, it prints the following result and runtime warning messages:
This seems to signal there is a divide by zero error lurking around. Perhaps what is happening with the density_matrix calculation is some kind of silent divide by zero error?
I'm sorry that my response is very lazy.
With statevector_simulator or BasicAer.get_backend("qasm_simulator"), the above program does not work correctly with the current qiskit (though behavior of aer_simulator_density_matrix looks unexpected). In addition, operator flow is now deprecated. Please create a new issue if we encounter the same issue with the latest API.
Thank you for your response!
