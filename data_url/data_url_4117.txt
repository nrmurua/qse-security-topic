The Perceval framework had provided error models for the overall circuit by adding multiphoton component in the source laser beam.
But it would be better if there is a noise associated with various gates (beam splitter, phase shifters) which are being applied. Since practically the various photonics components are not 100% accurate, we may need to model the noise associated with each gate operation.
Also, the Perceval forum link shows Error 500 when trying to post queries in the forum.
