Plots generated by plot_circuit_layout display the qubits indices only. For multi-register circuits, this is not enough.
For example, if we have the circuit
And we use plot_circuit_layout to draw the virtual layout
The result will be

You can easily see that, it is hard to figure out which qubit belongs to which register.
We need to distinguish between the qubits which belong to different registers. We can display register name (above or below the circles represent the qubits). Or use different colors for different registers as shown below:

transpile flattens to a single register because that is the only thing the hardware understands. Additionally, the swap mapper can permute qubits in such a way as to make anything more than a single register invalid.
I'm not sure what you mean by "transpile flattens to a single register", but the register names are already there in plot_circuit_layout.
Actually, I generated the image that uses different colors for different registers by adding a few lines of code to this method.
And the currently generated images have a very limited value in case of multi-register circuits.
