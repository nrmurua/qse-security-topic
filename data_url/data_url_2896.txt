I was using the testing scripts to test the PR I made earlier and found some failing tests. However, it looks like these tests passed for others. They were tests that should've been unaffected by the changes in that PR. I've attached the output file (here) that I get from redirecting bash continuous-integration/test-pull-request.sh 354.
In the terminal, I get
The one change I've made to the testing script was to change line 51, py35=${PYTHON35_DIR:-"/usr/bin/python3.5"}, to give my Python3.5.
From the output, it looks like there is a discrepancy between where some of your installed Python modules go and the Python version you are using for these tests. Are you sure that virtualenv is using the same Python verison?
If the test script is picking up a different python binary, instead of the one in the virtualenv, that's a bug in the build script. (Which it looks like is in fact the issue.)
Sorry, let me give everything together! I separated my output and error which is why it might look like that, but I do think it's using the correct version for the 3.5 tests at least.
Interesting... it seems like floats are being described in a different way on your machine?
What do you get when you run this:
I get this:
And when I run this:
I get this:
Are you getting this instead (ends with 7 instead of 66)?
The outputs I get are
and
It's the same for your first two tests, but does have the 7 vs 66 difference on the other two... What's the significance of this?
This was fixed as part of another CL, which reduced the precision going into the Quirk URLS.
