Store the TDM Word size and the size of the TDM memory / number of words / valid address range (pick something) in a constant in APS*Pattern.py
@ahelsing the word size is 32 bits and the address range is 0->4095 (see tdm hdl source Customize.vhd). I'm not sure what branch you are on, but this can go in the header of the pattern gen whenever you need it. I doubt we will run out of addresses in the medium to long term, but we can even expand this if need be
I work off develop generally. Care to make the change to add it there?
sounds good, see d90a333 MAX_VRAM_ADDRESS
