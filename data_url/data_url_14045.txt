The following statement is accepted by pqgl2, but not handled properly:
But the expression MEAS(q1) is not treated as a runtime value.  (in fact, it's just generally broken)
The sequence:
Leads to x being recognized as a runtime value, and is treated half-correctly (although measurements are still somewhat broken).
The first priority is to make the values gleaned from measurements work properly (in some case), including using them in conditionals.  In the longer run, it would be good to either allow measurements to be used as runtime values, or else have the compiler reject code that attempts to use them as such.  It's not acceptable for the compiler to fail silently.
This is related to #8, which was apparently begun but doesn't use the APS3 changes.
