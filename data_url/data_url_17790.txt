While working on #1153, @charlesastaylor found several functions duplicated in qiskit/backends/aer/_simulatortools.py and qiskit//backends/aer/qasm_simulator_py.py (such as index1). This duplication should be removed.
Also, the docstring for the _index2() function (in both places) reads """Magic index1 function. Is that a typo?
Didn't think this was worth a new issue, apologies if this is wrong place to mention.
it can be fixed in the same move. And yes, it's probably a typ0.
