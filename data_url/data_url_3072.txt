I'm getting a number of ResourceWarnings regarding ZMQ on an ARM machine:
Nothing terribly troubling, as my code still runs, but I'm loath to ignore warnings.
Does this occur when running in a jupyter notebook?
@bramathon these have all been on the command line; I haven't checked to see if they occur in notebooks as well.
Ah scratch that theory then
