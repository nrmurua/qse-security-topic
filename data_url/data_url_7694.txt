The tensor network documentation, in particular, has fallen a bit behind the functionality. This issue is to keep track of what extra documents will hopefully be written and any suggestions for content.
@jcmgray That is super cool  to extent documentation:
I think we can tell people QUIMb can handle infinite/periodic TN such as iMPS and scale invariant MERA. I will complete the flowing list
A detailed guide to drawing has been added here - https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tensor-drawing.html.
The basic introduction to tensor network functionality has been re-written - https://quimb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tensor-basics.html.
