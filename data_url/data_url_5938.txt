A 36-qubit circuit requires over 1TB of memory to store the statevector, which is likely why you are getting a segment fault. 34-qubits would require ~275 GB.
It looks like a bug where the memory checking which raises an exception when a circuit requires more memory than is available was missing for the Statevector or Unitary simulators. This is fixed in #969 so that if you run the above example it will return:
