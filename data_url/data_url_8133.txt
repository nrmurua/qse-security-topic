I'm trying to simulate a Rabi oscillating Hamiltonian with unitary decay operators (the real simulation has decay on a different tensored component, so I tensor with qeye). Even though the decay operators are unitary, I keep seeing decay. It's independent of the unitary prefactor, and doesn't seem to depend on the timestep. If I remove the time dependence I don't see decay. If I remove the decay operators it Rabi oscillates fine. Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong?
Thank you

return 2 * np.pi * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 5e3 * t)

result=qt.mesolve(H, psi0, tlist, [qt.qeye(2)], qt.sigmaz(), progress_bar=True)

plt.clf()
plt.plot(result.times, result.expect[0])

Nevermind, sorry I was being stupid. Changed the integrator tolerance and it work :/.
