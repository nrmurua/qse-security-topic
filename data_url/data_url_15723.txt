This is the current sequence of passes for the current preset passmanagers:
With the level 3 exception, in most of the preset passmanagers the pass Unroll3qOrMore runs after the layout allocation stage.
Most of the passes related with layout ignore 3-or-more-qubit gates.
This results in obscure layouts that are not always align with the promise.
Run Unroll3qOrMore before the layout pass. Either via require or set in the passmanagers.
