Additional context
This seems to be an issue with the new macOS, because when I tried to install it on a different machine it works.
It's an interaction between Cython3, setuptools, and rectagle-packer. Specifically rectangle-packer does not ship ARM wheels for OSX, which means that pip will try to do an sdist install, which then runs into Penlect/rectangle-packer#21 and then cython/cython#5568.
Because we don't control that package, we're a bit beholden to the community fixing it. That said, if this persists long enough we'll look at forking rectangle-packer or similar.
There are a few open issues on the topic:
Penlect/rectangle-packer#22
Penlect/rectangle-packer#21
cython/cython#5568
pypa/cibuildwheel#1612 edit: nope, not relevant other than pointing out how to unpin build versions.
Opened another PR (Penlect/rectangle-packer#23) against rectangle-packer to see if that fixes it.

Thank you! Meanwhile, would using a different version of Python fix anything?
Unfortunately I think any ARM osx system will run into this issue, though I don't myself have access to a mac so I haven't been able to exhaustively check.
@arcondello I just tried again and the issue seems to have been resolved.
