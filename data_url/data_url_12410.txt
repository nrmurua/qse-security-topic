Would this be an operation that could be made fairly easily if we had: #292  in the code to work off of ?
I think so.  One example use case is if I sample bitstrings from two different circuits and I want to compare the bitstrings on the subset of qubits the circuits have in common.  Ideally there would be some identifiers accessible in-graph, without deserializing the circuits.
