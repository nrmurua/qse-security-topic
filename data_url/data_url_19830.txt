The code in clifford_utils.py, lines 215-223 seems not to be the same as described in the appendix of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.7011.pdf (see also the jupyter notebook on the structure of the Clifford group in: https://github.ibm.com/IBMQuantum/qiskit-ignis-internal/pull/83).
In the appendix, the forth class is the "SWAP class", so I think that the code should be:
However, the current code is (this was the original code - I didn't change it):
I checked both options, and both of them produce 11520 elements in the Clifford group, so both options cover all the elements in the group (but using different gate representations).
I also checked test_rb and it runs OK, but test_clifford fails, since the tables (of lists of gates) are not the same.
So in order to change the code I also need to replace the file "test_tables_expected".
