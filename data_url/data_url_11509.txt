Adapt-VQE works fine with BasicAer, but fails with Aer backends (both statevector_simulator and qasm_simulator).
In previous qiskit verstion VQEAdapt worked fine.
After molecule definition I use built-in methods:
Computation runs fine without error, as in BasicAer case
Having found out about the meta package version numbering I know was able to reproduce your error with a stable-branch installation of Qiskit. Let me dig into this a little bit more and get back to you on this.
PR #1447 fixes this issue and was merged about a week ago. Thus, my initial attempt of reproducing the bug failed, because it is no longer present on the master branch.
This means that you have several options:
We can also see whether it is possible to release a Qiskit Aqua 0.8.2 based on 0bf9873 which would allow you to install this bug fix via pip but that is not a decision which I can make. @woodsp-ibm @manoelmarques what do you think about this?
@mrossinek thank you! I installed master version of qiskit and now it works fine. However, I would like to point out one thing:
with qasm simulator aux_operator values grow quadratically with the number of shots. I've already mentioned the same thing for QEOM #1460.
I think that it would be nice to normalize them.

While you seem to have an appropriate ground state the other operators, such as number of particles (1.948676 million!) and dipole moment are way off (to put it mildly!) @mrossinek Any comments here?
Hi @woodsp-ibm. I was actually just working on a fix together with @Cryoris.
See the new PR #1473
Since the Aqua core is in the process of being merged into Terra, I re-opened the PR which fixes this over there. See Qiskit/qiskit#5496
This issue is now also fixed in the migrated Aqua core inside of Terra. Closing.
