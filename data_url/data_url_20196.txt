Hey, thanks for this great library! Just wanted to let you know that Mac users can now install liboqs and its dependencies in a single command with Homebrew.
Ref: Homebrew/homebrew-core#56065
Hi Andrew! Thanks for showing such interest in our project.  At this point we still consider the algorithms in the library to be experimental, and that the implementations and library haven't received the full level of review that would normally be expected of cryptographic software for production use.  So we currently consider the library more for experimental use, rather than widespread deployment.  Is there an experimental or unstable branch of brew that this could go in, rather than the main distribution?
Homebrew allows you to host your own repo, but doesn't have it's own unstable branch. However, I don't think it's typically used for discovery if that's the concern (it should be primarily be an easy way for developers to do the quickstart steps in the readme). That being said, I can ask the project to remove it if you'd prefer.
I think for now we'd like to hold off on having liboqs available via brew, since we still view the code and algorithms as experimental.  Within the next year the PQ algorithm landscape should consolidate further, and we'll have higher confidence in implementations too, at which point we can revisit.
