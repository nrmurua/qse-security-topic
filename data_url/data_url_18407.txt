(Same with QVM and MAGICL.)

I'm still advocating for a Rigetti-specific version of the lisp-critic.
I wrote a new program to dig up this kind of info. Here's a report it can produce, with additional remarks added manually in italics.
Many of these are easy fixes. Two exceptions stand out:
A final issue to consider: sometimes external symbols are just syntax, and do not have a natural place to hang documentation. Consider it in anaphoric libraries, or otherwise in CL. It would take some extra thought to exclude them from a report on problematic symbols.
The report:
These are self-evident, to me, but a missing docstring is a missing
docstring.
These arise from adt:defdata.
These generally arise from class-slot style of working with classes,
rather than protocol-oriented style.
These are all due to adt:defdata.
@rigettizach Cool!
