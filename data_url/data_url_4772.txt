The version of the CX gate implemented in ops seems to have the wrong order of the beamsplitter relative to what is reported in the conventions page. This might be a bug
This bug also implies that the gate teleportation test and example need to be refactored using the correct behaviour of the gate. This is also true for any other test/example that uses the CX and CZ gates
The CXgate by definition should have the following behaviour
CX(s) |x_1>|x_2> = |x_1>|x_2+s x_1>
where |x_i> is a position eigenstate.
Its current implementation is correct. For example testing this behaviour for x_1=2 and x_2=1
we obtain the vector of means

The implementation is correct but the description in the conventions page is wrong. The order of the beamsplitter gates needs to be updated
Addressed in #169 .
It would be nice to add the code above as a unit test. Not sure where though. Any ideas @josh146 ?
This would be the perfect test to add to tests/integration/test_decompositions_integration.py. The tests in this file double check that the frontend-defined decomps do the correct things on the backends.
We should ideally have tests for all decomposed gates - S2gate, CZgate, Pgate, etc.
