Describe the feature you'd like
Amazon Braket supports executing circuits specified with OpenQASM 3.0. We should be able to translate circuits defined using the Braket SDK into valid OpenQASM strings which can be executed on the service.
How would this feature be used? Please describe.
The to_ir() method on the circuit class should be extended to accept a parameter to determine the IR to translate the circuit to. The IRType can be either JAQCD or OpenQASM. The to_ir() method on the constituent classes should also be updated to translate to different IRTypes based on this parameter value.
Note: For verbatim execution of circuits, the qubits need to use physical qubit addressing. The implementation should be able to account for generating circuits with both physical and virtual qubit notation. See details [1] [2].
