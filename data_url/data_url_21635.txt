The watchdog feature lets you enforce that a block of kernel code is executed within the specified period of time, otherwise the kernel is terminated.
For example this (part of the ARTIQ test suite):
gets terminated after 50ms and the idle kernel gets executed.
Watchdogs are somewhat complicated to implement in the runtime and the current implementation has some rough edges (#673). The complexity in implementation translates to a complexity in maintenance, such as when porting to the new async-await  Rust features as we are currently doing within the Zynq project.
Based on emails with key people and the published ARTIQ user codebases, it seems that nobody ended up using this watchdog feature, so I am going to remove it.
@sbourdeauducq Thanks for creating an Issue on this. This isn't a feature that we use in my lab. I won't miss it.
