Hi I'm trying to connect my  Redpitaya STEM-125-14 using PyRPL on a windows 10 mecmachines hine for the first time.
The Redpitaya is running STEMlab_125-xx_OS_1.04-7_stable, will connected and tested since I can access to it through my web browser and use it as an oscilloscope.
Then I download pyrpl-windows.exe following the manual and when the program scans over my LAN ports, I get the following error message:
My guess is that I lack some packages on my computer. Does anyone have any clone about how to solve this?
I tested this on two different window 10 machines and get the same error message.
I'm getting the same issue on Windows 11.
I'm also getting this on Windows 11. Has anyone solved this?
I'm also getting this on Windows 10. Has anyone solved this?
I reinstalled my python environment using anaconda3 5.1.0 (python 3.6), and successed connecting the board.
