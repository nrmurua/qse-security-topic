The PolynomialTensor method rotate_basis changes the PolynomialTensor object in place. This behavior is inconsistent with our general approach (for example, in _operator_utils.py) to have functions that create a new operator as output. Often, one really does want to keep the original operator around. @jarrodmcc @babbush
I think the reason its like this is because we've only implemented basis rotations for certain 1- and 2-body types of operators. For instance, we haven't written code to do it for 3-body operators or higher.
I believe we did that in #117.
Oh I guess so. Well in that case I support this change but we need to be careful to propagate the change to all dependancies since I believe that changing this will break OpenFermion-Psi4 and OpenFermion-PySCF. Let's not make this change until a big version bump (perhaps to v1.0) is imminent.
One can use general_basis_transform as a substitute which is standalone.
