Setting the paulis attribute (it has a @setter) on a SparsePauliOp instance does not update the BaseOperator shape attributes.
The above snippet produces the output
whereas it should produce
if changing the dimension is allowed, or raise an exception if it's not allowed.
I haven't looked closely, but it's possible that just updating _op_shape will be sufficient to fix the bug.
Looks like value of num_qubits gets updated from PauliList and up but does not get updated from SparsePauliOp. Correct me if I'm wrong
Personally I'd argue that those attributes shouldn't be settable by users at all, but I think the ship's sailed on that front.  Given that the setter exists, I think the best solution would be to have it reject attempts to either modify the number of elements (so len(self._pauli_list) must not change) because that allows an inconsistency with self.coeffs, and also reject any attempt to modify the number of qubits because that just seems inconsistent with the rest of qiskit.quantum_info.
Agree with @jakelishman's comment.
