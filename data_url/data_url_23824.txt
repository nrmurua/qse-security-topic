Currently depending on the type of loop you run, the data in the examples are saved in a testsweep.dat file or eg a test_multi_d folder.
I find this confusing, and with the #93 issue where I would like to save data along with the file, but also auto-save the plots I generate, I do think all types of loops should be saved in a folder.
Or am I just configuring this loop location in a wrong way?
Yup, that's a "feature" of GNUPlotFormat, that if it has to make multiple files it makes a folder, otherwise it just makes a file. But you're right, this won't make sense at all once we have the metadata as a separate file anyway. Also we've talked about automatically saving a default plot of the dataset, even if you don't plot it yourself.
