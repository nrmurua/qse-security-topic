The following was reported by Burt Holzman from Fermilab, who installed OpenFermion in a docker image:
PS The hackiest thing in there is changing the ownership in openfermion
(which is installed under a root-controlled /opt/conda) to the notebook
user. I didn't look at the code, but for some reason it expects write
access in site-packages ...
This might have something to do with some code requiring access to the src/data/ directory. We should investigate.
This is a "problem" we've been aware of since the earliest days of development. But we haven't been able to come up with a satisfactory alternative.
I guess this would be addressed by #270
