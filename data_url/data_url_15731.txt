When QuantumInstance class uses measurement error mitigation, the execute command returns the results of the calibration circuits in addition to the requested circuits. This causes an error in the CircuitSample.sample_circuits command and as a result alters the first iteration of the VQE optimization.
Should return just the result of the input circuit.
It seems like there is a mechanism to skip result in line 641 in utils/quantum_instance.py file.
I think it can be utilised to skip the calibration results as well.
