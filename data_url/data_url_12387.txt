Hi all, I'm looking to contribute, but it looks like the only tagged 'good first issue' is being worked on.
I have a physics and computing background, and I'm also applying to GSOC21 so I thought this could be a good opportunity to do an 'out of the project list' application. If it doesn't get accepted I'd love to contribute anyway.
What do you think?
Hi @jakeywatson contributions are always welcome! Another good issue for contribution would be to add in some more C++ ops see: #380 . If you see anything you like, there's lots of good information there on what a typical op contribution looks like. We are in the middle of gearing up for our 0.5.0 release and after that we will probably start to scope out what features we want for 0.6.0.
I'm personally not too familiar with GSOC, but I would never say no to more contributors on TFQ :)
Hi @MichaelBroughton, that looks good to me, I'm happy to take one of the ops from the list. I'll do it as a normal contribution, not with GSOC.
Are all of them still open? Also, which would you recommend, given that I'm new to TFQ? Really looking forward to the work :)
I'd say either of operator_matrix, operator_commutator or fidelity would be a good place to start, with the easiest being fidelity (can probably get away without doing any C++ on it and just using calls to inner_product). Also left another comment on #380  thread that we might want to also support stabilizer simulation which would be the largest undertaking of all of these (likely requiring contributions both here and on the https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim repo).
Can this issue be closed since it is no longer 2021?
