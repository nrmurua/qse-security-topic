Calling rtio_log() in DMA interferes with how the rtio.vcd file is displayed in GTKWave.
If rtio_log() is called in a DMA sequence, when viewed via GTKWave the corresponding log events are wildly misplaced compared to the rest of the events. I'm not sure if rtio_log() functionality is supposed/possible to be included in DMA, but if not, at worst I would expect an offending call to be silently dropped, or more preferable, for an DMAError exception to be thrown.
Example code:
If rtio_log() is supposed to be supported by DMA, then I would expect the log events to line up with the TTL pulses they enclose. If it is not supported, then I would expect this would be an appropriate time to throw the DMAError exception.
Effect with offending log events commented out:


The vcd file behaves as expected.
Effect with log events:



The very beginning of the vcd file is crammed with rtio_log() calls in the DMA sequence, the very end is crammed with all of the other events, and there is a large gap in between.
