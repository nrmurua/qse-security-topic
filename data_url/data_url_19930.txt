Describe the bug
Additional ctest (all of them) failed on windows
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Open x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022
Expected behavior
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
All test cases pass
Environment (please complete the following information):
Additional context
VS log for Debug/x64 build
By default, VS generate built test files in liboqs\build\tests\Debug*(liboqs\build\tests\Release*). But the helper.path_to_executable() try to find files in liboqs\build\tests*.
So the follow code snippet work:
Should I make a PR for that, or go through the test*.py to fix all?
Please check the effect of #1554 just merged: Would this resolve your issue? Reading the code I'd assume currently only by setting the environment variable "GITHUB_ACTIONS". If not, then yes, please propose a PR. As the OQS core team is not exactly comprised of "Windows experts" (or has that platform readily available), maybe @res0nance would be able (& willing?) to assist/review?
I've written a fix (read workaround) for the VS case. It's in the linked PR
