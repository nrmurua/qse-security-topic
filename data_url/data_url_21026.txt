Moving transactions which are the part of forked chain, back into transaction pool, so that the transactions which are not the part of the mainchain could be reprocessed.
This should be added prior to mainnet. The reason this is important is that it is unlikely transactions are not on both sides of a typical fork.  However, in the event of a network failure with the p2p network fracturing and reconnecting it is possible transactions may be different on either branches of a fork.
XMSS is stateful and therefore it is critical that one-time signatures are not repeatedly replayed to expose an underlying private key, thus it is important that transactions are preserved during transition from main branch to fork branch and unduplicated transactions returned to the memory pool.
