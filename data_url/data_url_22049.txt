and
Here's the FMC -> VHDCI adapter pins file we were looking at: https://github.com/npisenti/artiq/blob/jqi-dev/artiq/gateware/jqi_fmc_vhdci.py
/cc @npisenti @jbqubit
Initialization routine for Creotech FMC DIO 32ch lvds a v1.2 is here:
https://github.com/jbqubit/artiq/blob/vhdci_play/artiq/examples/phaser/repository/init_vhdci.py
Done, needs testing.
This works except for the FMC card line direction control.
@gkasprow Are there different versions of that card with different permutations of the shift register outputs, by any chance? Is this correct: 
The code loads the shift register MSB first:

To make PCB routing easier, the control lines are swapped in pairs:
dir_switch_dir(7) <= not dir(6);
dir_switch_dir(6) <= not dir(7);
dir_switch_dir(5) <= not dir(4);
dir_switch_dir(4) <= not dir(5);
dir_switch_dir(3) <= not dir(2);
dir_switch_dir(2) <= not dir(3);
dir_switch_dir(1) <= not dir(0);
dir_switch_dir(0) <= not dir(1);
This code works perfectly with FMC board.

Thanks. The code I linked was correct, but I was doing something daft in my test kernel. Things are working correctly now.
