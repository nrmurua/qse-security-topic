I have a program in which Alice and Bob use 3 qubits each. When I run it once, it works correctly the way I want it to but when I run the same program again, the startCQCNodes.sh terminal logs:
bobTest.py seems to run indefinitely.  so when I finally stop (Ctrl + C), it shows:
I have closed both Alice's and Bob's connection using close(), so I can't figure out why this is happening.
However, when I close both  startVNodes.sh and startCQCNodes.sh, kill the python network and start again, I am able to run the program, but again, just once.
Hi @rasa97
Which branch and version are you using?
Hi @AcksID !
I am using the PreBeta branch, latest commit in the log being
9a3f65f
I just tried clearing qubits using qA.measure(inplace = False), but it didnt solve the problem.
I suspect that some qubits are not measured out and are left in the simulation backend. A lot has happened since the PreBeta version. I would recommend you to use the master branch instead.
