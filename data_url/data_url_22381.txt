Is there anyway of choosing to run only the analyse part of the experiment? It would be useful to be able to rerun just the analyse part sometimes to tweak fitting parameters and to have the option of saving the results of the fit. I have the following experiment here,
It only saves the fit if save is checked but if I initially didn't save the fit and want to save it later I have to rerun the whole experiment. Is there a way of doing this without creating a separate experiment?
See #230. Modifying the master's dataset database automatically from the browser is not planned, though.
