Since the Gradient framework plot on the tutorial below has just one point, it shows empty:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/algorithms/02_vqe_convergence.html
Run the tutorial: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/algorithms/02_vqe_convergence.ipynb
It should show multiple values in the plot.
if the Gradient, Gradient(grad_method='fin_diff') is changed to Gradient()  which usesparam_shift, it works.
I am not sure if fin_diff should not be used anymore in this case or if there is a bug there.
I think this was addressed by #6918, the referenced plot in the tutorial now does show the convergence correctly ðŸ™‚ Feel free to reopen if I missed something!
