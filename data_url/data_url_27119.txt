Dear all,
I have a question about tail-fit.
In my case:
Without spin-orbit, tail-fit works fine.
With spin-orbit, I always receive the following message.
====================
I think that above message is not a problem with dcore,
It would be an issue of triqs v1.4.
I would like to apply the method given below,
but I'm not sure if dcore treats g_tau.
====================
Currently I am using the Legendre-filter method instead of tail-fit.
However in my case, it seems unsuitable for self-consistent calculations
especially for the Mott-insulating systems.
Sometimes self-energy(iw) converges to a non-physical form,
and even the imaginary part goes up in the positive region.
====================
If you have ever tried to fix the problem and run tail-fit,
could you give me a comment?
Best regards,
Kyohoon
Hi.
This seems to be an issue in TRIQS 1.4.
DCore does not support TRIQS 2.0, which requires C++17.
Personally, I've been using ALPS/CT-HYB without tail fitting (with more Matsuabra frequencies).
The high-frequency part of the self-energy may be almost irrelevant in your calculations.
(as long as the low-frequency part is converged)
Sometimes self-energy(iw) converges to a non-physical form,
and even the imaginary part goes up in the positive region.
Dear Shinaoka,
Thank you very much for your comment.
Now I am testing with ALPS/CT-HYB.
(also with more Matsubara frequencies and longer QMC run)
And the result is much better!
My problem seems to be solved without tail-fit.
Many thanks :)
Kyohoon
