Add option to disable the depolarizing gate errors in basic_device_noise_model.
Currently the reported gate error in backend properties along with qubit relaxation parameters and gate times are used to construct gate errors that are a composition of a depolarizing error and thermal relaxation error. This is done in a way so that the average gate infidelity of the combined error is equal to the reported gate error parameter in the backend properties.
If thermal relaxation errors are disabled the depolarizing error will account for the full gate error rate. Adding the option to disable gate errors would allow the gate_error backend parameter can be ignored and only thermal relaxation errors to be applied based on the qubit and gate time parameters (or no gate errors if thermal relaxation is also disabled).
