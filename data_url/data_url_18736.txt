I have 2 test failures on aarch64, due to precision issues:
Hey @ggardet, thanks for sharing! @thisac or @josh146 will be able to answer your question in more detail soon, but have you tried making sure you have the correct version of ANTLR installed?
We currently pin our version to 4.8. You can install this version using
It is in a build service, so I cannot change the version of ANTLR and must use the version provided by the distribution. x86 is not affected, though.
Hi @ggardet. I don't think the ANTLR version should pose any problems here. This seems to be simply a precision issue (in the 18th digit or so), so I'll add a fix for the tests shortly. Hopefully all the tests will pass then.
@ggardet Let me know if it works for you now when running the tests on the master branch, in which case I can close this issue.
I applied this patch on top of 0.3.0 and the tests now pass properly. Thanks!
