Hi all
I tried to install cp2k 8.2 with openmpi 4.1.1, gcc 10.3 and cuda 11.4.
I had finished toolchain installation. I also cloned dbcsr to exts/dbcsr  and used git submodule update --init --recursive in the directory to check again that every package is ready.
However, when I start make cp2k, it still gave me the error:
I checked the file exts/Makefile.inc:2, and found it checked whether $(EXTSHOME)/dbcsr/.cp2k/Makefile existed. The dbscr cloned from github does not have the .cp2k directory and that's why I got the error.
I tried to fix this problem:
First, I created the .cp2k directory in $(EXTSHOME)/dbcsr and used cmake to generated the Makefile, and everything was fine.
Then I tried to make cp2k again.
It gave another error:
I checked that the missing CMakeFiles/Makefile2 is in exts/dbcsr/.cp2k/CMakeFiles, I don't know why the program can't find it.
I'm confused and need some suggestions. Thanks.
Why are you trying to use a new DBCSR?
CP2K 8.2 has its own, so I don't understand the need to touch exts/dbcsr.
To me more precise, I assume you are dowloading a release via:
For users, the preferred method is to download a release (use the versioned tarballs, cp2k-X.Y.tar.bz2)
as stated in the INSTALL.
I find out that I download the wrong version of cp2k source code, which is automatically generated by github.
This detail is here: #1302
Thanks
