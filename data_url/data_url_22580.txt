There are a number of problems with it:
https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qdockwidget.html ?
The pyqtgraph doc says "Docking system that replaces/complements Qtâ€™s dock system to allow more complex (and more predictable) docking arrangements". Not sure how much of that is true/actually provides something useful.
When we have a decent docking system, we should also bring the corresponding experiment dock into focus when it is already open and the user double-clicks on the experiment in the explorer.
https://woboq.com/blog/qdockwidget-changes-in-56.html seems to have most of the features of pyqtgraph docks, plus a few extras (e.g. tab reordering). It will be part of Qt 5.6 (release due March 3rd) and the company developing it offers commercial support.
The only missing thing appears to be splitting a floating window to show multiple docks at the same time (only the main window can simultaneously show docks side-by-side).
Replaced with QDockWidget.
