Issue Description:
On solving some linear combinational problems using qiskit terra operators, I faced an issue while working on the inverse of a matrix.
Even though we can achieve an inverse using a mathematical inverse formula, it will be a multistep process. I also tried the NumPy linear algebra function “pinv” & "inv", but the end result was in shape instead of dimensions.
Expected behavior:-
Inverse/pseudo-inverse of an Operator using function and return operator with dimension.
Suggested solution:-
I have come up with a solution, where we can add inverse function in an operator class. I did some modifications in the operator code and the solution matches with the classical solution.
If you find this issue relevant, then I will be happy to help and be a part of qiskit community.
I'm not sure I understand the problem, since the operators are unitary the inverse equals the adjoint of the operator, which is available with the Operator.adjoint method. Did you use this method?
I'm closing this issue since I think the functionality should exist, but feel free to re-open if you think there's something we need to add.
