Boxes get overlapped in the latex drawer. In the example below I have 3 boxes: a 1-qubit unitary, a 2-qubit unitary, and a 2-qubit custom opaque gate.

Maybe an issue with justification? Though I was not able to fix this by tweaking the justify param.
PS. The underscore in the opaque_gate name should also render better.
Hmm, I'm thinking the layers for justification isn't interpreting things the same way the latex is drawing them so we end up drawing overlapping boxes. @maddy-tod you're more familiar with the layers and justification does this seem like what's going on? Either way I'll check the raw latex output, because I didn't actually think that would render. (I expected xypic to return an error, but it might be an edge case in the multigate).
As for the text, the easiest way would be to just use: https://pypi.org/project/pylatexenc/ as pass all the gate display text through that.
#2246 will fix the name issue, but I still have to look into the overlapping gate drawings
