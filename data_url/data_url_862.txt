Describe the feature you'd like
Support for the run_batch() method on LocalSimulator
How would this feature be used? Please describe.
LocalSimulator allows users to test programs before submitting them to the service using the AwsDevice class. AwsDevice implements a run_batch() method, allowing multiple tasks to be submitted. As a user, if I replace AwsDevice with LocalSimulator, I'm unable to test a code snippet containing run_batch() calls.
Describe alternatives you've considered
A user has to resort to implementing the batch run manually as:
I would like to try solving this issue. So the idea is to replicate the functionality of aws>aws_device.py>AwsDevice>run_batch() to devices>local_simulator.py. Are there any special considerations? Thanks!
@born-2learn Awesome! Yes, exactly. We want to add the following functionality:
There will likely be specific considerations you'll need to take into account for effectively implementing the parallelism; we want to see a performance improvement in line with the parallelization. Let us know if you have any more questions, thanks!
Since we're introducing run_batch to the local simulator, it's also worth adding the method to the top-level Device class.
I'm working on this feature; just to clarify, is it ok to use multiprocessing.Pool for the parallelization?
