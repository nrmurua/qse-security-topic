As discussed today over the phone with @imranashraf  we found that the duration of the readout is added as a delay before the readout starts/is triggered.
Additionally, I am now testing an openql program (AllXY) where I want a buffer between different microwave operations.
To do this I specify the "mw_mw_buffer" in the config file.
Changing this parameter does not have any effect.
@imranashraf if you want more details I can send you the files I am using.
update: changing the duration of the MW does work to address the second issue.
This is partly resolved in recent commit. Please pull the changes.
