For implementing live plotting, the new plottr monitors the database file directly, without using the subscribers, hence the information in qcodes docs is not correct anymore.
See toolsforexperiments/plottr#36.
I suggest just to remove the mentioning of plottr, or substitute it with a link the exactly working version (which is now "the old plottr")
I agree - go for it!
Monitoring the db file is really all it takes.
Plottr no longer uses subscriptions
