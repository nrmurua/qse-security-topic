refactor ConstantGate.jl to a safer implementation with @eval macro. use gensym for constant bindings.
This problem is solved in v0.7. I fixed this with some ugly workaround. Remember to delete v0.6 workarounds when we drop v0.6 supports. Basically the behavior of @eval seems to be different in v0.7 and v0.6.
