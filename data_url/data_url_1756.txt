As per our - not yet documented (#3347) - python policy we should support 3 versions of python at a time. In Oct 2020, the stable version of Python 3.9.0 was released, we should support it.
This means adding 3.9 to the test matrix in .github/workflows/ci.yml python-version: [ '3.7', '3.8' ] for Ubuntu, Windows and MacOS builds, and working out all the dependency kinks.
@kevinsung started to pave the way with the issues he opened, someone just needs to work through them.
Due to #3769 it looks like this depends on numba releasing version 0.53.0.
