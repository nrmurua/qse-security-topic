Hi, I was supposed to use Operator class of aqua as required by a course I am taking on edX. However, I have realised that Operator class doesn't exist anymore. I was searching up near class to construct a Hamiltonian as a sum of products of Pauli matrices, formerly done using Operator class

The nearest class I could find for such operation was WeightedPauliOperator() but its methods and arguments are not mentioned in aqua documentation hence I am unable to use it.
Kindly help.
What's called Operator in the text is indeed the WeightedPauliOperator. However with Aqua 0.7 a new framework for Operators has been introduced which mimics the mathematical workflow, see the documentation or this notebook for an introduction.
Your example would simply be
you can get the "old" operator notation from this by calling to_legacy_op
which is the same as in the text
Btw, even if no documentation exists in qiskit.org, the code of the WeightedPauliOperator still is documented if you need to look something up.
Thank you very much!
