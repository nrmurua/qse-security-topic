I'm using IPython in Google Colab (Python 3.8.10). qiskit[visualization] version is 0.41.0.
The following code
produces the following error:
Works fine with other arguments for draw (e.g. text, bloch, etc.).
Same problem for DensityMatrix.
This is mostly caused by Google Colab having quite an old version of sympy installed by default, though Terra could also be better at catching the error (see #9505).  As an immediate workaround, you can run
in your colab session, and that should hopefully solve the issue.
We're working on a larger fix.  In the meantime, I'll close this issue (but thanks for raising it!) because we've already got a report in #9481.
Duplicate of #9481
