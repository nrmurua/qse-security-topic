Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
This came up in #4108. The workflow there is: user-defined circuit -> Floquet / XEB characterizations for each pair in the circuit -> run a Loschmidt echo with each characterization.
The Loschmidt echo circuit contains two-qubit gates on all pairs. So if the user-defined circuit doesn't have all of these pairs, a ValueError is raised  in _make_zeta_chi_gamma_compensation complaining about the missing pairs.
Describe the solution you'd like
Should the default behavior be to skip corrections on missing pairs instead of raising an error? If not the default, can it be made an option?
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
For the tutorial in #4108, I can make it so the "user-defined" circuit has all pairs and this isn't a problem. However, this might not be too useful when someone actually tries to use the tutorial with their circuit.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
Seems P0 if any EAP users want to follow the calibration tutorial, but I can get around it for writing the tutorial so it's not blocking.
I purposefully made it hard to do such a things because this degrades the performance of the executed circuits.
Maybe we should discuss first the specific case you have and see what's the best solution there?
Discussed with Wojtek offline and agreed to close this - moments to characterize should come from the circuit being run (which would prevent this error from ever being raised).
