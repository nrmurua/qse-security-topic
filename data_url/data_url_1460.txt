Description of the issue
BaseDensePauliString already defines a __getitem__ method which works for ints, and hence is already implicitly an iterable. However, mypy doesn't recognize it as an Iterable unless an explicit __iter__ method is defined.
We can easily define the __iter__ method as:
However, this currently breaks a test due to an unfortunate combination of two bugs: #4835 and #4834
Cirq version
0.14.0.dev
From cirq sync: +1, should be done.
