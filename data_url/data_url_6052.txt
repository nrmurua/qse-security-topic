I'm now refactoring this class to use unitarymatrix simulator in make_fusion. I will send a PR after #606 with more comments.
@hhorii Lets make a separate PR for improving gate fusion. I think your PR 606 closes the documentation issue from the QasmSimulator class doc, but maybe some more documentation in the source code would be helpful as well.
