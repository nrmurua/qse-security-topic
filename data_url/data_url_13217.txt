This is an improvement proposal, following an AI Summer school I attended where everyone seemed to use Google Colab for  sharing notebooks. I propose to investigate how we could support Colab, which, by the way, I believe added some features in the past years, integrating with Github.
We currently only support My Binder which has the following pros:
My binder cons:
Colab pros:
Colab cons:
All above statements may be incorrect/not updated, so we'd better investigate if this is the case
Add google colab support/links (without dropping My Binder). Exact implementation to be found. Not clear at this time how to integrate this with Mitiq's docs.
This readme could contain useful links to copy a basic Colab implementation.
Pinging @nickdgardner and @Misty-W who also participated to the discussion in the Mitiq community call.
Just brainstorming some potentially useful models for how to support Colab (if we decide to):
•Peter Norvig's pytudes (markdown on github, very nice interface allowing you to run the notebook on Colab, DeepNote MyBinder, SageMaker Studio Lab; and to view the notebook on NBViewer):
https://github.com/norvig/pytudes#index-of-jupyter-ipython-notebooks
•The notebooks for this online intro data science textbook (made in Jupyter Book):
https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/README.html#the-notebooks
Thanks @nickdgardner!
Another possible reference:
• Notebooks accompanying Kevin Murphy's "Probabilistic Machine Learning" books (with a helpful intro to colab):

@nathanshammah can you comment on where you'd like to see google colab used? We don't have any binder links on the examples pages, which is what I originally thought you were referring to when reading this issue.
@nathanshammah @Misty-W @natestemen @andreamari Here's my attempt at making a colab version of the example I have been working on (qiskit adaptation of this)
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BQRT_TxbZ7HiYt_fF0HFJ8yz5U2c6JBL?usp=sharing
I think this should work for anyone with a google account. The only difference between the colab version of the notebook compared to the myst version is that I added the code below for installing the necessary libraries that don't already come with the default colab environment (in this case, mitiq and qiskit).
Follow up in #1820.
