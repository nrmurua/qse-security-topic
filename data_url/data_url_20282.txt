The filter file VisualStudio\oqs\oqs.vcxproj.filters contains data that has been auto-generated by a script (scripts/copy_from_pqclean/copy_from_pqclean.py , see PR #484 for background), however the filters don't appear to work when opening the Visual Studio solution.
Investigate the issue; fix the script.
