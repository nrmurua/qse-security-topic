I was trying to call the following code on kernel and self._ttls is a list of TTLInOut instances.
with the code above, the ttls show up on scope rather sequentially instead of parallel as intended. Using the code below instead does trigger out three ttl pulses in parallel.
Tested on windows host with artiq3.6 nist-qc2
Thanks

The ARTIQ timeline with statements are more or less implemented on a syntactic level. with parallel resets the timeline cursor before each statement in its body â€“ but for is one statement (the body doesn't matter), so the parallel block is effectively trivial.
You might want to write your example as
or
instead.
Thanks David. Your suggestion works.
