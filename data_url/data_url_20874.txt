We discussed that we to have static values in the META.yml so that end users do not have to parse C defines from api.h, as @thomwiggers had to do for his Rust bindings. It may make sense to do that as part of our test suite, though, to ensure that these numbers are actually correct; would have prevented the difference between d39d7c6 and cc9e11f.
Probably easiest to write a simple C program that outputs the lengths, and then parse that in Python code.
