If we don't enforce compilation, then users get an all-to-all connectivity 26-qubit QVM, regardless of what they provide to get_qc. We might want to consider just adding "qvm" as an accepted string which corresponds this unrestricted case.
Update: it looks like the compiler does try to enforce the number of qubits, so it’s not meaningless. However, the QC doesn’t force you to compile, like the “9q-square-qvm”, so maybe we should change that.
