We had issues getting quilc and the qvm to run on Travis for NISQAI -- is this the current issue? If so,
https://github.com/rmlarose/nisqai-dev/blob/dev/.travis.yml
may be of assistance. I forget the actual fix because we kept fudging things until it finally worked.
Yep I remember emailing with you about that. That's the way I planned to get it to work, but for some reason it wasn't finding the mapped port from the docker images. Since I couldn't find an interactive more for github actions build system I'm still not sure how to best debug. Let me know if you find one.
An alternative fix could be just to switch to Travis or semaphore...
For the time being, adding some sort of skipif in pytest based on the availability of the QVM would be an option?
I am starting to like Github Actions, see #123, and I think that it may be even more flexible than Travis. I am quite ignorant of docker stuff, besides the theory, but I think I'll look in ways to fix this.
