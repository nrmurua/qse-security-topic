Currently base_gate is an optional parameter for ControlledGate. This was orginally due to base_gate referring to the base gate class in which case it would not be very useful information for composite gates of Gate class. Now that base_gate is an instance it makes sense to require ControlledGate to have a base_gate which is not None.
I'm going to close this as stale now; it doesn't seem to have garnered any discussion at the time, and it's not clear if it's caused us any pain to maintain the base_gate=None path.  Feel free to re-open if there's more to discuss, though.
