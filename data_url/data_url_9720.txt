Application
Enable easy construction of binary indicator variables with values set by other problem variables; for example, True when an integer variable is above a threshold
Proposed Solution

Additional Context
See example in https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/examples/hybrid_cqm_stock_selling.html
Another use case is to use an indicator to enforce only one of the constraints.
