The following should not work because it does not fit on the corresponding real device:
This is essentially a corollary of Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1702
Run above
The fake backends should behave in a similar manner to the real system from which they are derived.  As such, sending circuits wider than num_qubits should raise an error.
No response
I guess we can do local validation of the input circuit and error in the fake backend. Right now backend.run() for all the fake backends just pass the input circuit directly to aer with the noise model set
