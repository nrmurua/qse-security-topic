make test fails locally, possibly due to the configuration of hubs in the Qconfig.
This has not been an issue with travis and submitted PRs.
python -m unittest -v test.python.test_api_ibmq.TestApiHub
It seems the original tests fell out of sync with the current hubs implementation, and might fail under specific circumstances - I'll look into it!
