Branched off from #4923
map_operations primitives provide a way for users to specify custom lambda's that should operate on each individual operation. The proposal is to provide a run_inside_classically_controlled_operations keyword argument so that map_operations apply the map_func recursively to gates wrapped inside a CCO and classically controls the resulting mapped operations,
Adding such a flag to other transformers/transformer primitives, which can potentially be non-local, like merge_operations is more tricky. One approach could be to wrap the gates inside a classically controlled operation in a classically controlled circuit operation and then do a recursive transformation on the wrapped circuit.
This issue is to collect evidence of use cases where we need to apply transformations on gates inside CCO's and then decide on an approach.
