Bytecode generation in SBCL looks something like this:
and (after #210) compiled circuit fabrication in quilc looks something like this:
quilc could benefit from adopting the macro inst, which stows an instruction to be eventually output at the termination of the bytecode generation routine, rather than relying on the compiler author to manually manipulate the list of instructions being returned.
@stylewarning brought this up here, where he also provided an example implementation: #210 (comment) . Overall, I think this is a great idea, but I think that the exact implementation that we adopt should...
Before I get around to working on this issue, I'd like to solicit other advice about how to make this look its prettiest.
I haven't actually solicited any further advice, but I feel much more confident that I know what I'd like it to look like. Gonna self-assign.
