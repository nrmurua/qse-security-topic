commit 2207887
the "FAILING" icon on the master branch is related to arroseur being down and a cron job launched 3 days ago. I deactivated cron jobs (since arroseur is frequently down and thus wrongly indicates a broken master branch). So the "unittests broken" only concerns the development branch, of course.
