Description
Horizontal qubits are internally coupled to a vertical qubits according to the formula

which can produce a negative  value of z for the top-left Pegasus cell; for example, qubit 0: (0, 0, 0, 0) --> (1, 0, 8, -1).
Applications that scan through qubits to find coupled qubits might use that and get a wrong node:
To Reproduce
Use the formula above to find qubits internally coupled to node 0 on a Pegasus chip.
Expected behavior
An error for coordinates that are out of range 0<=u<2, w, z => 0, 0<=k<12.
Environment:
Additional context
I expect other of the coordinate transformation utilities need input checks too.
I respect the desire for rigour, but disagree with this from a design perspective.  The goal of these functions is to provide a very fast translation between coordinate systems.  Introducing this sort of checking will significantly slow down the translation process (by a factor of 2 according to a test I just ran in py3.6), which I'm uncomfortable with.
So I'm hearing that we'll implement *_s safe functions for all of these? :-)
