Please can you update https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-master/drtio.html?highlight=drtio and https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-master/installing.html to include some basic info about switching, point people to artiq_route etc.
(Should this also at least mention SED?)
Documentation in artiq_route could be a bit clearer.
no special gateware/firwmare configuration is required, since all satellites are now DRTIO repeaters by default
NB route 0 0 does need to be explicitly programmed otherwise local RTIO channels aren't available
if no routing table is programmed a default one is adopted
