@PetarJurcevic try updating your Python version to 3.7+. Doing so may give you a more meaningful error. See more details here:
My guess is that you're running out of memory. Try watching the memory usage (e.g. using htop) before the code crashes.
@PetarJurcevic could you please try again on a recent Python version (e.g. 3.9 or 3.10)? concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor should be much more robust to this family of issues.
If it's still there, please provide a reproducible code snippet to allow us to investigate the cause of the problem.
