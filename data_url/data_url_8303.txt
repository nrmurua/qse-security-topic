I had tried many times to install the anaconda3.5 3.6 and 3.7, for installing qutip 4.4.0or4.4.1. But when I verifying the Installation, some similar errors always occur, as indicated below

ps: I have install vs2015 and option for c++ compiler
in addition, there are some installation information as below

the red underline has indicated some problem, is it matter?
who can give some advice for dealing with it?
Thanks a lot
4.4.1 should correct this bug.
Could you try reinstalling.
actually, I had installed the 4.4.1 firstly, but it had always a similar problem. have you had other advice?
Hi @saiyagami , your errors seem to be centered around OpenMP and parallelization stuff. It seems from the red underlined error that you do not have OpenMP installed, which shouldn't be the case since it is bundled with the Visual C/C++ compiler by default.
I'd recommend you try the following, in this order:
Hi @tehruhn, Openmp is not needed to run Qutip in parrallel. We are using the module multiprocessing.
The 4.4.0 error is an error on my part. The 4.4.1 error seems to comes from temp files being erased too quickly for windows version of multiprocessing.
multiprocessing does not use shared memory and reload all libraries from the files. string based coefficient are written to file as importable libraries and imported at runtime. In 4.4.1 once imported the file is immediately erased. Work file on linux, but I believe this is the cause of the error on windows. My PR #1082 keep the files until the object using it is no longer used, I am hoping this solve the problem.
Should by closed by #1082. Reopen if necessary.
