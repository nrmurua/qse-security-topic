It could be nice to highlight also graphically the contents of the documentation and/or tutorials, using sphinx-gallery. This could even be added to the website, as it is the case for https://scikit-learn.org, I think.
This has been partly implemented by @BoxiLi, with regards to the qip package, see here. It would be great to build upon Boxi's work and present the results also for the rest of the docs. So I'll keep this open.
