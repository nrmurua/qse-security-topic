Although the official QASM spec does not say much about the ancilla, the staq does produce the code that requires ancilla. Consequently, as you know, the code cannot be run by the qpp QEngine.
Would it be nice for the qpp to support the ancilla?
How do you think of the subject?
Thanks.
Well, after reading your staq paper again, I have much better understanding of the subject now. I think the ancilla management of the staq is reasonable, thus close the issue.
