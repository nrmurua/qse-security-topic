Hi,
I may have missed something but cannot find references to the proper way to serialize Qobj objects. We can pickle them, I think, but it is not always the most practical way to deal with them.
Typically, a json.dumps call on a Qobj object fails due to the fact that Numpy array are not JSON-serializable.
It may be useful to have some methods to easily import / export Qobj objects (that would ideally work even if the user is to deal with list or dicts of Qobj in a similar manner), or add some documentation about the proper way to do it if it is already doable.
We do have the qsave and qload functions in the fileio module.
Thanks, I missed this one. Looks perfect!
