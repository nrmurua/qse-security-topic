I'm profiling some of the XEB code using cirq.ZerosSampler() to see what sort of Cirq overhead we're incurring. Turns out ~24 seconds in a given sampling run is spent in cirq.Result.data, namely looping through each repetition to convert bitstrings to integers.
removes the bottleneck
#5153 should close this.
