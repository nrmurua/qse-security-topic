Unbeknownst to us, several PyQt5-only code still lurks in the codebase. We must find and port these because often they'll silently fail and screw up the system is unexpected ways.
Example:
This code looks fine and runs with PySide2 with no errors.
But!
initialFilter is NOT a PySide2 argument and thus is ignored. Meaning, getOpenFileName  will run as if initialFilter wasn't given as an argument and thus it won't filter anything.
In PySide2 the equivalent argument is. selectedFilter . So we have to correct the code
selectedFilter='*.metal' then it will filter.
This is a sneaky problem though because nothing crashes and there is not indication in the code that this is an invalid argument. Sometimes PyLance will catch some things but not always.
teamwork.
Yay!
