MacOS Catalina 10.15.7, Xcode-12.4. Current master.
Strange to get a -10 return code here. Does this happen reliably on your system? What happens if you run ./build/test/test_kem HQC-128 directly?

It happened reliably on two different systems (running the same software).
What happens if you run ./build/tests/test_kem HQC-128 directly?
And here's an excerpt from the crash report:
I do recall that the later Mac Xcode had more stringent treatment of the stack alignment, and liboqs is notorious for playing with pointer alignments :-(
Still, out of all the included implementations, HQC is the only one that barfed.
Upstream is aware of the issue and hopefully it will be fixed soon PQClean/PQClean#375.
Sorry, #954 doesn't (completely) fix this problem - the HQC-related tests fail. I tested with Macports Clang-11, and with Xcode-12.4 Clang:
Running test standalone - it crashes.
