Idea gleaned from http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/llvm-dev/2017-April/112026.html.
@sbourdeauducq If this is for contract, then #723 should also be.
LLVM performance doesn't currently seem to be the limit in my experiment: #1380
(NB: This was not to say that optimising the pass pipeline, whether for speed or code quality, isn't something we should keep in mind!)
The pass pipeline needs to be reevaluated again for today's LLVM, since it's been almost three years.
