from dwave.system.composites import EmbeddingComposite

sampler = EmbeddingComposite(DWaveSampler(profile='prod', solver='DW_2000Q_1'))
response = sampler.sample_ising({0: -1, 1: 1}, {})

response = sampler.sample_qubo({(0, 0): -1, (4, 4): -1, (0, 4): 2})

The problem happens when using any of the embedding methods (e.g., sampler = TilingComposite(DWaveSampler(...)
These problem status images are from the lowest level Sampler (in this case the QPU).
It is not in general true that the problem type that is passed to the outermost dimod.Composite (in this case EmbeddingComposite or TilingComposite) will be the same as is passed to the bottom sampler. However, these two problem classes are equivalent.
