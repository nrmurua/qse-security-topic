When factorizing the S gate with SolovayKitaev(), the output gives $T^2$ but not a single S gate. I know it's mathematically correct, but when I try to define the basis_gates to only include S gate but not T gate, the result is still $T^2$. Same goes the Sdg gate.


The expected output should be a single S or Sdg gate when the basis_gate set is defined to include them.

You defined a basis set for transpile, but not for the subsequent pass of SolovayKitaev. It's therefore going to resynthesise into its default gate set, which is $H$, $T$ and $T^\dagger$, so the output you're seeing is expected.  You'd need to specify the basic_approximations argument to that if you want to use a different basis in the SK decomposition.

Thank you! Just a follow-up question, there's an error when I try to add SdgGate to the basis gate, while it works fine for SGate. Any reason why SdgGate fails to be included as basis?

Off the top of my head, that feels like it might be a bug, but @Cryoris is much more familiar with the code than I am, so I'll pass it to him.
Yep, that's indeed a bug! See #9635 for a fix.
