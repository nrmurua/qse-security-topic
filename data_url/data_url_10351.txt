Right now, solvers are ordered by solver ID (lexicographical sort). This is not that significant for get_solvers which returns a list that can be easily sorted according to a preferred key, but it's significant  in get_solver - which returns the first solver.
Proposal: expose order_by kwarg in those methods that would define the sort key - as string or callable. String would be solver property name.
Closed with #287.
