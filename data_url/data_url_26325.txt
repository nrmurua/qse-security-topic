Hi,
I am trying to use CP2K from apt-get (ubuntu 22.04 and 23.04, version 2023.1-2 and 9.1-2) within a container (docker for building, singularity for running). Unfortunately, I get some random crashes (happens roughly once every 200-300 runs). I have no experience with CP2K and uses it only for some benchmarking, so I might be doing something stupid.
Here is the error:
Here is my dockerfile:
This is how I run CP2K. I have 128 cores on the machine (2x AMD EPYC 7742), so a process crashes every 2-3 runs:
Here is the input file:
Thanks for your help and time.
The programs are being killed (Program received signal SIGABRT).  So, perhaps they are exceeding the memory limit that you set for your containers?
When using MPI with Docker it's also always a good idea to increase the shared memory via --shm-size=1g.
And generally, when running with many threads one usually has to raise the stack size via ulimit -s unlimited and export OMP_STACKSIZE=64m.
I checked a few things and it does not look like a thread issue or a memory limit. Anyway, I can do my benchmarks even with this bug. Feel free to close this issue.
Best,
