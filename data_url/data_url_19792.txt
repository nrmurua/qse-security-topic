If I do a full cal and get a 32x32 A-matrix for a 5-qubit device, I would expect that I can use this for mitigating any experiment on this device. However, currently this only works when there are exactly 5 readouts. Would be nice to be able to apply it to say a 3-qubit readout as well. Right now, I would have to repeat some cals and get a 8x8 A-matrix.
Should be easy to do, but I'll wait until #144 is merged.
In the meantime you can run a circuit just adding measurements on the unused qubits and it will work (without needing to update the cals).
#182
