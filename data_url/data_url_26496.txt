All Intel regression tester are failing after the last DBM update. Runs are hanging as soon as multiple MPI tasks AND OpenMP threads are involved. The error can be reproduced by running the dbt_tas_unittest.
@mkrack, can you confirm that the extra brackets from e5f6aab fix the problem?
@oschuett yes, e5f6aab seems to fix the problem with dbt_tas_unittest.
