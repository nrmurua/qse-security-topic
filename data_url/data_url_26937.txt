Dear Quantum team,
I'm new with quantum, so I have some questions with your quantum solution for classification:
So there is no need for specialized hardware in order to utilize quantum. However is seems like there is a misconception about what this project aims to do. quantum does not implement quantum encryption, which is a highly experimental and complex type of cryptography. The encryption the this project offers is based on AES and GCM, which are "standard" cryptographic processes.
The technology referenced in the website included in your question, is far beyond the scope of what this project quantum intends to offer and implement. However that is not to say that quantum can not offer you completely secure communication over the WAN. Secure communication is exactly what quantum offers, and does so while being able to run on standard commodity hardware.
As for using this project in production, it is already being used in a production context. If there is anything we can do to help implement this system in your production environment, do not hesitate to ask!
Thanks for your reply
