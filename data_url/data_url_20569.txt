Hello,
The OpenSSL project team would like to announce the forthcoming
release of OpenSSL versions 3.0.5 and 1.1.1q.
These releases will be made available on Tuesday 5th July 2022
between 1300-1700 UTC.
These are a security-fix releases. The highest severity issue
fixed in 3.0.5 release is High, in 1.1.1q release Moderate:
https://www.openssl.org/policies/secpolicy.html
One of the issues fixed in the 3.0.5 release is the CVE-2022-2274 (Bug
in RSA implementation for AVX512IFMA capable CPUs) which is already
public:
https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2274
A workaround for the issue is to set the environment variable
OPENSSL_ia32cap to disable the AVX512IFMA based implementation:
export OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000
Yours
The OpenSSL Project Team
Resolved by #377
