Race condition happens in the QG tutorial and sometimes elsewhere.  I suspect this is due to logic in the file covalent_dispatcher/app/core/update_workflow.py not properly calling the results service to update the status of a completed task.  Currently we use send_result_object_to_result_service everywhere, which calls the service's POST method, but we should also be using send_task_update_to_result_service which does a read/modify/write operation directly in the results service.
