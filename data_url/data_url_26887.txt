A related problem is that the Berry phase dipole only works with
equal occupation for all states (same for OT). This means the
smearing option is not possible (metals!), but simple diagonalization
schemes without smearing should work.
Periodic Efield needs wavefunction gradients and direct optimization. This is only possible with OT.
This is now tested in the input (commit 9f65b72)
