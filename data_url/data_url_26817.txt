the --html-manual obviously uses cp2k_runs.F while https://manual.cp2k.org seems to use the XSL:

I think we should simply remove the --html-manual option.
--html-manual was more or less superseded by --xml. There is clearly a redundancy for some time now. --xml is more lean and versatile. HTML pages generated via Fortran WRITE statements are certainly not a good solution. I agree with @oschuett , we should get rid of --html-manual if possible.
there we go
