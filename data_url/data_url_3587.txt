I was experimenting with adding a fencing Pragma, and found it useful for pragmas to allow qubitplaceholders in their args. For most use cases this is probably moot, since probably 99% of pragmas written in pyquil end up being parsed by our compiler, but if people are writing their own backend for interpreting quil programs, having pragmas accept qubitplaceholders seems like a good idea. e.g. something like the following:
I found this useful in prototyping two qubit randomized benchmarking, where I might want better timing control over when gates and measurements happen, coordinated across two qubits.
sure, why not?
