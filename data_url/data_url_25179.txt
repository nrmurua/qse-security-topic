When running covalent start, I am getting
Run pip install covalent==0.230.0.rc0 and then covalent start
Covalent server should start.
Add boto3 to requirements.txt or modify the import statement here.
@kessler-frost I assume this was resolved?
@Andrew-S-Rosen , if not this should be resolved soon :D
Looks like this was solved in #1866.
