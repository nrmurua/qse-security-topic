The qutip.fortran module seems to be built and installed in the TravisCI environment, but for some reason loading it after install fails, so the tests are skipped.
See for example the build log at https://travis-ci.org/qutip/qutip/jobs/19551778
As discussed earlier, we will move the mcf90 solver into its own module with a separate installer
