Any reason why cirq is not using a conditional dependency for visualization? e.g allow using pip install cirq[matplotlib] to enable matplotlib visualization. This can be quite annoying on servers.
I think it is related to #1269
I think visualization is going to be a core feature, so it doesn't make sense to move this into an optional dependency. Is there a way to have a variant that omits the visualization instead?
I don't think such a variant exists that excludes packages.
I think there exists a workaround which is to do your work in a virtual environment or container where you have better control over your defaults and don't use system defaults.
I'm going to close this as we don't currently have a plan to make a minimal dependency version of Cirq.
