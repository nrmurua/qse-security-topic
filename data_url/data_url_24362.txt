Breaking up issue #175 into smaller issues.
Allow user to scan a default_option in a QComponent and obtain the capacitance matrix for each scan. Do gui.rebuild() for each scan entry.  Also connect to Ansys, populate with geometries, get capacitance matrix, delete geometries.  Loop through for each scan.
The user can make calculations based on scan.
