@gadial showed me that test_zz failed for him with:
RuntimeError: Optimal parameters not found: The maximum number of function evaluations is exceeded.
It happened when Gadi submitted a pull request, where the change did not affect test_zz.
The tests in test_characterization.py verify that the following flow runs: circuits generation - backend execution - fitting. The goal is to identify cases where the interface of one of these three components changes, requiring updates in the other components. The error of exceeding the maximum number of evaluations has to be ignored.
Three things, each can be done independently from the others:
#205 addresses some of the errors that have been happening. In general, these are deterministic errors (unitary errors) so I'm not sure why they are failing the tests.
#209 addresses some of the measurement tests that were failing. I removed the loop that didn't seem to add to the robustness of the test but was re-running the test 20 times.
