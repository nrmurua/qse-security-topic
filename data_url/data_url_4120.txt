Hi
when I run python .\setup.py install   from 0.9 branch it finishes with:
Using /home//anaconda3/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mpmath-1.2.1-py3.10.egg
Finished processing dependencies for perceval-quandela==0.7.3.post53
but isn't it supposed to be 0.9.0?
Also in the documentation , the HTML title in the head tag of the doc says 0.7.3, which is misleading and may lead users to believe they are not browsing the correct up-to-date documentation.
This implies a constant hand-written 0.7.3 is still lurking from the old release and was never updated.
A quick search gives:
https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AQuandela%2FPerceval%200.7.3&type=code
I am not familiar with the mechanism, so I did not do a PR but I am assuming the doc gets its version number from docs/source/conf.py ?  so I guess you want to update that file, the rst file too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ?
Thanks
Hi @mbassiouny33 ,
The Python setup system auto-generates the version number when you call python setup.py install. Getting 0.7.3.postXX means your Perceval version is XX commits after the "v0.7.3" tag in the git graph. Actually, I would expect 0.8.1.postXX as Perceval 0.8.1 is our latest official release, but this means you certainly do not have the "v0.8.1" tag in your local git repository. You may retrieve it by syncing with the main repository and then, pulling tags from the server.
Actually, you won't get a version starting with 0.9.0 today, as this version has not been released yet.
For the docs part, you're right. The version number is hardcoded and we need to change that!
Best wishes,
Eric
