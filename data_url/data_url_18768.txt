Parsing a ClassicalDeclarationStatement with a concatenation operator raises an error (I think the parser is trying to match to a semicolon when it instead encounters the concatenation operator).
Create a new Conda environment
raises error when processing the last line, a ClassicalDeclarationStatement with the concatenation operator ('++')
This is indicated to be possible by the live specification on array slicing (https://openqasm.com/language/types.html#array-slicing), the example used here are the first 3 lines from the code example in the array slicing section.
I think this error is caused by the double plus concatenation operator only be used for aliasExpression statements and not for regular expression statements which can be used in classicalDeclarationStatement.
Based on the discussion in https://openqasm.com/language/types.html#register-concatenation-and-slicing this seems very deliberate, so I don't think the solution is to just add the '++' operator to the 'expression' grammar.
