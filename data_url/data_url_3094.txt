Program unable to display circuit with the following error message: ValueError: Unable to render instruction XY(pi) 21 36 which targets non-adjacent qubits.. This is clearly wrong as the 2 qubits are indeed adjacent to each other on the Aspen-9 topology.
Note that pyquil.latex.display(program) yields the image below but displaying native causes the issue.
