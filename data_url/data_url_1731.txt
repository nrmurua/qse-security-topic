Density matrix simulator's _run_sweep_repeat function unnecessarily starts from zero every time.
Describe the solution you'd like
It should instead break the circuit into two parts: a pre-first-measurement prefix, and post-first-measurement suffix, per qubit (similar to how sparse simulator does for unitary and non-unitary). The first part need only run once. From that, the density matrix can be copied and fed as the initial state of the second part, which will be repeated repetitions times.
Need to double-check exactly what can go into the prefix circuit. Can all channels? Can reset gates? Does noise affect anything? (Don't think so, but maybe weird cases). It would be best if there's some protocol that can be used to break into the prefix/suffix.
[optional] Describe alternatives/workarounds you've considered
We could leave it. It only affects circuits that have non-terminal measurements or subcircuits (circuits with only terminal measurements are already optimized by _run_sweep_sample function). Those may be rare or use other simulators.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
