The QuantumCircuit.extend operation extends an existing circuit with another circuit. If the second circuit contains registers that are not in the first one, the register is added to the first. This operation can therefore add quantum registers.
Before #4766 this was not a problem because the QuantumCircuit.qubits attribute was generated from the registers, but now that the qubits are cached, calling extend causes a mismatch between the registers and qubits, because the qubits attribute is not properly updated.
Before #4766 (1db0340):
After:
Update self.qubits upon calling self.extend.
