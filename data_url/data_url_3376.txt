Attempt to run Qiskit job against qvm, e.g.,  Forest_qasm_simulator, hangs with mulitprocessing error ... the output follows a call qiskit.job.monitor.job_monitor()
Forest support is being added to a Qiskit-based tool. It may be sufficient to insert here the job dictionary from the job as passed to Qiskit

Hi @jwoehr. What leads you to believe this is a pyquil bug? I don't see any pyquil code in that stack trace. On the surface, this seems more likely to be a bug in qiskit / qiskit_forest / qis_job and/or some interaction between the three.
Thanks ... I use Qiskit all the time and don't have any problems .. just started the effort to integrate Forest with my stuff yesterday and somewhat unclear what happens where in the stack. but qiskit_forest could be the problem.
That makes sense. qiskit_forest seems like a good place to start. I recommend opening an issue over there and see what they say. I'll close this for now, but feel free to re-open if it turns out that pyquil is involved somehow or if you have any other questions about getting up and running on the forest stack.
