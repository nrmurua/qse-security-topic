The internal structure of BitCache is very similar to some common data structures. However, it does not implement any of their interfaces, making it incompatible with many of the already existing (and very useful) libraries and functions.
BitCache should be refactored so that it adheres to all relevant and applicable data structures from the collections.abc module.
The alternative consists on relying on duck-typing alone.
This might require changing the signature of some of the methods already defined, nonetheless, as of June 2021, this would not mean a breaking change; since BitCache and its specific implementations are only used internally.
