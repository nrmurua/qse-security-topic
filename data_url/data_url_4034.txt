The reason is that for the default installation instructions the python module pyQisaAs is not installed. To run the tests one can use:
Should we remove the tests involving pyQisaAs, or should be add pyQisaAs to the installation?
@Nader-Khammassi
@peendebak I think it is important to keep the assembler as part of the tests, this is currently the only way to check if the generated output is valid.
Making pyQisaAs part of the installation might however be a bit dependency heavy. As such I suggest we add a skipIf statement upon an import error.
The need to install qisa-as to pass all the tests has now been documented in https://github.com/QE-Lab/OpenQL/blob/develop/README.md#running-the-tests
