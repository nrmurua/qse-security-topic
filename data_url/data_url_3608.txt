In the Intro to Quantum Comupting ( pyquil/docs/source/intro.rst)  it states that the amplitudes of the basis vectors should add to 1 (a+b = 1).  I believe this is not quite correct.  The square root of the sum of their squares should be 1.  (Sqrt(a^2 + b^2)=1), or really just the sum of their squares.  No?
In what I suspect was an attempt to be pedagogical, that section is describing a classical probabilistic bit. That's why it's called a probability and not an amplitude.
You're correct that quantum amplitudes should be normalized according to the l2 norm
Whoops, should have read a little further.
Thanks for raising this issue, though. It's certainly not your fault for getting tripped up with this
