[BUG]
In the Config Customization notebook, ct.lattice decorator is called with an unnecessary parenthesis and get_metadata is called without any arguments.
Either the notebook linked is incorrect or has been updated since I cannot find references of both ct.lattice OR get_metadata. So, this issue can be closed perhaps?
