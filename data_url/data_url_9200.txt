Both arguments mu and cov are required when calling thewalrus.symplectic.passive_transformation, even when only one of them is required. For example, to calculate the transformation for an covariance matrix only, a dummy-mu still needs to be created and passed.
It would be good to be able to optionally pass the mu argument in the above case.
