I am encountering problems of GUI docking location does not restored to the last state upon restarting. I noticed this problem occurs after I undock certain widgets from the main dock before restarting.
The error message I received was: artiq_gui.state: Failed to restore state for object 'DockArea'
Upon multiple restart, sometimes certain widgets are missing, this issues is not repeatable upon multiple restart.
Can you send a artiq_gui.pyon that exhibits the problem?
See also: pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph#204 - but ARTIQ should not run into this bug.
I encounter the same problem frequently. Here's an example.
Should not be a problem anymore with QDockWidget.
