This is really weird; the libgflags.so file is clearly present in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu and CMake should know how to look for it there.
Out of curiosity what is the version of gflags that you have currently installed ?
(dpkg -l | grep gflags)
Ok, found the issue. I will submit a fix in a bit.
quantum@ubuntu-157:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu$ dpkg -l | grep gflags
ii  libgflags-dev                          2.2.1-1                           amd64        commandline flags module for C++ (development files)
ii  libgflags2.2                           2.2.1-1                           amd64        commandline flags module for C++ (shared library)

same issue at ubuntu20.04
I will need to look into this in more details to better understand what the issue is here with Ubuntu 20.04.
