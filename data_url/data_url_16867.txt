Scaling parameter of pulse visualizer should be able to be independently applied to each pulse channel. Usually pi pulses or pi/2 pulses have small amplitudes, while pulses on control channels, e.g. CR pulses, have larger amplitudes. Independent scaling is convenient for visualizing those pulses simultaneously.
