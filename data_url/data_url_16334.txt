blocks #5105
The faulty qubit tests fail in #5105 because the internal routines do not modify the coupling map and properties in a consistent manner.  For example using the FakeOurenseFaultyCX01 from the test suite, one gets a modified coupling map (from _parse_coupling_map) of the form:
but a modified properties (from _parse_backend_properties) that yields gates with the edges.
These two are obviously not self-consistent.
I tend to agree that defective qubits/gates should expose a sub-coupling map. If so, there are two possibilities here:
I think option one is the way to go, and the way it currently works as far as I can tell. It just seems the gates modifications are not in line with the ones to the coupling map. Perhaps not being renumbered correctly?
