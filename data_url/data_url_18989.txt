Now that we have some foundational testing framework in place, we need to augment it to better catch edge cases as well as prevent regressions or new errors popping up when changes are made in related sections of the code. One way of making the test suite broader and more robust is Property Based Testing - testing that relies on properties of the function as opposed to example test cases.
Hypothesis is a property based testing framework for Python that also works with pytest. The framework calls the test function thousands of times with generated data, specified loosely by types and bounds, and ensures the properties weâ€™ve defined hold true. If an assertion fails, Hypothesis will keep searching to find the minimal example required to violate the assumptions and show it to us.
Sit and think about every possible edge case and hope to God that you didn't miss any of them.
