On Qiskit 0.19.6, this tutorial raises the following exception:
QiskitError: 'channel is not completely-positive'
I'm also experiencing this issue, are there any updates? The error is generated when I try to obtain the process fidelity (but not the state fidelity) from the tomography data
this issue was handled in #1026
This tutorial no longer exists in this repo -- and sounds like it was fixed by #1026
