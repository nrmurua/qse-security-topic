As agreed to by @ajavadia and @jaygambetta, all the circuit drawings in the docs should use MPL drawer.  This would also prevent issues like #4371.
MPL drawer is not been tested and it's very hard to move forward with the amount of pending PR affecting it. We need to to prioritize testing on MPL asap.
Could I work on this issue?
Sure. Make sure you check the results with tox -edocs
There are three options for draw a circuit diagram object using matplotlib:
Do we have any preferred option?
There are situations in the source code where the circuit is not dynamically generated inside the jupyter-execute:: code block but  manually represented. For instance in QuantumCircuit.assign_parameters
Examples:

...
How should them be treated? adding a jupyter-execute:: code block? leave the current representation as it is?
Finally the option is to use circuit.draw('mpl') and go through jupyter as much as possible
Following offline discussion, I'm going to close this. The consensus was that inline text visualizations in docstrings are valuable to both developers looking at the source and to users looking at help or docstrings in their IDE or jupyter (in addition to being viewable on qiskit.org) and removing them would make their contents harder in general to access.
