Description of the issue
#5991 updates proper_repr for numpy types. As a result, all repr files should be regenerated using the new proper_repr methods.  This issue is to unblock the PR and track the changes to .repr files independently.
See #5991 (comment) for more details.
@tanujkhattar I'd like to take up this issue if no one is assigned to it.
