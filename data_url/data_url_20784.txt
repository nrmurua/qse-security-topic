While updating PQClean inside of rustpq/pqcrypto I stumbled upon a possible bug in the compute_syndromes() function of reed_solomon.c.
I tried to run the tests with cargo test, but it failed for the AVX2 implementation of HQC-RMRS-256 with a Segmentation fault.
Please see attached image:

Please let me know, if you need further information.
That looks like an alignment issue...
Yeah, that's a super-illegal cast.
