If I try to run my VQE code for long, it shows the following error. It runs properly for but fails if it runs for large number of iterations. The problem is faced when I used qc = "Aspen-8-noisy-qvm". It works fine when if I use qc = "2q-qvm" or similar names.
The server has failed to return a proper response.
Hm. That's frustrating! Can you provide a sample script that will trigger the issue?
You may try this- it works sometimes, it doesn't as well!
