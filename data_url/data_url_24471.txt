The test builds that run to validate pull requests use an installation command (pip install -r requirements.txt) which is different from the installation command in the README.md file (pip install -e .), which is what end users would use.
There are 2 problems with this:
It there a reason to have 2 different install methods?
For example, issue #616  was not caught in the test build for pull request "OP-61 Improve qtt installation." (to solve issue #613 ). In that particular case, the user install method does not include the PyQt5 dependency (in setup.py), whereas the test build install method does include it (in requirements.txt).
Yes, I completely agree.
This was in the past not possible since the PiPy version of qcodes was not updated for a long time. It meant we had to install the package directly from github, which is only possible using the requirements.txt. The same holds for qilib, which is being resolved in this sprint (DEM-790) by the SE-team.
I see. So in that case I suggest we change the README.md to use
pip install -r requirements.txt -e .
as @peendebak had already suggested in issue #611 .
We still have the duplicate dependencies list in setup.py though. Not sure if we can remove all the dependencies there, but that's lower priority.
The only problem with the pip install -r requirements.txt -e . solution is that once we release on PyPi the installation does not work anymore, since you cannot use any requirements.txt when you install directly from PyPi.
I hope that once the SE-Team sprint is done, we have qilib on PyPi. Then we can move all dependencies to the setup.py and only have a requirements.txt or developement_requirements.txt for building the sphinx documentation.
If this update from the SE-Team takes to long, we should go with your suggestion.
qilib is on pypi, we use the pip install now
