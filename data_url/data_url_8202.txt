Describe the bug
For a unitary matrix, U:
UU^{\dagger} = I or U^{\dagger}U = I
This does not quite happen with QuTiP's rand_unitary
To Reproduce
The terminal output is not an identity matrix.
I think this is because it is generating two different unitaries in this case. What you (probably) want is:
This gives me the expected result locally!
Oops, that's right. Closing this
