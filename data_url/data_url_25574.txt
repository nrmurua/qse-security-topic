From discussion: #710
In the case of the fargate executor, I followed these steps:
Configured aws credentials by copying the secret_access_key, access_key_id, and session_token generated for my profile into the ~/.aws/credentials file.  I also set the  AWS environment variables to make sure that the right variables were pulled in the event that some variables were not properly set in the ~/.aws/credentials file.
I ran some commands to verify cli access to AWS resources, especially those required by the fargate plugin, e.g,
aws ecs describe-clusters â€”cluster covalent-fargate-cluster to inspect the fargate-cluster
I updated the covalent.conf file with entries for the fargate plugin
I tried to execute an electron in the workflow below, but the task execution failed with exit code - 1. The exception was raised by poll_ecs_task() in fargate.py.


@cjao's comments:
In _format_exec_script() (https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent-fargate-plugin/blob/1751ac1dc1dd3ef3856e4de5f74075b9bd689140/covalent_fargate_plugin/fargate.py#L282), there is a string representation of the args and kwargs passed to the function which can't possibly work for non-json type inputs
@AlejandroEsquivel can this be closed?
