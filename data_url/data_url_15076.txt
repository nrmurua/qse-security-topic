Not sure if this is the right place for a feature request on the qam3-runner program.
To make is more useful and more like the backend.run method, the user needs to be able to add metadata to the job and ideally each submitted program.
Perhaps a simple metadata:dict optional key arg to the qam3-runner would be ok.
The qasm3-runner program doesn't live anyway on public GitHub - it's an IBM-internal object.  I guess the closest thing to an owner that program has is the dynamic-circuits team (on internal slack) - maybe best ask them what the best course of action is.
I'll close this issue from Terra because there's nothing we can do about it here, at least.
Metadata may be attached to the circuits object (circuit.metadata), and this will be stored in the result header. This is for backward compatibility with qiskit-experiments. In general, it is not a good idea to use the job result as a database and you should store this information separately and associate it in analysis with job results..
