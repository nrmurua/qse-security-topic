Writing a 5Q circuit for use on FakeOurenseFaultyCX01 from the test suite yields the following exception upon transpilation:
However querying the backend directly gives backend.num_qubits=5 and the coupling_map:
Try running a 5Q circuit on FakeOurenseFaultyCX01 and query the backend properties directly.
I would expect a backend that says it is 5 qubits and has a corresponding coupling map not to fail with an error that says only 4 qubits in coupling map.
Would a warning that you are using a backend with temporary disabled qubit/gates help?
Well I think everything should be consistent. I think that requires modifying the backend config and props at runtime, and outside of transpile. I personally think the introduction of the faulty qubit logic is the incorrect way to go, but if going down this path things should be as explicit as possible and self-consistent.
