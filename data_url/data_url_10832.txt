Description
If you pip install dwavebinarycsp and then build penaltymodel-maxgap, running any dwavebinarycsp.stich() fails for scipy==1.4.1:
For example:
Upgrading scipy solves the problem
To Reproduce
As described above
Expected behavior
No errors
Environment:
Additional context
See dwave-examples/factoring-notebook#16
I was unable to reproduce using pip install instead of build penaltymodel from source. I noticed that colab builds from source and managed to reproduce the problem in both unix and Window OSs.
@JoelPasvolsky , were you ever able to resolve this issue? Can we close it?
Looks like this dwavebinarycsp commit updated penaltymodel requirements to use scipy==1.7.3 so that should fix it
