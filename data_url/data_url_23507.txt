Hi all,
I 'm starting to implement a driver for a TTR506 VNA from Tektronix. The *IDN? command returns me:
'TTR506A,Tektronix,B010965,Application version 2.0.1.4ead5a2e Firmware version 066185400'
Which means it is not compliant with #107 (#107), so I suppose it would be problematic.
Do you have any ideas to solve it?
Thank you for your help.
To handle this you will probably need to overwrite get_idn defined here https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/instrument/base.py#L466 to unpack the data format as given in your instrument. I think this will be sufficient but let me know if you have more questions.
Thank you,
I was thinking about that but I was not 100% sure. I'll try it.
