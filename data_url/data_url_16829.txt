It would be nice not to have to build a measurement schedule up every time. It's usually the same thing every time: measure some qubits, or measure all qubits. This requires a backend with pulse enabled.
Measuring only a couple qubits, building the pulses
or measuring all of them, with info from backend defaults
and
Second option:
Whatever API, the method should do something like what the scheduler does: take the default measure command, and remove the extra measurement pulses. Unlike the scheduler, this method can just do a trivial mapping from qubit index to MemorySlot (at least for this issue).
I do not think this should be a part of the Schedule as this is a utility method making assumptions such as the mapping to channels. I would prefer to keep the Schedule class as close as possible to a data structure for a pulse program and am open to providing a builder interface on top of it.
@taalexander okay, sounds good. This suggestion was for keeping the interface close to circuit.measure but I also didn't like depending on the backend. Also, looks like I've opened a duplicate issue, which you and @eggerdj have also made versions of! Good thing Soolu is working on it!
duplicates #3480  and #3572
