In Qibo 0.1.8, for the SymbolicHamiltonian linear algebra functions, is there a need to form the full dense matrix for these functions?
I was testing my notebooks after updating my conda environment (Qibo 0.1.7 -> Qibo 0.1.8), and I found that the calculation of expectation values slowed down by quite a lot, accompanied by this warning:
Digging through hamiltonians.py, it seems that the expectation function inherited from the parent Hamiltonian class calls self.matrix, which forms the dense matrix.
This holds for some of the other linear algebra functions in the SymbolicHamiltonian class as well, e.g. the eigenvalues function returns self.dense.eigenvalues, which brings up my question above: Why the need to form the dense matrix?
As a workaround, I'm currently following the calculate_expectation_state function exactly, which doesn't form the dense matrix:
