Incremental coverage can say that a continue statement is uncovered when it actually is.
cirq/t.py
cirq/t_test.py
This was not fixed because Python's optimizer replaces a jump to a continue with a jump to the top of the loop. See https://bugs.python.org/issue2506. There are two ways of fixing this:
1.Tell Coverage.py to ignore continue
@Strilanc Thoughts?
For now we'll stick with # coverage: ignore annotations. That's far better than a mystery expression to trick the optimizer.
continue is used multiple times.  cirq/circuits/qasm_output.py: line 168 for example. How was this coverage issue fixed?
The mystery continues..
If it's not happening anymore, it may have been fixed upstream from us.
Victory reports not happening anymore.
