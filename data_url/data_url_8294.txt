Hi there! You people have done an incredible work with Qutip, but I still think there are many small settings that could be added probably without much effort;
When saving a Bloch sphere
It would be awesome to have a way to specify the resolution of the png image just like in pyplot. Something like this
Not having this option currently forbids these images to be added to conference posters or HD animations since the resolution is too low.
Is there any quick workaround for this? I really need to know how to do it if there's a way.
I guess this is a more complicated thing for the next Qutip update since it would be good to not just increase the resolution of the saved image but also the number of polygons making the sphere (which I guess would look smoother when zooming in the image).
@nathanshammah I'm looking into this right now.
HI @Titanosaurus , have submitted a PR, you will have your fix when it gets merged. :)
Usage would be as follows:
Wow! Thank you for the quick response @tehruhn
