If #if defined follows immediately after END INTERFACE, make pretty removes part of the interface.
The following code snippet allows to reproduce the issue (placed on the root directory of the git repository):
Adding code between END INTERFACE and #if defined doesn't seem to cause issues:
fprettify --diff FILES does not have any issue with either file.
Yes, I also ran into this. Unfortunately make pretty is in a rather sad state right now. The biggest culprit is probably the cp2k-specific stuff in normalizeFortranFile.py.
Another, less critical, issue is that if #if defined wraps an USE statement, prettification changes the way all USE statements are formatted.
Yeah, it's quite a mess...
Our custom normalizeFortranFile is pretty spaghetti and probably not salvageable.
The spun-off fprettify project has also quieted down after Patrick stopped working on it three years ago.
So my conclusion is that these previous solutions were too ambitious.
I think the best way forward is to write a much simpler formatter (<500 lines)  that focuses on the essentials:
Thanks both for the comments.
It's sad to hear that the fprettify project is no longer very active. I think relying on an external project would have been the best solution here. Code we don't write/own is code we don't have to maintain. And while a simplified formatter might be easier to maintain, it will still be a burden. But if it's the only solution, why not?
I would suggest to have a lightweight version for the precommit. Keep the full current version as a tool for developers.
This is a good compromise, I think. But maybe it would be worth moving normalizeFortranFile outside of the main repo if it's not salvageable and in a "use at your own risk" state?
