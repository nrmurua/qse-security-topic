As brought up by @mtreinish in #9507 (comment) it would be nice to enable the transpilation to CR<Pauli> gates by adding missing equivalences:
[...] one thing we are missing in the equivalence lib (it came up on slack) is targeting a CR basis. I think to fix it we can just define a rules from cx to crx, etc to fix that.
An alternative to the CX -> CR<Pauli> equivalences would be adding the R<2-Paulis> to CR<Pauli>, but here we'd have to check which is more efficient generally.
