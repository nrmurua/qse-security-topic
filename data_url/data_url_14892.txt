There used to be such repository, but now it redirects to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit
The Python package qiskit-terra still points there.
Was qiskit-terra discontinued?
qiskit-finance still depends on qiskit-terra, see here.

The repository Qiskit/qiskit-terra was renamed to Qiskit/qiskit. All the code that used to live in Qiskit/qiskit-terra now lives in Qiskit/qiskit and GitHub handles the redirection.
The Python package qiskit-terra still points there.
Good catch! Fixed in #10719

No qiskit-terra is not discontinued. Qiskit Terra is know renamed as Qiskit. The pip package will continue to be called qiskit-terra, at least for the time being.
