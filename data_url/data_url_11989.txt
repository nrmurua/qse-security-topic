I think the parenthetical at the end of the highlighted sentence above should be changed to "little-endian".
I often mix this up. But, following the sentence, the least significant bit (the little bit) is on the right (at the end).
Also, other online info/docs state that Qiskit uses little-endian:
https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/8244/big-endian-vs-little-endian-in-qiskit
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate.html
You are right. Qiskit uses little endian. Would you mind creating a pull request to correct it?
Please let me know if you are new to making open source contributions and will need some help!
if aeddins doesn't want to deal with this I would love to start getting involved in something.
@aeddins-ibm Would you like to make the PR yourself or would you like @InfamousPlatypus to do that? Please let us know!
Please go ahead and make the PR @InfamousPlatypus . Thanks!
Is this issue resolved? The issue arose due to a discrepancy between the little-endian representation and the big-endian notation specified in the documentation, correct?
LGTM. Belated thanks to @InfamousPlatypus !
