I found that I need to import torch first to use it as backend. Otherwise there will be an import error.
If I first import torch:
Otherwise:
I am not sure about you specific torch release. But for me, I have tested pip-installed torch with cuda support and with only cpu, both are ok to tc.set_backend("pytorch") without firstly import torch
And to enjoy fast speed with tensorcircuit, I strongly recommend to use Jax or TensorFlow backend, and you can also enjoy your familiar pytorch pipeline as well, just with a tc.interfaces.torch_interface wrapper, see an example https://tensorcircuit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/torch_qml.html
Thanks for your reply.
I am not sure about you specific torch release.
I am using torch 1.11.0. More details about my enviroment:
And thanks for your suggestion of using Jax or TensorFlow backend. I will have a try!
