Can you reproduce this on v0.2.2?
.dwrc along these lines,
python3 interpreter,
Thanks for reporting this. We're working on replacing the legacy .dwrc all together. The new version will handle profiles and authentication in a more user-friendly way.
But, FWIW, I can't reproduce this with dwave-micro-client==0.2.2 and Python 3.5.2 on Linux.
@ccoffrin Looks like the last line of that traceback is missing. Is it maybe TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str? That could mean the response you received from API was ill-formed. Pull request #24 adds some checks for that case.
You are correct, I fixed the note above.  I was able to reproduce on os x, python 3.5.  I believe the root of the issue is that no default solver is specified.
Fixed as of #103 as part of #101.
