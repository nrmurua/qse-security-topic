FakeBackendV2.run invokes noise-less simulation if it is called before touching target (more precisely, if it is called before the internal _target object is populated).
Run the following code.
Noisy simulation should be run if qiskit_aer is installed (as like FakeBackend V1).
This line should be replaced with if self.target:
Yep this is an easy bug to fix, @itoko do you want to push a PR making your suggested fix? If not I can do it
Edit: Although looking at the code more clearly I think the intent there is to not attempt to build a noise model if there aren't any noise properties, maybe if self.target and self._props_dict will fix the issue without potentially attempting to build an empty noise model?
