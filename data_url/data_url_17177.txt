Produce the correct measurement result
the results should be {'1': 1024} but BasicAer returns wrong results.
No idea but it is related to the PR #2735 since before this PR, basic aer works correctly.
Furthermore, if all quantum registers are measured, the basic aer works okay. It seems that this issue only happened when only a part of quantum registers are measured.
