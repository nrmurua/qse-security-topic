parameters must be manually bound beforehand or else  noisy simulations cannot be executed.
One of three errors arises, which will be different depending on what you pass as a parameter bind. If binds are List of Dict(Parameter, number), the following error occurs:
Whereas, if one attempts to rectify this with binds as List of Dict(Parameter,array), one gets either
if using np.asarray([number]).  if using np.array(number), one instead gets:
Parameter binds of List of Dict(Parameter,number) should be acceptable as a pass-down.
No clue. The fix to one problem keeps creating a new one. This is potentially related to the fix to #1249.
@mtreinish It looks to be something to do with transpiling to different basis gates, though I'm not sure why this would cause an issue. Here is a more minimal example that avoids the execute function.
