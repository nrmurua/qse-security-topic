Not just when booting from the network. Otherwise PHY is not initialized (net_device.reset_phy) when booting from the flash.
Ah, no, the firmware should rather always initialize the PHY and not rely on the bootloader to do that. We had code to do that but I think I accidentally removed it while refactoring.
