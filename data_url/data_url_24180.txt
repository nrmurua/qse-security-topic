(Marco NOTE: duplicate of #244)
Cannot check the components to render
Open HFSS or Q3D

Add the checkbox
Workaround until the bug is fixed: Switch your Color theme in the Window View dropdown to System default and the checkboxes will display.
See #244
This is interesting

Any help solving this is welcome. After spending quite some time on it in February we had to lower priority of #244 and get on other items.
I tried looking up the issue in the code for some time but could not find anything as of now.
This is probably an issue with the layout QT style file I defined that is loaded. There may be a missing image or the color of the checkbox is not set right. Does anyone else have this issue in dark?
I don't see this issue.  Having Qdarkstyle is in dependencies may have fixed this as part of other work.
