Description of the issue
We currently use tensorflow and tensorflow quantum in our project. Tensorflow uses cirq as backend to simulate the quantum computer. We want to use cirq-rigetti for accessing rigetti devices. However, this is not compatible with tensorflow.
Tensorflow forces numpy 1.19.5, while cirq-rigetti forces the use of pyquil3.0.0 for python >=3.7 which forces numpy>=1.20 (and thus is incompatible)
cirq-rigetti's requirements file suggests pyquil2.28.2 for python < 3.7. pyquil2.28.2 uses numpy 1.19.x and thus this would fit.
However, cirq-rigetti's setup.py file forces python 3.7
How to reproduce the issue
Install tensorflow, tensorflow-quantum, cirq, cirq-rigetti via pip.
Discussed at Cirq sync: this should be addressed in Tensorflow Quantum - please raise an issue there.
