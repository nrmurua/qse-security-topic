When running the HHL algorithm on a test case with a qasm simulator this error is cast
LinAlgError: SVD did not converge in Linear Least Squares
I have tried with multiple matrices and all give the same result. I also get this error when trying to run on the online simulator.
To reproduce this you can take the example from the qiskit textbook and swap in qasm simulator for the state vector one.

From what I have read others have had the qasm simulator to work with HHL so I don't understand what my problem is.
I ran this same code on ubuntu , using WSL, with qiskit version 0.13.0 and Aqua 0.8.1 and there this error did not show up.
Upgrading the Qiskit version solved it.
{'qiskit-terra': '0.16.1',
'qiskit-aer': '0.7.1',
'qiskit-ignis': '0.5.1',
'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.11.1',
'qiskit-aqua': '0.8.1',
'qiskit': '0.23.1'}
