When running Shor method 2 with >17Q, I get the error:
I have not seen the same error with Shor method 1 with max_qubits=25
What target system are you using to run these?
Shors method 2 uses mid-circuit measurement to operate with fewer qubits.  It is encoding something that clearly does not fit.  We might need to modify the encoding or use a larger integer.
I'd like to be help resolve these issues in the benchmarks.
Ah yes, you are correct. I'll take a look into that, and if that cause the error I'll close the issue

It looks like the error is a local python issue and can be easily resolved.
