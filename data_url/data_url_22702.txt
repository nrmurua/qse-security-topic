You can fix this by doing:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libstdc++6
I will add this to the manual.

I rebuilt the llvmlite-artiq package for linux-64 on an Ubuntu 14.04 VM, so the workaround is no longer necessary, I am deleting it from the manual.
Awesome! Thanks.
