The valgrind is currently not supporting Apple Silicon Macs (https://doesitarm.com/formula/valgrind), is there a way around it?
Since (along with AppleClang) gcc and LLVM Clang seem to supported by Apple Silicon, you should get some (if not all) of the checking provided by Valgrind through the compiler sanitizers.
At any rate, I'm closing this since it's not an issue specific to liboqs.
