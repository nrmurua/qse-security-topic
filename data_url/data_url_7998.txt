Hi,
I am studying quantum computers and quantum algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems.
I wonder if I can use qutip to simulate quantum computers and algorithms ?
If yes, what are the main differences between qutip and the pennylane framework ?
Regards
Hi @deb75,
I wonder if I can use qutip to simulate quantum computers and algorithms?
Yes, but only with a small number of qubits (<~12).  You can use the package qutip-qip. The purpose of qutip is to simulate quantum dynamics. So the main focus of qutip-qip at the moment is to simulate the behaviour of the underlying physical system of the quantum computer. In particular when you have noisy hardware. Therefore it is very different from pennylane, which focuses more on high-level applications and algorithms.
For more questions that are not related to bug reports or features, e.g. how to use qutip .... You could post it on our help group https://groups.google.com/g/qutip
Thanks for your answer.
In fact, what i am looking for is precisely to simulate the underlying physical system. All quantum computers are affected by noise which causes qubit decoherence.
I will continue on the google groups
Thanks again
Regards
