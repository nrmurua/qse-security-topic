Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Currently, the ODE solver needs to be fed a time step dt if we want to get real-time measurement results separated by dt
prob = ODEEvolution(reg, t_tot, h; dt=dt, adaptive=false)
The same time step is used for the ODE solver, and the adaptive could not be turned to be true.
Describe the solution you'd like
Could we separated the two different time steps. In other words, users can feed a time step for plotting the results, but the ODE solver can still automatically choose different time steps for precision.
I'll close this in favor of #156 which should resolve this
