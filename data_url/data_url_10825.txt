Current Problem
When no quadratic biases are present in a penaltymodel, return an error that is more comprehensible to the end user. (Note: end user is likely to be calling the penaltymodel from stitch(..) and may not be able to understand the error from so deep in the penaltymodel stack)
Proposed Solution
Catch the case when no quadratics are provided.
