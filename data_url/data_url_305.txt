We seem to be getting a failure when trying to allocate a qreg that has a size defined by an argument:
test-5.cpp in #323
Trying to run the above program outputs:
The QuakeSynth pass should have made the argument a constant inside the kernel, and thus this kernel should JIT compile correctly.
Not a regression
No response
I think that this is due to the same bug in #337 .
@schweitzpgi After 337 is fixed, can you confirm if this also fixes this issue? If not, we'll assign it at that time.
test-5 passes.
