If we run below experiment, i.e. qubit spectroscopy, with the pulse simulator, the simulator doesn't sweep qubit frequency.
This code internally generates multiple copies of schedule, and binds custom frequency pulse.DriveChannel(0): freq to each QobjExperimentalConfig, i.e. qobj.experiments[idx].config. However the parser doesn't check this field and only checks the global experiment configuration qobj.config.

If we provide only single frequency with multiple schedules, this setting is passed to the global configuration qobj.config to reduce data volume of qobj, i.e. copying this dictionary to each experiment configuration is just an overhead.
Frequency initialization protocol should be:
