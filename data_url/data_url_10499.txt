Description
Can't use cmap with embeddings.
The cmap variable should be referenced directly, instead of as a kwarg here:
https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave_networkx/blob/master/dwave_networkx/drawing/qubit_layout.py#L275-L276
It is accessed properly elsewhere in the same file for reference.
To Reproduce
import dwave_networkx as dnx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from minorminer import find_embedding
Q = {(0,1):1,(0,2):-1,(1,2):0.1,(1,3):0.1,(3,5):0.1,(1,5):0.1,(5,6):0.1,(6,7):0.1,(7,8):0.1,(0,8):0.1}
emb = find_embedding(Q, G)
dnx.draw_chimera_embedding(G, emb, ax=ax, cmap='RdBu')
plt.show()
Expected behavior
Should display nodes varying from Red to Blue, but shows random colours instead (i.e. including green, brown, yellow, etc.).
Environment:
Additional context
This is a bit tricky as not a lot of people use this or would rather just display the distinction between chains.
Using a dictionary with chain_color and manually calculating these colours works.
One thing that isn't clear is what happens to non-chain quadratic terms in the fixed case.
Currently they are rendered as black lines.
Doesn't look like edges and chains can be rendered easily at the moment.
