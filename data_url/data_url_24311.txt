fourq_q3d.disconnect_ansys() only works after some analysis has run in Ansys. It does not work right after having connected to Ansys, nor after having added a project or a design to Ansys.
Should work all the time.
Need to purify the meaning of "connect" and "disconnect", so that we can do independently of all the other information related to Ansys. This might require update in pyEPR (or maybe just picking  a different method).
Note: this is important because without a "disconnect" the Ansys session remains hanging, as mentioned in #198
Future renderer using pyaedt addresses this.
