We have a number of pull requests that are all nice fixes and enhancements, however we are delaying merging because of travis test failures. I can't see how any of these pull request can be an underlying cause:
#421
#422
#428
#429
So I will merge all these. We can then investigate what is causing some of the tests to fail under this issue.
At least two tests have been observed to generate unrelated failures:
I haven't seen any others recently (at least, not since resolving #425), but if we observe any, we should add them here so that we can be sure everything works for 3.2.0.
Good plan
Looks like this failed in the current master build
test_sp_eigs.py", line 234, in test_DenseValsOnly
Along with other instances of test_subsys_apply
We have not modified the sp_eigs code in some time. Also, the only error that I have ever seen is subsys_apply.  Taking care of that test would cure most, if not all, of our issues.
The most recent three PR should resolve all error and warnings in the tests. I will merge them all later today unless there any objections
This is fixed.
