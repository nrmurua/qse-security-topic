Currently, only a whole register or single bits can be passed to c_if. It would be helpful if one could do something like this:
qc.x(0).c_if(classical_bits[1:3], 3)
The slice could be handled as a separate register. I don't know if this is even supported by the OpenQASM specification.
An alternative might be to allow chaining of c_if statements. Currently only the last statement is considered, according to my testing. So in this: qc.x(0).c_if(classical_bits[1], 1).c_if(classical_bits[2], 1), only the last condition would be regarded.
We can't do either of these within the OpenQASM 2 specification (the only thing that's allowed is equality comparisons between registers and integer literals), but we're currently in the process of massively expanding our dynamic-circuit support, which will include far more general conditions.  I don't know when exactly we'll have all this support out, but we are working on it.
By the way, the documentation for both InstructionSet.c_if and Instruction.c_if explicitly says it doesn't stack.
Thanks for the reply! That sounds interesting, I'll keep an eye out for it.
I remember reading the docs, but the note must've slipped through the cracks... I am going to close this now.
