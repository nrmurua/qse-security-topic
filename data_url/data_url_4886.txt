A meticulous re-derivation of the two-qubit depolarsing algorithm has revealed there are 5 distinct distributed communication patterns possible during mixTwoQubitDepolarising. Which should be triggered (in a correct implementation) depends on the targeted qubits, the density matrix size, and the number of nodes. QuEST currently assumes two patterns (embarassingly parallel, and half-amps all-to-all groups-of-four); but the three remaining patterns are valid (though rarer) and introduce worthy optimisations to total bandwidth. The domain and nature of these optimisations are complicated, hence this issue will not be revisited until the relevant manuscript is uploaded to arXiv for reference.
