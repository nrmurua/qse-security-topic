It seems like ChemPS2 is failing to build due to an issue with hdf5 when using new nixpkgs (a08d6979dd7c82c4cef0dcc6ac45ab16051c1169) - works fine with the version in the current nix-qchem flake.lock
Yes, the update to nixpkgs 3ad64d9e2d5bf80c877286102355b1625891ae9a took out a few more packages (see #262).
A little background here:
I have a Hydra running, that builds against nixpkgs-unstable to discover, such problems. The flake.lock file is only updated if everything builds. Using flakes should thus always be stable. If you want to use the overlay directly, use ./default.nix (insteads of overlay.nix). It pins nixpkgs to flake.lock.
It is fixed now.
