Calculating mean values is very NISQY. VQE, QAOA e.t.c: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11485
Could you please assign it to me?
These are classical algorithms; why do they belong in Cirq?
These are classical algorithms in the sense that CHP (https://www.scottaaronson.com/chp/) is a classical algorithm that simulates certain types of quantum circuits efficiently on a classical computer. It's in the same vein as the clifford simulator. These algorithms calculate: Given a short depth circuit U and an observable  O, calculate <0|U^+OU|0>. Some structures of this observable can be calculated efficiently with these algorithms (Positive semi definite, close to I, hermitian).
