Description of the issue
During the last release these were some items we thought about with @tanujkhattar to improve:
@MichaelBroughton Do you want to weigh in?  I do not think this is needed before Cirq 1.0, especially if we revamp release process after Cirq 1.0.  I am removing the before 1.0 tag unless you have objections.
