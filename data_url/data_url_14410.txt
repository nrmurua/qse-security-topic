To counter the known issue of barren plateaus/vanishing gradients (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07090-4.pdf), people have been proposing new ansatzes other than hardware efficient ansatz in variational approach or quantum machine learning, with mathematically-proven improved performance.
This feature could be also added to qiskit library, such as Alternating Layered Ansatz, Tensor Product Ansatz, etc (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12537.pdf). These are potential simple tasks to be implemented.
If no one has taken this, I'd love to work on this.
I've already created a small demo of these two ansatzes (Alternating Layered Ansatz and Tensor Product Ansatz), which basically produces circuits that look as follows:
Alternating layered ansatz

Tensor product ansatz

With each block being of the form (size varies):

If this is available and the above looks good as a start, I'll start working on implementing it into Qiskit as soon as possible :)
I think both of these should be easy to construct with the NLocal ansatz. Is that also the one that you used in your code @epelaaez? ðŸ™‚
Hi @Cryoris! Yes, this is easily done with NLocal, as I did in #8518. At the moment I've only done the tensor product ansatz, but the other one should follow the same basics.
