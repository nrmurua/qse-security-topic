The guts of lscheduler-replace-instruction can be used to write a generic lscheduler-append-lschedule function. (For that matter, the rest of lscheduler-replace-instruction probably then forms a generalization of lscheduler-dequeue-instruction.) This was too hard to get right under time pressure, but it's worth revisiting how these methods can be refactored.
