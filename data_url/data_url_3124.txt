_decoherence_noise_model takes in gates: Sequence[Gate], and depends on get_noisy_gate (both functions found in pyquil.noise) to get the ideal matrix and noisy gate identifier of each gate in gates (permalink). However, get_noisy_gate only supports I, RX(+/-pi), RX(+/-pi/2), and CZ right now, thus _decoherence_noise_model returns an error when gates contains an XY gate.
Expected behavior: get_noisy_gate should handle parametric XY gates to return the numerical representation of the gate (permalink) and the noisy gate name. This will in turn fix dependencies from _noise_model_program_header, add_decoherence_noise, decoherence_noise_with_asymmetric_ro and apply_noise_model as well, allowing pyquil users to play around with noise models relevant to the Aspen-8 QPU.
I am using a virtualenv named venv in a local directory, but will hide the path prefix and use PATH in the following error output for privacy reasons:
