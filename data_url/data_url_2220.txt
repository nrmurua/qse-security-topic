Modify cirq.Simulator() so it knows which backend to delegate to when simulating circuits. If there is noise go to DensityMatrixSimulator etc.
Could we also add an optional flag like cirq.Simulator(simulator='density') so the user can decide explicitly?
Eh, I think specifying DensityMatrixSimulator if you want a density matrix simulator is fine. Having it also as an argument to Simulator, and a stringly typed one at that, seems unnecessary.
It's not as simple as defaulting to DensityMatrixSimulator if there is noise. For instance, if the noise is coherent then it's still better to use the wavefunction simulator.
For the reason @kevinsung lists I don't think this is feasible. If we were to put this in Simulator code one would have no way to do the monte carlo pure state simulator.
