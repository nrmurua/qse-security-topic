Hi Mitiq Team,
I was trying to implement ZNE using pennylane  hybrid quantum classical pytorch model with reference to documentation : https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.qnn.TorchLayer.html.
I got error as :
Here is my code:
Here is the colab notebook that I am working on: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r6jWHEuhtLcJyAtzU4Bp7uiG3KIRlgJN?usp=sharing
Thank You.
Hello @brrbaral, thank you for your interest in Mitiq!
If this is a bug report, please provide screenshots and/or minimum viable code to reproduce your issue, so we can do our best to help get it fixed. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can also ask us on the Unitary Fund Discord.
Hi @brrbaral,
conversions problems may be due to gate parameters which are torch tensors instead of floats.
I would suggest, as a first attempt, to import fold_global from pennylane.transforms instead of from Mitiq.
If it doesn't work, this comment may be for a useful workaround:
#1694 (comment)
See comments on #1694 for a previous discussion on a similar problem.
Dear @andreamari Thank you for your response.
It worked after importing  fold_global, poly_extrapolate, richardson_extrapolate and mitigate_with_zne
from pennylane.transforms.
Thank you again.
