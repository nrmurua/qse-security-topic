Thanks Zlatko, I will follow up here with more information
Here is what I had in mind:
I just checked out the README in the docs/ folder.
I could spend some time adding these to the docs as a separate pull request if there is broad interest in doing so.
Excellent, thank you, @nmaterise. Maybe at the next meeting you can present these that you will add?
Zlatko
Sure thing. I will see what I can put together by then. Thanks for organizing today's meeting. I hope can help to improve pyEPR and I am really excited to help with the other issues we started during the meeting.
Thank you, @nmaterise ! Looking forward to it. You can post here if you need help with getting anything set up or feel like you need more direction. @DanielCohenHillel  has also been very active
