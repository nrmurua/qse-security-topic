Add reporting / exporting  of full Hamiltonian Matrix from the EPR and LOM and Z analysis
Can then send this to qutip
or a simulator or to pulse
@nalanzil , is this issue on your plate?
Is this actually related to #699 (data formatting)? or is this some API work for qtip?
And is it that some Hamiltonian data is actually missing, or is it all there and just need to be formatted?
(what is the qtip format?)
Hey @marcolincs does it make sense to wait until the new LOM code (ETA Oct from Yehan?) is finalized before tackling this issue?

I can't tell @nalanzil , I do not understand the request (thus my all-over-the-place question :-) ) Others on the call with me could also not understand well what this issue needs or target
