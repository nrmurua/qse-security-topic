Description
pegasus.clique_emebdding fails to embed a K5 in a K_44 cell.
To Reproduce
returns ValueError: No clique embedding found
finds the embedding.
Expected behavior
Clique embedding should succeed too.
Environment:
Additional context
I believe this is expected behavior. If we were being more verbose, the find_clique_embedding function should be more correctly named find_regular_clique_embedding - embeddings that have all equal chain length. The result is that minorminer, by relaxing the equal chain length requirement, can find embeddings that the clique embedding function cannot.
Additional Context
I recall that in Pegasus, regular might actually mean "nearly equal", but I don't remember the rules. @boothby can comment further.
The "clique embedder" searches for cliques of a very specific structural description, in a Chimera graph.  We exploit that structural description to produce a polynomial-time algorithm which is effective at "solving" an otherwise NP-Hard problem.
The K_5 you're looking for does not fit into that structural description.  In general, I have an unpublished description of a K_{4n+1} into a C_n with nearly-uniform chainlengths -- a similar algorithm exists to find those embeddings, but implementing it is currently a lot of effort compared to the actual payoff (e.g. it is very rare that masks contain few enough defects to yield that embedding).
I would recommend against putting a bunch of effort into testing this code, as it's soon going to be replaced wholesale.
Thanks @boothby and @arcondello. I was not testing, I was naively using: the description does not include the details now explained.
This issue can be used to update the description if the limitations will still apply to the new code.
Thanks!
That's a great description, thank you.
I believe this is resolved.
