Is there any cirq video tutorial ?
I don't know where to ask this questions. If it's wrong I can close this issue.
My problem is: I didn't find any video tutorial for Cirq. I want to learn this framework, but I don't know where to start
If any experts here, What would you suggest/recommend ?
Hi @mertbozkir,
I'm not aware of any video tutorials for Cirq, but the website has a number of text-based tutorials you can work through. I recommend checking out the basic tutorial to get started, then reading through the pages under the "Guide" tab to learn more about each component.
Hope this helps, and welcome to Cirq!
Thank you so much @95-martin-orion. I appreciate it for this resources, but I have already knew them. My learning style is based on Video or images. :))
I will start this cirq website.
There are a few recordings from the Quantum Educators Workshop on https://quantumai.google/education, and a few more videos on the same page.
@rmlarose omg. Thank you Mr. Ryan, I can see now.  That's great opportunity to dive in :)
