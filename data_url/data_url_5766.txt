BUG TEMPLATE 
A circuit containing an inverted isometry produces incorrect results on the Aer statevector backend. The BasicAer "qasm" simulator does produce the expected result.
This script shows the same circuit on two different simulators:
The output on my machine is:
It can be seen, that the Aer statevector simulator always returns 0 when measuring the state after the "multiplexer" gate.
Both simulators produce the same result.
#1508 fixed this issue.
Thank you, I can confirm this fixed it for me.
