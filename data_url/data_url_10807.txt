Description
find_embedding fails for single-variable problems / cycles in source edgelist.
To Reproduce
Additional context
For the failed BQM above, source_edgelist == [('a', 'a')] and target_edgelist is the standard chimera.
I got the similar error too.  The "Unknown exception" really bothers people because I have no clue what is the problem there.
Dr. Wu, are you using a recent version of minorminer?  To my knowledge the "unknown exception" issue has been resolved -- if that's happening in the latest version, please open a new issue and include inputs that cause the problem.
boothby, thanks for the reply. You are right. My minorminer was not updated to the latest version.  I hope in the answer section you can provide a description how the problem was solved. That will save people a lot of time. For example: the problem was addressed by updating minorminer to the latest version 0.1.8. Thanks.
