can you make a docstring describing what form coupling, channel_range, impedance, and bwlimit should have?
And if there's a docstring, the whole first part of this method (and acquire too) could be rewritten:
2
not a big deal, but I much prefer implied continuation from parentheses instead of backslashes
3
success (spelling mistake in our variable)

this pattern:
gets a little tedious. What about something like this instead of _result_handler:
I could even imagine including a kwarg updates=['clock_source', 'sample_rate', 'clock_edge', 'decimation'] that would create the _set_updated() calls that also consistently trail this pattern.
Also, it's maybe a matter of style, but I wouldn't call the unknown error a KeyError because the error itself isn't that the key is missing, that's just the reason you don't have more info to give the user about it. I'd probably call them both RuntimeError
@jenshnielsen, is this issue still relevant?
no, that part of the alazar driver code is different now and follows the _call_dll suggestion.
