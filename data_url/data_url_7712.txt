I'm running quimb to solve a DMRG problem. When I use SLEPC backend, this error appears:
I've checked the installation of quimb and SLEPC and everything seems ok. Can you tell me what is going on?
Looks like a numerical rather than software issue, neither slepc or the fallback script can converge an eigenvector to the tolerance specified. You could try loosening the tolerance or tweaking other settings like the number of lanczos vectors. It might also be something to do with the conditioning of your application. But no easy fixes Iâ€™m afraid!
Is there a way to request the eigensolver to provide its "best guess" of the solution instead of returning an error?
You could try the lobpcg backend, I think it does that by default, just with a warning.
It takes a lot of time with lobpcg. So, can't use SLEPC for that? maybe with a tweak in the code?
Not that I can recall off the top of my head, but you are welcome to look around the slepc4py documentation and submit a PR if you find something.
