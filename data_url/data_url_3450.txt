Somewhere in the evaluation of these tests the shot number becomes a real rather than an integer. Tests fail due to a type assertion. Haven't investigated where exactly this occurs.
The tests don't fail on semaphore etc because they're skipped (not good).
Pinging @msohaibalam since git blames you.
@notmgsk All the tests in pyquil/tests/test_operator_estimation.py are passing for me locally.
