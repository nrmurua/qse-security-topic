Current Problem
When writing some papers related to usage of D-Wave Ocean, I would like to add a reference to the software. Unfortunately there is none. Other software stacks to access Quantum COmputing resources (e.g., Cirq or Qiskit) count with such a reference.
Proposed Solution
Add a Zenodo doi such that people can cite dwave-ocean when they use it and maybe add something to the README adding instructions on how to cite your work.
Alternatives Considered
Zenodo seems to be the most natural way of doing this, but there are alternatives such as Journals of Open-source Software.
Interesting. Thanks for the request! We'll look into it.
