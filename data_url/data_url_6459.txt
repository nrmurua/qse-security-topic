PR #225 was partially generated by a script which is not currently hosted on Github. For future reference and maintenance purposes, we should include that script in the qsim repo.
This issue is low priority relative to the ongoing multi-qubit work.
Much of the code in #248 is also generated from a script, which we should also include in the repo.
