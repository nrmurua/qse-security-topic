in the AWG70000A driver, when we call 'play', the behavior is this (line 493):
running = self.run_state() == 'Running'
this is a bit odd for the case where the sequence starts with an element that will result in wait for trigger.
I think this should be changed to:
running = self.run_state() in ['Running', 'Waiting for trigger']
to capture all possibilities where the instrument is in principle ready to go.
