Hi. I tried installing forestopenfermion by
pip install forestopenfermion
And, i got the following long error message (cut):
Building wheels for collected packages: scipy
Building wheel for scipy (setup.py) ... error

Hey there. I would recommend posting this as an issue on Forest-OpenFermion's GitHub (https://github.com/rigetti/forest-openfermion). Though affiliated, a different group of people maintain that package. Accordingly, I will close this issue on OpenFermion. Good luck!
