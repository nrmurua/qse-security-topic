When I try to python setup.py webapp it crashes with the following error
Follow the steps in CONTRIBUTING, starting with
https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md?plain=1#L17
The UI should be built successfully
No response
running yarn build directly in webapp provides more output
the fix is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69394632/webpack-build-failing-with-err-ossl-evp-unsupported
on Debian the issue is different, caused by yarn install
maybe I will try to remove package-lock.json
got stuck, asked stackoverflow

BTW, perhaps this could be a bit fragile way of doing what you're asking in the stackoverflow post?
