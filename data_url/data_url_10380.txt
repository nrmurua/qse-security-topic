When I tried to run the example
code given on my PC, it return
this error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "D_wave_example.py", line 8, in 
solver = client.get_solver()
File "/home/bsonghao/dwave-cloud-client/dwave/cloud/client.py", line 655, in get_solver
raise SolverAuthenticationError
dwave.cloud.exceptions.SolverAuthenticationError: Token not accepted for that action.
Hey @bsonghao, looks like you're missing a solver/token in your configuration (either dwave.conf file, or keyword arguments to from_config()).
If you don't know the name of the solver upfront, you can use Client.get_solvers() and then just use the one you need (first).
No, I do have a dwave.conf file and here it is
[defaults]
endpoint = https://cloud.dwavesys.com/sapi
client = qpu
token = ...
[DW_2000Q_VFYC_1]
solver = DW_2000Q_VFYC_1
[DW_2000Q_1]
solver = DW_2000Q_1
[BAY14_X_INTERNAL]
solver = BAY14_X_INTERNAL
[c4-sw_optimize]
client = cpu
solver = c4-sw_optimize
[c4-sw_sample]
solver = c4-sw_sample
I think one possible error is the token=... part,
I don't know the token value
Oh, yes, the problem is with the token you're missing.
At the moment if you like a token to run problems on the quantum computer system you should contact sales@dwavesys.com.
However, not too long in the future we should be making it easier to get access and run simple tests on our quantum computer systems. Stay tuned! :-)
Got it. Thanks for your help.
