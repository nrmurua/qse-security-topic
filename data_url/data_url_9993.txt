When pickling a SampleSet with an unresolved future, the sample set should wait until the future is resolved
If some other process is doing the pickling can SampleSet block until the future is resolved? Thinking of issues with PySpark and having to explicitly return sampleset.record to enable pickling.
Yes, this would cover that case
