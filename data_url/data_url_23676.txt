The new channels in the QDac does not render well using the monitor https://github.com/qdev-dk/Qcodes/blob/master/qcodes/monitor/monitor.py because each channel is rendered as an individual instrument.
@giulioungaretti Is the eml source code for the monitor in qcodes/monitor/dist/ available somewhere

Thanks, turns out that a fix to the dict from the python side is sufficient
