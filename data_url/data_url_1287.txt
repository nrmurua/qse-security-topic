Description of the issue
This is a small thing and is more as an fyi than any pressing need for a fix. Colaboratory's autocomplete feature to view available commands associated with a module (as could be used for exploring commands available in the cirq library) appears to max out at 100 displayed commands. It would be cool for exploratory purposes if colab could add support to navigate beyond this limit.
How to reproduce the issue
Cirq version
This sounds more like a Colab issue than a Cirq issue. Maybe you can increase that as a setting in colab. For example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/61043420/5716192
I think they set a cap at 100 to benefit latency of autocomplete. Ideally could have option when scroll to bottom of list to select "show more". Either that or replace with large language model, something like that.
As @vtomole mentioned, this looks like a Colab issue and not a Cirq issue. You can consider opening an issue in one of Colab's github repository (https://github.com/googlecolab) to discuss the potential solutions.
