It appears that the OpenQL configuration file was subject to a syntax change that wasn't effectively communicated.
Until today, when I updated OpenQL from version 0.8.0, I was able to define a gate decomposition using the following syntax:
"gate_decomposition": { "cz q8 q10": ["barrier q8,q10,q11","sf_cz_sw q8","sf_cz_ne q10","sf_park q11","barrier q8,q10,q11"] };
As of today, attempting to compile using the same snippet leads to an error “Unsupported gate type: 20”. I understand this error arises from a failure to match to the correct cz decomposition, leading to the addition (by OpenQL) of a native CZ gate, which the OpenQL CC backend doesn't support/allow (explicitly stopping compilation with the aforementioned error).
Now, only the following syntax leads to proper identification of the decomposition, proving the change in syntax:
"gate_decomposition": { "cz q8,q10": ["barrier q8,q10,q11","sf_cz_sw q8","sf_cz_ne q10","sf_park q11","barrier q8,q10,q11"] };
So the issue is that you have to specify a "," between the specified arguments of a decomposition rule in a json file
while you before your migration didn't have to.
You found a work-around so this bug is not urgent anymore.
Scanning the logs of the code imposing this "," requirement, I couldn't find where this was added.
Sections 8.1.6 and 8.5.4 of the compiler documentation also specify by giving examples
that you need to specify a "," in the configuration file.
So I consider this bug solved.
