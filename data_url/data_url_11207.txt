There are many strategies to calculate many body ground state energy for Bose Hubbard model. One of the fastest and most powerful one is the directed worm algorithm which hasn't been implemented in Openfermion software. The next challenge is this: how to add the directed worm algorithm to Openfermion. if we could implement this, it would be very fantastic for future many body research with Openfermion.
Thanks for this suggestion. Can you give a reference describing the directed worm algorithm?

the phd thesis is about the directed worm algorithm with all details.
here is the original reference: Prokof’ev N. V., Svistunov B. V., Tupitsyn I. S. (1998) “Worm” al- gorithm in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, Physics Letters A 238, 253–257.
this method is also applicable for spin full models and fermions.
closing due to inactivity.  Expanded simulation techniques can also be interfaced through OpenFermion-FQE.
