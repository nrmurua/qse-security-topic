Description of the issue
The following free functions should be deprecated in favour of using the underlying gates directly.
cirq.rx  --> cirq.Rx
cirq.ry --> cirq.Ry
cirq.rz --> cirq.Rz
cirq.ms --> cirq.MSGate
Cirq version
0.11.0.dev
I got started on this and it turns out the cirq.r* rotation functions are used in a lot of places. The main difference from the cirq.R* gates is that the functions don't require a keyword arg, so that instead of cirq.Rx(rads=pi) you can do cirq.rx(pi), which seems like a nice shorthand for some very common operations. Before we go to the trouble of fixing all the use cases, I just want to make sure we really want this (no comments here indicating this was ever discussed at a cirq sync).
@quantumlib/cirq-maintainers, thoughts?
On revisiting, I agree with you that the migration effort is probably not worth the trouble and we can leave the cirq.r* helpers as it is. I'll be happy to close this unless someone has concerns.
@MichaelBroughton, do you have a preference here?
I think we should leave as is. I'm in favor of closing (it would be a lot of work to get this done pre 1.0).
