it would be nice to be able to add any amount of "control points" to any gate, and if you have time, an inverted "control point" would be nice also.
@tjf801 thank you! Added to our list.
@tjf801 by the way, I guess you already know that, but just in case to say that workaround is:


Workaround until we implement it natively.
Would love to see this natively, has there been any updates?
You deserved it after 2 years of waiting! :) Added to dev pipeline.
@tjf801 @tysonwolker
basic support for multi-controlled gates and inverted controls is now added to v0.9.186. Only u1 and x for now.
Multi-controlled u1
Output is:
Multi-controlled x
Output is:
Inverted controls
When creating gate, instead of simply providing number of control wires, you can provide array of boolean values where true is normal control and false is inverted.
Example: 3-controlled x gate with second control inverted:
Output is:
Warning! Achtung!
In moment of writing this: not tested well!
Now this works in GUI as well: https://youtu.be/0ujizq7iat0
