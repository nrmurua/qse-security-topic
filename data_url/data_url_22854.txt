Just a heads up!
Oh! This is a change in the new version? Thanks for pointing this out. Do you have a solution?
Downgrading to 0.24.2 worked for now.
I updated the readme for now, thanks! Let me know if you run into other issues. The master branch will soon turn into an official v0.8 with a pip install and online docs.
I've just made a commit to fix this, please check if it solves your problemðŸ˜€
Nice, Pandas is now at v1 so this is good to close
