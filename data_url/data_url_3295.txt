When trying to run a simple bit flip:
Looks like our usage of pyi types in code evaluated by the Python interpreter is bad. They are only meant to be used by type checkers/IDEs. Worked with @MarquessV on this for quite a while earlier.
We should remove annotations of these types for now. Maybe we can figure out a way to make them work, but at the moment they are preventing execution entirely in v4.
Looks to be fixed now - in the future we should be validating annotations with stubtest rigetti/qcs-sdk-rust#256
