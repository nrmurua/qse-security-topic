Main idea: It's potentially confusing for users to see an error from a platform they are not using. This could arise when handling circuit conversions. We should catch these lower level errors and display custom errors from Mitiq.
I actually think the error messages are good and will close this now. Please re-open @willzeng @andreamari @nathanshammah if you disagree.
Example:
This raises:
The full call stack is:
@rmlarose I can see that to us this is a clear error message, but I think that for a user (in particular perhaps a user who is just trying to apply error mitigation in as automatic a way as possible) this could be confusing.
A suggestion would be to catch errors that happen during conversion wrap them in a ConversionError object and then return the original error message prepended by "Error converting program to/from qiskit/cirq: " where X is either.
What do you think about this @rmlarose @andreamari @nathanshammah ?
This seems reasonable, I'll add a ConversionError.
In general, for people who want automatic error mitigation, it's probably confusing as to why the circuit is being converted at all when one calls execute_with_zne or even a folding method. I don't know if there's any good way to alleviate this, though, nor if we should try.
