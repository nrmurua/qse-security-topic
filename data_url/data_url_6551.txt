As of PR #188, ApplyFusedGate expects the calling Simulator class to define a State type for one of its arguments. UnitaryCalculatorBasic and UnitaryStateSpace have such an object, but name it Unitary instead. We need to fix the naming and add tests that verify ApplyFusedGate works for the Unitary classes.
