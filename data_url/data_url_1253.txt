Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
I have been working with cirq library alot, but I sometimes end-up with some real tedious work, as compared to qiskit. In qiskit, there's a class NormalDistribution which when called returns a circuit. In my case, what I need is the normal probability distribution of the probabilities of all the possible qubits formed with N qubits. I tried to encode the circuit for the NormalDistribution from qiskit in cirq, but ended up with some internal issues of the parameters. Also, I came across that there is no explicit U-gate (general single qubit gate with 3 Euler angles) functions (although I tried building one (code mentioned below).
Describe the solution you'd like
I came across an example where the structure of the circuit is explained. But I believe that the parameter values gets changed as we try to mention the mu (mean) and sigma (standard deviation) value for the circuit. In the example, it shows that we need a bunch of U-gate which in cirq can be custom-built. The code for the U-gate is as:
I think the better solution would be if we could build a class for Normal Distribution in which case, it will reduce the effort for the user to work around that thing.

What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P2 - we should do it in the next couple of quarters, although I need it in no later than 2-3 weeks
