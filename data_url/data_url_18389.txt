Rigetti API is now exposing a new InstructionSetArchitecture.
A few questions:
I would add a parser/converter to the quilc package (or another package adjacent to the quilc package), which then constructs cl-quil-native structures.
I would keep the existing functionality inside of cl-quil untouched as much as feasible. And I would not add a(nother) parser to cl-quil.
