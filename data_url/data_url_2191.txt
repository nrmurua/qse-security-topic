By installing both cirq and cirq-dev on accident and when trying to fix by uninstalling one of the versions in a python environment, it seems like pip may be installing both to the same location and uninstalling one leaves a broken version of cirq which can imported but not really. This seems like a usability problem.
While trying to install a package dependent on cirq-dev I accidentally uninstalled just cirq and the following occurs:
This similarly happens if I have installed both and uninstall cirq-dev:
I'm not sure if this is worth fixing. I'd rather this problem than adding thousands of dev versions to the cirq pypi package.
Does the same issue happen with tensorflow vs tf-nightly? Maybe there's a trick to it.
I'm currently unable to reproduce this using either conda or using a virtualenv.
I'm going to close as this is a sort of strange corner case where the unstable and stable version are co-installed.
My only thought is that there could be someway to warn if you are about to do this.
