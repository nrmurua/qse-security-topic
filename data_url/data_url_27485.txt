The logging module should be perfect to store notes. We need a way to efficiently do this.
I propose using a magic command
%note {text_goes_here}.
This then gets stored in the data_folder/notes directory, and a new file is created each day.
Later on, this can be combined with measurements to create some sort of log of the measurement steps
Implemented this for antimony, but needs to be part of SilQ
Not sure if this is necessary. At first I was quite happy with it, but it was a bit of a hassle having it at two places simultaneously.
Closed, if ever need be, code is in Antimony init
