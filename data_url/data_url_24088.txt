Currently, when a run fails during the execution of Sweeper class' run_sweep method, the warning message, , does not tell which option name or option value that failed.
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-metal/blob/fdc6df69ecb1e9a4ada03f519228a16903f0ec7d/qiskit_metal/analyses/sweep_and_optimize/sweeper.py#L166-L168
One way to trigger this warning is to abort the simulation in Ansys when the run_sweep class is executing.
It will be useful to add which option name + option value (key) combination that didn't execute properly for reference in case the user wants to run the sweeper again for the failed option values.
I made a change in my local Qiskit Metal code as following to display the option name and option value that failed in the warning message.
self.design.logger.warning(f'For class {self.parent.__class__.__name__}, option_name={".".join(option_path)}, key={item}, run() did not execute as expected: {message}')
The necessary variables are available within the iterate_option_sweep method.
