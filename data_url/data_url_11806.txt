check the following(existing) import declaration inside qiskit-aqua/qiskit/aqua/translators/ising/portfolio.py
from qiskit.aqua import Operator

I'm wonder if the right formulation should be:
from qiskit_aqua import Operator
Please advise
In the latest release version of qiskit-aqua, 4.1, the import is correct to be from qiskit_aqua. However since then qiskit_aqua has been altered to qiskit.aqua so if you are looking at, or using, the code in the master branch of this repo, which has yet to be officially released as a version to PyPI, then the import is now from qiskit.aqua as you describe.
There is a tutorial, which shows this portfolio.py in use, and this works from the latest official PyPI release and shows the import from qiskit_aqua. This will be changed at the next official release since then it will indeed be qiskit.aqua

I've got the picture. Thank you.
