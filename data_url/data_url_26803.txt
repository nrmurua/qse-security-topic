The toolchain seems to be largely untested with macOS.
The setup:
Using simply ./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh will not work: gcc points to clang, which doesn't support -fopenmp. First one to complain is OpenBLAS, which can be made to build with --with-openmp=no, but our fftw script does not support building without OpenMP-support in the compiler.
Using CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9 ./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh fails in OpenBLAS since those vars are inconsistently forwarded: CMake picks them up correctly, OpenBLAS does not.
Using ./install_cp2k_toolchain.sh --with-gcc=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/9.2.0_1/ fails since it always assumes a multilib-system (where lib64 is available):
@oschuett is this fixed then?
is this fixed then?
Not to my knowledge, but since the report is now 2.5 years old I consider it outdated and non-actionable.
