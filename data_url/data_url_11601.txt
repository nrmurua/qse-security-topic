Leaving 'expectation' constructor parameter as default of None should allow VQE to auto-select an expectation. While it does do this it has an issue in that it 'locks in' the first selected one since it holds it in self._expectation. The instance variable would have been initialized to None as default and hence the the logic checks against None to determine if it needs to select an expectation (where the user did not provide one explicitly and hence it would not have been None). This works fine but if say you start with a statevector backend then it ends up 'locking' in an expectation to suit that backend, so that setting the backend later to qasm_simulator (or real device) ends up in failure due to mismatched expectation. (And vice versa of course wrt to changing backends).
