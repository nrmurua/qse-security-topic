I thought I already fixed this, but https://travis-ci.com/quantumlib/Cirq/jobs/130987423 from #507 has failing tests producing a bogus coverage report.
You might have fixed it because i haven't been able to reproduce it. This might have had to do with something else in the PR you are linking. Open if you able to reproduce.
