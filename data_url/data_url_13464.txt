Currently the readme doesn't contain instructions on building mitiq from source. Is there a way to do it?
A convenient way (especially for contributors) would be to enable installing from source using pip install -e . which would install mitiq as an editable file.
Hello @paniash, thank you for your interest in Mitiq!
If this is a bug report, please provide screenshots and/or minimum viable code to reproduce your issue, so we can do our best to help get it fixed. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can also ask us on the Unitary Fund Discord.
Hi @paniash, for the moment this is written the docs https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#development-install
But we could consider putting this in the Readme too.
Hi @andreamari. Thanks for the docs link, should've checked it first. Can I make a PR to add this to the README?
It's fine for me. But I ask @crazy4pi314 for a second opinion.
I'm good with readme, but maybe both places (docs and readme?)
@crazy4pi314 I've made the PR for it (as per your suggestion). Could you review it and let me know? Another reviewer seems to have a different opinion on the PR.
We discussed this at our weekly meeting and decided to link to the docs instead of writing it out explicitly in the readme (i.e., to go with #682 (comment)).
Fixed in bac9a5a.
