The result is printed out 4 times rather than once whilst running on the mgpu platform with 4 gpus. Not sure if this is a bug?

Even if you have a simple snippet:
and one executes it with mpirun -n 3 python test.py, the output is printed out three times:
Hey Zohim. This all makes sense. This is how MPI works - there are N concurrent heavy processes running the same code.

If you'd like to tailor which process prints what (e.g. the master rank is the only one that writes to stdout), then you could do something like
