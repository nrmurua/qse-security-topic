Reproducers:
It looks like synthesize keeps calling itself while trying to add this instruction, resulting in a RecursionError:
Perhaps it would be possible to catch this either with static analysis or a try-catch to inform the client of the problem more directly?
Just tried this out with the new refactor, I like the ValueError result that you get when trying to self-nest. Thanks!
