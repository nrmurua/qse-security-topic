The indented block of mathematical notation (CU: |0>...) after "Therefore, under the action of CU, the basis vectors are transformed according to" matches the block further down on the page, but these should be different from each other.  The second block appears to be correct, and the first block needs to be edited.

This issue should be posted on the qiskit-terra repo because they maintain that part of the documentation. @1ucian0 , could check if terra is the correct repo and transfer this issue there? I don't have permissions to do it. Thank you!

Hi @vandieren, let's take a look at those blocks.
Let's start with the first one (I included some text to avoid any confusion about which block is which):

In this case the $C_U$ is controlled by qubit $0$, so if that qubit is in the state $|1\rangle$, the gate $U$ will get applied to qubit $1$. Otherwise, the state doesn't change at all.
In the first and third rows of that block, we can see that qubit 0 is in the state $|0\rangle$ so there's no change.
However, for the second and fourth rows qubit $0$ is in the state $|1\rangle$. Let's see if the gate $U$ is applied to qubit $1$:
Therefore, the first block seems to be fine.
Let's look at the second one:

Here the control qubit of the $C_U$ is qubit $1$, so if that qubit is in the state $|1\rangle$ the gate $U$ will get applied to qubit $0$, otherwise there would be no change.
Notice that for the first and second rows qubit $1$ is in state $|0\rangle$, so the state stays the same.
However for the third and fourth rows the state of qubit $1$ is $|1\rangle$. Let's check them individually:
In short, both blocks are different and both are correct.
I hope you found this explanation helpful ðŸ˜„
it appears correct now.  thanks
Now that it's solved I'm closing the issue
