With the circuit below (code linked), the results given by the simulator local_qasm_simulator_cpp are clearly different whether or not a barrier statement is used (circuit.barrier(q)). In particular the count of 000 states differ: around 3% without the barrier and around 50% with the barrier. The expected result is around 3%. The Python simulator is not affected and gives the expected result.
Run that python file: https://gist.github.com/jonremy/04b5a5c9fec5435466535edc3c51ad3f
Its output is similar to:
The counts should be similar whether or not a barrier is inserted.
Workaround: remove the barriers when working with the simulator.
Thanks @jonremy for the detailed report. This seems like a simulator bug. The two circuits are indeed identical, except for a barrier:


@chriseclectic can you please take a look? I suppose that in the buggy barrier case, the simulator simulates one shot then marginalizes over the 3 qubits and then samples 1024 times. Is there some error introduced here that doesn't happen when simulating 1024 shots?
This may be related to #698.
@jonremy @ajavadia
As @nonhermitian said this is the issue that was fixed in #698. It doesn't look like the fix has made its way to the stable branch though.
Executing a circuit from the above script on the master built simulator I get that results that look to be equivalent (within sampling statistics). For example (doing 10000 shots):
Right, this is fixed in the new simulator. this will be in the 0.6 release, coming up in 1-2 weeks. Thanks @chriseclectic.
Great, thanks everyone!
