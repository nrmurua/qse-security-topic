@mtreinish when you merge the draw changes can we add to this test one that checks the draw order. Then all parts of the ordering are checked.
A test for checking the order used by the visualizers was added here (PR #1187):

Do you mean something different?
One that makes sure its ordered for this test set. This is a simple test set to check multiqubit and multi reg order
closing as @1ucian0 is correct the test show it multiple registers
