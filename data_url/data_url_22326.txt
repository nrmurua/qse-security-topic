Is it possible to construct dependent arguments? For example,
If I change the value of test 1 and try to recompute test2, it doesn't update.
Not possible with the current code.
When do you expect it to update?
I was hoping that clicking on recompute argument would retake the updated argument from test1.
That wouldn't be a great design, because the order of the widgets is the order of the calls. You could have a value depend only on the value of widgets above it, which sounds arbitrary.
Why do you need to have such dependencies?
The experiment I wanted to run was this,
Where we do a ramsey experiment on the three different microwave electrodes we have. They have different pi times, so I wanted to the appropriate pi time to load depending on which electrode is chosen.
We could have three different experiments for the there different electrodes but it would be nice if we could have all of them from the same experiment file.
Why not have three arguments, one for each pi time?
We can also do that. Calling an argument from a widget before it doesn't work now, right?
When the repository is scanned, or when arguments are recomputed, all GUI argument values are ignored currently (and the defaults taken).
Okay. We can just work around this for now. It would be nice but not necessary.
