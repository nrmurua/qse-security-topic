Current Problem
We currently mock the solver with MockLeapHybridSolver but it would be nice to also mock the abstract object MockLeapHybridSampler
Proposed Solution
Add MockLeapHybridSampler/MockLeapHybridBQMSampler
Alternatives Considered
We can get by with the mocked solver but it requires mocking the cloud client
Additional context
Add any other context here.
Agree, especially combined with moving the mock client to the cloud-client (dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client#387).
