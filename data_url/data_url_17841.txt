The name options for the circuit_drawer are ['latex', 'latex_source', 'python', 'text']. The output python is no very descriptive of the expected output. I suggest to rename it to 'matplot'.
I'm totally fine with this. I only used python as the name because @jaygambetta did not like using matplotlib as the name. We can change it to matplot though, I agree that's a much better name.
How about just 'mpl' since that is the canonical short-name for Matplotlib?
@nonhermitian oh, yeah that's a good point. That's what we should do
i agree
