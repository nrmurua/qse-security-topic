Expand the supported python versions by checking newer pythons and functionality.
Hi @ncrubin Can you assign this issue to me.
@jitendrs thanks for taking a look at this!
@ncrubin Thank you.
any news on this?  It would be nice to add the 3.8 tag to OpenFermion
@ncrubin I am still working on it. I will try to list out changes soon for validation.
We now test against python 3.8 and 3.9 in our CI so this issue can be closed
