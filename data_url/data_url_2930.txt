And perhaps the text diagram symbols should be '@', '@'?
And ZZ**(0.5) might be confusing too, since the gate isn't exp(iZZt) it is exp(i11t).  '1' '1' ?
Using CZ instead of ZZ in __str__ style situations seems best to me. In the text diagrams I would use @---Z or @---@. I'm also partial to Z---Z, but only because I'm also partial to drawing a CNOT as Z---X.
@-Z seems good.
