Using VQE class with a parametrized quantum circuit (i.e. efficientsu2), the energy evaluation function is called with parameters in alphabetical order, and not in numerical order as it happens with method assign_parameters of parametrized quantum circuit.
This leads, for example, to parameters called in order: theta[0], theta[10], theta[11], theta[1], etc... which can cause unexpected behaviors if a program relies on numerical ordering of parameters.
That the parameters are called in numerical ordering: theta[0], theta[1], theta[2], etc...
For the case of parametrized quantum circuit, the class VQAlgorithm in "qiskit-aqua/qiskit/aqua/algorithms/vq_algorithm.py" sorts the parameters in the following way:
while it could behave like the parametrized circuit method assign_parameters, which calls them according to the order of the property ordered_parameters.
See #5614
Or see #5557.
This is a work in progress and should be fixed soon! ðŸ™‚
This should be fixed by #6418 (see the sort_parameters_by_name argument), so I'll go ahead and close this issue ðŸ™‚
