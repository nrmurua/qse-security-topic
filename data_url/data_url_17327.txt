When parsing the cmd_def provided by the backend, pulse commands may be parameterized (typically phase shifts). These commands are sanitized before being passed to Sympy for parameter and expression extraction. Currently, this sanitization is too conservative and is failing on the string "-(P1)".
Create a cmd_def with a frame change command with the parameter "-(P1)".
This string should pass sanitization
Relax sanitization strictness to allow consecutive special match characters. In the long run, replace with a full math parser.
