QuTiP version 4.4 was released recently and appears to break a number of krotov's tests.
See https://gist.github.com/goerz/ba8575b060497ec05d5a928925432b19 (run locally on a Macbook) or the Travis log at https://travis-ci.org/qucontrol/krotov/jobs/558664343.
The main problem seems to be that mesolve now prints extra output when it is used to propagate a Schr√∂dinger equation (qutip/qutip#1047).
