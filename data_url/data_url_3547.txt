I have been using pyquil since last week (mostly the weekend) compiling a small quantum ciruit for a challenge problem.
This particular problem involved repeated calls to your service, which worked fine except for slowing down dramatically (actually appearing to choke out in many cases) after a few calls.
However, when I tried again today, I got
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "dummy_alg.py", line 37, in 
print_job_stats(check_compilation(out_mapping))
File "src/obj.py", line 40, in check_compilation
compiled_result = compiler.compile_async(Program(qnn_prog))
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pyquil/api/compiler.py", line 122, in compile_async

raise UnknownApiError(str(body))
pyquil.api.errors.UnknownApiError: {'message': 'Forbidden'}
The server has failed to return a proper response. Please describe the problem
Hi @williamaustinwebb, thanks for submitting. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve- if you try running your program again after encountering this error message, it should still work.
