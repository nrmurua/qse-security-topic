Dear developers,
The following line raises AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'evalf'
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/e03cb1b7fdd1b9f07a7322992ab68b66977a1097/qiskit/qasm/node/real.py#L75
evalf may be some Sympy stuff.
Fixing it as well as

There are two similar methods real() and sym() in Real, BinaryOp, etc. And the latter method seems to be able to treat variable scopes recursively.
Which one is intended to be used to evaluate mathematical expressions?
Thank you,
Sympy usage in Terra  was removed by @mtreinish in #3156. This might be leftover. I think your solution probably makes sense, but it needs a test to make sure symbolic QASM can still be parsed (e.g. something written with pi which is a valid keyword in OpenQASM).
Thank you for your comment (and sorry for my very late reply). Yes, it should be tested indeed.
For evaluation of mathematical expressions, sym() seems to be better to use as far as I
tried (I still don't know why real() is defined, though).
I leave this post open so please close it at your convenience. Thank you again for your great quantum computing environment!

This issue is really a question for Slack and should be closed as "moot".
