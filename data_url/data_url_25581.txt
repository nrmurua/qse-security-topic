I understand @FyzHsn. Can we include the field alone in v10 and default it to is_active = true? This way, if there is consensus on the Web app updating it, then we do not need to wait for the column to be introduced. Else, if you feel it is too much back/forth, we can wait for complete consensus and then take it up.
Reminder that this issue should be broken down into smaller PR's.
