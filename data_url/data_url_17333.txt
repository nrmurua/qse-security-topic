qobj_to_circuits gives the following DeprecationWarning:
but qiskit.compiler.disassemble_circuits() doesn't exist.
If a function is deprecated, and the warning suggests to use a new function, this function should exist in the current release.
Implement the function or change the deprecation warning.
Sorry there seems to be a mistake in the deprecation message. For now please use
from qiskit.assembler import disassemble
@mtreinish I think disassemble should be added under the qiskit.compile namespace.
yeah this is a bug we did not update the disassemble warning when we changed API. This was probably my fault.
It was when I originally added the function (and deprecation message) in #2137 but it looks like that was changed in #2244 right before the release without updating the deprecation message.
so yeah my fault :-(
fixed by #2350
