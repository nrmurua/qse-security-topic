There are multiple options to capture the output of CP2K into a file. Unfortunately they don't behave consistently. Given an invalid configuration file, the following calls all behave differently and most of them not how I would expect it.
The simple case, echo to the terminal, works:
Specifying an output file results in the error being shown on the console and the creation of an empty file:
Redirecting all output by fd redirection results in only the MPI_ABORT part being logged:
Redirecting output for stdout and stderr to separate files does not help:
Redirecting the output to a pipe works again:
My guess is that we fail to synchronize the communication between the MPI C part of the code (in this example OpenMPI was used) and the Fortran buffers for the same file descriptors for the FD redirection examples. But at least the output redirected with -o ... should go correctly to the file instead of just the screen.
Fixed via #1604.
