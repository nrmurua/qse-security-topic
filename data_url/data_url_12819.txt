I had trouble with LinearAlgebra Exercise 8 after submitting my code
Notice line 426 --i does not decrement the value of i in Python:
edge_unitary_matrices has 2 elements https://github.com/microsoft/QuantumKatas/blob/master/tutorials/LinearAlgebra/testing.py#L405.
Thank you for reporting this! Indeed this test is broken. Weird, I was sure I solved through all the tasks when I was reviewing this...
