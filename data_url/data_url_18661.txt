I'm not sure this is even a valid quil program (is it required to terminate the program with a HALT?), but at least the error message could be better.
Here is a minimal example with full backtrace.
If I slap a HALT onto the end (or X 0 or whatever), then the error is avoided. The JUMP @BLK-599 seemed suspicious to me since it appears to be JUMPing to an undefined LABEL, but I fed the output into QVM and it didn't complain, so it seems the bug is in my mental model, not the program.
Very weird output. Certainly looks like a handful of intertwined bugs.
Testing a fix now. PR hopefully coming soon.
