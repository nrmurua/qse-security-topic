When Quilc (v1.24.0) compiles the above test case in a Ubuntu 17.04 OS, it throws the following error:
But it can be compiled successfully when using the latest version of Quilc or in a Ubuntu 18.04. Here lists the testing environments:
The issue can be triggered by using the below requirements:
I am sure that the experimental configurations on Ubuntu17.04 (Server end) are the same as other platforms. So I think that this is a compatibility issue of Quilc.
Thanks for the report.
It's a curious issue; I have no idea why this would error on one OS vs another.
If I had to guess, it's that "qelib1.inc" is different from one machine to another. The error message is awful and should be improved, but the error message is complaining about having 0 parameters but needing 4. Your program doesn't have any such gates needing 4 parameters, so I'm wondering if it's the include that's different on your server machine.
