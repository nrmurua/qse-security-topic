The default optimizer for the VQE implementation is currently the BFGS method.
My personal experience is that this classical optimizer shows a poor performance when dealing with finite sampling.
Perhaps we could discuss this issue and choose some other default optimizer, depending on the people's preferences.
Do you have a particular choice?
The Powell method works fine for me when sampling is present (I just talked to Adri√°n, and he agrees)
It is supported by scipy.optimize.minimize
