Thank you for creating this very useful package. Currently only the source distribution is uploaded to PyPI, which leads to long pip installation times. To speed this up, it would be nice if the built distribution could also be uploaded to PyPI for the most common platforms.
This is definitely something I would like to do. The problem is that I am very wary of doing it, because it would be so easy to accidentally include AVX instructions that are not supported across enough machines, and I could easily never know something was wrong.
I will forward this issue along to the internal person who did the work for qsim, to try to entice them to do the same for stim.
You could put a print statement in setup.py and show a message explaining why it is taking so long :)
This was done for 1.7
