The parater viewer is quite a handy tool to manage the voltages on the samples, but sometimes there are a few issues that make it harder to work with. The following things are missing a bit for our measurements at the moment (these should be quite useful for all users):
@stephanlphilips @CumulonimbusCalvus @QFer
There is already a parameterviewer that can show settings in pycqed:
(downside is that you cannot set values with this one)
To make parameterviewer 'true multithreading'  the instrument drivers should be as well. QCoDeS instruments are not multi-thread safe (and there is no multi-processing variant), so adding this feature is quite hard.
The notification for big jumps is is handled partly by the boundaries you can set on QCoDeS parameters. But adding an extra notification to the GUI indeed seems like a  good option to have.
The QTT parameterviewer has been replaced by new tools. Closing the issue.
