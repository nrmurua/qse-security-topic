This TEP describes what TEP is and how TEP system works.
TEP stands for TensorCircuit Enhancement Proposal. TEP is a design note for major features development in TensorCircuit. It is published as an issue and referred as the issue number, say this one is TEP #23.  TEP provides information to the community (developers and users) and describes a new major feature proposal for TensorCircuit.
Each TEP must have an ownerâ€”someone who writes the TEP using the tep issue template.
For now the status of TEP is decided by @refraction-ray , we will have a committee in the future with a growing community.
Write the TEP as concise as possible, but make the proposed API and implementation design self-contained.
Mainly on developer side.
No backward compatibility issue.
Inspired from PEP and NEP.
Using GitHub Issue system and issue templates.
