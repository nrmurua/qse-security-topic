We have setup ASV as a part of our testing pipelines, and it can generate benchmarking webpages like: https://pv.github.io/numpy-bench/
Is this something we want for Mitiq? It can also give diffs of benchmarks from commit to commit.
@rmlarose I think you were using this the most, thoughts?
+1 from me. I like the idea of expanding the current benchmarks and hosting the results online (whether in the documentation or on a separate page). asv makes it quite easy to do.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
I think the first step for this is to separate out the running of ASV from the regular test suite, then have a separate action to trigger this part of the gh pages site to build.
Basically, I would try this by making a separate action for building and publishing ASV results, using the static site build detailed here:
https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html
Then, using the https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages action, have it publish to a sub-directory on the gh-pages branch so that it doesn't wipe the rest of the pages away
