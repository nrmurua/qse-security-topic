Spun out from #2423.
Clifford Simulator currently special cases handling for multiple Gates through hardcoding operations on the CliffordTableau and StabilizerCHForm in the simulator. The CliffordTableau and StabilizerCHForm logic also, in turn, has hardcoded handling for these gates as private methods.
This is unpythonic; the goal is to implement method dispatch and have this handling exported to individual gates and just use a protocol/protocols in the Clifford Simulator. The protocol(s) would update the internal state of the tableau or the ch_form directly through the gate's defined method. It would also have a generalized, but more expensive, fallback to decomposing single-qubit unitaries into corresponding Cliffords if the method is not defined on that Gate.
Whether to have 2 separate protocols for update_clifford_tableau and update_ch_form or unify it to update_clifford_state is similar to the discussion around generality vs specificity in context of #2946 .
