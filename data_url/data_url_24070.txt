Pull in default units once, at module load time, save for module, so no need to access again and take time
No pointless reloading of default units
@zlatko-minev,   I am trying to determine the scope of this issue.
Looked at the code in class ParsedDynamicAttributes_Component() and methods in parsing.py.
My evaluation of request:
When a QComponent is loaded into QDesign the first time, the parsed default options could be stored in QDesign.  So, when the same QComponent is loaded into QDesign again, the parsed options can be read from QDesign.  So parsing doesn't have to happen again.
This is not correct!!!!!!!
update:
Make sure that changing default units works when they are changed.
Would need to look at he parsing module. At a global level, switch units.
