#1815 adds a DAGNode object as a public interface for exposing dag nodes outside of the DAGCircuit class, but does not change the internal structure of dag.multi_graph. Should DAGCircuit standardize the nodes of its multi_graph as instances of DAGNode?
Considerations:
Should DAGCircuit standardize the nodes of its multi_graph as instances of DAGNode?
No, the internal multi_graph can be whatever, as long as the DAGCircuit object exposes DAGNode objects.
We are working in removing access to the internal multi_graph (see #1897 and #1916).
I'm not fully sure if this issue still makes sense in the context of the new DAG refactor #1912. Shall it be closed?
