Allow QuantumVolume to be called with a generator object rather than only using a numerical seed. This is important for sharing RNG objects in applications using these circuits (such as in Ignis), and also internally in the QV circuit we can pass the RNG object to the random_unitary function which already accepts a generator for the seed kwarg.
Example: to generate a list of quantum volume circuits from a single seed value:
