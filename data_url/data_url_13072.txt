When I click on Executors on the API-doc page, the visible side bar scrolling under "On this page" shows "Digital Dynamical Decoupling" highlighted instead of "Executors". The main part of the page jumps to the Executors section as intended, just the side bar seems to be broken for Executors. For other sections it works fine.

Under "On this page", "Executors" rather than "Digital Dynamical Coupling" should be highlighted.
