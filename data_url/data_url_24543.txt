Floating point rounding errors can lead to errors with duration equality checks. A minimal example
results in an error:
A workaround is to increase the value for epsilon in qupulse.utils.sympy.almost_equal.

This is related to #533
I have a (hopefully final) fix for these problems in temp/wip_duration_and_numba where AtomicMultiChannelPT gets padding and truncation functionality.
The root for this specific problem is that qupulse.utils.sympy.almost_equal only uses an absolute epsilon of 1e-15 by default. It probably makes sense to take a higher value when testing ns times (like 1e-9).
