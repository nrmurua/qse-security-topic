Dear friends,
I entered in the Documentation site for the project (https://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and I noticed that the documentation in the branch "develop" for the Phase Estimation gate is not present (https://projectq.readthedocs.io/en/develop/projectq.setups.decompositions.html).
So my questions are: Is this site being updated with the branches in github? Did I fail in creating the documentation files for Phase Estimation (in docs/projectq.ops.rst)?
Thanks a lot
Best
This issue is related to #280.
I suggest we do any further discussion on that issue there to keep things organised.
