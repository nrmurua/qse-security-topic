Mark Hodson reports:
One of the Livermore event participants wanted to do a controlled operator on a sum of Paulis.
PauliTerm and PauliSum objects aren't gates themselves, and so don't supply a .controlled() method. However, a PauliSum object could reasonably be so-extended: for a Hermitian operator H, I (x) H + Z (x) H looks like a block sum of a zero-matrix and H, and so exponentiates to the controlled-exp(H) operation.
This might be a little clumsy from the perspective of the types defined in pyquil/paulis.py: a PauliSum can be controlled to give another PauliSum, but a PauliTerm will control to give a PauliSum.
