The static polymorphic methods for getting the data pointer in Lightning assume std::complex data types. Certain platforms assume C-like data structs instead (eg struct cmplx { float x; float y;}). We can ensure that all CRTP-like uses of the StateVectorBase class supports such data extensions by allowing the return datatype to be decltype(auto), which will infer the type from the cast derived method.
A modification from:
to
should allow this.
