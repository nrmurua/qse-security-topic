QasmQobj includes pulse specific fields (meas_lo_freq', 'schedule_los, etc):
QasmQobj(config=QasmQobjConfig(initial_layout=[5, 6], meas_level=2, meas_lo_freq=[], meas_lo_range=[], meas_return='avg', memory=False, memory_slot_size=100, memory_slots=2, n_qubits=2, parameter_binds=[], qubit_lo_freq=[], qubit_lo_range=[], schedule_los=[], shots=1024), experiments=[QasmQobjExperiment(config=QasmQobjExperimentConfig(memory_slots=2, n_qubits=2), header=QobjExperimentHeader(clbit_labels=[['c', 0], ['c', 1]], creg_sizes=[['c', 2]], memory_slots=2, n_qubits=2, name='bell', qreg_sizes=[['q', 2]], qubit_labels=[['q', 0], ['q', 1]]), instructions=[QasmQobjInstruction(name='h', qubits=[0]), QasmQobjInstruction(name='cx', qubits=[0, 1]), QasmQobjInstruction(memory=[0], name='measure', qubits=[0]), QasmQobjInstruction(memory=[1], name='measure', qubits=[1])])], header=QobjHeader(backend_name='ibmq_16_melbourne', backend_version='1.0.0'), qobj_id='68127e25-a6b5-4cb6-9c32-3ce16dea9223', schema_version='1.1.0', type='QASM')
This is a result of a single parameter extraction method compiler.assemble._parse_run_args. This should be split into three methods. The first for parameters general to pulse qasm and pulse experiments, second for qasm only parameters and third for pulse only parameters. These should then be conditionally called based on input experiment type.
Would it be possible to split _parse_run_args into just two methods, one for pulse experiments and another for qasm experiments. I see this check in assemble already,
which causes me to believe assemble will only have 2 types of input for the experiments. _parse_run_args is called before this check, but maybe splitting the method into two and inputting them within the respective conditional above would solve the issue?
Pulse requires some of the same arguments as the circuit path. So I think it should be three methods. Otherwise, I agree.
After looking through the parameters for assemble() again, am I wrong in categorizing them this way:
Circuits Only:
Both Circuits and Pulse:
Pulse Only:
Are there any other parameters that I'm missing or that I categorized incorrecectly?
seed_simulator should be for both as we will soon have a pulse simulator.
So I've split _parse_run_args into two functions so far, and have placed them into assemble.py at the following place:
_parse_run_circuit_args includes the args required only by circuits, plus the args required by both circuits and pulse jobs. _parse_run_pulse_args includes the args required only by pulse, plus the args required by both circuits and pulse jobs.
I am just a little confused on what the third _parse_run_args function would be. Would it be the one that is currently in place that includes all of the arguments? Are users allowed to submit jobs that have both circuits and pulse experiments in them? Is there another type besides QuantumCircuit or ScheduleComponent that is accepted as experiments in assemble()?
Sorry if it seems like I keep asking the same question, I am still just a little confused as to what the third version of _parse_run_args would be.
By three I meant there would be a
