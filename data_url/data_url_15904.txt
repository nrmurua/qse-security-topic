Sometimes it is difficult to pinpoint where the arrow denoting the statevector is pointing on a Bloch Sphere,
like in the following case-

It is not clear (without additional input about the state) whether the arrow lies in the "xz"-plane or the "xy"-plane.
The above state has been generated by the following circuit:
I would like to suggest and contribute to using the Plotly graphing library to create visualizations of Bloch Sphere. Below is an example implementation I made using the plotly library for Python.
The interactivity of the graphs would aid in gaining strong intuition of Bloch Sphere representation.
Comments and suggestions are welcome!
The primary goal of Qiskit is circuit construction, compilation, and optimization, thus such tools are really out of scope for this package.  However, luckily what you want already exists:

Interesting! Kaleidoscope looks great, @nonhermitian . I think I had come across it a few months ago, but it slipped my mind. Thanks for sharing.
No problem.  Closing this.
actually you can add %matplotlib nbagg or %matplotlib notebook or %matplotlib auto to make it draggable
