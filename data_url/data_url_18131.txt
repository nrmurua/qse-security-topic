Hi, I'm using qiskit just by a short time, but I noticed that some methods are not recognized by the linter. (For example QhantumCircuit.h)
So in my project there are errors, I can ignore them, but it would be better if the implementation of qiskit take this in consideration.
Thanks,
Marco
Hello Marco,
thanks for the suggestion - it would indeed be ideal, but requires either a more "intelligent" linting solution or a modification on how the gates are currently implemented. The .h() method you mention is appended to QuantumCircuit dynamically at runtime, and the linter is not able to recognize it as a valid method, since it is mostly based on static analysis.
The topic of how gates are implemented has been touched on other issues as well, as it is a bit inconvenient not only for the linter, but for other purposes - it's not a top priority at the moment, but certainly worth revising. In the meantime, and only for your convenience, perhaps your IDE supports an option similar to the generated-members pylint directive that might alleviate the issue?
A better way of doing this is being discussed in #316.
