It is not super clear which part is to blame (it could just be the serialization/deserialization) but there is a surprising performance hit at a specific number of shots for a simple 1Q program
The QVM shows that "Finished in" goes from 2-3 ms to 9-10ms so a surprising jump but not largely responsible.
That is surprising and curious. (You're not secretly decoding some 4K video in the background are you? :))
Results for me, in same order
@caryan you still seeing this behaviour?
