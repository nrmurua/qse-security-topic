When I set deepcopy = True and specify subsys_update_info when initializing the parameter sweep, the sweep can't recognize the subsystem objects in the subsys_update_info. The ParameterSweep object will misinterpret the subsys_update_info and think the bare spectrum don't need to be updated. In the end, the bare spectrum are calculated once and copied for the rest of the sweep, resulting in the incorrect result.
We expect seeing three different list of evals, while the current code gives the repeated eval lists.
