Right now we have a function running_in_jupyter() which detects if the qBraid-SDK is running in a jupyter notebook, and if so, modifies various display outputs accordingly (e.g. get_devices()).
In this issue we want to implement a function that detects if the SDK is running in qBraid Lab, with Quantum Jobs enabled. This is important to ensure that we do not create duplicate quantum jobs.
The implementation will build on the _qbraid_jobs_enabled() function, which already does a version of this check, but only for the dedicated qBraid-SDK environment. This function also does not have any way of verifying whether or not it is being used in qBraid Lab. To detect if running in qBraid Lab, one approach could be to check for the existence of the qBraid CLI at usr/bin/qbraid, since right now, the CLI is only available through Lab, and cannot be installed locally.
