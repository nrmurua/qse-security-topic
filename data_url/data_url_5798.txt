The QASM 3 simulator can't cope with Terra for loops created that don't use the loop parameter.  If such a circuit is built with the builder interface the loop parameter is set to None, indicating that nothing should be bound into the loop body.
This gives a CircuitError:
The for loop should run, and just be equivalent to repeating the body len(indices) times.
