Compute the root channel fidelity. This quantity can be computed by means of a semidefinite program as was shown in Proposition 50 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10708.pdf.
Task
As this is a channel metric, one will need to create a channel_metrics directory. The file created should be channel_metrics/sqrt_fidelity.py.  One will also need to create channel_metrics/__init__.py with the content:
Tests:
Corresponding tests should be located in tests/test_channel_metrics/test_sqrt_fidelity.
Docs:
A new heading in channels.rst should be created for metrics with the name Distance Metrics for Quantum Channels under which should go toqito.channel_metrics.sqrt_fidelity
