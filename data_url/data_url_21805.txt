from David:
the loop at 184 walks every old entry, and writes out a copy of it at 194. It writes out an updated value, sure, but then you just end up with duplicates of the same value
(so if new_value.len() > old_value.len() it's actually expand :) )
IE, there's no spot where it skips writing an entry if a duplicate were found
https://hastebin.com/zodimilequ.diff should fix it
This should also remove all traces of entries that have been removed with remove() - the current patch does not do that.
