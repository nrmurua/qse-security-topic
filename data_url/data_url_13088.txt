Qibo is an open-source high-level API provided by Qilimanjaro, written in Python and capable of running a quantum algorithms on top of different quantum computers and simulators. It currently supports the IBM real and virtual machines, the Rigetti virtual machine, and Qilimanjaroâ€™s virtual machine called VQMlite.  A key goal is to provide a standard interface that can be applied to many different backends.
Currently if we pass a Qibo circuit to Mitiq, we obtain the following message:
I hope that we can add a new frontend to Mitiq that works well with Qibo.
As a workaround now, we can convert a Qibo circuit to QASM such as here #1232

Hello @shangtai, thank you for your interest in Mitiq!
If this is a bug report, please provide screenshots and/or minimum viable code to reproduce your issue, so we can do our best to help get it fixed. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can also ask us on the Unitary Fund Discord.
This issue had no activity for 4 months, and will be closed in 2 weeks unless there is new activity. Cheers!
I second this suggestion.
Thanks for the first stab at this issue in #1232 @shangtai. Are you interested in working on this further?
We also have a feature coming out in the next release of Mitiq that allows one to define their own to_mitiq/from_mitiq functions that can hook into our code [#1850]. That might be an acceptable workaround for the time being.

If I understood correctly, It's true that it would be a workaround for circuits that only contain qasm gates. However, a more specific implementation would still be necessary for general qibo circuits. We could work on that together in the near future.
Ah okay yeah I'm not familiar with Qibo, so if there are lots of operations that are not able to convert into cirq circuits then that can cause problems as cirq is our underlying frontend that mitiq is written in.
