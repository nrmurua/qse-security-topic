Currently, the status field in the DB is a string.

However, the status attribute in the result object is an instance of the custom Status class.

When we are comparing these, we are casting the Status instance to a string.

This is hacky. The right way to do it is either store the result status as a string natively in the result object, or override the comparison function in the Status class so it can be compared directly to a string.
