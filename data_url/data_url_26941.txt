So quantum should be able to handle floating fail over ip's over an arbitrary number of hosts. These floating ip's would be assigned to multiple servers, and a single server in that group would claim the ip on startup. In the event that the server which claimed the ip were to lose access to the datastore, the ip would then failover to the next server in the group. However if no servers are responding, the ip should be removed completely, until a healthy server is put back into service.
