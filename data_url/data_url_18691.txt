gives QUILCError: Invalid index NIL for (SIMPLE-VECTOR 16), should be a non-negative integer below 16.
I'm running quilc 1.4.0 (library: 1.4.0) [e501e1c], and the stacktrace is
looking into it
I don't understand the compiler well enough to fix it, but I have found some small test case. It seems if either the qubits enumerated in the 1Q ISA layer
(a) do not include a qubit labeled "0", or
(b) do not include every label from "0" to "n-1"
(and both INITIAL_REWIRING "PARTIAL" and PRAGMA EXPECTED_REWIRING are provided) then the above error will occur.
Examples:
