This Op should be converted to fold constant operands into the operation itself like the ExtractRefOp is currently. Not only would this potentially reduce the number of operations in the IR, but it can be a matter of correctness as MLIR treats different ways of expressing constant values as having different semantics.
For example, instead of
this IR would be folded and expressed as
Bonus: subvec should be spelled as subveq to make it consistent with the rest of the IR.
