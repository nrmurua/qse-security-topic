Context: #3273:
"putting the Number check first results in some failures because we have code that assumes that if code is not parameterized then it's possible to do floating point operations on it. For example, in TwoQubitDiagonalGate if the gate is not parameterized we try to compute the unitary (https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/ops/two_qubit_diagonal_gate.py#L63), but this fails if the gate contains sympy expressions even if there are no free parameters. I guess to model this properly we'd need separate checks for "is symbolic" versus "is parameterized". For now, I'm going to leave the number checks after the sympy checks."
