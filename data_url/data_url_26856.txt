Hi,
I need to have a couple of tools accessible to be able to build some of SIRIUS dependencies. Would it be possible to have autotools, automake, autogen, libtool, and autoconf included in the CI image or shall I build them myself. Without these tools, any of my pull request will be rejected which would be a pity.
I do not mind building them though but I do think that the CI image should include the most basic tools for compiling which is not the case. I am open to suggestion.

Yes, it probably makes sense to have autotools and alike as external dependency. If we start to go down this road then we should probably treat make and cmake the same way.
The toolchain image is build from this Dockerfile. Feel free to send in a PR.
Ok I will modify the dockerfile to include these packages. These tools should not be built by hand. They do not affect in any ways the runtime of cp2k whatsoever.
