I am unable to open slides that were provided on FOSDEM 2020 presentation. I am able to download the slides but I don't know what format these slides are in.
This presentation was references here.
Thanks for reporting this. That's strange, I don't know if I can change what on the website. Somehow FOSDEM renamed it, without the extension. The format is .pptx. It should work if you add it to the end of the file name.
Thanks ! That worked.
