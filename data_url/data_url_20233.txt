This is my code but it gives a linker issue. I installed it as per the  instruction.
What is your compilation and linking command?
Also, the code above is not at all correct.  You have not properly allocated memory, you have multiple pointers pointing to the same piece of improperly allocated memory, you haven't called keygen.  Please see the example code in the project for an idea of how to properly use the API.
gcc -02 -Wall -Wextra -I$HOME/liboqs/include -L$HOME/liboqs     -L$HOME/liboqs/.libs tests/example_kem.c -o example_kem -loqs
error: unknown argument: '-02'
gcc -o2 -Wall -Wextra -I$HOME/liboqs/include -L$HOME/liboqs     -L$HOME/liboqs/.libs tests/example_kem.c -o example_kem -loqs
:ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
This is when I am running the example file
Same problem when I am using make
Ah, the instructions you've copied and pasted from our wiki have not been updated after some changes to our build system.
First clone and build liboqs:
Then compile your file:
If you encounter problems related to linking against OpenSSL, you can try this:
Note that in -O2 it is a capital letter "oh", not the number "zero" (your comment above has -02 not -O2).
Thank you very much sir. It helped.
