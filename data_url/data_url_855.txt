Describe the bug
Braket SDK requires amazon-braket-schemas-python >= 1.10.0.  A change in amazon-braket-schemas breaks customers attempting to call AwsDevice.get_devices() for versions before 1.10.0.
To fix
Locally:
pip install --upgrade amazon-braket-schemas
From a Braket Notebook Instance:
!pip install --upgrade amazon-braket-schemas
Closing as this issue is now stale.
