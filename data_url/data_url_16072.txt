Appending a circuit which uses both qubits and clbits can be drawn out of order, if it introduces a dependency which can only be followed along classical wires.
Base circuit:
Circuit to be appended:
Combined circuit:
Matplotlib:

Latex:

DAG drawer has the right dependency on c[0]:

The appended circuit should be drawn after the measure.
@kdk I think this is a simple follow-up to #5397. That was looking only at conditional gates in the final circuit. It should be easy to extend that to look for node.cargs that match the measure. I can take a look at it.
