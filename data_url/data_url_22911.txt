Hi, I'm a new user of pyrpl, trying to get a simple sin output from the asg and read it using the scope using the emulated FAKE Red Pitaya.
Code:
from pyrpl import Pyrpl
p = Pyrpl()
(I've tried using global-config, no config file, etc.)
Hostname=FAKE on the host selection window
This is my asg signal

This is the scope:

I've been trying to get the sin wave to work for a few days now but I seem to be doing something wrong....
Furthermore, the sample .ipynb notebook here https://pyrpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/tutorial/
seems to hang on the first call to s.curve()
Have tried with the Github repo and the pip version, and have tried many different values of trigger, threshold, frequency etc.
