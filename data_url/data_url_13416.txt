Mitiq needs more error mitigation techniques.
Based on Error mitigation by training with fermionic linear optics. Could be viewed as an enhancement to mitiq.cdr: Instead of (near) Clifford circuits, the training set consists of Fermionic linear optic (FLO) circuits, which are also efficiently classically simulateable.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
