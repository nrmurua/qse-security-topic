Once in a while, compilers add new warnings. That's good, because it helps us find new flaws in existing code, but unfortunately this also has a tendency of breaking things, especially when particular versions of the library are included in other things.
For example, in open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust#199, the wrapper breaks because Bas was using a newer compiler version than what liboqs 0.7.2 was tested against.
Does it make sense to move the -Werror flag to only be set in tests?

Sounds good to me -- as long as (at least) one of those tests is part of CI.
New warnings produced by new/different compilers seem like useful information to gather, so it'd be nice to somehow ensure our test suites can keep up with all that's latest/different out there

Yeah, the way I envision this we put -Werror behind some flag that we enable everywhere where we want to see failures.
It turns out there is already a CMAKE feature that does this: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/COMPILE_WARNING_AS_ERROR.html
This already partially implemented by #1378
