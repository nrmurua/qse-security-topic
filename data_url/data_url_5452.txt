Latest LGTM runs for C++ appear to be stuck installing pybind11:
Hopefully resolving this will allow us to track C++ code quality in LGTM as well.
Let me check this, it worked on my machine. What OS do you have?

As far as I can tell the LGTM runs are handled by a remote server - the full logs are available in the link above.
It fails because the LGTM VM doesn't have the Python libraries required to run pybind11. There is no solution unless we decide to have Python disabled by default (so that, only C++ would be compiled).
To avoid this issue, I'm changing configure.ac so that in case of a python fail, it simply disable python rather than issue an error.
LGTM is still unable to check C++ quality. Apparent cause is the flags LGTM uses for g++ - in particular, the lack of -std=c++17:
Additional logs can be seen in the latest run.
Yeah .. initially the problem was python but I'm not sure how to resolve this problem. I can take another look.
We probably need a configuration file.

@95-martin-orion Is it ok with Google policy to install the LGTM app? Thanks!
Is it ok with Google policy to install the LGTM app?
As far as I can find, this is the only restriction in the Google policy:
It's explicitly noted that this prohibits use of the Travis CI app, but not travis-ci.org.
To avoid any trouble, let's not install any apps. Thanks for clarifying this!
