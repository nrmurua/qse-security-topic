I noticed a small labeling error in the Qiskit tutorials documentation. The exact location is Tutorials >> Circuit Tutorials >> Getting started with Qiskit page.
Here, under the Visualize Circuit header, a system of n qubits is mentioned. An n qubit system has qubits labelled from Q0 to Qn-1. Instead, the tensor product that is displayed, has qubits ranging from Q0 to Qn, thereby denoting an n+1  qubit system.
The labelling of the qubits is to be changed to: Q0 to Qn-1.
Hello @abhishekjay, I would like to work on this issue. Is it ok if I give it a go?
