The parallel computing backend options for the simulated device don't seem to do anything.
This issue was already pointed out here:
https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/9209/how-to-use-parallel-executions-of-circuits
Here is the code I ran. I observed no significant differences between runs
Only the Aer simulator has those parallel options not the BasicAer simulator.
from qiskit import BasicAer
...
backend = BasicAer.get_backend("statevector_simulator")
