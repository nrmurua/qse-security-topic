In the Original Noise and Errors tutorial, the use of the Quantum Master Equation was mentioned only briefly.
We should expand its emergence and how to use these effective noise channels, comparing to the microscopic model parameters (SPAM parameters, stochastic fluctuations in lasers).
@Varda-star  This one can be tackled once #428  has been implemented.
