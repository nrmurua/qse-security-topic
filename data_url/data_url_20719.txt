From the Falcon reference implementation:
127  * There are three formats for signatures:
128  *
129  *   - COMPRESSED: this is the default format, which yields the shortest
130  *     signatures on average. However, the size is variable (see below)
131  *     though within a limited range.
132  *
133  *   - PADDED: this is the compressed format, but with extra padding bytes
134  *     to obtain a fixed size known at compile-time. The size depends only
135  *     on the degree; the FALCON_SIG_PADDED_SIZE macro computes it. The
136  *     signature process enforces that size by restarting the process
137  *     until an appropriate size is obtained (such restarts are uncommon
138  *     enough that the computational overhead is negligible).
139  *
140  *   - CT: this is a fixed-size format, which furthermore allows
141  *     constant-time processing with regard to the signature value and
142  *     message data. This is meant for uncommon situations in which
143  *     the signed data is secret but of low entropy, and the public key
144  *     is not actually public. The CT format is larger than the
145  *     COMPRESSED and PADDED formats.
As per discussion in open-quantum-safe/liboqs#1561, it seems that the PQClean was intended to use the "PADDED" format. However, the code to zero-pad signatures to a fixed length was omitted, meaning that PQClean implements some combination of the "COMPRESSED" and "PADDED" formats. In particular, this means that the implementation here behaves differently from any flavour the reference implementation.
