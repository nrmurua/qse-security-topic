I find the following code example puzzling:
The first REPL line allows me to construct an object whose __repr__ is Pauli('').  However, if I try to instantiate Pauli('') directly, it fails.
Code snippet above.
Either both statements should fail, or both should be allowed.
I currently see no reason not to simply support Pauli(''), such that it works without raising an exception.
Yeah, this is a good point.  There's nothing mathematically invalid about a zero-q Pauli, and since all the other ways of construction already worked, I see no reason to forbid it via label.  I've made #9726.
