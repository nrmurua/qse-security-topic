There are some things which were detected during QA session that don't work in the Quantum Gravity tutorial doc/source/tutorials/quantum_gravity/spacetime_classification.ipynb.
Some of these things include:
We'll need to switch to using PyTorch instead of Tensorflow since the latter doesn't work on M1 Macs.
There's a PNG missing in the notebook that wasn't found.
The following code-block blocks indefinitely:
let's find another solution... we can't entirely write off tensorflow
