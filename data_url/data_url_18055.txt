The depth of the circuit as returned by the DAG is incorrect.

As the circuit shows, the depth is not the reported value of 13, but rather 22.
DAG depth and circuit depth should be equal.
Some of the gates in this example occur in parallel so the circuit depth is less than 22.
Ok, I can not seem to reproduce the error I say a month or so ago.  Will close unless I can see it again.
@nonhermitian @awcross1 Yeah the behavior seems to be correct. The longest dependency path (i.e. circuit depth) in this picture is 13.

Ohh, nice plot!
