The addressing phase of the compiler is currently influenced only by chip topology. Other physical factors also affect algorithm performance, chief among them coherence times / gate fidelity measures. It would be wise to prefer to map commonly-used logical qubits to high-fidelity physical qubits when such hints are available.
As of March 2018, this data is now available as an ISA layer, and chip-reader stores it in the miscellaneous data fields of the hardware components.
