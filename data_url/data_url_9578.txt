This a very minor issue that is just about a small problem in the documentation. Concerning the progress_bar option of Simulation.run, the documentation states that it is a boolean, however, by the way it is used in sesolve, it must be either None or True (or a BaseProgressBar object). A value of False will raise an error.
Here is the relevant extract from the source code of sesolve:
Afterwards, progress_bar is always expected to be a BaseProgressBar object.
