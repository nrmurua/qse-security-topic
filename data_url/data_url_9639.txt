Are we talking about "samples" as sampling the amplitudes of the final state? How about a rejection sampling routine?
Samples would be a series of 0's and 1's for each atom, each corresponding to the measurement outcome of one run. Usually they are organized by run, such that, for a given run, 100110... means "q0" was measured as 1, "q1" as 0, "q2" as 0 and so on. The samples of N runs would be N such sequences.
This is the least processed the output data from a computation can be.
@cdalyac implemented something along those lines in the MIS branch. See tutorial.
@sebgrijalva maybe you can prepare a pull request into simulation, that would solve this issue and #56
This was addressed in #61.
