#443 added instructions for building liboqs on ARM.  But it would be good to have continuous integration tests that exercise building on ARM.  Christian wrote a few suggestions in #408.
FYI, the strategy we used for PQClean to test big-endian systems could probably also be applied for ARM. There are some limitations though.
