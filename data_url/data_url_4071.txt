In the configuration specification https://github.com/DiCarloLab-Delft/OpenQL/blob/master/configuration_specification.md, it is specified that all durations are in ns. The parameter cycle_time should be used for conversion to #cycles.
Currently the parameter cycle_time is not used and durations are assumed to be in #cycles. This is inconsistent with the configuration file for the specification of buffers (in ns).
Done. Here is an example of generated QISA:
and corresponding TQISA:
@imranashraf , Hard to see if the output is correct when there is no input to see if it is correct.
I tested on the most recent commit and did not find this to be working. Furthermore, I got warnings when building that seemed related to this issue. As such I will reopen this issue.
DiCarloLab-Delft@97dd4fc should fix it. So for the  tests/test_cc_light_long_duration.py which uses test_cfg_CCL_long_duration.json
containing long duration as you were testing, the following output is generated, which seems to insert the correct cycle based on cycle_time (5ns), prepz duration (200000 ns) etc :
and you can run this test now.
Confirmed fix, closing issue.
