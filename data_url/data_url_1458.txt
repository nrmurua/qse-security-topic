We still have a number of gates and operations that have public fields. These should be private, with public getters if necessary. (And those getters should not return mutable references unless it's something performance critical.) Otherwise this breaks the contracts of FrozenCircuit etc.
Ideally upon fixing this we should create a unit test that checks this to some extent for all gates in Cirq.
This should probably be done before 1.0.
From cirq sync:
We should do it. Let's do a deprecation by creating a setter and mark it deprecated.
