In light of #53, I think it would be interesting to switch from astyle to clang-format. Clang-format is both a library and a stand-alone tool aiming at automatically reformatting C sources files, and continus to be developed while astyle has not been updated since December 2014.
I agree. As a side benefit it is likely included by default on the build images so there would be no need to compile it for each build.
Not sure if it would be possible to keep the exact same formatting we have now though?
Okay, seems like a good idea.  Can you come up with some command line options?  Not a big deal if they don't reproduce the exact format, but I'd like to keep the main formatting principles.
I'll do it this week! Is there a PR I should wait to be merged for before doing it (bitroting)? I'll also refactor slightly the travis files by creating a .travis directory.
I'd like to wait until #58 lands, which should be this Tuesday or Wednesday.  The other big one is #47, but I'm not sure what the status of it is from a cryptographic perspective, so you can go ahead without it.
#58 has landed, so reformatting can go ahead.
I've tried to do this on a branch, but discovered that the version of Ubuntu in Travis (12.04 "precise") has a very old version of clang-format (3.4), which is missing a bunch of options to produce the desired format.  Anyone know how to install a newer version of clang-format on an old Ubuntu?  Otherwise we might have to stay with astyle.
Sorry very hectic weeks recently, I didn't have time to look into that. I did it for fplll here.
