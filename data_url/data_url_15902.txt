gives:
The docs say it should do this if a calibration is not provided:
Normally, if we tried to transpile our circ, we would get an error. There was no functional definition provided for "my_custom_gate", so the transpiler can’t unroll it to the basis gate set of the target device. We can show this by trying to add "my_custom_gate" to another qubit which hasn’t been calibrated.
But here I have explicitly done so.
add_calibration says that it takes a tuple. What happens when you change that line to:
?
The error still persists.  Also note that the tutorial uses lists:

I already see this problem when reducing it to 3 qubits rather than 5.
Is there any more of the traceback available?

The unroll_custom file has:
which is missing in the 3Q unroller.
Likewise for CheckMap.
Is anyone working on this?
