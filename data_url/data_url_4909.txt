calcProbOfOutcomes(Qureg qureg, int* qubits, int* outcomes)
Returns the probability of the total measurement of the bit-string outcomes from qubits qubits.
This can just wrap calls to statevec/densmatr_calcProbOutcome and do some math
calcProbOfAllOutcomes() added to v3.3.0. However, a single outcome method may still be useful
