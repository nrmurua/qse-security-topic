Readout Error has absolutely no effect
Result:
Has effect.
Make it effective.
Please use approximation =False with other pauli operators.
It is possible to make it retain approximation=True and shots=None while having a correct result? Since exact expectation value is needed.
Do you need "exact" expectation value with "readout errors"?
Currently Aer supports readout errors with measurements, that will not produce "exact" expectation value.
My understanding is that "exact expectation value" is the limit when shots approach to infinte, which is the ideal value.
You claimed that with shots=None and approximate=True can product such ideal value but instead it do not.
As shown in the following code, we can see that the NOISY expectation value approaching 0.4 with decreasing sampling error,
however, equals to 1 when approximation set to True, which is absurd.
output:
Noises such as bitflip, phaseflip, depolar are working when shots=None and approximate=True but all of a sudden readout error is ignored completely.
What is this inconsistancy?
The readout error also has no effect for AerSampler when shots=None.
