#1652
A tool or an addition to an existing tool to be able to determine the current firmware version of Urukul and possibly other devices. Another solution could be an automated check that alerts the user current firmware: X  on Y device is  incompatible.
Earlier versions of Urukul, v1.2-3, requires a specific patch and there are a variety of firmware versions for Urukul CPLD.

What does this have to do with the Urukul CPLD gateware?

AFAIK that's what the proto_rev check does on Urukul.
IIRC, proto_rev is shared between protocol-compatible CPLD versions. (Not quite the same as the firmware version)
Edit: (commenting for completeness)
