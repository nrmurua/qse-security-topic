Hi team! I miss you! :D
Running a test of a component that uses qiskit-aer under the hood, I got this SIGSEV.
Does this look like something needs to be fixed around pybind11?
I can provide you with a test case in case you want to reproduce it, but unfortunately, I cannot share it here.
Hi @atilag, Thank you for your reporting.
Is this happened when you just run import qiskit_aer?
Can you try a non-alpha version of py3.11 and install a released version? I'm curious if this is an artifact of using an old pre-release more than a bug in aer
I do believe it is, by interpreting the entire stack trace.
The import is not controlled directly from my abstraction, but I can dig in to make sure this is at importing time.
Yes, I can confirm that a simple import triggers the SEGFAULT.
