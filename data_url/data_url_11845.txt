The qsvm variational notebook in qiskit-tutorial achieved ~95% accuracy before fixing the bug in cross-entropy loss; however, with the bug-fix, the performance is only ~65% accuracy.
One thing I noticed that is the loss is extremely large as compared to the previous version.
here is the final value of the objective function. I recall that we will get something around 0.xx before.
