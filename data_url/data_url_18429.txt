It Would Be Nice (TM) if quilc could be used purely as an algebraic simplifier (namely for the QVM!) to reduce the number of gates total in the program. I don't necessarily mean fusion, but a re-expression of the program to be simpler.
Exploiting knowledge of commutators and some basic simplifications on top of that might already be enough to make an impact.
