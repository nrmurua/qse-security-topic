I see that with a fake connection I can only have the solver named 'phony'. If I set the dwave solver to c4-sw_sample, the code fails.
And using the default 'phony' solver, I end up outputting "Without D-Wave's libraries, QMASM can do little more than output qbsolv, MiniZinc, and flattened QMASM files" without any solutions. Could you please help me understand this?
QMASM relies on D-Wave's proprietary SAPI library to minimize the Hamiltonian/QUBO.  Without SAPI, all QMASM can do is output the problem coefficients; it can't do anything useful with them.  However, if you install qbsolv, you can use that as the solver.  Specify --format=qbsolv --run on the qmasm command line to go that route.
What I really want to do is rewrite QMASM to use Ocean instead of SAPI.  Not only is Ocean open-source software, but it also provides a classical solver.  The full QMASM functionality will therefore be available whether you're running on your desktop or on a D-Wave system. Alas, this is a major code change, and I haven't yet found the time to work on it.
Closing this issue.  At long last, I rewrote QMASM to use D-Wave's open-source Ocean API in place of their proprietary and now-deprecated SAPI library!  As a result, QMASM can run programs using Ocean's integrated software solvers if you don't have access to a D-Wave system.  (Note that through D-Wave Leap you can register for free cloud access to D-Wave hardware in case you want to try that out.)
