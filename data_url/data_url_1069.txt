Feature: Tagging qubits and moments
Problem: Currently one can tag operations.  These can serve as compiler or executor pragmas.  They also provide a way to cross an api boundary with more generic data appropriately serialized.  In actual hardware, it is useful to also provide other metadata to the hardware.  For example qubit can be tagged with properties of the qubit necessary for executing gates.  Similarly tagging moments can be useful to propagate information about the duration of the moment upwards and downwards through the api surface.
