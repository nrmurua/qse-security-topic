Hello I was just trying your first example from the documentation and i reached this exception when I ran pyquil-config-setup:
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-Traceback (most recent call last):

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

My Python version is 3.6.5.
The problem was that I had installed pyquil using pip and not conda, reinstalling fixed the problem.
In general, I think we're too precise with the requirements in setup.py
