When testing the providers, there are several warnings about "error parameter greater than maximum allowed value".
Not sure if those are expected. If so, they should be captured (and checked) by the test themselves.
What is to be done on this issue? @1ucian0
It seems like Aer introduced this warnings in Qiskit/qiskit-aer#792
In the same commit, Aer is adding a parameter from_backend(..., warning=<bool>) (here) that we can probably use to silence these output.
If you need sync help, look for me on Slack or Gitter. Thanks!
Is this issue still unaddressed, and if it's okay with everybody, could I give it a shot? @1ucian0 @rochisha0
Is this an actual error or just warnings? Thanks
@VANRao-Stack Yeah sure, from my side.
Is someone working on it, or can I give it a shot?
There is nothing really to fix. This is just a warning that the calibration results from the devices are not within given physical ranges. This is to be expected because the value indicating an error is 1.0. As of Aer 0.6 these warnings can be disabled.
Would it be a good idea to modify so that it only returns the warning once, or so that the default is to have the warning off?
Just set this to false:

Yeah, sure, but is that what we want to do? Seems like it'd be best to have the warnings upfront (e.g. for researchers' sake). That said, once a device model is reporting gate errors once, it'll be reporting them repeatedly (right?) which would be unnecessary + annoying. We could add a bool to stop the prints after the first?
Is someone working on it, or can I give it a shot?
Yes please, do go ahead, sorry for the late reply, my exams are still going on. Cheers!
@coder-mtv Want to be assigned?
Hi @1ucian0, can I try this one?
If @coder-mtv does not answer in the next 8 hours, you can take it @sagarpahwa
