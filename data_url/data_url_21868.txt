In a setup where the max ADC value can never be reached (DDS railing gives about -0.5FS) setting offset=0.99 puts the DDS amplitude to max, while setting offset=1 puts it to zero.
I guess this is a standard issue, but it should at least be documented (otherwise, setting offset=-1 is a pretty standard thing to do!).
Yeah. it's two's complement where the positive max is one LSB smaller than the negative. Will document.
thanks!
Hmm. On re-reading I don't understand the first paragraph. Just to clarify: This is a setup with a positive ADC working point and thus negative offset. Do you mean offset=-0.99 and offset=-1 in the first paragraph? Because those two should be fine.
