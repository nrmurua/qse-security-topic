If the bug manifests in unexpected behavior (as opposed to a crash), confirm that you have consulted the
API documentation
Deprecation warnings are raised by scipy for two imports: csc_matrix and dia_matrix.
Change appears to have been made in scipy 1.8.0, see scipy/scipy@f84b803
No warnings should be outputted.
import the file scqubits/core/cos2phi_qubit.py
Easy to fix by importing from suggested namespace.
Thanks for the report and the associated pull request. There's a broader question here: what is the range of scipy versions we are actually supporting at this point. The requirements.txt entry may not be accurate anymore. Pinning to the latest scipy version should be avoided for several reasons, including questions about Python version support (not critical if we go through with dropping Python 3.6).
TODO
Determine: at what scipy version does the new namespace become available?
