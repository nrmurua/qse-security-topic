It looks like qutip contains a piqs.py file. Does that include the full functionality of this package? If not, what is the overlap, and which is considered more up-to-date (and/or still developed)?
thanks.
P.S. also, thanks for writing this - it seems very useful!
Dear @petergthatsme, thank you for your message.
That's correct, PIQS is now integrated in QuTiP, from version 4.3.1. They are both up to date and with the same content. Updates in the future might affect first the PIQS standalone library. Both options are fine, yet importing the QuTiP module (qutip.piqs) might be safest, as it occurred to a user, on a machine running Ubuntu, that a compiled component issue arose, which was resolved by downloading QuTiP with pip and using qutip.piqs.
Incidentally, exactly today we updated the arXiv paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05129, as the relative paper has just been published, mentioning in the comments of the QuTiP integration.
We will shortly update the online PIQS documentation to make this clearer. Also, more details on the functionalities included in QuTiP will be given in QuTiP’s 4.3.1 documentation, already some examples of use of qutip.piqs in QuTiP are given in the tutorials section under the “Permutational invariant Lindblad dynamics”, http://qutip.org/tutorials.html.
thanks for your message and info @nathanshammah. Indeed, just saw your paper on arxiv a few minutes ago! Nice that piqs is up to date in qutip.
