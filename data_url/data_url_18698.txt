Previously, logical-scheduler objects had 'print to stream' functionality, which we used in the HTTP reply package with the intention of offloading program statistics calculation to pyQuil / the end-user. Serialization modes for the new logical-scheduler structure are less obvious, so it's current ly left unimplementedâ€”with the consequence that this quilc option flag no longer works.
Either implement a serializer ( :) ) or abandon the flag ( :( ).
