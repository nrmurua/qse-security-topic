Description
The energies returned by LeapDQMSampler don't include offset.
Steps To Reproduce
Expected Behavior
When a DQM object is submitted to the hybrid solver, the sample set should have the correct energy with the offset.
This is because the server-side DQM solver does not have access to the offset. Simple solution is to recalculate the energy client-side. Or just add the missing offset.
We'll need an asynchronous SampleSet.recalculate_energies to do it "nicely". For now we can make a custom handler for constructing the sample set.
@hsadeghidw , can you get away with
for the time being?
Of course, but it's still nice if the energy returned is correct. Do you know which version of the dwave-system will have a fix?
