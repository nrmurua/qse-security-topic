Qiskit Terra: master
pip install qiskit-aer is putting the Aer provider into the qiskit meta package and not into the terra providers module:
So terra cannot find it:
Have this changed recently on Terra?
Where should Aer goes now?
It should still go into terra providers. But it seems that it goes into meta package on my machine.
How do you fix this? I'm new to programming.
I'm on Windows 10.
On all my envs, I don't have that Terra path in site-packages. @nonhermitian how did you install Terra? Seems like coming from an egg package (which is the old format of setuptools). We haven't tested packages installed via egg with packages installed via wheel, the latter is considered the standard way of packaging.
Is this a bug with aer install, or with the qiskit meta-package install?
I did setup.py install from terra sourse
If you install everything from source with no meta-package, then Aer does the right thing.  Will close.
