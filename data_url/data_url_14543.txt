Often circuits are built out of wrapping smaller circuits into one instruction, or out of pulse gates.  Right now both of these are shown as a box with a label.  Displaying their content by inlining would be a nice option.
The pulse part only makes sense in the matplotlib drawer. The inlined circuit potentially in all drawers (just do a dotted line and label the box, as described in this issue: #2944).
Could you maybe make a simple diagram @ajavadia that would help elaborate on what you had in mind?
