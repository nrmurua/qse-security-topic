Compiling longish sequences spends ~10% of them time creating APS2 instructions and converting them to 8 byte machine code and another 5% of the time creating Compiler.Waveform, most of which is in hash_shape. It also uses a non-trivial amount of memory. It seems both of these could be solved with conversion to immutable named tuples and caching.
