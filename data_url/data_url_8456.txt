Hi,
I was trying to run some simulations with Floquet formalism in Qutip in a Jupyter notebook, when I ran into a "The kernel appears to died unexpectedly, it will restart" error message.
I tried to understand what is happening, and it seems it is due to a segmentation fault. It happens also when run in CPython 3.5.2. gdb was not super useful, and I could not get it to output any interesting backtrace.
Manually tracking the issue down, it seems that qutip.floquet.floquet_modes call qutip.propagator.propagator which itself calls sesolve. As far as I could track the error down for the moment, it seems to happen in this call.
My code is quite lengthy, and I did not yet manage to isolate a small snippet to reproduce the error :/ Not sure what is the best way to debug this either :/
Thanks!
Sorry for the noise, I got what was wrong, it was basically a mistake from my part.
I was using a time-dependent hamiltonian written with strings, such as
and H_0 and H_1 had incompatible shapesâ€¦ :/ Maybe it would be worth adding an extra check on this, to ease debugging? Thanks!
It checks to make.sure.the dims are compatible.  It is gard to see how the dims can be correct, but the shapes wrong?
In my case,
and I don't get any error when running
apart from the Segmentation fault.
I think this is due to sesolve being called with _safe_mode=False here as running
gets me a Segmentation fault without any other error, but running
gives
Ahh, it is because I forgot to add the safety check to the propagator function.
