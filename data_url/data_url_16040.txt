Using parameters as arguments for delay gates generates error
CircuitError: 'Unsupported duration type.'
my circuit
have delay gate accept parameter as arguments
This type of functionality would be very useful for measuring T1 and other type of experiments (echo, etc.) that would require delays with variables times.
One solution here is to explicitly allow ParameterExpressions in Delay.__init__:
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/132c686/qiskit/circuit/delay.py#L26
The fix should include a test to make sure that attempting to schedule a circuit with a parameterized delay raises a useful error message (and that it can be successfully scheduled once bound), and that the isinstance(duration, int) if unit == 'dt' condition is still respected when the duration parameter is bound.
I'll work on this
