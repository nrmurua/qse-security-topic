The following command does not work
keithley.auto_range('off')
I expect the keithley to change the auto_range future
the keithley beeps and gives error -113
Which means (keithley manual Undefined header)
Is this because _set_mode_param uses self.mode() which gives (e.g.) 'dc current' instead of '"CURR:DC"\n'

I don't know who to tag in this, because I don't know who wrote the keithley_2000 driver.
Could you forward this @giulioungaretti ?

I wrote it. I made a small change in the mode parameter which I thought would work identically but clearly didn't :P. Daniel fixed the issue in #298 but this PR has some other issues and hasn't been merged yet. I'll take a look at it and fix it tomorrow morning.
