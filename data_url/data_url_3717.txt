throws the following error:
The type of the integer in a numpy array of all ints is unexpected:
That is strange, it works for me.

What's the different numpy versions?
Mine is 1.13.3
Might be a Python version thing. I'm on Python 3, numpy 1.13.3
I'm also affected by this. numpy 1.13.0, python 3.6.1 .
Fairly certain this is a Python 2 vs Python 3 issue. int in Python 3 is now what long was in Python 2 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0237/. NumPy's integers are not related to the native Python 3 int whereas they were in Python 2.
Python2
Python3
I'll make a PR.
Also for reference: The default numpy numerics complex and float types are compatible with Python 3:
