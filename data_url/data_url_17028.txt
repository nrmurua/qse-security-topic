Matplotlib version 3.0.3
/Users/kevin.krsulichibm.com/q/qiskit-terra/lib/python3.5/site-packages/matplotlib/figure.py:2369: UserWarning: This figure includes Axes that are not compatible with tight_layout, so results might be incorrect.
warnings.warn("This figure includes Axes that are not compatible "


Only occurs on the first call, so recalling the function will clear the warning
Hmm, I'm not able to reproduce this warning on linux in jupyter with either matplotlib 3.0.2 or matplotlib 3.1.1
It seems that might be a Mac thing. I also have one of the warnings.
This is not an issue for me as well.  I am using 3.1.1.
