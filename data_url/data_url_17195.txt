From discussions with @gadial , there seems to be some issues with the DAGCircuits returned by DAGCircuit.layers which can lead to inconsistent behavior, e.g. they cannot be drawn with the dag_drawer and calls to apply_operation_back will not consistently add gates to the end of the dag. e.g.
will generate
This seems to be constrained to the DAGCircuits built by dag.layers(), repeating the above on the original dag without going through layers consistently generates X-Id.
