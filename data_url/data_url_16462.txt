The benchmarking site has flagged a regression on transpile of circuits with optimization <= 2 after 35db627 merged. This is a bit unexpected since the primary change was on block collection and consolidation which is only run on level 3 (which got faster).

My working idea here is that this was caused by the addition of inline=True 35db627f#diff-d00f0de07831e0961cb92a4af5f40e5eR480 which makes the decomposition of unitaries from the input QV circuits slower.
