Evaluating the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of a parameterized circuit and subsequently converting it with PauliExpectation can yield a different and wrong QFI compared to evaluation without PauliExpectation. Specifically, the below example leads to negative eigenvalues of the positive-semidefinite QFI.
This was found together with @Zoufalc.
PauliExpectation should not change the QFI.
This issue seems to occur when a parameter is multiplied with a number as in rz(0.5*x[0], 0) and the issue could not be reproduced without such multiplication.
I obtain the same problem with AerPauliExpectation, I presume this is coming from somewhere in the QFI implementation.
I calculated the QFI of one example by hand so we can better compare the problems. This is the circuit I used
and here are the results
Note that the result with the PauliExpectation seems to disregard the coefficient 0.5 that we get from deriving RX(0.5 * theta). Similarly, AerPauliExpectation disregards that factor but on top has an additional factor of 4.
