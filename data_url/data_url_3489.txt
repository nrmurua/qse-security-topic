PyQuil supports Python 3.6 and 3.7 (and will generally support the latest two versions of Python). We depend on contextvars and dataclasses which are provided by backport packages for python 3.6 on pypi/pip. Conda-forge has these backport packages too but they are more strict and can only be installed on 3.6 and will refuse to install on 3.7. Please see conda-forge/pyquil-feedstock#6
The usual conda workaround is to use "selectors" to only include those two packages as dependencies if you're building a py36 package. However, we've been building a "noarch" package because pyQuil is written in pure Python and none of the code has any compatibility issues among the versions. You can't use "selectors" for a "noarch" package.
So--you might suggest--stop using "noarch" packages. I have been trying to do that (conda-forge/pyquil-feedstock#9) but it hasn't been working and I don't know how to debug.
The solution is probably to just vendor the two backport packages.
