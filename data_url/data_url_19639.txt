When I was digging the entanglement verification source, I found one thing probably incorrect.
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ignis/blob/405efbcf59e2e05306680f9c335040e16cf24e5f/qiskit/ignis/verification/entanglement/analysis.py#L192
In the qiskit/ignis/verification/entanglement/analysis.py line 192, I guess the first term of that line should be
 (F, F_m) = (.5*(P0 + P1) + np.sqrt(np.absolute(fft[qn])),
not,
(F, F_m) = (.5*(P0_m + P1_m) + np.sqrt(np.absolute(fft[qn])),
because first term represents the fidelity in the case we don't apply error mitigation.
The result could be different.
Not error mitigated fidelity should be composed of P0, P1, and C, not P0_m, P1_m, and C.
Fixing the variable names
Please let me know if my understanding is incorrect.
