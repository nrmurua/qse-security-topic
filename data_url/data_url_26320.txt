Dear developers,
I found the dipole print in qs_loc_dipole.F, line 113-145, as shown here:
This is in line with the berry formula
$$Dipole = -\frac{eL}{2\pi} Im\ln{\langle\psi| e^{i2\pi/L \sum_{I}{\hat{r_i}}} |\psi\rangle}$$.
I assume the leading - is for negative charges of electrons, so in code, it just adds -zwfc  in exponential part.
However in fist_efield_methos.F Line 227-284, as shown here
The dipole calculation in fist is different because:
Hi
I don't know about the signs. There could be another sign switch at a latter stage, so only a test for the final
output can be conclusive.
I agree with you on the second point. The correct way to handle this would be by using the atan2 function.
should be
and the derivative as to be adjusted accordingly.
Hello, I reimplemented the berry formulas from cp2k in the Jupyter notebook to benchmark the results.
using the function get_traj_dipole with the version = "qs" or "fist" can obtain the dipoles from cp2k position files.
to_issue_dipoles.zip
Indeed, the version = 'fist' outputs the negative dipoles.
In addition, I run the MD with the electric field of [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
The water molecules are aligned opposite to the direction of the electric field.
