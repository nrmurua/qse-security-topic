Using EXT_RESTART together with MULTIPLE_UNIT_CELL and COORD_FILE results in a CPASSERT with a somewhat minimal error message
The line is

Input file (based on Si example)
si.xyz
In the restart file, the MULTIPLE_UNIT_CELL 1 1 2 calculation is translated into a MULTIPLE_UNIT_CELL 1 1 1 calculation with a doubled cell, which likely causes the issue.
Interestingly, the issue is not raised (i.e. I can restart without problems) when specifying the coordinates directly in the CP2K input file like so:
It would be nice if
I guess the easiest fix (which is also clear for the user to comprehend) is to not emit COORD_FILE in the RESTART file (I always wondered but never checked what CP2K is doing if both &COORD and COORD_FILE are present), and raise an error if both are given (optionally a warning that the coord file is ignored with an explicit &COORD section).
The more elaborate one would be to preserve everything.
