This issue is regarding the organization of the circuit library, and in particular of the N-local circuits:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html#n-local-circuits
EvolvedOperatorAnsatz gate is not under N-local circuits, although its basis is NLocal,
While QAOAAnsatz gate whose basis is EvolvedOperatorAnsatz is under N-local circuits.
See the circuit library documentation: https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html
EvolvedOperatorAnsatz gate should be also in the N-local circuits directory https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html#n-local-circuits
Move EvolvedOperatorAnsatz gate to the N-local circuits directory https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit_library.html#n-local-circuits
Note that this should be handled in two steps.
First, one should add the gate in the correct place.
Then, in the following release, one can start the deprecation process.
I would like to do this.
thanks @Ca1eb3 - I assigned you to this issue!
