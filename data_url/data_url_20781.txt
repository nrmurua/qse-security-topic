We've each time removed schemes that were dropped from the NIST competition. @Bob10918 just very kindly contributed the updated version of the LEDAcryptKEM code, but LEDAcryptKEM had since the end of Round 2 been removed from PQClean.
This raises the question: do we want to open up to non-NIST schemes?
I'm inclined to say no, we should not open up more, as we already have a fairly limited bandwidth to maintain the current schemes ourselves.
I'm against merging non-NIST schemes.
I don't think there is much interest in non-NIST / non-Chinese schemes at the moment.
Having more schemes inevitably results in more maintenance work in PQClean as well as in downstream projects like https://github.com/mupq/pqm4. Sure, we could provide an easy way to filter those out, but I think the added complexity is not worth it imho.
Once you merge non-NIST schemes, the next logical request would be to also have XMSS and LMS. It would just require a small tweak to the API. I really don't want to go down that path.
For OQS we are focused solely on NIST schemes for now.  If things start happening outside of NIST that gain significant traction, then there would be a reason to revisit that.
I think we've got consensus. Sorry @Bob10918, but I don't think we will be merging #387.
I hope that the testing framework was helpful to find any issues in the code, at least.
