Are they using the same GCC version?
The warning is something coming with GCC >=v10 and it is completely harmless.
the GCC version is 11.2.0. I think they use the same version.
these warnings could not be recorded by  "tee" command but it printed out on the screen.
In any case, they are harmless...
