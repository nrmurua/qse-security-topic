Implement the BranchingPulseTemplate and LoopPulseTempalte classes.
Implementation should include all methods required to define a pules using the class but not yet the translation to waveforms (see #20).
Part of #13.
Requires clarification of the issue #28 .
BranchPulseTemplate still needs to be implemented.
