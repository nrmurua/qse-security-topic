Following on from #1007, @jlbosse also improved in #984 some of the error messages for PauliSum and PauliTerm objects, but they certainly could continue to improve. A valid approach would be to separate errors into those concerned with operators and those concerned with coefficients, and to create custom exceptions that point users in the right direction for creating a valid object from a Pauli string.
