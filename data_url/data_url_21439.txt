Novatech409b control breaks in stable release of ARTIQ 7.
Pinging the novatech409b fails when using artiq_session or when starting the controller manager manually and calling ping via sipyco_rcptool.
Everything seems to work normally when using ARTIQ v7.8050.8599be5.beta. I have not tracked down for which commit the problem starts with.
Pinging the device in the stable release of ARTIQ returns True, as it does  for ARTIQ v7.8050.8599be5.beta.
I have not tracked down for which commit the problem starts with.
I don't have the hardware and I think many people also stopped using this device. So if you don't debug this, nobody will.
Moved to m-labs/novatech409b#2
