Hello, I am a newcomer to ZX calculus and PyZX so please pardon my ignorance.
I am running the demo notebook gettingstarted.ipynb using the PyZX 0.7 release. The demo starts by generating a random Clifford circuit but with the seed set to 1337. I notice that this is the same circuit as the web page https://pyzx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html.
However when I run the notebook, the simplified ZX diagram after clifford_simp() and normalize() is slightly different (both diagrams have 8 Z-spiders, but the phases and edges don't quite match) and after extract_circuit() the circuits are vastly different. The result on the web page is much simpler, it has just 9 Z spiders, 9 X spiders, and 6 Hadamard edges, whereas the result in my notebook is a much longer circuit, 39 Z spiders, 6 X spiders, and 18 Hadamard edges.
Am I doing something wrong, or was the demo web page perhaps created using an earlier version of PyZX? (e.g. I notice there is a call to Circuit.to_graph(), which doesn't appear to be in the current API) It would certainly be nice to get that simpler result, if that is also correct ...
You are not doing anything wrong. There must have been some changes to the rewriting strategy that cause this particular circuit to be brought to a different normal form that is less good. I don't know how you can get back the old one, sorry.
