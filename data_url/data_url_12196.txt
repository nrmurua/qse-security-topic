Hello.
I just updated QISKit to 0.7.0.
I get the import error
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
ImportError: cannot import name 'QuantumCircuit' from 'qiskit' (unknown location)
when using
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
I tried to uninstall and reinstall QISKit, and also to change my code into
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
The error I get now is
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit.qasm'
Is there any way to downgrade QISKit to 0.6.0? Or to fix the issue?
Thanks a lot
Uninstalling Python before reinstalling QISKit fixed the problem
Hi @nico0008
did you solve your issue? I had the same and I'm looking the way to fix it.
ImportError: cannot import name 'IBMQ' from 'qiskit' (/Users/parfait/anaconda3/envs/Qiskitenv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/qiskit/init.py)
My using Python version 3.7.1 and QISKIT versiom : 0.7.0
Many thanks
Yeah after uninstalling Python, and also Qiskit. Now I have Python 3.7.2 and Qiskit 0.7.0, and the beginning of my code is the following:
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, register
import numpy as np
from qiskit import *
from qiskit import IBMQ
from qiskit import BasicAer
import Qconfig
Good luck!
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, register
import numpy as np
from qiskit import *
from qiskit import IBMQ
from qiskit import BasicAer
import Qconfig
Thanks @nico0008 !!!
I'm going to try it now.
One more question... do you use Jupyter or anaconda and set the environment.yml?
I just copy this code to test... but i find difficulties https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/index.ipynb
Thanks for your help!

Hello,
No problem! No I do not use Jupyter nor anaconda... I just use visual studio to code in python and added Qiskit extension! Which code do you mean?
Great!!!
I started with artificial_intelligence (qsvm_kernel_classification.ipynb) under aqua. I had the modules problems. So I decide to test the hello_zero.ipynb and still having the same problem. ImportError: cannot import name 'IBMQ' from 'qiskit' (/Users/parfait/anaconda3/envs/Qiskitenv/lib/python3.7/site-packages/qiskit/init.py)
NameError: name 'qiskit' is not defined and so on.
Thanks
I've been fighting with the same problem more than once in the past, and the only thing which always worked for me is uninstalling python and reinstalling it, even if it may not be the best way to solve it.
If I were you I would try uninstall and reinstall it, I think it will work then :)
I will follow your advise... can you give me the step you follow?
thx
I guess you should search python or anaconda in your computer's programs, uninstall them, and you can also delete all the files in C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python or whatever this path is in the case of your anaconda distribution
Hi @nico0008 Fixed!!!
The real problem is having more than one installation and instance...
Many thanks for your help!
I very appreciated it!!
@pifparfait Oh cool I'm glad you fixed it! You're welcome! And thank you for the info ;)
Hi,
You can find more details on the installation here:
