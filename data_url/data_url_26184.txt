RTD is set to build the latest version of the repo.
If we enable stable version to be the default version, it fails.  Stable version's last commit is fbea718


Stable version is set to v1.0.4 when it should be at v1.0.5 because that's the latest version.

The build for all earlier versions lead to failures.

Probably a reason why the earlier versions are not accessible in the flyout menu and not built by RTD even though they have been activated.

Need to figure out a way to use the older build yml file for v1.0-v1.0.5. All earlier versions are missing build os lines.

v1.0.4 : https://github.com/vprusso/toqito/blob/fbea7189a78359f5f666a5c3f5867f7577f9f423/.readthedocs.yml

v1.0.2: https://github.com/vprusso/toqito/blob/076592a95b3e7c8ff4f5a892ffa88348a57aab1f/.readthedocs.yml

The easiest option is to create branches for these older versions instead of building from tags.

Is fixed through setttings in RTD and branches discussed in #331.
Did not require a PR.
