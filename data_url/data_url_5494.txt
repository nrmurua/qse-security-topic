There is currently an unstated assumption that ordering-file cuts list the qubits they affect in index order (i.e. 'cut 28 40' is valid, but 'cut 40 28' is not). This causes segfaults if the qubits are given in the wrong order.
To resolve this, cuts read from file should be internally re-ordered to be in the correct order.
