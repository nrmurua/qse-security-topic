Check-type validation raises several errors in [type-arg] for missing ndarray. See discussion in #1118.
Removed #1156 from 0.15.0 milestone - solve #1214 in 0.15.0 milestone instead (incremental fix).
Upgrading numpy to a version greater than 1.21 will also fix the one security vulnerability we have open.
