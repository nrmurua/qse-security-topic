The goal of this enhancement is to set up a basic test suite for benchmarking the performance of scqubits between releases and branches. We aim to use the asv package which already implements much of such functionality.
A simple tutorial of how asv works can be set up is shown here
Possible implementation steps:
Install asv.
Run asv quickstart to set up the default configuration.
Edit the newly created benchmarks/benchmarks.py by updating the TestSuite with some number of "reasonable" tests (those should include some number of tests that have already been implemented here).
Make sure that the benchmarking process works and can be ran (see asv's documentation: at the very least test that something like  asv run branch1..branch2 runs the benchmark that compares the performance between a couple of different branches).
Hi, I'm interested in working on this issue as part of the Unitary Hack. Is it possible for me to be assigned to this challenge?
Thanks.
Hi @D3vanagar1
sorry for the slow response - i've been traveling.
You've now been assigned - great that you will be working on this bounty.
Hi @D3vanagar1 just checking in as the hackathon will be over soon. Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this bounty.
Hi @petergthatsme. Sorry, haven't had too much time to work on it as I got quite sick over the past couple weeks. Been slowly getting back into it over the weekend and should get alot done today.
