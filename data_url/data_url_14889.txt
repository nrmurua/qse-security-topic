This issue about the IAE algorithm showed different results when running on the runtime Sampler vs Aer Sampler. After some investigation, the issue seems to be caused by the serialization of the multi-controlled RY gate that is used to build the state preparation circuit.
After discussing it with @Cryoris, we had the theory that the parameters were not properly stored, but I am not sure, because the printed before/after circuits look the same (see here circuit for the example presented below)
[Edit] After further inspection, the parameters are stored but the circuit instructions are not using them properly.
Before serializing the circuit shown in the example, circ.data contains:
Where, before serializing:
And after serializing:
So it looks like qpy is only reading the initial parameter (0) and applying it to all gates.
Let's say we have a circuit with multi-controlled RY gates (the issue is more evident the larger the amount of gates, but I wanted to keep the example small):
Let's now dump and load the circuit again:
And run an exact simulation using the reference Sampler:
(I am not re-using the primitive instance because it caches the circuits).
The results should be identical, and yet, they are not:
Similarly, if we try the Aer Sampler:
If we configure the runtime sampler to match the Aer Sampler settings, we get that in both cases the runtime results match the "after serialization" aer results:
Finally, if we transpile the circuit locally (uncommenting the line in the first snippet), all results match the "before serialization" aer/reference ones (which is the expected outcome in any case).
Serializing the circuit should not change the result of the sampler.
