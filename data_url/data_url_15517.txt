#7643 implemented mocked IBM Quantum Systems backends using the new BackendV2 interface.
The BackendV2 class contains pulse channels (drive_channel, measure_channel, acquire_channel, control_channel) that were not implemented by #7643.
It's unclear to me whether these channels are useful for fake backends. If they are useful, we should add them.
Closed by #8444
