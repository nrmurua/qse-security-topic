Even though there is the fock_matrix attribute in the documentation of MolecularData, it doesn't seem to be implemented.
Could you make an update here, please?
Are you going through Psi4 or Pyscf to get integrals?
Let me expand, In canonical orbitals the fock matrix is diagonal with entries as the MO-energies.  So you could construct it simply.  In non-canonical orbitals (an arbitrary orthogonal basis) you can construct the fock operator in the usual way.
Sorry for the late reply. I mean the Fock matrix in terms of atomic orbitals, which is discussed here. Though there is a mention of this attribute in the docstring of MolecularData, in this line, I couldn't find its actual implementation.

I am using both of them, having the same problem. Thank you.
Ahh, I realized that it can be derived from Roothaan's equation since the canonical orbital, overlap, and orbital energies are given.
