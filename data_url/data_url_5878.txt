When someone uses from_backend to 'mimic' a real backend, the 'local' configuration property is set to False which causes problems In qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance. As described on issue qiskit-community/qiskit-aqua#1551
The 'local' property should remain unchanged since the backend is still local.
Keep 'local' configuration property unchanged, set to 'True'
@chriseclectic Any comment on this as this is causing Aqua to treat a local simulator, and the way we interact with it, as if it were a remote one based on this local flag.
I don't really understand why you would need to do anything special depending on local vs remote for simulators, simulator vs not simulator should probably be enough, but either way it's a simple enough fix.
Thanks Chris. To answer why we also have remote simulators. Anything remote had that configurable wait time; hence the test. At that point in code it does not care whether its a simulator or real device, all it cared about was the extra config that I guess is around how long we wait for remote, that does not apply when local.
