#7643 implemented mocked IBM Quantum Systems backends using the new BackendV2 interface.
However, noisy simulation of qasm job using FakeBackendV2 is not possible because Aer doesn't support generating NoiseModel from V2 backends. As a temporary solution, a modified code of NoiseModel.from_backend that supports V2 backends (FakeBackendV2._get_noise_model_from_backend_v2)was added to the mocked backend in Terra. We should add native support of V2 backends in Aer and remove the temporary solution code from FakeBackendV2.
Related to Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1477 and #7831
Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1484 added support for BackendV2 in Aer. We should update FakeBackend.run.
@HuangJunye I'd like to work on this. Can you please assign this issue to me?
@ozamanan Thanks for your interest in contribution! I have assigned you. @cometta is working on a closely related issue #7831. Just want to let you know to keep an eye on each other's PR when they are submitted. Feel free to contact me on GitHub or Qiskit Slack if you need help.
