In master equation solver, the case where collapse operator = None vs the case where collapse operator = [0 * some matrix] outputs different results. This behavior can be found here.
fid1: 0.911130904224875 fid2: 0.8301538149349885 Is fid1 = fid2? False
Both cases should give the same output, say x.
No response
When no c_ops are passed, mesolve fallback to sesolve and the output states are ket.
ket1.overlap(ket2) (fid1) is computed as < ket1 | ket2 >, while dm.overlap(psi) (fid2) as <psi | dm | psi>.
You can see that fid1**2 == fid2, up to numerical noise.
It looks like the mystery is solved!
