I tried to run artiq on a windows 32-bit machine. Installation using "conda instasll artiq" works and I am able to start artiq_master. As calling the artiq_gui, it throws the exception as in the picture below.

This has been tested both in the standard windows cmd and starting from cygwin console as well. For both cases, it shows the same traceback sequence.
This is due to bug #39
