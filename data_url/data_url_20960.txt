Hi Guys,
I find pool git link of https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/pool/ is incorrect(pls check the pic). It still points to https://docs.theqrl.org/mining/pool/ instead of a github address. Can any one tell me which fork of zone117x node-cryptonote-pool should be used? Many thanks.

no one reply, just close it~~
@jackalyst (Jack) and @fr1t2 (James) can you take a look to this
Fix in the works, awaiting approval. Thanks for pointing this out @darcymei and sorry for the broken link!
