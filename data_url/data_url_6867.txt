Is it possible to create a gate that accept inputs the same way the Compare gates do ?
If not possible please try to add this feature as soon as you can...
And  of course, thank you for your awesome simulator...
There is limited support for creating custom gates that accept inputs. The trick is to put input-requiring gates inside of the custom gate, and then supply the inputs from the outside.
For example, put two +A gates into the circuit, then create a custom circuit gate:

And then you have a fancy new gate:
