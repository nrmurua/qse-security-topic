cu3 & u2 are deprecated:
Thanks for reporting the issue. Yes, you are absolutely right u1, u2, u3 gates and the controlled versions of them have been deprecated. Would you mind creating a pull request to replace u1, u2, u3 gates with the more generic u gates in the tutorial?
Please let me know if you are new to making open source contributions and will need some help!
Took a stab at correcting the notebook. There were the two code blocks that were throwing the deprecation warnings, however there were also references to the deprecated gates in the verbiage as well. Those should have all been corrected with the PR.
