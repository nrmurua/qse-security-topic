Hi QuEST team :)
I'm a student majoring in the architecture of GPU and  i have written a original version of multi-node && multi-GPU. I have some questions and i did't find email address to send email. So i come here and want to get a email address to  ask some questions:)

Our email address is plainly stated in the Contact section of the README, as quest@materials.ox.ac.uk. However, we've been getting many questions about multi-GPU, so would prefer you ask your questions in this Github issue, to reduce duplication.
got it
