In qiskit/aqua/operators/common.py, the evolution_instruction added a barrier to every slice. As a result, it added a lot of barrier when using the feature map functions(In fact, it added a barrier for every single qubit operation). With N qubits, the feature map circuit length increased N times.
It's good to remove the barrier or add an option to control the barrier with default disabled.
This has been implemented in #697
