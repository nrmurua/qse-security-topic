Hii!! Sorry to bother, but I have been looking at backends/abstract for the partial trace function and I have seen it is not implemented yet. However, when computing the entanglement entropy from callbacks I saw that it uses the partial trace function, which as I said it does not seem implemented yet. I would like to ask if you know how the entanglement entropy is computed then and if there is an explicit way on qibo to estimate the partial trace. It would be very useful for my Master Thesis and for qibo, as we will try to implement some of our work in the qibo repository.
The methods aren't implemented in the abstract class Backend. Rather, they're implemented in specific backend classes, like the NumpyBackend below:
https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/blob/master/src/qibo/backends/numpy.py#L641
If an specific backend do not have its particular implementation of a method, the method defaults to the NumpyBackend method.
