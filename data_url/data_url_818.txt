Describe the bug
Pi is interpreted as a FreeParameter when one imports a circuit from an OpenQASM3. However, it cannot be substituted and it is not recognized as a float or a sympy.Float so it remains a FreeParameter.
Additionally, the following snippet works but should not:
As pi is a builtin constant in OQ3, we could forbid the declaration of the pi identifier and standardize the behavior between the BDK and the local simulator.
To reproduce
Expected behavior
As pi seems to be defined as sympy.Pi (see circuit.instructions[0].operator.angle.expression), unitary could be evaluated if the FreeParameterExpression is evaluated in to_matrix.
Edit: remove unnecessary code in the second snippet.
This is fixed with #829
