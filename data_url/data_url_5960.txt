The output is
Are these behaviors as expected? I'm concerned about the following points:
I just found the expectaiton value of Y is correct for statevector_simulator.
the output is
I have checked this for other input states.
However, variances are still zero.
Value: I guess that there is a bug in the stabilizer simulator. In the previous execution you were probably automatically directed to the stabilizer simulator, whereas in the second execution you explicitly asked for the non-stabilizer simulator.
Variance: as long as there is no noise it is expected to be 0, because we compute <psi|Y|psi> (we don't perform average of measurement results).
Thank you for the comment.
I checked about value.
the output is
so I obtained correct value. Your guess seems correct.
For variance, we should return the population variance for (at least) the statevector simulator.
This is a non-zero value. (because <X^2>-<X>^2 = 1 - <X>^2 â‰  0 in general)
The variance in snapshots is only the sample variance over noise for each shot of the snapshotted value: eg for 5-shots you have shot_values = [val0, val1, val2, val3, val4], then the returned quantity is mean(shot_values), variance(shot_values) and is (usually) 0 for ideal simulations since the values are all identical. This is somewhat confusing so I am planning on removing it and just returning the mean for average snapshot types.
The first issue was fixed in #849 .
For the second issue, I discussed with @chriseclectic , and it's good to remove the variance parameter and my proposed variance should be done in other instructions.
So I think this issue is closable.
Thanks a lot.
