Seems the nightly build is failing due to the following tests:
It seems multiprocessing.Process in LocalExecutor may be attempting to pickle the args, which apparently happens on the spawn start method, a little bit of info on this from https://medium.com/devopss-hole/python-multiprocessing-pickle-issue-e2d35ccf96a9.
Furthermore pickle cannot seemingly serialize local functions as defined in the pytest tests tests/covalent_tests/executor/executor_plugins/local_test.py hence the failure.
