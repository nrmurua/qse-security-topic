In much the same spirit as #145, it would make sense to have a consistent indexing pattern amongst the functions offered in toqito. We should also make this change in the permute_systems.py file as well.
That is, the indexing offset for permute_systems starts at 1 but to be consistent with the rest of the functions (and indeed, to be more intuitive from the perspective of a Python programmer) it should assume an index starting at 0.
