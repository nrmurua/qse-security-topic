The VQE simulation of H2o molecule results in memory error:

MemoryError: Unable to allocate 4.00 GiB for an array with shape (16384, 16384) and data type complex128
However, my computer has enough memory, my other script reqesting much larger memory still works fine.
using H2O molecule, VQE with UCCSD ansatz, L_BFGS_B optimizer,
With earlier version of qiskit-aqua (0.6.5) VQE simulation of the H2O molecule does not have such a problem.
Are you using statevector_simulator? If so this is most likely the same issue as #1027 and in which case might I suggest you use the Aer qasm_simulator and set use_custom to True on VQE (see https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.aqua.algorithms.VQE.html for docs on this). This will use the custom Aer snapshot instruction to compute the expectation (uses AerPauliExpectation object inside VQE to do this - though you can pass this in explicitly to VQE). Overall this mode is more efficient too than running with statevector and like statevector has the ideal outcome without shot noise.
Yes, it is a statevector_simulator. Thank you for the hint, it indeed solves the problem.
