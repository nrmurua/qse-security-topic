Grammar error with lines 24-26, 28 and 45.
If we comment out defcals in pong.qasm and run the tests, the tests will fail.
The test should pass even if the defcals are not present. The issue was hidden by the defcal grammar:
Note the wildcard non-greedy match LBRACE .*? RBRACE. Since Antlr will try to match the entire file, if there is any invalid syntax after defcal, Antlr will match everything after defcal to the defcal body and thus hides the error.
The current grammar cannot parse the following:
Need to fix either grammar or the example.
I think in this case we need a fix to both - pong.qasm seems to be mixing OpenPulse in with OpenQASM outside defcal blocks, so it shouldn't be valid, and the ANTLR grammar should represent that.
For others: this is a real manifestation of the problems discussed in #246, where there are also some suggestions for ways to improve the grammar around here.  As a summary: the main consideration is that whatever token captures the defcal block should not interfere with any calibration grammar which may want to use the "end brace" character internally.  The suggested solutions to this were along the lines of:
