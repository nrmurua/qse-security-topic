f3c7a7d
The files in f3c7a7d, except test_ad9154_status.py that can be reintroduced as-is, do other manipulations to the JESD core that are a bit annoying to support over DRTIO. What about moving them to firmware? Perhaps those tests could be run at each boot.
Running them at Sayma boot is good. Depending on the clocking we might have to delay that though.
The satellite manager should be capable of bringing up all the clocking by itself.
Though I remember there was some crash/bug that required a reboot of the device after STAPL or PRBS test had been done. Is that fixed? Cc @enjoy-digital
@sbourdeauducq: that's possible you will need to reconfigure the device ADI chip after the STAPL/PRBS. That's something I can test/fix if needed when I'll be integrating and the core on Sayma.
Also supports I2C.
