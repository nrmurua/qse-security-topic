The signature of exponential_map is:
But at least MemoryReference can also be provided on the second chained invocation.

This is not a run-time bug. I'm observing type check warning highlighting in PyCharm. I'm assuming running eg. mypy would output the following error:

Hey, Mark. Would you provide a MWE that triggers the mypy warning?
Hi @notmgsk - so I just checked and my assumption about mypy was wrong. It seems PyCharm has its own native implementation of the relevant PEPs pertaining to type checking and does this inside the IDE. You will have to install PyCharm community edition and have it point at an environment with pyquil installed to see the issue.
The MWE is then:
Here, gammas[0] will be highlighted as an error, as per the above.
