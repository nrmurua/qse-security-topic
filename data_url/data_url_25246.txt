I ran into an issue with pip install covalent because my environment used Python 3.11. After looking at the Compatibility page, I noticed that 3.11 wasn't listed as a supported version for earlier macOS versions.
My suggestion would be to add the latest macOS version (13, Ventura) to the compatibility overview.
Additionally, might it be a good idea to add Python 3.11 as "not currently supported"?
This should probably be closed since the corresponding PR is merged.
