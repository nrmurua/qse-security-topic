ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit.util'
You must be running a very old version of Qiskit - qiskit.aqua has not existed for over two years now.  You should look into upgrading to a recent version of Qiskit (0.45 is the most recent), and the optimisation module has long since been a separate package: qiskit-optimization on PyPI, which has its documentation here.
If you have further problems with the optimisation module, I suggest you open them at https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-optimization, which is where that module lives now - it's not a part of core Qiskit.
As @jakelishman mentioned, there is big chances that you are running packages that are unmaintained or reached end-of-life support, so I'm closing this issue. If you still thing that there is a bug in the current supported version of Qiskit, please leave a comment or open a new issue with instructions on how to reproduce the problem and the version of Qiskit and Python you are running.
