Hello all,
My team is working on a program with arbitrary gates controlled by multiple qubits in pyQuil. After looking through the docs, we found that we prefer the QubitPlaceholder method of program construction so that's what we've been using. We ran into a problem today where the address_qubits() function that maps placeholders to actual qubits is dropping the CONTROLLED modifier on gates.
Here's a simple repro test case for the problem:
During execution, here are the first four instructions of the original program:
But these are the first four instructions of assigned_program:
The CONTROLLED modifiers got dropped, which causes the compiler to fail with this output:
We've tried this with different numbers of control qubits (including 1) and with other gates (H, Z), and it always fails.
The circuit works fine if we don't use QubitPlaceholder and just explicitly define the qubit indices during program construction, so we're doing that as a workaround. However, we do prefer the mapping flexibility of the QubitPlaceholder system, so we'd like to switch back to that if this issue can be resolved.
Thanks!
