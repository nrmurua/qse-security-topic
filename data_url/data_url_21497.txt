Startup kernel aborts due to "not a shared library for current architecture"
Startup kernel runs (and in this case does nothing)
Following error message in UART log
This isn't the cleanest setup at the moment - we're using gateware built from our own fork, last upstream commit cca654b (with the rest of artiq also at this state). I tried using artiq_compile in a fresh environment from the stable channel, and this also failed.
Is this linked to the move away from or1k and I'm in some sort of broken in-between state, having built gateware from an intermediate commit?
Conda list for custom environment: artiq-ndscan.txt
Conda list for artiq 6 environment: artiq-6.txt
You need to compile the startup kernel with the same ARTIQ major version used to compile the gateware. ARTIQ-7 (since recently) uses RISC-V whereas ARTIQ-6 still uses OpenRISC (and will not move to RISC-V).
I get the same error using artiq_compile from the same commit referenced above (i.e. using artiq_compile from the same point that the gateware was built, modulo our own additions), but I'll pull all in the upstream changes and try again.
Is this resolved?
