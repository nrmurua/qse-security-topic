Now that llvmlite supports Python 3.8, we could feasibly create Python wheels for 3.8. I believe llvmlite was the last dependency holdout, but I could be mistaken.
This should be as simple as removing cp38-* from the environment variable CIBW_SKIP in .circleci/config.yml and appveyor.yml, and the new wheels should start being built. However, additional debugging could be required.
More information about configuring Appveyor and CircleCI for building wheels can be found over at the cibuildwheel repository.
