I've tried running calibratepulses and after it compiles the first 8- sequences and takes that data if fails with this error message:
Attempted to access data(0); index must be a positive integer or logical.
Error in PulseCalibration.analyzeRabiAmp (line 20)
if data(end/2) > offset
Error in PulseCalibration/PulseCalibrationDo (line 46)
[piAmpGuesses(1), offsetPhases(1)] = obj.analyzeRabiAmp(data(1:end/2));
Error in PulseCalibration/Do (line 207)
obj.PulseCalibrationDo();
Error in calibratePulses (line 32)
pulseCal.Do();
So it looks like it just isn't taking any data. I changed the ExpParams.measurements from M1 to the new M1_KernalIntegrator that we are using. Not sure if this is correct though.
Any Ideas?
I don't have any insight at the moment.  For the record you're on the develop branch at a commit somewhere around 1/12/15 right?  Could you run
Or see what the last commit was?
It looks like the last commit was on 1/16/15.
Can you tell me the comment or the commit hash?  There were some changes made that day to some of the objective function code.
This issue was fixed in ee3dbc1.
