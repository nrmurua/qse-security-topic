I'm attempting to build an RPM package for oqs-openssl to work with our team's build infrastructure. I have compiled oqs-openssl before however I'm running into some difficulty with the RPM.
The cmake step for liboqs is producing the following error:
meth.o -c -o crypto/ec/oqs_meth.o crypto/ec/oqs_meth.c crypto/ec/oqs_meth.c: In function 'get_oqs_alg_name': crypto/ec/oqs_meth.c:198:14: error: 'OQS_SIG_alg_default' undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean 'OQS_SIG_alg_count'? return OQS_SIG_alg_default; ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ OQS_SIG_alg_count
Has anyone else tried building an RPM for this package?
Could you please clone oqs-openssl again: We yesterday merged #313 that removed any reference to 'OQS_SIG_alg_default'.
That worked, thank you. However when running oqs-openssl and attempting tog enerate a new dilithium2 key I get an illegal instruction error.
If possible could you advise on the files I'll need to deliver as part of my RPM package?
At present I'm including the following:
I get an illegal instruction error.
This sounds like a build problem: Are you building and executing on different machines? Quite possibly for an RPM package I guess... The same problem appears when doing docker images on an x86_64 machine with some CPU extensions that not all x86_64 machines provide (say AVX512): For this purpose we provided the build option OQS_DIST_BUILD: Be sure to build the RPM for the liboqs.a (and/or liboqs.so -- depending on what you want to ship) with this option set. For an idea what to include in a binary distribution (and how to use the build option above), you may want to check our oqs-demos Dockerfiles, e.g., the one for curl also containing oqs-openssl
Thanks for the handy tips, I've got it working

Great to hear and Thanks for letting us know. Would this be anything you feel might be worth-while for others to use, too? Maybe a contribution to oqs-demos?
Yeah, I'd love to add it to oqs-demos. It's for a niche operating system however it can probably be abstracted to other OS's quite easily.  I'll clear it with my Open Source team first.
