Here is a minimal example that reproduces the bug:
This produces the output:
The mean photon of mode 2 and 3 should be different from mode 1 because the squeezing parameters are different.
Thanks for discovering and reporting this @trevor-vincent!
I've determined that the source of this bug is the function tfbackend/ops.py:reduced_density_matrix (used internally when computing mean_photon). The final for loop in this function fails to account for the fact that removing subsystems in reduced_state will cause the mode indices m to be "off by one" for each subsystem that has been previously removed during the loop.
This is a bug at a core part of the codebase, so is high priority to fix. Thankfully, the fix looks relatively simple, something along the lines of:
