Hi, I'm doing some experiments of running google supremacy circuits (GRCS)
with hybrid schrodinger-feynman simulator in the DDSIM package.
When I try to run some benchmark, for example, when I do
./ddsim_simple --simulate_file_hybrid 5x5/inst_5x5_12_0.txt --nthreads 4 --ps
it is not finished even after more than 12 hours.
The weird thing is that when I change the nthreads to 8, e.g.
./ddsim_simple --simulate_file_hybrid 5x5/inst_5x5_12_0.txt --nthreads 8 --ps.
it ends in the less than 30s.
It seems that the "simulateHybridAmplitudes" function (which is in the HybridSchrodingerFeynmanSimulator.cpp),
the taskflow block is not finished so it can not go further to the next lines.
But this is just my opinion and I still don't know what's happening.
Can you please check this is reproducable and real problem?

Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. I was able to recreate your report and will try to look into this.
From a first glance, I can see that with ./ddsim_simple --simulate_file_hybrid 5x5/inst_5x5_12_0.txt --nthreads 4 --ps the process uses no cpu. Thank you for your pointer to the simulateHybridAmplitudes, I'll start from there.
Thank you very much.
By the way, I also found that the hybrid simulation does not give us correct amplitudes.
When I used the --pv option to check the simulation results, it just gave me the zero state.
If you figure this out, please let me know.
Could you try #216 and see wether this change fixes the issue at hand?
#216 This fixes the termination issue. Now it finishes well. But it still gives the zero state with --pv option.
The HybridSchr√∂dingerFeynman-Simulator is a bit tricky in this regard, I pushed a quick fix so you can use it without delay.
Background: The HSF Simulator with mode amplitudes never stores the final resulting decision diagram, but this is where the abstract base class Simulator expects the data. The python bindings explicitly have the get_final_amplitudes methods to work around that.
Okay, I see.
Thank you for your quick responses!
