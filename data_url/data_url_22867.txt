Hi, just bought the x-channel system with one primary and one secondary RP. Tried to run Pyrpl on both and could not launch the application on either.. I was able to run Pyrpl on the primary with an older (stable) SD-image but that is no use since the x-channel streaming only works with the new beta image. The secondary RP is not even detected when trying to launch Pyrpl.
Erros when trying to launch Pyrpl on primary RP with beta image:
ERROR:pyrpl.redpitaya_client:Error: wrong control sequence from server
WARNING:pyrpl.modules:Exception <class 'TypeError'> was raised while _setup_ongoing was True: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable, <traceback object at 0x000001AA0AB5F3C0>
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
I suppose there might be an OS-update with the x-channel system, making it incompatible with the current Pyrpl build?
My question:
Can I expect Pyrpl to ever work with the RP x-channel system?
If so, when?
and if it should already work with the x-channel system, please let me know how.
