This is how things are done now:
I see the following problems:
1- I think save_account instead of add_account is more appropriate for saving to disk
2- remove_accounts() and remove_account() should be merged. I think we can just have remove_accounts(), which can take a single credentials or a filter on hub/group/project. Leaving empty removes all accounts. This would mirror load_accounts().
3- I think we need separate functions for add/remove in session and save/delete in disk.
So how about add_account/remove_account only targeting the session, and save_account/delete_account targeting disk. This way there's more control, and the function purposes are more clear.
So I propose the following:
In the above, 'token', 'url', 'hub', 'group', 'project' can be part of **kwargs filtering. The big advantage is that you don't need to supply long tokens and urls (e.g. can just specify a certain hub as shorthand). This is the real advantage over using Qconfig I think, otherwise it would be similar.
@ajavadia you're killing me. I have to say I agree with you but yeah lets put more fire on the qiskit 0.6 update.
Are you sold on add vs use? Use is all I used in the examples. We could make the other name changes and this would not break anything except documentation.
Saying this I think it is clear I need to make a backend example.
so we would use
The disable just does one like the use and delete is for the harddrive.
^ I concur. Will work towards this.
great. this breaks none and then i can make an example after highlighting the admin
Slight changes to the above after discussions:
Waiting for #1000 to be merged.
