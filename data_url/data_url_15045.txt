The transpiler scheduling padding passes do not respect the instruction constraints in a Target. If running on a backend which doesn't support certain operations on qubits the padding passes will potentially insert invalid operations at the end of a transpile() call. The simplest example of this is if you use the built in scheduling_method kwarg for transpile() on a backend which doesn't support delay then the output of the transpiler will not be valid.
Run the padding passes on a target that doesn't support the padding operations on some (or all qubits).
The padding passes should only run on qubits that the padding operations are supported on that qubit. If not we should skip padding that operation.
