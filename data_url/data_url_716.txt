I constructed the following circuit in qpp:

However, the actual measurement probabilities were
The qpp code I used is here:
In both the Quirk simulation and the qpp program I use

for λ = -π/2.
The problem is omega(-4); // e^-i*pi/2. The function omega assumes unsigned integers (as documented, it is supposed to compute the D-th root of identity), so -4 becomes max unsigned - 4. If you directly use -1_i (or std::exp(-1_i*pi/2.)) instead of omega(-4), i.e.  U << 1, 0, 0, -1_i; then you get the correct probabilities.
BTW, can use 00_ket instead of mket(qubits).
In general, if you want to simulate quantum circuits, I suggest to use the qpp::QCircuit in combination with a qpp::QEngine, see the examples in https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/tree/main/examples/circuits
Brilliant, thank you!
