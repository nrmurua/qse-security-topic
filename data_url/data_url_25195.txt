Since the pickling of task functions and other assets happens on the client side, the version of Covalent SDK that was used in this procedure is a vital piece of information that should be propagated to the machine which will deserialize and execute that function.
This is because there are changes in the codebase that might happen and the Covalent version used by these remote executors might be outdated. Sharing this information from the machine where the task functions were serialized on, to the machine where the task functions will be run becomes necessary. Thus, this issue will require adding a new covalent_version attribute to the RemoteExecutor class in covalent/executor/executor_plugins/remote_executor.py file to simply convey this. It will be each executors responsibility to respect this version and updating these executors is out of the scope of this issue.
