I am not sure if this has something to do with compatibility, but it looks like it the classical register for measuring the qubit has to be named 'ro'. The change triggers KeyError in line 482 in pyquil/_qvm.py
You're correct: this is currently required, and it's something we'd like to relax in the future. Thanks for making an issue. :)
Is this documented somewhere? The documentation of declare suggests one can set the name argument to whatever one likes...
This no longer raises an exception. The qc.run() method reads memory results using qc.qam.read_memory(region_name="ro"). You can declare and use memory as before, but to read the results you need to use the read_memory() function with the appropriate region_name:
Awesome! Thanks for clarifying!
