In 3114718, I've rewritten the section "Other Optimization Methods" (formerly, "Krotov vs GRAPE and CRAB"). This includes separating out the comparison of Krotov vs GRAPE with respect to the method as such, and the somewhat limited implementation in QuTiP, as well as a more complete discussion of the numerical costs associated with gradient-free optimization.
@karl-horn, can you check whether your use of NLopt is covered sufficiently in the current version? Based on https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aaf360/meta, it looked like you're using  Subplex only as a direct alternative to Nelder-Mead. Please extend the documentation if there's something more fundamental to discuss about methods provided by the NLopt package, or if it should be included in the decision tree diagram in the last section in some way.
