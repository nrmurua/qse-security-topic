The code below, at OpenQL\src\ql\pass\map\qubits\map\detail\mapper.cc, doesn't take into account that two communication qubits in different cores are not mappable:
We should change it into something like:
This is not an issue since get_min_hops can only return 1 for the case of two qubits in the same core.
I.e., for two communication qubits in different cores, get_min_hops won't return 1, so the code above doesn't take that case into account.
I will do a separate commit however with some other changes, including an update to get_min_hops code.
