Hello,
Test 11 is failing for me on the release v1.1.0 and on the latest master branch commit.
the error is:
---- There is 1 error in Python -> C++ transcription for the class solve_parameters_t
1 The parameter h_int does not have the right type : expecting many_body_op_t in C++, but got 'pytriqs.operators.operators.Operator' in Python.
I have also tried manually merging all 3 commits mentioned here: https://github.com/TRIQS/triqs/issues/329
After merging these, all triqs tests still pass, but the dcore tests keep failing.
Ok, after hours of testing, I figured it out immediately after posting this. Compiling cthyb with
-DHYBRIDISATION_IS_COMPLEX=ON -DLOCAL_HAMILTONIAN_IS_COMPLEX=ON
resolves the issue. I would therefore recommend putting this as a requirement instead of an optional flag in the install guide.
