Error:
This is FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE on powerpc64le with LLVM 11.0.1.
@pkubaj Thanks for the error report. However, this is not reproducible as it seems to pertain to new code (from you?): The code line in the error message above is CPP-guarded __s390x__ (which arguably is not PPC :) and reads differently in the main branch:

-> Please update your report as otherwise we cannot do anything about it.
I tested it on 0.7.0. s390x support has been added since and currently the error is about line 147.
All right. In that case there's something "interesting" going on with the struct timespec type on FreeBSD17 on PPC64LE. As you have such environment, could you fix the issue yourself with correct cast(s)? If so, a PR would be great, encapsulating the change suitably with a correct platform #define. If not, the best I can offer is setting up an x64-based FreeBSD system to try to reproduce.
@pkubaj Could you please re-test? #1225 just merged could/should have resolved this
Closing due to inactivity (assuming resolved).
