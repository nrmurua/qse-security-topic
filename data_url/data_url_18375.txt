CQC recently announced open-sourcing their C++ compiler tket (yay! congrats!). It has many great optimization abilities and does well in a lot of benchmarks, especially for a variety of real-world circuits.
We should try writing a pass that uses tket as an optional optimizer in QUILC. It would be neat to see what happens.
I would approach this by writing a contrib and exposing a relatively generic tket-compile function which can be installed on the global compiler list.
