I just installed scikit-quant into a fresh venv on Python 3.9.1 (on Windows) and while the direct interface works, the Scipy interface does not.
It looks like skquant.interopt is not installed at all (I get ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'skquant.interopt' on import.)
Is there something I should have done to install it? I have not found anything in the documentation, so I assumed it would just work.
I installed the package using python -m pip install scikit-quant[NOMAD]. The package version is 0.8.2.
I know nothing about Python packaging, but I have noticed that __all__ in skquant/__init__.py does not include interopt - could it be connected?
I did python -m pip install scikit-quant (without NOMAD) in a new venv and it worked there.
After that, I tried installing into a fresh venv with NOMAD and it worked as well, and it also works in the original venv.
In other words, I cannot reproduce the error any more, so I am closing the issue...
