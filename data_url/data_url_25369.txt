_get_node_error is an internal getter in Result which connects to a DB to return a value. It is called once in execution.py. This must be removed from Result since client side object can't be aware of the DB. execution.py needs it own logic to get the value from the DB.
Acceptance Criteria
Functionality to retrieve the error from the in memory Result was added in 3292926
In this issue I will just be cleaning up some docstrings in get_node_error and nearby similar methods
