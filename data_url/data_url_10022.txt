Currently we allow extensions to fail by using a try-except block, but we might be able to just use the optional kwarg as described here:
https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3bab40db96efda2e127ef84e6501fda0cdc4f5b8/Lib/distutils/extension.py#L79
Turns out it is far less robust than the current method. Raises an error rather than fails gracefully for misspelled compiler arguments for instance.
