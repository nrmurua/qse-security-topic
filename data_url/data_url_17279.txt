Pulse jobs that use meas_level=2 fail on those devices that support it, e.g. ibmq_20_tokyo, even if the same schedule is successful with meas_level=1.
meas_level==2 is currently not supported on the backends (check the configuration). However, there is currently no validation performed at the Terra, or API level. This is related to #2354 and I will close in favour of this.
Reopening as meas_levels=[1,2] is not correctly set. I will contact the relevant parties to fix and then close in favour of #2354.
Closing in favour of #2354.
