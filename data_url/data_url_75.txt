When the from_state() function is used to initialize a state, it adds a bunch of rotations gates and x gates to it.  This preparation is really inefficient and slows down circuit execution quite significantly.
Here is the code that uses the from_state() function to prepare an all zero state for a 16-qubit circuit.
