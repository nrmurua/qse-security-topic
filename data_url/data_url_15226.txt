QPY fails to load a circuit that has registers, but bit index 0 isn't in a register or at least, isn't in the circuit by the time a later register is read.
fails with
Correct load from QPY.
qpy/binary_io/circuits.py:926 is obviously wrong: it's passing an int to QuantumCircuit.add_bits rather than the bits that it has defined right above.  This isn't the only issue, though - the whole register reconstruction has an incorrect model of bit ownership and bit ordering, so a more complete example like
fails, because in the output circuit, the clbits go [('c1', 0), ('c1', 1), Clbit()], whereas they should be [Clbit(), ('c1', 0), ('c1', 1)].
