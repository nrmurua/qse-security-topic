@ajavadia and I had some discussions about renaming the instruction class operation. I don't mind what we do here but in the circuit, it is called instructions and then in the dag, it goes to operations. We need to make it clear with the one name.
My vote is instructions
@ajavadia is operations.
Thoughts?
Does anything break if we wait to settle the name during the Q1 circuit work?
no this is post 0.7
The OpenQASM specification seems to refer to operation almost exclusively a quantum gate:
There is one type of classically-controlled quantum operation: the if statement
In this context, the quantum operation has to be a gate. The word operation, is always in the context of quantum wires. The word instruction is used in a more generic way.
My two cents.
@ajavadia I think we can close this now. Do you agree
Assuming that @ajavadia is okey with it, closing. Feel free to repoen.
