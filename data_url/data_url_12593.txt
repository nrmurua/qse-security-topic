Currently, the fuser relies on circuits having the structure that all single qubit gates be followed somewhere in the circuit by a 2 qubit gate, but the Circuit class does not enforce this.  Seems Circuit should not carry these gates and instead Fuser should add these as necessary to collect all gates
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
This collection should occur in the external qsim library.
