The section on pulses states that a "future document will define a textualized representation of one such grammar, OpenPulse". This issue tracks the definition of that representation.
I have had some brief offline discussions about this with Blake and Lauren. It would be good to open up the discussion here to help explore what this textualized representation could look like.
Thank you for opening this up @stevenheidel. We are working on a white paper to go on the Arxiv to accompany the OpenQASM3 specification and within it, there is a "preliminary" example of an openpulse grammar syntax for pedagogical purposes wrt calibration definitions. It would be great if we could unify this (I will share offline) with #109 prior to the public release of this document.
Sounds good, email is steven [at] heidel [dot] ca - I would be happy to contribute to the white paper as well
Closing as this was completed by #184.
