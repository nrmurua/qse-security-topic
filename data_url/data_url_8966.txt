Could you be more specific about what you are doing and what isn't happening?
There is no 'install' make target. This is because there are no install instructions in CMakeLists.txt.
Oh, you mean like run a make command to install libstim as a library that can be linked to or to install stim as a command line tool in the system? I've just been building it and then adding the out directory to my PATH, or using the fact that the python package includes the command line tool.
What do you expect to be installed if you run make install?
Library, headers. and possibly cmake and pkgconfig files.
