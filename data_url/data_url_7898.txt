Hello,
I'm using qutip alongside another library, which does something like this:
Im not entirely sure why it does so, but nevertheless debug messages don't show up anywhere, since the root logger doesn't print anything without it being configured. If you run the above code in Ipython but add import qutip before it, logging.debug("foo") prints to the stderr (without qutip it doesn't). So when I started using the library with qutip, suddenly all debug messages started getting printed to stderr.
Apparently, this is somewhat on purpose, by looking at the code here. I'm not entirely sure what tho think about that, because as shown above this causes something unexpected. Nevertheless, I thought I could work around this by setting log_handler = "null" in my settings file, but that in turn causes qutip to crash, because the rc loader expects log_handler to be a boolean for some reason. Also, it took me a while to find this, since the log_handler option is not documented.
I'm using python 3.7.4 and QuTiP 4.4.1 installed with pip.
It seems that the library you are using turns off the logging stream. Maybe you can try logging.disable(logging.DEBUG)
I worked around this by doing
I supposes that it's a bit weird/wrong that the library sets the log level like that, and maybe it's understandable that qutip has somewhat automatic logging for IPython. The real issue is that the config for log_handler is broken. I could possibly submit a PR for that at some point.
