(fresh node on a raspberry pi)
A fix is being tested. There are still some other bugs, the fix for this bug will be included in that.
Please check the swig version on your node by following command
swig -version
Make sure you have SWIG Version atleast 3.0.10
SWIG version was/is 3.0.2. Let me know if I can help test something.
As similar issue was detected in Debian Jessie.
The updated instructions in https://github.com/theQRL/QRL/blob/master/README.md should fix your problem.
I have update the instructions and tested in Debian Jessie. Maybe after the hard-fork once testnet is running again, you can test the new instructions in Raspbian Jessie.
I think #369 fixed this for me.
My node is on a jessie based os, indeed. I tried undoing the jessie specific instructions. It seems the regular swig3.0 package works as well.
@moplk Yes, #369 fixes the problem but it is more like a workaround. By following jessie instructions we ensure that you are running newer swig and cmake versions (which bring a lot of additional fixes)
I am closing this issue.
