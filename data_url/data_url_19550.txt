Is it intended that one can specify only one initial point x0? For a two-dimensional problem with e.g. 8 initial points I get:
Example for x0:
[[260 471]
[269 421]
[263 195]
[248 292]
[282 203]
[249  27]
[285 399]
[237 189]]
No particular reason; just that the top-level interface was setup to take only one initial (rightly or wrongly inspired by scipy.minimize), so changing that line should be fine, assuming you also set the maxmp option (IIRC; the number of points per batch) to a value equal or larger to the set of initial points.
