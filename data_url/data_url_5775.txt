Multi-chunk parallelization (cache blocking) is not applied when using density_matrix method with noise models.
cache_blocking metadata will be recorded in the result when is is applied.
cache blocking transpiler does not recognize some operator in density_matrix, add them to enable cache blocking.
fixed with #1480.
