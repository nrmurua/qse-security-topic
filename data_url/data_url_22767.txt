The text "sync()" appears in the artiq manual but using the web-based search for "sync()" doesn't find it.

This is not a text search but an indexed keyword search. Search for sync. Also, this would be a bug in sphinx, not in artiq.
From a usability perspective being able to search the documentation is important. Consider updating the search box instructions from "Enter search terms or a module, class or function name" to "Search keyword index. e.g. sync not sync()."
The function name of sync is sync, not sync(). You are welcome to file your suggestion with the sphinx project if you feel it is a correct improvement.
Robert, Do you maintain the m-labs website?

No. I know sphinx and am triaging your issue.
