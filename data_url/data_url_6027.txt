When using the density matrix snapshot function the snapshot value should be returned as a complex numpy array matrix. However it instead returned in JSON nested list format.
Trying to fix this by explicitly setting the C++ type to matrix instead of using the built in JSON serialized for the class leads to the Pybind error: TypeError: Unregistered type : matrix<std::__1::complex<double> >
The snapshot code here uses the default state serlizier which converts to JSON.
Changing it to the follow should store a matrix in the result instead of a JSON, however doing so leads to the above Pybind type error:
Return density matrix snapshots as numpy arrays
Fix Pybind handling of complex matrices in snapshots
The same TypeError: Unregistered type : matrix<std::__1::complex<double> > happens if you try and take a unitary snapshot during a unitary simulation.
