In Mitiq the procedure for generating quasi probability representations assumes that the user already knows the channel representation (superoperator matrices) of each noisy operations. This is a frontend-dependent and backend-dependent aspect that should not directly be handled by Mitiq.
This issue is for adding an example in which superoperator matrices of noisy gates are deduced from hardware properties.
Can I take this for the next milestone?
milestone?
Sounds good to me @purva-thakre !
I believe @natestemen will be the milestone manager for next milestone.
