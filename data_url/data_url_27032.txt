The following error is observed if one uses too many GPUs for molecular systems with a small number of basis functions. For instance, in this example, we have 12 basis functions and if one employs 1-2 GPUs, the calculation would run fine. The calculation would crash when we go to 3-4 GPUs simply because there is not much work to distribute among GPUs.
This must be handled!
