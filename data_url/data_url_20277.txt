Hi there!
I am trying to incorporate some QKD algorithms onto your library and I am installing liboqs on Debian 9.
At installing openssh-portable and run:
./configure --enable-pq-kex --enable-hybrid-kex      
--enable-pq-auth --enable-hybrid-auth    
--with-ssl-dir=< path-to-openssl >/include 
--with-ldflags=-L< path-to-openssl >/lib   
--prefix=$OPENSSH_INSTALL                
--sysconfdir=$OPENSSH_INSTALL            
--with-liboqs-dir=$LIBOQS_INSTALL
it returns an error and I do not know how to approach it:
checking zlib.h usability...no
checking zlib.h presence..no
checking for zlib.h...no
configure: error: *** zlib.h missing - please install first or check config.log ***
Â¿Could anyone tell me how to fix it?
Thank you very much!!
I'm guessing since you closed this, you resolved it, but if not, try: apt-get install zlib1g-dev
