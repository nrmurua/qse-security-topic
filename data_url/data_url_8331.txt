I'm teaching a course where we use QuTiP, but recently we cannot import QuTiP anymore : /
The procedure to reproduce the error is to open a new notebook in colab, install QuTiP with
and then just
The error in this case is
I tried it on Colab and obtained this error if importing a single function,
which seems related to the init,
AttributeError: module 'qutip' has no attribute 'settings'
The strange thing is that that bit of the init has not been touched for years,  https://github.com/qutip/qutip/blame/master/qutip/__init__.py#L45
I don't have an immediate fix (@quantshah might know more about colab) but a workaround could be using My Binder, if that is a viable option for you.
To set it up, you need to copy a requirements.yml file in your repository and activate My Binder by copying the link into their homepage.
Right now, in the master of qutip-notebooks we get an issue with scipy's IndexMixin
scverse/anndata#146
But, from my notebooks repository it seems to work. Copying the environment file and copy-pasting the My Binder link should work. You can copy-paste a given branch in mybinder.org, such that it does not keep rebuilding the environment completely from scratch, something that will happen if it finds a new commit in that branch. Hope this helps.
.
Copy also the apt.txt as from my notebooks folder if you want latex in plots.
Thank you, I will look into these alternatives.
@ziofil, I just checked that updating the colab notebook to have the line
works for me, as @quantshah mentioned.
QuTiP will find already the SciPy 1.2.1 requirement and will avoid keeping 1.3.
It is an issue with IndexMixin relocation in SciPy 1.3 (released this May 17), which has been changed from scipy.sparse.sputils to scipy.sparse._index.
I tested this also in My Binder and this works too, by setting in the environment.yml file,
in line 9,

I will open a PR with this patch for qutip-notebooks for the time being. Once the next official version of QuTiP is released, this problem will not arise, as this issue has been taken care of by @Ericgig in PR #999 by updating scipy IndexMixin, now under private use, with scipy get_index_dtype.
Solved by QuTiP 4.4.0 PyPI release. It proved quite slow to build the wheels on my try on Colab (5 minutes), we can open another issue in case this is standard.
