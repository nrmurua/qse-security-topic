To extract a documentation of the Toolkit I have experimented with doxygen (link) but it is not really optimized for python. It works, but the results look weird, especially since it does not work well with type hints: Each type hint is intepreted as an additional method parameter.
Looking for a better tool I've read of Sphinx which seems to be made for python and I would test it sometime in the future.
Does anyone have experience with commonly used tools for python and knows recommendations/alternatives?
No experience, but I believe the official Python implementation uses some tool (which might well be Sphinx) and the results look pretty good.
It is sphinx, and it is used by a wide range of python projects from small and large (like django, scipy/numpy, the standard implementation, etc.)
Sphinx docstrings can however make the docstrings a bit markup heavy. Since Sphinx 1.3.1 there is an extension that parses Google style doc strings, which are both readable in source code and parsable by Sphinx.
Example:
Additional documentation can still be added in standard reStructured Text markup, just like usual Sphinx (for images, general description and so on).
I think that's fine and would create an issue to set up sphinx and adapt the existing docstrings for the future.
