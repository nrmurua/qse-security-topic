Passing the executor="local"  parameter to an electron when running Covalent with Dask does not result in local execution.
With covalent start,  Dask overrides execution of an electron that is decorated with the "local" executor.
Passing the parameter executor="local" to an electron when running Covalent with Dask should execute the electron locally.

This is odd, I was using executor="local" to work around the Dask serialization bug. See also Cell 12 of the quantum gravity tutorial. Can you provide a test script?
I do notice that specifying executor="local" at the lattice level sometimes fails to propagate to electrons, but that issue is already being tracked.
@Emmanuel289  any chance you tried passing Local object instead of string ?

@cjao Copy this. I saw that this issue (#699) was documented as one of the items in the list of known issues in our release notes, so I merely opened this to track that item. Please see the last item for r110.2 (https://www.notion.so/v0-110-2-release-notes-6629edda9a0d400283bfe3a3b45a47f7). I will update here with a test script from my end.

@santoshkumarradha I didn't give that a shot. I'll try with the Local parameter and update here.
