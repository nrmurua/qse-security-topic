The AerSimulator(method="statevector") takes exponentially more time to accomplish the same task when compared to StatevectorSimulator() and QasmSimulator(method="statevector").

I was expecting that all of them to have the same performance.
Execute runs asynchronously so you can't benchmark it the way you have here. If you block until each simulation is finished by changing the line to execute(qc, sim).result(). You get the actual run time of each simulator:

Here Aer and Qasm are the same as expected, but it does look like there is a bug with the qasm/aer simulators running all 1024 shots even though there is no measurement (while statevector always runs 1). Manually setting shots=1 everything looks as expected:

I double checked the code and the shots / sampling isn't technically a bug. Because the circuit contains initialize it disables sampling since a general initialize instruction requires a reset which doesn't allow sampling. If you changed it to set_statevector then sampling is enabled by default.
