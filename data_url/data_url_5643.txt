If you run the Estimator with shots=None the result has shots=1024.
shots should be None. I'm not sure what variance here means but if it depends on the number of shots then it is also incorrect.
Thank you for your reporting an issue. This is not a bug, but it should raise an error because shots=None can only be done in the case of approximation=True. I'll fix this until 0.12.1.
