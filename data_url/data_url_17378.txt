With changes to the transpiler interface, the use of a backend is replaced by explicit use of the coupling_map and basis_gates as arguments.  These, along with n_qubits, are fundamental properties of a backend, and should be accessible as attributes of the backend, e.g. backend.coupling_map.  Not only is this easier to use, it fits within the standard object oriented model of scientific computing where fundamental properties of an object are attributes not functions.
You could also name to this list. Currently it is a method, which is a bit odd.
Actually the transpiler still accepts backend. This was due to numerous feedback about how people were using this function, and therefore I did not deprecate it. From the docstring:
With this, I don't think there's still reason to promote specific things from the configuration to first class properties.
Ok, seems reasonable.
