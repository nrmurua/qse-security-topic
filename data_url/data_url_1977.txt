Quote from the docstring: "Currently this function assumes each measurement gate applies to only a single qubit."
Currently, I get an incorrect histogram if I didn't read the docstring and used a multi-qubit measurement (I always make circuits like this):

If I use single-qubit measurement gates, I get the expected histogram:

This looks like it could be fixed by adding some logic to plot_state_histogram (https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/study/visualize.py#L22) that checks for multi-qubit measurements and either correctly interpret them or raise an error.
I have made a quick-fix, I guess. Can you tell me what would be better, to raise an error/warning or to add said logic? Adding said logic does not seem hard, just a little longer.
Along with the 2 code sample provided above being made equivalent, I have also made a mixture of single and mutli-qubit measurements work the same. Please tell me if some other combinations might have been expected. Just h-stacking the results worked.
