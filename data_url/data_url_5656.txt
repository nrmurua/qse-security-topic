Specifying method="tensor_network" ( #1637 ) with device="GPU" produces AerError: "Invalid simulation method tensor_network" for the latest release.
This should install qiskit-aer 0.12.0, qiskit-aer-gpu 0.11.2, and cuQuantum with cuTensorNet support. Then
tensor_network should be available for AerSimulator when cuTensorNet is functional.
Not sure if it's related, but the latest version of qiskit-aer-gpu (available on PyPI) is 0.11.2.
0.12.0 is not available through PyPI (though we will fix this issue soon). Could you compile and try Aer from codes?
Actually the qiskit-aer-gpu package does not include the cuQuantum support. If you'd like to use cuQuantum you will need to compile aer from source. There instructions on how to do this here: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-with-gpu-support including the options needed to build the cuQuantum support.
Thanks for the clarification. I was aware that cuStateVec_enable needs Aer to be built from source with appropriate flags, but somehow forgot that this would likely be the case for tensor_network as well :/
