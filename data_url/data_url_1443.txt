Summarize the task
Spin-off from #4824 to get ionq device prepped for deprecation of decompose_operation API in devices.
Acceptance criteria - when is the task considered done?
When ionq_device is no longer blocking deprecation of decompose_operation
@Cynocracy Cirq optimizers have been migrated to new transformer framework. Can you now do the migration for ionq device? You should create a new TwoQubitCompilationTargetGateset  for ionq put the decomposition logic there. See other similar implementations of gatesets, like CZTargetGateset in cirq core.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
#5028 This issue tracks the migration of optimizers in vendor packages
Sure thing, happy to take this one up
I was looking into this, and found #4925 recently that seems to have made changes to how cirq-ionq exposes these, but it doesn't support nqubits > 2 which is strange.
Anyway, it's making my changes a bit more involved than I intiially thought, so just calling it out.
Am shooting to continue to support that high level interface but to use a [TwoQubitCompilationTargetGateset "behind the scenes" (while also dropping IonqAPIDevice)
Hmm, maybe I'm just not understanding. The diff looks like it tried to preserve behavior.
Going to continue to try to wrap my head around things :) hopefully a PR emerges soon
Have my changes staged, but am confused by the sudden appearance of cirq.PhasedXZGate in the test output :( I've tried using the base class and TwoQubit[...]
The full failure is
And I'm puzzled as how I've changed this behavior at all.
Any ideas?
mm, I'm wondering if it's the yield statements and me not understanding where/why things are generators.
I am stuck again, still ending up with a cirq.PhasedXZGate in the compiled circuit, which should be broken up. Pushed my latest yield-less changes
@Cynocracy You also need to override the postprocess_transformers property of your compilation target gateset and remove merge_single_qubit_moments_to_phxz transformer phase.

@Cynocracy What is the status of this PR?  Do you still need help with this?  It looks like Tanuj had a suggestion in how to fix this.  Do you think we could either wrap this up, or expose the branch for someone else to finish?
This is fixed by #5479
