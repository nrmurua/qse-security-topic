Description of the issue
This came up while reviewing #4881 and offline discussions with @Zshan0.
A common pattern used throughout cirq protocols is to take a default: TDefault parameter which should be returned if the protocol does not succeed, or raise a type error if no explicit default has been provided. For example:

However, this construct actually raises a mypy error and is a known issue --  python/mypy#8739
How to reproduce the issue
Here is a minimal failing example that follows a similar construct:

Summary
There are two different issues here that need to fixed:
Cirq version
0.14dev
Cirq cynq: not terribly high-priority, but we should at least confirm that mypy isn't skipping files/directories.
