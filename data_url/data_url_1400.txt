As far as I can tell, Engine.get_sampler's gate_set argument is now optional. As such, cg.get_engine_sampler should not require a gate_set_name.
Also: we don't have a CZ gate in gatesets.NAMED_GATESETS or GOOGLE_GATESETS
We could deprecate cg.get_engine_sampler entirely, since this is equivalent to cg.get_engine(...).get_processor(...).get_sampler(). But I agree if we keep it around we should make the gate set arg optional, as it is on EngineProcessor.get_sampler.
This has been done
