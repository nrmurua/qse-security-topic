Going through the docs and trying to create the Picard vs Q coin toss (https://pyquil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html). Up until now, everything has in the previous pages of the docs has been working as described, however now I'm getting an error when trying to import forest.
My .pyquil_config file is setup in the home directory as shown below.
[Rigetti Forest]
url: https://api.rigetti.com/qvm
key: nmRPAVunQl19TtQz9eMd11iiIsArtUDTaEnsSV6u
user_id: 6506ed6b-16b6-424d-8b15-2e5c9e2b70d0
Tried changing the import statement "from pyquil import forest" to "from pyquil.api import api", and then changing "qvm = forest.Connection()" to "qvm = api.SyncConnection()". This also returned an error: "cannot import name api"
I believe the documentation is outdated, as some parts of it recommend importing pyquil.forest, while the only branch on the pyquil github repo with a forest.py file is 111 commits behind master.
As for your error, I was able to replicate it with "from pyquil.api import api" as you did.  Since api.py is a file in the pyquil folder that you're looking for, any of the following will work:
from pyquil import api
import pyquil.api
import pyquil.api as [any name you want here]
Yep that was it!  Fixed by 36e8654
