FunctionPulseTemplate is an important low-level pulse type that allows users to create smooth pulse shapes like gaussians, etc. The implementation however, is still lacking an implementation for the build_sequence method. This is non-trivial and should be done by someone with an understanding of how registering waveforms in the sequencer works at the moment. Related to #66.
Implemented similar to the TablePulseTemplate.build_sequence with a little help by @terrorfisch.
