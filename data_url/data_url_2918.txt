Every time we present to people, there is some chaffing at the name "Moment". If we used "Layer", I think this would be avoided.
Layer loses the connotation that this is in time.
I think Moment is a great choice, because it means exactly a particular point in time.
All of the words we have come up for this have overloads in physics, computer science, math.  I think the benefits of having a word that has a distinct meaning that is very close to what the actual concept is outweigh these overlaps.
I'd like to repeat my previous suggestion of Tick, which keeps the time metaphor instead of a spatial metaphor, but doesn't have any overloaded physics or stats meanings like "moment" does (AFAIK). That said, I think moment works pretty well.
I'm satisfied with leaving it as moment so I'll close this for now. If we get more complaints, maybe we'll take a poll or something.
