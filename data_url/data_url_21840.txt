While running script using sawg....
Joe, looking at this again, the eye scans during your mem test look really quite bad.
For example 11101001001001001001001000100100100100100 that's much worse than anything I've seen for a while. Compare that to the eye scans I posted in #1065 for example.
Can you post "typical" eye scans you see on your boards with + without the RTM, please?
Could also be connected to #1065.
Following is typical.
Is that with RTM? Any idea what caused the bad eyes then? Did you change gateware between good and bad mem tests?
The board spontaneously rebooted after @ 0x40023e78. That's when the bad mem test appeared.
Otherwise this board has uniformly had nice memtest results for the last two weeks.
