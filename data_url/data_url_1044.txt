Description of the issue
Our CI jobs rely on sh files, direct bash use of grep, xargs, sed and the 5 requirements.txt-s scattered around.
This is hard to maintain and is fragile and error prone.
I propose switching to tox.
Tox allows us to express different test environments, with different dependencies.
With substitution values from other config sections we could theoretically reduce duplication while maintaining the ability to create separate, slim, fast envs for each job.
This could help in #3552 too.
