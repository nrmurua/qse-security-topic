From Readthedocs:
With the introduction of our new "Ubuntu 20.04" and "Ubuntu 22.04" Docker images, we stopped pre-installing these extra > Python packages and we encouraged users to install and pin all their dependencies using a requirements.txt file. We have already > stopped supporting "use system packages" on these newer images.
We are removing the "use system packages" feature on August 29th. Make sure you are installing all the required dependecies to > build your project's documentation using a requirements.txt file and specifying it in your .readthedocs.yaml.
