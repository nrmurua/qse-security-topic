Probably I can help out on this (cc @nwlambert and @quantshah as I am not very knowledgeable about the theory). Similar path to qutip/qutip-doc#32 and #1518.
Is this about qutip.nonmarkov.heom? If so, we can close it -- the new BoFiN HEOM added for QuTiP 4.7 includes an extensive guide.
Assuming it is about the HEOM and closing. Please re-open if the assumption is wrong.
