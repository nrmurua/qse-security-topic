As I showed @stavros11 in person, there is one or more documentation examples that lead to over 10 thousand warnings due to tensorflow trying to cast complex128 to float64. Due to the amount of warnings, this is probably happening inside an optimization, but there is no reference to which example(s) raise the warnings. I could not reproduce the warnings locally.
I managed to reproduce the warnings by running the following:
As you said, this can be fixed by setting dtype=tf.complex128 into the tf.Variable definition.
I think the warnings can be produced by the back-propagation test.
