I think that a function to generate parameterized GGM matrices will be useful especially on TFQ for the PQCs (they are used in Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (arXiv:1810.03787v2) for example).
More info about GGMs in Bloch vectors for qudits (arXiv:0806.1174v1)
Discussed on Cirq Cynque: this might be useful but not high priority for us at the moment, if somebody is willing to contribute it, we'll accept it as it seems useful for our qudit support. Before implementing it a design proposal should be written here to work out the details.
