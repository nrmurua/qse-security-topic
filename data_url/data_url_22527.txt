Experimental asyncio support for pyserial is here:
https://github.com/m-labs/pyserial
The file aio.py can be used independently from the rest of pyserial. I have sent a few things to pyserial, if by the end of next week they have not reacted to them we will host aio.py somewhere else, possibly as a different project.
Time's up. https://github.com/m-labs/asyncserial
Implemented in the two serial controllers (tcube/novatech), untested. I will give the tcube devices a shot. @jboulder can you test your controller for the Novatech 409b after the changes I made (in the master branch)?
asyncserial is currently not working on Windows.
Tcube driver OK.
Windows problems fixed.
Just waiting for the novatech test.
@jboulder Can you give the new novatech controller a try?
I've ordered Novatech but they've not yet arrived. Will test when they're
on hand.

@jbqubit Have they arrived?
Testing this is the last known issue before 2.0.
Fixed and working.
