I have a Jupyter notebook dark theme set up. The white space generated by calling plot_state_city is not enough for the figure axis labels to be inside it.

Setting a higher value for figsize=() seems to correct it, but the labels also get smaller.

It could be because I have a higher DPI monitor. Not sure whether #3315 could be related or not.
Use non-default Jupyter notebook theme, then:
The white space generated by calling plot_state_city should include enough space for axis labels, and the labels should maybe scale at least to some extent when figsize is increased.

I'll take a look at this issue. Since it's a bit old, it is okay to test and fix it in the latest version?
Sounds good, I've assigned the issue to you. If you find it's still valid feel free to open a PR to fix it.
Thank you @mtreinish! Can confirm this is still an issue in qiskit-terra v0.25.0. Will look into a solution.
