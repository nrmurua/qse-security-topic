At the recent EuroSciPy 2019 meeting, it came up that having a qutip-talks or talks section in qutip-notebooks might be handy for tutorials and uploading slides. I am more in favor of a stand-alone qutip-talks as it would make qutip-notebooks too heavy. It is also true that it might not contain code properly.
Revamping this issue also in light of the many presentations that have been created over the last couple of months and years by me, @quantshah @BoxiLi @hodgestar @AGaliciaMartinez @purva-thakre and @MrRobot2211, among others. I would opt to make a separate repository, and then link to it from the docs and website.
