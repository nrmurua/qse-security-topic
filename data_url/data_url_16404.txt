Plot the hinton plot without any error.
Not very sure about the possible solutions.
Most likely due to matplotlib version 3.3.0. Use matplotlib 3.2.2 for now.
I was not able to reproduce this issue on master, neither with matplotlib 3.2 or 3.3.
This issue seems like duplicated #4846 and it was probably solved via #4739.
Consider updating to qiskit-terra 0.15. If you think this is still an issue, please reopen!
