Visualization open controlled gates was added in #4131 . But a few gates were missed out. In the circuit below, all were implemented as open-controlled gates but were drawn as below:

@enavarro51 @TharrmashasthaPV do either of you want to have a look at this?
Actually I am working on a fix right now as a continuation to #4052 and #4148. matplotlib.py needed a lot of updating to match text.py so it has taken me a bit. Should have a pull request by tomorrow, and I'll include this.
Question @ewinston. I'm doing a deep dive in the mpl drawer bringing it even with text drawer. I noticed that snapshot shows as a custom multiqubit box in text and a barrier in mpl. The reason it's a box in text is that a label is required for snapshot and code above the snapshot display code tests for a label and sends it to the box code. This seems like a bug to me. Should both drawers display a barrier or a box? And if a barrier, what of the required label for snapshot which doesn't really have anywhere to display?
Also load, save, and noise are referenced in both drawers. Are these valid qiskit-terra functions? Thanks.
@enavarro51 Sorry, I missed this note. @1ucian0 may be more familiar with the visualization code than myself.
