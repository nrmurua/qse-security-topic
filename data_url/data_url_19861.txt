The two most common docstring formats are Numpy-style and Google-style (more compact). They both contain standard keywords for arguments, returned objects and the possibility to annotate the signature with type hints or within the docstring itself.
This is particularly helpful to automatically build the API-doc as part of the documentation with Sphinx's autodoc's feature.
Numpydoc helps ensuring this happens, https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#.
Happy to help on this with contributions or feedback.

How does Sphinx handle inherited classes?  For example if I have a class
and I inherit this class while also optionally add a docstring here
what does the documentation show for the inherited class?
Update:
I see that some documentation on this is provided here for numpydoc, which was what I tested with. As it quickly turned out that the doctrings become quite long, I will moving towards Google style and parse with napoleon.
Implemented in #26
