When I try to use QAOA with scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b as my minimizer and no minimize_kwargs (I want to use the default argument), I get the error:
fmin_l_bfgs_b() got an unexpected keyword argument 'method'
it's due to this line in grove/qaoa.py:
It should be replace by a more complex condition that verify if the minimizer is indeed optimize.minimize
