In trying to build a circuit from qasm using an ecr gate:
I get the following error:
Looks like .name is never set for the built-in Cnot and UniversalUnitary classes (so, this works if U/CX are replaced with u/cx). Any idea why @1ucian0 ?
in addition to that, should this gate be included in the qelib1.inc https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/qasm/libs/qelib1.inc being a basis gate?
I think the problem is about scoping. The following works:
in addition to that, should this gate be included in the qelib1.inc https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/qasm/libs/qelib1.inc being a basis gate?
We are moving towards leaving qelib1.inc fixed, following the paper definition. See #4312 and #6125
