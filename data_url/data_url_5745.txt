PulseSimulator gives wrong measurement counts after running X-gate schedules on two qubits.
it should turn both qubits from 0 â†’ 1 giving counts around :
{'0000001': 56,
'0000010': 69,
'0000011': 874,  }
considering the noise model coming from the ibmq_jakarta backend being simulated.
No idea, but this might be related to an  error mentioned back in 2021 in issue #1257 and when I downgrade to Qiskit version = 0.23.0 which has Aer Version = 0.7, with a bit of changes to account for deprecated and reworked Methods, it gave the correct output above, but adjusting the more involved code I'm working on for the downgrade would be really difficult.
