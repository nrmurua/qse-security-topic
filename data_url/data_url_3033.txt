Followed the installation instructions in docs/install.md on my corp linux machine. Got this error at step 6:
(circEnv) sxwang@sxwang0:~$ pip3 install -e ./cirq/cirq
Directory './cirq/cirq' is not installable. File 'setup.py' not found.
Also, the next line of the instructions says "If you want to install Cirq and have changes you make to Cirq show up when you edit Cirq, add -editable to the last command." Isn't -e = --editable?
Ah I think it should be "pip3 install -e ./cirq"
Ah yeah -e is --editable, doh.  I think it should be just "pip3 install ./cirq" if you aren't doing edits.
The ./ is necessary for indicating we want to do a local install instead of installing some internet package called cirq, right?
