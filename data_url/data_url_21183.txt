With the current VCD-based RTIO analyzer system, events that do not change TTL state cannot be displayed.
This is a particular issue with input channels where typically only rising edges or only falling edges are detected by the gateware, and the events do not show up at all in the display.
I propose that RTIO events that do not change the TTL state are displayed using an arrow in the new dashboard-integrated display.
