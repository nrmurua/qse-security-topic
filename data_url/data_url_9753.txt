Description
The example given at https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/dimod/en/stable/reference/bqm/generated/dimod.BinaryQuadraticModel.to_numpy_matrix.html fails to run.
Steps To Reproduce
Simply enter the code from the to_numpy_matrix example:
Expected Behavior
I expected to see
Environment
Looks to me that it needs the , 'd': 0 in the model creation line:
Sorry, just noticed that the problem is that it is not adding the d by itself, once it is specified in the order, as should be expected.

Right.  If you remove the d from variable_order or add it, as you did, to the model, the example works.  However, the documentation claims that the d should be added automatically:
This example converts a binary quadratic model to NumPy array format while ordering variables and adding one (‘d’).
