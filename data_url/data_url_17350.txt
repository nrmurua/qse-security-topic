circuit.draw()
should have test written somewhere.
I think this is a duplicate of: #1298 I'm going to close it and we can just track it there
sure but I would close the other or edit it as we dont use load, save, extra. Just snapshot is the one we need.
I think this issue actually could be clearly written as a good first contribution.
Add snapshot label to circuit.draw()
@1ucian0 and @mtreinish what do you think?
ps. [Yes it applies to all drawers]
@jaygambetta sure sounds good to me. My only hesitation for a good first contribution label is that for the latex drawer I never actually found a good way to implement the label on top of the barrier in latex because of how we draw barriers it might require qcircuit patches. But, now that I think about it that's probably fine, adding barriers to first qcircuit and then terra was one of my first qiskit contributions.
Sure! I think it would help the first contributor if there is a clear expected result in advance. Would it be okey to draw snapshot as following (for the case of text)?
