Description of the issue
I am working on a library that uses json serialization which depends on cirq.DEFAULT_RESOLVERS. In version 0.11.0, this cirq attribute was removed.  I will now have to add try / except statements to my library to make it compatible with both the old and new cirq. Please bring back cirq.DEFAULT_RESOLVERS.
How do I import DEFAULT_RESOLVERS now? It looks like it's defined here but I cannot determine the import path to use.
Cirq version
returns
AttributeError: module 'cirq' has no attribute 'DEFAULT_RESOLVERS'
related issue #4115
Just like in issue #4115, this only happens if I pip --upgrade cirq instead of doing a clean install.
