Currently the default number of PEC samples is 1000 or it can be set manually.
It would be good if Mitiq could, optionally, deduce the appropriate number of samples to be used.
The number of samples could be deduced from one of (or a combination of) the following things:
the amount of negativity of the circuit quasi-probability distribution
the desired precision
the actual variance of the measured samples (adaptively)
etc.
