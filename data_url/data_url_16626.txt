We need a way to express Boolean functions compactly (e.g. f(x1,x2) = x1^x2), without resorting to exponential descriptions. Right now we only do things like truth table descriptions using exponential arrays (in synthesis algorithms like graysynth and libraries like FourierChecking).
Some tools for this exist as opensource like RevKit and the Tweedledum library.
Then we can also have synthesis algorithms for these that do not rely on synthesis of diagonal operators, and use those for synthesizing FourierChecking, Forrelation, HiddenShift, etc. etc.
