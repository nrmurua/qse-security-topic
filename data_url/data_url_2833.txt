I understand why we moved examples out of cirq.  But now we end up with code like
from examples.supremacy import
which is kind of odd...because it feels like we are taking a really common top level word, i.e. there is no notion that these are cirq examples.
Should this bit
cirqexamples or cirq_examples
or should we have it back in the cirq namespace?
Isn't that code just in the example tests? That seems fine to me. We could use a relative import in that specific situation...
OK fine to leave as is.
