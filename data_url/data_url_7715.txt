Hi quimb team,
In example 12 you showed how to perform optimizations in torch. What do I need to change in order to use cuda as the device for torch optimization?
Best,

It should just be as simple as calling:
apply_to_arrays(lambda x: torch.tensor(x, dtype=torch.float32).cuda()), or whichever way is your favorite to get the initial torch data onto the gpu:
That works. Thank you!
