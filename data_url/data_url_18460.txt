CL-QUIL has some transformations to do gate fusion. However, it's not very smart. For instance, according to this comment, fusion can't occur across gates which aren't static, like
The reason is because the program is divided up into contiguous sequences of static gates and optimized only within those sequences. That was just for simplicity's sake, not for any technical reason.
We ought to fix this.
