The test program:
The input file:
We should expect the printout to be 1, shouldn't we? In reality, it is 2.
I have got a hunch: if this problem had not existed, I wouldn't have opened the issue #119. This one may be the root cause of the problems in QEngine.get_stats(), QEngine.to_JSON(), etc.
Please note QCircuit.get_nq() is wrong too.
I can confirm. For some reason, the QCircuit constructed when reading a qasm file sets nc=nq=maximum(classical_regs, quantum_regs). Adding @meamy to this as well.
Looks like the number of bits and qubits are being supplied to the QCircuit constructor in the wrong order here and here. bits and qubits just need to be switched around and everything works.
@vsoftco Let me know if you want me to make a pull req, or to just swap them yourself. Looks like I don't have push permission.
@meamy I just realized that as well, and pushed it, super tiny typo :)
