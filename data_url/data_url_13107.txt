To use CDR, the circuit must be compiled into a specific gateset. (See here.) We should add a compiler which inputs an arbitrary program and outputs an equivalent one compiled to this gateset.
Ideally, this compiler would use only Cirq functionality. However, since this is pretty essential to the CDR workflow, I'm ok thinking about adding another requirement if necessary / significantly more convenient.
I would comment that the gate set necessary depends on the native gate set of the hardware. Currently all the code is tailored to IBM hardware.
