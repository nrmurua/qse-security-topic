For T1, I see that the BaseCoherenceFitter constructor is initialized with expected_state=1. Then BaseCoherenceFitter._calc_data contains the lines:
which generate, for two qubits, expected_state_str='11', instead of 01.
Perhaps I'm wrong, as test_t1 is supposed to fail if there really is a bug.
I'm not clear what point num_of_qubits has independent of qubit. I would suggest we switch to qubit as a list of qubits which we will do these experiments in parallel
#50
