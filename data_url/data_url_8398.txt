I am able to reproduce locally. Both with scipy 1.1 and 0.19
both with libopenblas 0.2.20
The sp.linalg.eigsh call generates the seg fault.
Seems it this is a known issue with anaconda openblas
scipy/scipy#7667
I have read many other related posts:
opencobra/memote#383
numpy/numpy#613
This one suggests a fix with openblas 0.2.17 (not anaconda though)
mingwpy/mingwpy#2
Any ideas?
I'll try and raise with anaconda
I have raised the issue with anaconda
ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues#9500
