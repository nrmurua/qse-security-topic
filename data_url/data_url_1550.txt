Description of the issue
QasmParser cannot parse Qasm-code.
Is there an error in my Qasm-code or a bug in the QasmParser?
Thanks for your help!
How to reproduce the issue
I convert my circuit from Qiskit to Qasm, which gives the following results:
Now I would like to create a Cirq circuit using the QasmParser from Cirq (https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq-core/cirq/contrib/qasm_import/qasm.py), but i get this Syntax Error Message:
Removing the parameters of QAOA-Gate ends in a Syntax-Error, too.
When i remove the custom gate and insert this into the parser everything works fine.
Cirq version
You can get the cirq version by printing cirq.__version__. From the command line:
QasmParser doesn't support the ability to define custom gates yet. See #3560. Please feel free to look into adding this if you'd like.
Alright.
I found a workaround that rewrites the Qasm-String without Custom Gates and finally can be parsed.
Thanks!
