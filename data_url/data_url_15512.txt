When attempting to generate an instance of the UCCSD class object, the returned object is an empty circuit with zero qubits. I am posting this issue here and not in Qiskit nature because this seems to be a breaking change that was introduced in Terra 0.20.0. Previously this worked fine. (I am using Qiskit-nature 0.3.1).
The following code reproduces the issue:
This will return:
Generating a UCCSD object like this should not return an empty circuit with zero qubits. This seems somewhat specific to how UCCSD is generated because the same issue does not show up for the HartreeFock class.
No response
So I tracked this down and this issue was introduced in #7216. Before that, we were checking if _data is None to see if a blueprint circuit has been built or not. In #7216 we introduced a variable called _is_built for that check and changed _data to be an empty list when the circuit was not built instead of None. Now the UCCSD circuit in Qiskit Nature still does check _data -- but that argument is now never None and the circuit doesn't get built correctly.
The good news is that in the new Qiskit Nature release this is not a problem anymore but we should still fix this version incompatibility.
Edit: See qiskit-community/qiskit-nature#601 (comment).
Ah great, thank you! I installed the main GitHub branch of qiskit-nature and that does seem to fix the problem.
Ok, by my understanding I think we can close this on the Terra side (breaking the subclass API in BlueprintCircuit wasn't a great choice on our part, but it'd be even more trouble to go back on that now), and if it's fixed in dev Nature, we're ok on that front too.  Feel free to re-open if there's more to discuss here.
In case someone sees this, with Nature 0.3.2 released this issue is also fixed on the current stable install.
