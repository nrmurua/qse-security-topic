I am trying to convert Jordan-Wigner mapping to Bravyi-Kitaev mapping for an existing QASM file.
I found this stackexchange thread to be relevant, but I am not sure whether it had been correctly implemented by the author.
Could anyone advise ?
Or if possible, could this be made as part of OpenFermion internal coding implementation ?
