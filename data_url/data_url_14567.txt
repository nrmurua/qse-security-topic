Attempting to pickle an IBM Quantum job object gives the error
AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'InstructionScheduleMap.__init__.<locals>.<lambda>'
Doing the same for an Aer job object gives
TypeError: cannot pickle '_thread.RLock' object
Run the IBM Quantum Lab boilerplate plus the following.
For the Aer version use backend = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
It should be possible to pickle them, or at least to serialize them in some way.
I also observed this in 0.18.1 but not in 0.19.0.dev0+4fcd9a0.
