Thanks for the heads up - @Strilanc was saying that we can probably put the Quantum Volume stuff into cirq/experiments now. Happy to do that if it makes sense.
Yes, that would resolve this issue (+ restoring the entries in the big json dictionary)
I tried moving the file, but then I realized that it actually depends on something else in contrib - cirq.contrib.routing :\ https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/cirq/contrib/quantum_volume/quantum_volume.py#L11. That means we don't want to pull it in, right? Is routing something we want in regular Cirq, or do we need another solution for json-ifying things in contrib?
Couple of other options:
If we do have an experiments/ module, the code will likely need to depend on contrib-quality code. Any experiment worth its salt will identify functionality not strictly associated with the experiment itself but either (a) not worth it (for the experiment developer) to put in the (large) effort to move to cirq-proper, or (b) slightly too specific to alleviate concerns of cirq becoming bloated
It might be worth putting the effort into getting parts of routing into the main library. I know that people are using it, which is a strong indicator.
I suspect we'll soon and have experiment code that uses contrib code outside of whether routing is ready to graduate or not
