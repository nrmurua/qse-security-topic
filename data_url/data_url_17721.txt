Setting the figure size of iplot_hinton has no effect on the output figure size unless width and/or height are >= 10 at which point the figure becomes incredibly small.
@filemaster
10 pixels is too small to represent any kind of graph. Please, use a bigger size to define the size of the image (any pixel size bigger or equal to 300 width & height looks good).

Why does (9,9), or any number less than 10 work then?
