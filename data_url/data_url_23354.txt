This happened many times for a range of values:
eg also can replace last line with
You then cannot talk to it before clearing the message queue on the instrument by running
yoko.write('*CLS')
Can you be more specific in describing the steps needed to reproduce this? How are you sweeping? That is, what are the start, stop and steps? What is the sweep rate?
Hi Sohail. The sweep function is a wrapper on the qc.Loop from qdev-wrappers (do1d). An example of one of the times this happened is with these sweep values
"sweep_values": {
"parameter": {
"value": -0.2164,
"ts": "2018-03-27 13:51:49",
"raw_value": -0.2164,
"class": "qcodes.instrument.parameter.Parameter",
"full_name": "yoko_voltage",
"post_delay": 0,
"unit": "V",
"instrument": "qdev_wrappers.customised_instruments.GS200_ext.GS200_ext",
"instrument_name": "yoko",
"label": "Voltage",
"name": "voltage",
"step": 0.1,
"inter_delay": 1
},
"values": [
{
"first": -0.2164,
"last": -0.2364,
"num": 21,
"type": "linear"
}
also this one
"class": "qcodes.loops.ActiveLoop",
"sweep_values": {
"parameter": {
"value": -0.1538,
"ts": "2018-03-28 15:28:53",
"raw_value": -0.1538,
"class": "qcodes.instrument.parameter.Parameter",
"full_name": "yoko_voltage",
"post_delay": 0,
"unit": "V",
"instrument": "qdev_wrappers.customised_instruments.GS200_ext.GS200_ext",
"instrument_name": "yoko",
"label": "Voltage",
"name": "voltage",
"step": 0.1,
"inter_delay": 1
},
"values": [
{
"first": -0.1538,
"last": -0.1338,
"num": 41,
"type": "linear"
}
]
also bad news: clearing the error message queue by running ' yoko.write('*CLS')' and then doing a loop the actual voltage output on the yokogawa does not change but the qcodes dataset records the voltage sweep as instructed. Renders the instrument unuseable
I am currently trying to reproduce the issue
Is this possibly a LAN error?
I have noticed that occasionally the Yokogawa will stop responding over LAN (although never during a sweep), requiring an instrument restart. It would be interesting to see whether the issue occurs over USB.
