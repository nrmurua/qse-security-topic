I was trying to set up the git integration following the instructions on the manual but a _pygit2.GitError: Reference 'refs/heads/master' not found error. I've listed the commands I used below.
Make a commit in the repository.
It seems like there's an issue with creating a bare repository as stated in the instructions. I can't make a commit either and get the message,
fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree
if I have a repository where I just do git init it seems okay.
Sorry, more precisely: make a commit and push it to that repository.
If you're running everything on a single machine, you may also give the non-bare repository to ARTIQ and use a post-commit instead of a post-receive hook.
It may be obvious then but it seems like there's a missing step in the documentation. If I follow the instructions listed here,
https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-release-1/getting_started_mgmt.html#setting-up-git-integration
I get the error, which can be resolved using your suggestions but I think the documentation should be updated to include those.
