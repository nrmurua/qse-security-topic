During decapsulation, the public key is verified perfectly. We should check whether validation is required during encapsulation.
Although the official SIKE implementation does not contain public key validation for decapsulation, several validation functions are available in the SIDH signature project:

According to the feedback from one of the SIKE creators, the validation is not required because of the Fujisaka-Okamoto transform and related loss of incentive for the attacker. Closing issue.
