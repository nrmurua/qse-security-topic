In the "return" statement of enr_destroy, we have return [Qobj(a, dims=[dims, dims]) for a in a_ops]. Then, when attempting to create the Qobjs in this return statement, we have the following conditional statement:
Because np.prod assumes that the input numbers are 32 bit integers, there is a possibility for an overflow, causing the result to be negative and hence this ValueError will always be raised.
enr_destroy would work
This can be easily fixed by doing np.prod(np.hstack(self.dims[0]), dtype = np.int64)  instead of what is currently being done.
