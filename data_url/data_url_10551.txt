Description
This program:
fails:
Since sampler.sample didn't complain about type mismatch I assume that it does accept CQM and this is a bug triggered by CQM only having linear terms in it, and not having quadratic terms.
To Reproduce
n/a
Expected behavior
n/a
Environment:
The EmbeddingComposite and the DWaveSampler only accept BQMs, not CQMs or DQMs. If you want to solve CQMs you should use the LeapHybridCQMSampler.
We should probably raise a better error message, I agree.
