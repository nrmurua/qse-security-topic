DAGCircuit.extend_back() was created as a wrapper around DAGCircuit.compose_back(), making the wiring requirements more relaxed (allows partial wiring). But it is not general and only works on physically-embedded circuits (see #3762 (review)). I think we should just remove this method and make compose_back() also work with partial wirings.
I'll see if I can fix this.
