In the code to merge Clifford operations there is code that only works if a pauli string coefficient is $\pm 1$.  If not it raises a NotImplementError, lines that are not tested :(
My suspicion here is that at this point the phase can only be these two values, but someone will need to better understand this code and the associated TODO.
