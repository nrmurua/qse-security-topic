Using the Unroller to unroll a circuit can fail, while using transpile with optimization_level=0 works fine.
The error in the unroller is:
The unroller should be able to unroll any circuit if the basis is sufficient.
Not sure!
So I took a quick look at this, and I"m not sure if it's something we can solve. The unroller just works with the definition property of a gate and just descends through the definitions until it reaches something in the basis or can't find anything and fails. In the case of the second that's what's happening the first gate in the definition is P(pi/4) which is defined in terms of U which doesn't have a definition. The unroller doesn't know that U is equivalent to U3 and this problem of having gate definitions only in a single basis was exactly the reasoning behind the introduction of the basis translator. You would hit a similar thing if you used a ['p', 'sx', 'cx'] basis on the first example as the unroller is solely dependent on the basis being unrolled to matching the basis used in the gate definitions.
Of course, that cannot work! Ok maybe we should just update the warning which is not very descriptive.. ðŸ˜„
If the issue is just proper documentation of error, I will fix this issue.
