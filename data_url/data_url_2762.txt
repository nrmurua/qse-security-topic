Final section of those documents have this problems:
https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gates.html
https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simulation.html
Also optimization.
Those links are not TODO anymore, but we do need to add docs for optimization: #1703.
It looks like those links still contain TODOs
REmoved all the TODOs, I believe.
