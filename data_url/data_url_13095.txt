Mitiq is a package that at a high level takes circuits and returns error mitigated results (basically a float or an array of floats). As the industry moves to fully quantum and classical representations of programs, it will be important to support error mitigation with these new representations. The project would be developing a prototype and contributing to open source tools that would allow the existing Mitiq package (or fork of) to consume and produce hybrid quantum programs in the QIR representation.
There are a lot of different ways this could go, but a successful project would demonstrate an MVP where a hybrid quantum program could be passed to Mitiq, and it would return a new program with built-in error mitigation.
There could be an "adiabatic" or gradual migration approach where we start with an un-modified Mitiq and wrap it with other Python tools for QIR parsing and generation. Then once more of the workflows have been tested decide if there is a Pythonic route with forking Mitiq or if a fork to another language would be needed to most easily integrate with the developing quantum compiler ecosystem.
