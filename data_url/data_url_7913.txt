I have been trying to simulate a 3 level system which has a time-dependent Hamiltonian. However, the plots I obtain are wrong. I am new to qutip so I might be missing something very silly.
Here's the code:
Being basis elements, the sum of the populations should be 1 and phonon number should not go negative but the plots obtain tell a different story:

sigma_00.pdf
sigma_11.pdf
sigma_22.pdf
The version I am using is:
Any help would mean a lot to me!
Perhaps someone else can give a more concrete answer, but I guess the driving frequency is too high for the number of time-steps?  Try tweaking the ODE solver with options like the following:
options = Options(nsteps=15000, atol=1e-13, rtol=1e-13)     
and passing it to mesolve
result1 = mesolve(Ha, psi0, times, [np.sqrt(T1)*sig01, np.sqrt(T2)*sig02, np.sqrt(gamma*(nth + 1))*a, np.sqrt(gamma*nth)*a.dag()], [a.dag()*a, sig00, sig11, sig22], progress_bar=True, options=options) 
More practically speaking, for the problem you are solving I guess explicitly including the time dependence is unneccessary, since you have already made a RWA on the drive and the coupling?
Moving to an interaction picture in w1, w2 and wph, and removing the explicit time-dependence might simplify the problem and might give you equivalent results, and in the process make your code much simpler and more efficient?
In other words just set w1=w2=wph=0, and  put the drive as a time-independent term in the hamiltonian
H01 =  g*(sig12*a.dag() + sig21*a) + pump1*(sig01 + sig01.dag())
My problem may be more serious. I cannot execute the demo of time-dependent in LZ transition. I guess it is the problem of OS. My platform is MAC OS 10.14 and GCC is 4.2.1. I don't have MS VS 2015. May the environment is not satisfied.
I also got some wrong result with mesolve, which uses ZVODE integration method. The mesolve raises no warning. But I was able to get the right result with ISODA method.
The situation was applying a Pi pulse(~50 ns) to the qubit and wait about 1000 ns and then apply another Pi pulse.  The second Pi pulse had no effect for the final state.
I was using [qobj, func] pairs for the time dependent Hamiltonian, where func is the self-defined gate envelope.
Hi @xlelephant, it sounds like a different issue you mentioned, could you open a new issue with an example?
No problem, but to create an example, I need extra time to unwrap the self-defined gate sequence and refactor my test.
