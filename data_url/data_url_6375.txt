Modifying the cross entropy benchmark unit test to run to a depth of 4, it seems to run into a bugged edge case in 1 out of 1000s of random circuits, for QUnit. (If CZ is the only coupler gate, this might suppress the issue, but the combination of CZ and CNOT alone fails infrequently but consistently.)
As I gather more information, I will report it here.
As of #361, the accuracy of Qrack::QUnit has been tested for several thousand random circuits up to a depth of 5 layers. I think we can close this issue.
