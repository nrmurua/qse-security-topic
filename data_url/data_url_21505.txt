See output below. Adding the package llvm-or1k does not seem to help.
This issue was originally found by our DAX CI job.
The error is actually this:
OSError: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /home/leon/miniconda3/envs/artiq_test/lib/python3.8/site-packages/llvmlite_artiq/binding/libllvmlite.so)
Conda and conda packages have implicit dependencies on various packages from your distro, which are out of control and can break, as is happening now.
I guess you can upgrade the glibc on your system (2.32 is already one year old...), or downgrade the glibc used for building conda packages in nix-scripts (the easiest way is probably to pass an older nixpkgs into the conda FHS environment, since so many things depend on glibc).
There are apparently also some hacks such as this (this is a common conda problem and affecting other projects as well):

You are right, I did look over the glibc version error. For CI, we moved from an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS image (ubuntu:stable docker image) to an Ubuntu 21.04 image (ubuntu:rolling) and the CI job passes now.
