I realise that the Pulser._chirps() method is a bit out of place, considering we don't use it anywhere. I need it for the QM translation, but I can also just have it there instead.
The argument I have in favour of leaving it in Pulser is that it contains the information on how the detuning waveform will actually be done, which we might want to use for a more realistic display of the Sequence or even its simulation, but I don't know if this is something we want anyway.
What's your take on this @lhenriet @sebgrijalva ? Do we keep it or not?
