A make build for qrack fails on Docker build for ARM64 with an error that indicates cross-platform issues.
I have a working build from five days ago, so IMHO something has recently been pushed to change this.
Be it the compiler, or the code.

Any1 ideas on this ?
Add -DENABLE_RDRAND=OFF to the cmake command. This is due to the hardware RNG functionality we just added, which requires the compiler flag to access the RDRAND instruction. (It's noted in the README, but it's easy to miss.)
ARM compilers, like for the Raspberry Pi 3, don't recognize the compiler flag. Other systems have a compiler that recognizes the flag, but falls back to software RNG at run time if the instruction isn't detected. Obviously, you won't have hardware RNG, but the instruction isn't supported by the compiler or the hardware in the first place.
ok, read it, couldn't connect the c++ error with that option- fixed now - tnx !
