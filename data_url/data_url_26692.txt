Yes, the i386 test won't work until #1130 is merged. I haven't done that yet because there are still at least two issues.
Maybe I should merge it nevertheless?
I think, I'll just merge #1130 now. It will add a red entry to the dashboard, but maybe someone else can look into it or I'll get to it hopefully in 2-3 weeks.
