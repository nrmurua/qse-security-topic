to_latex throws an error on a valid Quil program. Presumably because it cannot handle DECLARE. Not sure if to_latex is intended to work on any valid Quil program, but at least DECLARE should work as it is required for measurement. Here's an example:
Output:
This is with pyquil 2.0.0.b6. xref #308
to_latex() should probably also ignore Halt and Pragma instructions (and well as Declare), which can legitimately show up in protoquil programs.
+1 It would be great to plot circuits with manually defined measurements.
