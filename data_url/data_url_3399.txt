Following on issue #988, which is being addressed in PR #999 (this PR adds typing for both gates.py and quilatom.py), this issue is for adding Python 3 typing to the quilbase.py, which is another critical component of the pyQuil library. Once this issue is addressed, we will begin using mypy as part of the CI for files that have been converted (see #1006).
Is #147 relevant? I can resurrect the PR, with Python 3 PEP484 syntax instead of Python 2-style comments.
fixed in #999
