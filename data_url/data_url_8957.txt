Currently, stim.TableauSimulator has many methods related to treating a tableau as a state. For example, it has to_state_vector and set_state_from_state_vector and set_state_from_stabilizers. These methods would fit well into the tableau class as methods like from_state_vector.
It would need to be well documented that, when treating a tableau as a state, we are consistenly using the state you get when applying the tableau's operation to the |000...0> state.
