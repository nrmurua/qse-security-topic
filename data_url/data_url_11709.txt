The timeout parameter seems to be ignored by the Aer simulator.
Take any long enough VQE instance and initiate the quantum instance like this:
You will see that it keeps of running much longer than 10 seconds, and terminates only when the execution is done (regardless of the timeout).
Terminate, and properly communicate this through the API.
Start by checking if the Aer simulator is supposed to support timeout. If not and it is given a timeout parameter, then maybe it should raise an exception. If yes then check if the simulator does not support timeout properly, or Aqua does not pass the timeout information properly to the simulator.
Closing because I do get a timeout exception when I set the timeout threshold to 1 second
