This causes an encoding failure when you try to print a class but its __str__ is a unicode string instead of a bytes string.
Whenever we see a def __str__(self): we should substitute this in:
Or not use unicode characters. Just saying... :-)
Ehhh.... I think fixing this is independent of whether or not we actually use it in circuit diagrams. There's a lot of ways for unicode characters to end up passing through a __str__ method.
Fixed by #179
