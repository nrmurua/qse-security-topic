The statevector simulation on GPU returns wrong final states if the number of qubits is >= 10.
Using the following minimal example:
I get the |0> state instead of the QFT with 26 qubits state vector:
Moreover, if I add a repetition loop this state returns random solutions.
The exact QFT final state. I have also noticed that for small number of qubits the GPU is always on idle, like a sort of CPU fallback, however I can't find information about that behaviour in the documentation.
@doichanj Can you look into this?
Should be fixed by #1325
