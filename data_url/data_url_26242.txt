Previously, toqito made use of the previously free and supported Travis system for automated test, build, and lint pipelines.
At present, there is not an automated CI/CD solution in place. I don't have any particularly strong opinions on what technology stack is used here, so I'm all for discussing this at greater length to hone in on an ideal solution. It would be great for tests/linting/etc. to run automatically along with more in-depth reports on important codebase metrics (i.e. code-coverage, etc).
In addition to setting this up, the pipeline would need to successfully run the tests and be linted properly As the tests are currently passing (but not in an automated manner) and the code is fairly well-linted, there should not be too many additional tweaks here.
Hey @vprusso, I am getting started on this. My plan is to use GitHub Actions since it's built into the platform and generally well-regarded. I'll try and keep parity with your existing Travis steps. Then we can discuss what would be ideal if changes are needed. Does that make sense?

That does make sense! Actually, I was hoping to move away from Travis completely and go entirely in the direction of GitHub actions as that seems to be the standard way of doing these things now.
