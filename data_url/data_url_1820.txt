Is your feature request related to a use case or problem? Please describe.
The CliffordTableau is still not being removed from the CliffordSimulator because direct_fidelity_estimation still relies on the availability of stabilizers from CliffordState.
Describe the solution you'd like
We can move to use the tableau directly

Happy to take this on if you want me to.
Thanks for creating the issue, Tony. I can take it up.
By a quick glance at the direct_fidelity_estimation implementation (for Cliffords), it seems to just be iterating over the circuit and using CliffordSimulator'sapply_unitary on all the ops. After that it just needs the stabilizers from the final state to proceed. It seems easy to just switch to using CliffordTableau instead of CliffordState and act_on protocol instead of apply_unitary. It will also add the ability to handle any measurements the circuit might have. Let me know if that sounds good or if I'm missing some caveat.
I sent you:
