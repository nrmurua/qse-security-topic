Issue part 1: The docs for QVMConnection.expectation()'s second argument operator_programs says it takes a list of PauliTerms, but it actually expects a list of Programs.
Issue part 2: It would be much more convenient to have it take a list of PauliTerms or PauliSums
With #262 you can now do
should this be included in pyquil somewhere?
@marcusps says
... passing programs to represent observables is just seems like a hack, and is bound to lead to confusion -- it certainly caught me by surprise.
... [T]he real fix should to be stop representing observales with programs. I don't think that is a defensible design choice.
Let me add to my comment. PauliTerm.program also drop the sign/phase of the PauliTerm, and this leads to very subtle bugs when performing calculations.  I suggest that we transparently support both PauliTerms and the program representation for now, but through a scary warning when programs are used, and indicate that interface will be deprecated in the future.
Closed by #396
