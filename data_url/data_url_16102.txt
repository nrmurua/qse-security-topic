A statevector simulation of a simple quantum circuit with two gates gives incorrect results. The circuit consists from an X gate and RYGate controlled by two qubits.
The following code compares the problematic circuit with double controlled gate (gate.control(...).control(...)) with its equivalent which is implemented using gate.control(num_cuntrol_qubits=2, ...):
The code above is self contained and should work in any setup.
The code should return ['001', '101'] in both cases.
I believe the problems lies in the transpilation process, due to the different transpiled circuits. In the doubly controlled circuit there are extra controls on the transpilation of the inner gate. I'm not sure how to correct this issue.
Im transferring issue to Terra since I think it is a transpiler issue. If you look at the transpiled circuit that is run by the simulator for the two cases they are quite different:
Circuit1:
Circuit 2
