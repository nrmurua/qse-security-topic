I know this question might not strictly relate to Quirk, but anyway: what defines a radius (r) in Bloch sphere?
Suppose I prepared a W state for 4 quibits with this circuit.
In the given cicuit r=0.5 for all 4 quibuts. Does r define a measure of entanglement between qubits? Or I can make r=0.5 for one single qubit?
You should ask this question on the quantum computing stack exchange.
The radius tells you how close to a pure state the qubit is. A pure qubit has one specific direction along which you will always get the same measurement result; the direction of the bloch vector. Qubits can appear not-pure for two very distinct reasons: entanglement and uncertainty. The radius being less than 1 is a necessary condition for entanglement, but not a sufficient one, so it is a useful but unreliable signal. And entanglement is extremely diverse: many of its relevant details can't be adequately described by just one number per qubit.
Thanks a lot!
