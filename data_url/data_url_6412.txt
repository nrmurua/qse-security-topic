The code in vm6502q.v3.0 is stable and complete, but the doxygen and general documentation is messy and out-of-date. We should follow today's release with a v3.1, just to get the documentation to a pristine state.
The doxygen resides in this repo, so updating the documentation will require an iteration on the framework repo. I plan to change nothing else, between now and the v3.1 documentation update.
This should be ready for update now.
