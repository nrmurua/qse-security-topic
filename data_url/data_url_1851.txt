Hi,
it looks like that R(theta, phi) gates are not supported by QASM parser in Cirq.
It is especially strange having in mind that R(theta, phi) gate is hardware native gate for Google devices.
At the same time R gate is implemented in Cirq as cirq.PhasedXPowGate(p, t) and could be added in a circuit, but could not be parsed from QASM. Qiskit on the other hand supports QASM readout of the R gate.
I believe it shouldn't be very hard to add such functionality.
Thanks for opening this!
Yes, this should be relatively easy to implement using a mapping like this:
I was just looking at this issue, and if you're asking for the parser to create a PhasedXPowGate from QASM, then, based on my understanding, I don't think you can do it with the current version of the parser because it currently doesn't support parsing custom gate definitions. Using it with something like the following would throw an exception:
I guess you could add custom logic to check parameters for u3 gates in _parser.py and return a PhasedXPowGate instead of a QasmUGate, but this would be tech debt that would likely need to be changed when the parser adds the ability to handle custom gate definitions down the road.
There might be some optimizer functionality that I'm missing here though.
This looks to me like it was fixed in #4455
