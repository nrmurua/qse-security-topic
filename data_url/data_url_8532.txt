Exponentiating a zero matrix yields a zero matrix in the latest version of qutip.
Did you try the development release? Seems to work just fine.
Yes. Perhaps it is a problem with my scipy installation or something. I'll do some more poking around and try to figure it out.
This works as far as I can tell. Closing for lack of response.
