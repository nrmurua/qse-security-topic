In the Visualization section: plot_hinton
It displays 2 plots : one for real and one for imaginary
There are 2 issues:

We expect the following plot_hinton

We make few simple changes in the state_visualizaton.py file and we can obtain the correct plot for the imaginary section in the plot_hinton.
The second part of this issue (The size of the square of the elements are not equal for the imaginary plot) will be fixed by #8447.
I am investigating in the first part of the issue. The hinton plot currently plots the matrix transversely. I am not sure if this is the expected behavior.
produces

The first part of the issue I think its related with the elements displayed on the hinton plot
As seen from the density matrix, the elements of the  real part is displayed as shown :

This the second example specific : elements related to real as well as imaginary section.
I think, how are the elements are displaced is confusing . Still will look into it. Maybe we have can small description for the same.
