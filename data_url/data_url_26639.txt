I get in a make test run:
That binary was renamed some time ago. Unfortunately contrary to our other regtests, unittests are just discovered by convention rather than by explicitly registering them.
This breaks the workflow for people switching branches regularly and makes for example a git bisect more difficult since you have to explicitly clean the exe-dir.
I think, power users who know git bisect can also run make execlean. It's a minor inconvenience on which we shouldn't spend time.
Well, I guess it would be rather easy to rip out the discovery part and add the unit tests to TEST_DIRS instead. This would have the added benefit that we could add tags to them.
