Hi, Johnnie
H = qtn.NNI_ham_XY(n=10, S=1)
psi0 = qtn.MPS_computational_state('0'*10)
tebd = qtn.TEBD(psi0, H)
tebd.updata_to(1, tol=1e-3)
The code returns a ValueError, it's about the function 'gate_split' in 'tensor_1d.py', the size of gate has been set to (2, 2, 2, 2), but when spin = 1, it should be (3, 3, 3, 3), so it cannot reshape array of size 81 into shape (2, 2, 2, 2). It's better to set the size to be (spin*2+1, spin*2+1, spin*2+1, spin*2+1).
thanks,
Qicheng
This problem is not to do with the gate but rather because MPS_computational_state is for 'qubits' (i.e. spin-1/2). You could use
which then raises no errors for me. I would note that I haven't really thoroughly tested the higher spin stuff so do do plenty of sanity checks!
okay, i will check the high-spin cases.
