Hi,
It seems there are some errors in the Floquet mesolve-equivalent function, which are not seen when considering a simple qubit.
Consider for instance an harmonic oscillator with a drive, which should converge towards a coherent state:
output_ref.states[-1] is a coherent state as expected.

But output.states[-1] is far from being a coherent state.

I tried to debug it, without real success for now :/
EDIT: Might be partially related to #624.
Got it to work as expected after a few changes:

Many thanks for taking all the time to look into the Floquet solver.  I have no time of my own to devote to it at the moment, so feel free to modify and change as you see best.
Sure, I'll try to keep my PR up to date with my latest checks.
For anyone who might be using qutip for Floquet simulations, would be cool to have some reviews on my PR :)
qutip.floquet does this floquet formalism supports any hamiltonian or just it works for two level systems? Also the code uploaded is not working, how to plot this wigner function? as an initial learning point. Floquet formalism is totally not working fro me. plz help

It should support any hamiltonian. I have simulations test cases with harmonic oscillators for instance. However, you should have a look at the code from #766 since the code currently in QuTiP repository seems to have been tested only with two-level systems and contains some bugs.
Also the code uploaded is not working, how to plot this wigner function?
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you are talking about.

I think you should first try to make it work with simple two-level systems. See http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html and https://gitlab.inria.fr/lverney/qutip_floquet_example/blob/master/Example.ipynb. Note that there are some bugs in the current QuTiP code which are fixed by #766 but this one is not yet merged.
I have tried the simple two-level systems in http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-floquet.html and found an unexpected error, could you help to solve this problem #854 ?
Following the closing of #766 and for anyone having issues with the current Floquet codes (which has some bugs, there are open issues about it), here is a gist containing a working version of the Floquet code in qutip, to study Hamiltonian and steady-state behavior of any time-periodic system: https://gist.github.com/Phyks/20bfb5107cbc595f9e54ff92fccd6fb5.
Main differences with qutip code is:
Hope this helps,
Thank you @Phyks. Could you open a PR about it? @Ericgig, I saw that the new solvers PR relative to QobjEvo, #990, sesolve is called instead of mesolve. Probably these changes here are independent on this.
Hi @jakelishman, given your expertise, it may be very useful if you could have a look at the floquet module. There are a lot of issues connected to it, and many users are really eager to see their solutions. This would be a milestone for QuTiP future releases, later in 2020. If interesting, there could even be projects that could be proposed as part of Google Summer of Code 2020.
I'll try and have a look in the coming weeks - hopefully it's not too urgent or someone else could take it.  I suspect looking over the whole module will require quite a lot of work, and it's been quite some time since I was last working with Floquet theory, but I'd certainly be interested in having a go.
They’ve been on a dead track for months if not years, so there is no rush. Probably your experience is more than enough. Given that a thorough overhaul may be demanding, I mentioned the Google Summer of Code option: applying with a project and being chosen is a way to get well paid for a couple of months of involvement. This applies also to other modules, we will post our project ideas on the wiki page, a look at last year project proposals is here. Having good candidates get in touch early allows them to craft a strong proposal and may prompt the mentors to provide a specific project idea, which they would not otherwise bring up: https://github.com/qutip/qutip/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2019.
See #1248 that implements the correct A.  I'm not certain about the comment about c_ops - I'll need to look into it more before we merge #1248.
The Floquet solver was heavily rewritten in QuTiP 5, so closing this for now.
