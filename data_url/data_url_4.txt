As title requests please add to your list QRL - Quantum Resistant Ledger
https://theqrl.org
I've thought about this for a bit since its tangential to the core mission of this project. However, I think it fits nicely into the Quantum cryptography section alongside the quantum-proof OpenSSH and OpenSSL projects. I've added it just now.
Thanks for your input!
