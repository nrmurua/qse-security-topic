Hello, I find that there are  build options for cuda in the install_cp2k_toolchain.sh file, but there is no counterpart for ROCm or HIP. It seems that the DBCSR library can be built with HIP, so I wonder if CP2K can do the same.
Thanks!
CP2K does currently not support HIP. For now I'm focusing on Cuda.
OK, thank you for the confirmation! I want to ask further that, do you have any plan to support HIP? If you do, when will the HIP version of CP2K be available?
I'll probably look into HIP later this year. I first want to polish the Cuda kernels and speedup our GPU regtests.
