Hi
I tried to compile cp2k-8.1 with sirius 6.5.3 (with gfortran 10.2.0 and Cygwin on Windows 10) and got the following errors during compiling sirius_interface.f:
The "passed LOGICAL(4) to LOGICAL(1)" errors can be solved by replaceing ".FALSE./.TRUE." with "LOGICAL(L=.FALSE.(or .TRUE.), KIND=1)".
According to the function declaration on genetated.F90 (found in sirius/src/api. The latest file also can be seen in https://github.com/electronic-structure/SIRIUS/blob/master/src/api/generated.f90),
the type of arguments of the functions "sirius_create_context, sirius_create_kset_from_grid and sirius_create_ground_state" are apparently
different between sirius_interface.f and declaration of sirius 6.5.3.
How could be solved the problem?
Thank you in advance.
it is unfortunately not prominently documented, but the minimal required version of SIRIUS for CP2K 8.1 is SIRIUS 7.0
Dear Dev-zero,
Thank you for quick reply!
I just cloned Sirius at Dec. 12 so I did not think the Sirius version is too old.
I will clone the latest Sirius, compile and use it with cp2k 8.1.
Best Regards,
hi @brhr-iwao
Depending on the way you compile SIRIUS you will have two options.
Dear @mtaillefumier
Thank you for kind instruction!
I will try to clone or download either of Sirius 7.0.0, 7.0.1 or 7.0.2 and use with cp2k-8.1.
Best Regards,
My pleasure. I would download the archive directly here
https://github.com/electronic-structure/SIRIUS/archive/v7.0.2.tar.gz
or of course on github here
if case of trouble open an issue directly on SIRIUS github (I am one the maintainers/dev of the package)
We officially only support a single version for each of our requirements. Those versions are defined by our toolchain. Other versions might work too, but we don't test them. So, you mileage may vary.
so it should be documented in the INSTALL.md that people should consult the toolchain scripts wrt to supported versions
