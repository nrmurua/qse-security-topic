Use GPU acceleration according to the tutorial, but after running ./demo, an error occurs ：“memory cannot be allocated on the GPU” . Why？ How can i solve it.
按照教程的方式使用GPU加速，但是运行./demo后出现报错，无法分配内存在GPU
That error is triggered when cudaMalloc fails (see here), which usually implies that the attempted state-vector (created with createQureg) was too large to fit in GPU memory.
I imagine though your GPU can fit the 64 bytes needed for the tutorial's 3-qubit register :)
I would guess you've supplied the wrong GPU_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY for your GPU. Look up your GPU here, and as per the tutorial, compile with
How'd you get on with this? Did a different GPU_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY fix your issue?

no，I got a bigger memory GPU
Are you saying you switched to a different GPU which incidentally has QuEST's default GPU_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY = 30? The tutorial example requires a negligible amount of GPU memory (as said, 64 bytes).

I think the error reason is my program needs more GPU memory, bacause when I run my program at a 32G GPU, no this error!
Ah I thought you were referring to the previously mentioned tutorial, which definitely does not demand 32 GiB. Sounds like a simple hardware problem then :)
