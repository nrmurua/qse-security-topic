The tutorial page here (i.e. /doc/source/tutorials/qiskit_hybrid_neural_network/source.rst) needs to be converted to a jupyter notebook, like the other tutorials. At the moment, the implementation is in a giant code snippet copied from a Python script.
Hi @araghukas I would like to work on this issue.

Hi @tinaoberoi, awesome! Please go right ahead.
One thing to note is that you will need access/credentials for AWS as well as IBM Quantum to actually run this. However, if you don't have the required access but are willing to rearrange and annotate the code into a Notebook format (which would be greatly appreciated!), then I'm happy to do a test run myself.
@araghukas I will follow the second approach without credentials for now. If I hit a blocker will update.
