As noted here, when the build is configured with the command:
upon building, the following tests fail:
with either ERROR: OQS_SIG_verify failed or ERROR: OQS_SIG_sign failed
I can't repro on my Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS.
Interesting, I'm able to reproduce on my Ubuntu 19.10, with clang version 10.0.0. Will try to investigate this.
I'm running Ubuntu in the Windows Linux Subsystem, so there are perhaps side-effects wrt the compiler flags used.
I created a VM with avx2 and bmi2 support, and I was able to repro the issue. I'll investigate next week.
I can't easily find the source of the problem. The Picnic team pushed a v2.2 version last month to fix a few things, just before releasing v3. I'll plan on integrating the v2.2 update in this OQS release, and integrate v3.0 (introducing new parameters) after our snapshot.
Fixed by #743.
After discussing with the Picnic team, I learned that the clang-9 issue should be fixed with a commit from on their v3 code. I'll try to pull that in our  v.2.2 PR #746 and see if that fixes the issue.
