Hello,
When I try to install cp2k in my school hpc, which is PBS, there is a problem information, that  ERROR: (./scripts/install_libint.sh, line 82) Non-zero exit code detected.
This is the command i used to compile cp2k
The attached is make.log of installing LIBINT.
make.log
Thanks for your time and consideration on this problem.
Thanks in advance.
Which CP2K version did you try to install? The LIBINT make.log shows no error message or any other helpful information.
Thanks for your reply!
This is version 7.1.
In the below, it is the errer information shown in the terminal.

These are other log files in installing LIBINT:
configure.log
[config.log](https://github.com/cp2k/
CMakeLists.txt
cp2k/files/9618459/config.log)
config.log
I suggest to try the current cp2k release version 2022.1 instead of a three years old release.
