When creating a subclass of a PauliGate, it does not serialize correctly.
See example below. This was originally opened as an issue in qiskit-ibm-provider:
Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-provider#690.
This fails with the following message:
Should work correctly.
The method _write_instruction defines:
Perhaps it should be taking
The problem here is a conflict between the Gate class and the params list for PauliGate. What qpy does in the case of custom gate classes (that are defined outside of qiskit) is it stores a custom instance of Gate with the definition, name, number of qubits, and params copied over from the custom class. This is done because for deserialization there is no guarantee that the custom definition will be available on the other side (the class might not be defined, it might be completely different, etc). However, in this case because it's a subclass of PauliGate the params are strings which is a valid type for PauliGate's constructor, but not for a Gate object.  This is fundamentally an issue with the data model of Gate/Instruction's inheritance around parameter type validation (where it allows the parent to be more restrictive than the child class). I'm not sure there is fix that will allow the PauliGate subclass to be serialized as it's built there short of changing that. If you overrode the params of ChildPauliGate not be the pauli labels then (with a fix to #8941) the serialization will work as expected as a gate named pauli with the same definition will exist in the circuit.
