I build a short circuit with only 2 rz gates, and try to check if it is equivalent to Id. Qiskit crashes because it attempts to translate the rz gates to u.
No crash.
No response
The reason that this code fails is since it calls Clifford(circuit) where circuit contains non-clifford gates (rz or u).
According to the following documentation of the Clifford class (see: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford.html)
Clifford operators can be initialized from circuits containing only Clifford gates
If you want to check that this circuit is equivalent to identity, you can call Operator(circuit) to get its unitary matrix,
see: https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.quantum_info.Operator.html
Thanks, will try that.
