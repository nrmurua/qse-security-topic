Users as stupid as myself, may not find the documentation that you have here https://qojulia.org/documentation/index.html if they only look at the github page and not at the organiation page.
So please link the docs page in the github repo page as well :)
Nevermind, I now realize that the doc link is not on the "Documentation: link" but on the "More information, documentation and examples can be found on our website http://qojulia.org." sentence!
