With a length scale, obviously.
This seems tricky?  I guess you take all the durations and try to find a "minimal" unit of time, and then use that to draw the schedule?  If we can spec this out this might be a good starter issue.
By default I think it should try to infer the length scale from the duration of the operations that are present, and the times between them. Perhaps the default could be provided by the device. There should be an argument to override this default length scale. The length scale should be included in the output diagram.
Closing because Schedule was removed.
