yeah because @Strilanc  is out and it requires some auth on his machine.  I have instructions for doing this but haven't fixed it since it is easier to wait for @Strilanc to get back (Monday-ish)
Ah yes. That manually reset Craig has to do every once in a while haha.
I'll let this stay open for if we ever manage to automate that auth part.
Back up and running.
Thanks!
