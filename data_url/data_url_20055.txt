I'm trying to replace NTT code with assembly using NEON and building for integration with liboqs. The implementation environment is ARMv8.2 based ubuntu environment, and the target algorithm is dilithium. However, the build does not proceed with an error about the assembly item at compile time. Looking at the error items, it seems that CMAKE does not build based on ARMv8.
Examples of error items are as follows.
[../~/asm.S : 312:12 error : invalid suffix "b" on floating constant, MOV v26.16b, v2.16b]
Are there any build options I need to modify if leveraging assemblies? I didn't find that issue in various documents including the README.txt.

Hi there,
I haven't seen this error before. Just to clarify, these are asm files you are adding to the reference implementation from pqcrystals? What are the build commands you are using?

Thanks for your interest, this is not the official implementation provided by pqcrystals. For accelerating specific functions, we replaced function implementation from C to Asm. Since there is an additional generated file(asm.S), we modified the Makefile and proceeded with the build, but the above error occurred.
We've actually verified that the asm code we've written works on that platform. However, when I try to merge with liboqs I get the following error:
I get the following error:
Something seems to be missing here (?)
@Youngbeom94 : Is this issue still open/do you have an error message we can check or shall we close the issue?
Closing issue due to lack of activity. Please re-open if needed.
