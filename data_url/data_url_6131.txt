Add support for the following expectation value snapshots to the Stabilizer::State class in stabilizer_state.hpp
Suppose that a circuit has 5 qubits and the observable is 0.2IIXZI + 0.7ZXYII.
Iterate on the Pauli operators. In the first iteration, take care of IIXZI, and in the second iteration take care of ZXYII.
For IIXZI:
Apply the same steps for ZXYII and sum the values of the Pauli operators.
The algorithm for the Pauli expectation value calls the probabilities snapshot. According to @chriseclectic, the code for the stabilizer probabilities snapshot does not work properly for subsets of qubits. The following should work:
Assume a circuit of 5 qubits and a probabilities snapshot on qubits 0, 2, and 3.
Complexity is a polynomial multiplied by 2 to the number of qubits in the subset. Consequently, Pauli expectation value is polynomial for local Hamiltonians.
In the deterministic case there is in fact no need to go in recursion, just to set all deterministic qubits and branch on the random ones.
