I'd like to suggest you put more references into the API doc or source code comments, preferably as what SciPy people do in their "References" section. I don't mean that you spend a lot of time to put a "References" section into every piece of code. But, some references would be very helpful for understanding your particular implementation of those components of quintessential nature of quantum computing.
Thanks.
@DevelopDaily Great suggestion, and sorry for getting at this issue so late! Most of the implementations follow the conventions in Nielsen and Chuang. Some are my own. The only code that is not following in the two categories is explicitly documented. I guess I can mention in the Wiki, or in a README, as doing this for every function may be tedious.
Do you have any particular case in mind, so I can understand better what you mean? I.e., how'd you write some docs for some specific function?
According to docs ket qpp::QEngine::get_psi(); returns state of quantum system. ket is vector, but state of quantum system should be a matrix with size 2^N x 2^N. How to get this full matrix?
@sergeysalata The state is a vector, as you evolve an initial pure state. What you're asking for is the density matrix, which can be obtained by ket psi = qengine.get_psi(); cmat rho = prj(psi);.
