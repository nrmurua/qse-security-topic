The CHANGELOG release versions are not compatible with the actual releases on PyPI. For instance, it says 0.230.0.rc0 was released on 2023-11-24 in the CHANGELOG, but that was actually 0.229.0.rc.0.
Look at the CHANGELOG :)
The versions should match.
Maybe I am bad at reading :)
Hmm, that is indeed weird ðŸ¤” . We'll look into this.
(btw, I believe you meant 0.230.0 instead of 0.223.0 here ðŸ˜… :

What is up with me and numbers lately!! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
@Andrew-S-Rosen After a quick overview of the nightly workflow, it seems like this should be fixed now as there's a 230 release on pypi. It was actually that release on pypi that got out of sync/wrong. I believe things should function as expected from now as both are now at 230.
I'd vote for making this issue as resolved and if we encounter a similar scenario again, we can reopen it.
Ah, makes sense! Closing.
