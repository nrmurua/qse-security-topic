@cduck noticed this.
Pytest is only supposed to be a dev dependency, but asynchronous.py imports it in order to implement one of the helper testing methods. We should rewrite the code in question.
Also, we should have a trivial continuous integration check that does nothing except try to import cirq and print a circuit (similar to what the package verification script does). This could be snuck into one of the existing ones, just before installing test dependencies.
