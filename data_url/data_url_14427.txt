Due to floating-point errors, resulting from the application of np.abs, Waveform - upon initialization - may throw a PulseError, incorrectly suggesting that there is at least one sample with a norm greater than the sum of unity and arbitrary tolerance.
The corresponding method is https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/f960d05ab664665d2fdcbe4060d9f17b09274a16/qiskit/pulse/library/waveform.py#L56
Essentially, the logic dictates that:
P.S.: It's unclear to me where the non-determinism of test failures - given repeated executions of the same test - originates (assuming no other tests are run at all, as part of each test run, as per this and this).
Assuming a properly set-up dev environment, the issue can be reproduced in one of the following ways (both extracted from #7235; both courtesy of @1ucian0):
If not reproducible with 10 iterations, increase the magnitude to 100 or 1000.
Guards should be implemented to ensure that the norm-checking logic doesn't break as a result of floating-point errors. This is my interpretation of an approach suggested by @jakelishman.
If you could, please, label this with mod: pulse.
It would probably be a very low priority work item (subsets of it might naturally escalate, as a result of independent bug reports of individual cases), but I suggest that all applications of np.abs across the codebase get looked into, at some point, so that a uniform (and as elegant as possible) solution(s) could be applied, as per whatever the different error cases might require.
