The output of qiskit.circuit.random.random_circuit for 64+ qubits with conditional=True can cause a variety of failures throughout transpilation, depending on the particular ordering of passes run.
One minimal example, which triggers a bug via StochasticSwap:
produces
No type errors during compilation.
The problem is that random_circuit outputs numpy.uint64 values for the comparisons, but some points in the compiler stack need to re-map conditions, and use bitmasks against Python's bigint int type.  The fixed-width Numpy types don't support this if the Python int they're masking / being masked by don't fit.  random_circuit should be outputting the correct int type; this is compelled by the newer IfElseOp form, but not the old form.
