In QAOA, by default the driver is an X acting on all qubits; Of course it is supposed to be on the specified qubits.  But instead, in the source code grove/pyqaoa/qaoa.py, line 88 and 89:
for i in range(self.n_qubits):
ref_prog.inst(H(i))
So it is applying X to the range of (0,n_qubits), instead of the qubits desired.
