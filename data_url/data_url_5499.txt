Add number of qubits to first line of circuit files when missing.
As noted in #94, qFlex currently misbehaves when the first line is a gate instead of a qubit count. Specifically, the circuit-data-parser consumes the cycle number from the gate as the qubit count, which causes the gate to be malformed when it is read later in the file.
To fix this, we need to enforce the "first line is number of qubits" requirement.
Resolved by #103.
