There is an experimental yosys-plugin for inserting and synthesize VHDL with yosys.
We might not want this in the stable VM, but we would like to try it out.
https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl-yosys-plugin
What shall we do?
@ThorKn I can add a flag to the ghdl install script that controls whether or not the shared library should be build and installed.
That would be the best way i.m.o.. And the default should be "false".
