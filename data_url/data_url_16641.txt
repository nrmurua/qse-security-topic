In the spirit of #2797 it would be great if latex drawer add support for cregbundle.
Take the following example:

I suggest something like this:

The latex code for that figure is:
Hello! I haven't contributed to any open-source software but I want to try my hand at this.
Sure! Go ahead. Let me know if I can help!
It seems there is a small bug:
with circuit.draw('latex', cregbundle=False):

with circuit.draw('latex', cregbundle=True):

The expected result is to have two registers in the last image.
A side note (if it's not easy to fix, no worries. We can leave it for later). Would it be possible avoid moving the gates right? Consider this:


Oh wow, I never realized that multiple classical registers could be in the same circuit! That's pretty interesting. I'm working on squashing that bug now.
Relating to the side note: I'll certainly try my best to fix the formatting and avoid moving the gates to the right but, even from a brief look, the problem looks more complicated than I can handle. It's not going to stop me from trying though!
Unrelated to the bugs brought up, I found another bug where the number on the bundle would bug out:

But I then I fixed it:

I just wanted to let you know that I know about this and I've already dealt with it in case you also find the same bug as well.
