Many applications can make a good use of an AST visitor. In my case, for "unparsing". There were many attempts to create ASTs, but they fall behind quickly, as the grammar is a moving target.
If I understand correctly the ANTLR documentation, it is possible to annotate the grammar with semantic actions. This would allow to keep the AST generation in sync with the grammar.
I believe this may be within the scope of the working group proposed here - #221 (comment).
For reference see New OpenQASM2 translator based on ANTLR4 grammar
Closing this as fixed with the merge of #269.
