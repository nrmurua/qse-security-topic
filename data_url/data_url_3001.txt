I get errors when state is complex valued. Consider:
hm, strange.  Where are you running this: google3 or your own virtual env?
My own virtualenv. I cloned a new version of cirq today.
Some context:
I am simulating unitary dynamics with a given Circuit, then saving the final state. I then pass that final state (complex valued) to a second simulation (which uses a Circuit of MeasurementGates) and collect many sample measurements.
Just to confirm that virtualenv was using Python 3?
Correct. My code is not compatible with 2.7.
Fixed in #131
