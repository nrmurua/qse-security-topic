Dear Developers,
I tried out your bqskit package. When installing the version 1.0.4 of the package from pip  I could import a circuit from a qasm file.
However, when I cloned the package from the GitHub repository (either branch master or tag 1.0.4), the following code snippet gives an error:
The error message indicates that qasm files are not supported in the package:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/laci/kutatas/test2.py", line 3, in 
circuit = Circuit.from_file('heisenberg-16-20.qasm')
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
File "/home/laci/kutatas/bqskit/bqskit/ir/circuit.py", line 3164, in from_file
language = get_language(filename.split('.')[-1])
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
File "/home/laci/kutatas/bqskit/bqskit/ir/lang/init.py", line 17, in get_language
raise ValueErro
Could you help us to resolve  this issue?
Best regards, Peter
Hi Peter, thanks for the bug report.
It seems like the error message is cut off a bit, was there any additional message there?
In any case, can you try the 1.1-dev branch to see if the issue is resolved? We will be pushing an update soon, so hopefully this is already fixed.
It seems to work, even in the master branch.  I don't see a reason why it was not working before... Thanks for your help.
