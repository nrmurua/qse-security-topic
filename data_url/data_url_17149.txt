The circuit visualizers are currently configurable via some kwargs to the circuit.draw() function, but also the mpl drawer accepts a style dict. This request is to unify the interface so that the important ones are accessed via the kwargs. The mpl style should probably just be trimmed down to some coloring schemes.
Here's a rundown of the status of each:
 'cregbundle': this is a useful option that is only available via the mpl style, and I'd like it to be available in all via a kwarg in draw(). PR Support for cregbundle in text circuit drawer #4274
 'line_length' kwarg: this currently only works for text. The mpl accepts a 'fold' key in its style. These should be consolidated into a fold kwarg (i think fold is better than line_length). PR "fold" option unified across drawers #3108
 'scale' kwarg: works well for mpl and latex. Does not work for text, which is probably expected. But docstring should reflect that. PR Support for cregbundle in text circuit drawer #4274
 'filename' kwarg: file saving does not work for text. It should. Could not reproduce.
 'plot_barriers' kwarg: this works well. The mpl style key 'plotbarriers' is redundant and should be removed. PR Deprecate allowing extra keys in circuit drawer style dict #3105
I'd like to give this one a shot if possible.
@maxKenngott Probably the best way it to make a PR for each of the items in this issue. Are you going for any one in particular first?
'plot_barriers' kwarg: this works well. The mpl style key 'plotbarriers' is redundant and should be removed.
Fixed in #3105
I used a flight to attack some of them. Let me know what's on your plate @maxKenngott !
