The FreeBSD port science/py-qiskit-terra was updated to 0.25.1 on Aug 18th, but now the fetch fails:
Was the release re-made, or was your GitHub account hacked and the new tarball is malicious?
The release was re-rolled.

This issue #10755  may be helpful, please give a read.
Those tarballs are just automatically generated by GitHub on a tag event.  We haven't rerun any release, but you're not downloading an artifact that we generate and so we don't have complete control on it.  Judging by the file size change, I'm guessing that GitHub has modified that tarball due to the repository renaming also discussed in #10755.
Maybe it is a modification in the tarball root directory? now is called qiskit-0.25.1, maybe it was called qiskit-terra-0.25.1? Let us know if this answers the questions so we can close this issue
