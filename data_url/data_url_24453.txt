With travis's recent billing changes that went into effect this month: https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing we're rapidly approach the qiskit project quota for the free trial accounts. This is problematic as both retworkx (for non-x86 jobs) and ibmq provider (for networking reasons) both rely on travis for their CI. We don't want to hit that quota and block development/testing on those projects. So we should try to remove our travis usage for things that dwe can run elsewhere to prioritize access to projects that really need it.
Github actions provides a good alternative that has all the necessary capabilities and native integration with github so we should migrate our CI jobs to use that instead. It also offers a much larger quota and enables things like storing artifacts from jobs (useful for saving docs build output etc). You can look at projects like ignis and aqua on how to configure it
I am happy to work on this if no one else wants to.
As discussed offline -- we are setup to use github actions once the repo goes to public.  There may be one or two minor hiccups but nothing to keep this issue open until March for.
