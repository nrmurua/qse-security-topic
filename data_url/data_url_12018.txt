In the tutorial on vehicle routing,  I see a couple of issues:
It would be nice to have the derivation of the quadratic form from the integer programming formulation of the problem.
The tutorials that are here on optimization have been moved to the new qiskit-optimization repo and refactored. These here will shortly be removed. So the vehicle routing one is here now https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-optimization/blob/master/docs/tutorials/07_examples_vehicle_routing.ipynb having been updated too. I do not know if the issue you state still exists - maybe you'd take a look. If this still exists then maybe @nonhermitian can transfer this over.
Closing as the tutorials no longer exist here. Thanks for suggesting how to improve Qiskit!
