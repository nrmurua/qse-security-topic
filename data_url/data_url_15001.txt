CI reported a failure in an algorithms test that I've not seen before.  It doesn't appear to be related to the PR in question (#10172), since it passed CI when up-to-date and not in the queue, and only failed when re-running the exact same commit in the queue.
This is my first time noticing this particular failure, so it could be that it's super rare.  It'd be good to know for sure, though - the traceback below makes it look like there might be some mistaken handling of parameters somewhere.
Traceback from CI:
Stable CI.
