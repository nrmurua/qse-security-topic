I think I broke pysisyphus when I reverted the HDF5 patch (no idea how these two are connected).
It now fails a test:
@sheepforce
Hm I mean Pysisyphus uses HDF5 quite a lot but I also have no idea how this would influence numerics. @eljost Do you know more?
Anyway, the assert is checking cycle numbers and apparently now it converges faster than before ðŸ˜„
This test keeps failing:
It seems to be a bit of a gamble if it passes or fails. It fails almost every other evaluation of the master branch, when nixpkgs is updated.
Is there a way to disable this test?
Interestingly this test never fails if I run it locally w/o Nix, but with Python 3.9.9 and numpy/scipy/pyscf from PyPI. It seems that Phillip added several tests to this list

so they are skipped.
Ok, I disabled the test. It builds fine again.
