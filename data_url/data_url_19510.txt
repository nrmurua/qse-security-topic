I think it would be useful to be able to pass a list, an array, a range or similar as argument to the measurement gate. I encountered this need when programing a quantum classifier with qibo. Depending on the number of clases to be classified, the number of qubits measured is different. In order to automatize which qubits are measured as a function of the number of clases, this feature is desirable.
Sorry, I wrote too quickly before. Can be automatized easily anyways.
Don't know then if this issue makes sense or not
If you mean a list of qubit IDs, the measurement gate accepts an arbitrary number of qubits so you can pass a list using the * operator. For example gates.M(*[0, 2, 3, 4]) will measure qubits 0, 2, 3 and 4. The same works with generators (such as range) and numpy arrays, so gates.M(*range(10)) will measure qubits 0 to 9.
Oh, I see. Thanks Stavros!
We should update the docs.
