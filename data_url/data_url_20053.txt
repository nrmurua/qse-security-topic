Hi all,
When i tried following the instructions from the manual, I got an error:
All the dependencies were already installed!
Could you please help me with this?
Thanks in advance!
To help us better understand things, could you also please share information about the platform you're using as well as how the build process started (build start command and first few lines, not just the last ones)? Edit/Add: If you're not doing it already, please be sure to run ninja with the -v parameter so we can see what commands are actually executed...
Yes. I have attached a full output:
out.txt
I am using "Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS".
Thanks for the quick reply! If you need any other info please let me know :)
Thanks for the update. The library using during linking looks "fishy" to me: /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.a: Did you create (and install) this while building (oqs-)openssl? It seems to contain unlinked OQS symbols:
-> Is it possible that you previously ran make install in (oqs-)openssl without first successfully building and installing liboqs?
In any case, please try building liboqs again without the library /usr/local/lib/libcrypto.a in that system location (remove or rename if you're not sure where it comes from). Please ensure libcrypto is taken from a /usr/lib... location: The link stage failing in your case should look similar to this:
Yes. The libcrypto was the problem (and it was indeed created using the oqs-openssl)!
Thanks a lot for your help, I'll close the issue :)
