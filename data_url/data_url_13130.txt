On step 5 of the Development environment section of the Contributing to Mitiq page, if z shell (zsh) is used, the .[development] needs to have quotes around it.
It is expected that users can simply copy and paste the provided command from the documentation and successfully install the dependencies of Mitiq.
Since this only effects z shell users, it is recommend that a note is added mentioning the potential error and the workaround.
Note: If the command above fails with the error: "zsh: no matches found: .[development]", this is a behavior of z shell and can be corrected by including quotes around .[development] like:
pip install -e ".[development]"
Hello @bdg221, thank you for your interest in Mitiq!
If this is a bug report, please provide screenshots and/or minimum viable code to reproduce your issue, so we can do our best to help get it fixed. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can also ask us on the Unitary Fund Discord.
Any reason not to quote the command for all users? Does quoting it break other shells? If not, lets just quote it for everyone.
BTW thanks for flagging this and opening the issue! Much appreciated.
I tested with bash and it works with the quote. It does make sense to have a single solution without any notes.
What about quotes with a comment saying something like "quoting needed for z-shell users"? Maybe a link to the stackoverflow post if you think it's a good idea.
I think it may be a bit overkill (which isn't necessarily a bad thing.) My guess is that most users aren't hitting the error. It would just be nice if somebody did hit the error to have a quick solution readily available. So, I would say either to go with the quotes there and no note or how it currently is with a note added for z-shell users.
I vote fix the problem for everyone by quoting.
Fixed by PR #1997 .
