Is it possible to add a non-unitary gate by giving it's density matrix in a single qubit 'qasm-simulator'?
Certainly, I can't use circuit.unitary() for that. Is there any other way?
I don't really understand what it is you are asking. A density matrix is a state, not a gate. Circuits can already accept non-unitary instructions in the form of Kraus or QuantumError instructions and be run on the simulator to simulate non-unitary noise or dynamics. Have you gone through the simulator tutorials in particular the building noise models one?
@chriseclectic  The term density matrix might be misleading. I meant is it possible to apply a non-unitary gate by mentioning its matrix. For example, if I want to apply a Projection gate (projection on |0> ), can I provide [[1,0],[0,0]] matrix as the gate in the simulator?
yes. You can. (PauliZ + Identity(2) )/2= [[1,0],[0,0]]. For this, first you need to convert the gates to matrix and then matrix to gate.
