Defgates now appear in the instructions list. Previously, they were accessible only via the defined_gates property. This has the effect that program manipulations that worked in v3 no longer work in v4.
Not clear on the rationale for defgates being in the instructions list. It doesn't appear that DefCal, DefWaveform or DefFrame are.
This reproduction isn't quite right. Hold on
