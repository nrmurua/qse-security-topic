I open this issue in order to keep track of the following @marekgluza comment (we are going to merge #1047 soon).
@Sam-XiaoyueLi we will discuss on Monday that we will be adding the routines as suggested in the issue by @shangtai  into a secondary file additional_double_bracket_functions.py next to double_ bracket.py as in  2075cad
Sam, I'll ask you to migrate from the old repo the
After the meeting on Tuesday, we will discuss with Matteo how to do the gradients similarly to @wrightjandrew

Following the video call discussion:
Currently @Sam-XiaoyueLi is adding strategies into the double_bracket.py class
https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/blob/dbi_Z_search/src/qibo/models/dbi/double_bracket.py
We initially thought there might be a file with additional functions
https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/blob/dbf_migrate/src/qibo/models/dbi/additional_double_bracket_functions.py
Sam, can you comment what kind of things would make sense to be added into that file? (The idea was to keep double_bracket.py as basic as possible)
The reason is that doing the Z_search was difficult in the previous workflow without doing it more low level. Sam maybe you can prepare some overview for the reason for the PR?
For me that's fine (and if it's faster to do it that way I'd advocate to accept the PR and maybe make a low-priority feature request for later to restucture it) but @MatteoRobbiati and @andrea-pasquale, Sam will ask you for review whether you agree that this aligns with the qibo-style
Thanks Sam! üëç :)
