Add support for returning values from the main aq.function
https://openqasm.com/language/directives.html#input-output
For compatibility, OpenQASM 3 does not require an output declaration to be provided: in this case it assumes that all of the declared variables are to be returned as output. If the programmer provides one or more output declarations, then only those variables described as outputs will be returned as an output of the quantum process. A variable may not be marked as both input and output.
Note for simulator results: We'll probably want to formalize the output with a schema class like with our production sim
