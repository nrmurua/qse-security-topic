I try to used with python on Ubuntu 16 LTS
When I try to run it:
I think you have two different python 3.5 version install on your machine.
locate python3 installation path and search for cirq library in its site-packages directory.
you can try to install with below command as well to install in current python pointing version and cross check if you can import afterwards,
python3 -m pip install cirq
Please delete multiple versions of python 3 installed, or to be on the safe side create a virtual environment first and then install Cirq inside it.
@catafest Feel free to reopen this if the stated solutions don't solve your problem.
