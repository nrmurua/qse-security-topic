qiskit_simulator.exe crashes on Windows 7
qiskit_simualtor exits normally.
Just the command qiskit_simulator.exe causes the crash.
The crash window is as follows (sorry for the Japanese message).

no idea.
Hi @t-imamichi ,
I could run the simulator without problems on Windows 7 (64 bits), using Qiskit 0.4.15 and latest 0.5.1.
Are you running on 64 bits?
Yes, I am using Windows 7 SP1 64bit with 8GB memory. The simulator of the latest 0.5.1 does not work. Is there any dependency such as runtime or library?
I confirm that qiskit 0.5.2 solves the issue. Great job!
