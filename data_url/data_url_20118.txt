In support of #892 this is to document build failures by algorithm and build environment.
Using our CI tests, downstream integrations and manual tests supporting the wiki build instructions, all algorithms not listed below should be assumed to build and work OK on
Failures:
BIKE: fails to build completely under MSVC, thousands of errors, e.g.,

BIKE: fails also under cygwin (less dramatic), e.g.
Picnic: Fails under cygwin; probably unintended overload of system defines, e.g.:
Question now: How to proceed?  Widen the matrix/check more environments (gcc 9, 10 on Linux; M1 on OSX; msys2/mingw in Win)? Fix these (e.g., could #887 make BIKE be usable on Windows)? "Just" document in #892? What else?
Feedback solicited @jschanck @dstebila @christianpaquin @xvzcf
The AVX2 implementation of BIKE includes some .S files that are ELF-only. These are incompatible with macOS and Windows. The CMakeLists file already handles macOS, so we just need to do the same for Windows here:

For Picnic in Cygwin we need to add the following to the list of config tests on lines 44-77 of endian_compat.h
Thanks very much @jschanck : Just finished validating your suggestions above on a Windows AWS VM (access credentials via OQS AWS account if you want to use it too). Implemented in PR #1001. With this BIKE is now working on Windows & Picnic with cygwin; waiting for #887 for an MSVC fix for BIKE.
Is this still required? Do our new algorithm datasheets adequately document this?
#887 should already have closed this. The datasheets further document things well.
