I wonder if we can have controlled-u gate optimization similar to the 1-qubit gate optimization with quaternion. If two consecutive controlled-U gates share control-target qubits, they can be combined into a single controlled-U gate with the same logic as the 1-qubit gate optimization with quaternion.
There is already a PR for 1-qubit gate optimization:
#626
Can you give more examples
@rraymondhp ping?
This will be achieved with the KAK decomposition I think?
I agree. I think we can close this and open after kak if it does not meet the needs.
