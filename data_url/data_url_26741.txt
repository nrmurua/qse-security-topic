Here https://github.com/cp2k/cp2k/blob/master/arch/FreeBSD-gfortran.psmp#L1 if FC uses the MPI compiler mpif90, CC should also use the MPI compiler mpicc, not gcc.
Same for all other files in this directory.
All our MPI communication happens in Fortran. While this might change in the future, for now it's correct to use gcc instead of mpicc.
