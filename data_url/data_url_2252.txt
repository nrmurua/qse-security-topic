PauliString.pass_overations_over only accepts SingleQubitCliffordGate. For example:
raises TypeError: Unsupported operation: cirq.X.on(cirq.NamedQubit('q0'))
The expected use-case is AFAICT:
This is pretty awkward given the constructor takes a Pauli.
There is a test explicitly for this behavior: 
This is a usability bug. The code and the test should be fixed to work when given cirq.X, cirq.Y, cirq.Z, cirq.CNOT, etc.
If we're feeling really ambitious, we should make stuff like cirq.SingleQubitMatrix work when it happens to approximately encode a Clifford. That would require writing a matrix-to-clifford method.
I suspect there are several other places where the "Clifford" gates interop poorly with the "normal" gates.
