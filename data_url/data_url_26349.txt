This is a follow up to the recent question from the Google group: "what is the unit for IR intensity using normal mode analysis in cp2k?"
IR intensities are defined as proportional to (dmu/dQ)^2. However, CP2K prints out an intensity value in the vibrational analysis module that is |dmu/dQ| in atomic units. The same value is also printed as "intensity" in the MOLDEN vib file. I think this is at best
misleading and probably leads to errors in the post processing analysis.
I propose to change the "Intensity" output by (dmu/dQ)^2 in some often used units, e.g. km/mole as in G16.
If there are analysis programs that rely on CP2K intensity to be |dmu/dQ| we could find another solution.
