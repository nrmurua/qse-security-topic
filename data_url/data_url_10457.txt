Description
The method that chooses a beta range when none is provided in a sample call will choose a very poor range for some basic problems.
To Reproduce
It's easy to see the bad behavior with h only problems. The beta picking method always chooses 0.1 for the initial beta, so if we choose h with values smaller than this, we get quite bad results.
Less damning but still important to note is the behavior with h = +/-0.5:
Expected behavior
neal should give back reasonably low energy results without providing a beta range, especially on very easy problems.
Unfortunately, I just discovered that by passing in a beta range on a problem I had lowered the mean energy from -974.7 to -1396.0 with default parameters.
Q is a 12x12x12 cubic lattice with Q in {-1, 1}. I think this shows there is more work to do.
