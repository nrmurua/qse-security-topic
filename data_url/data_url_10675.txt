A user would like visibility into "bqm_embedded" when they use an EmbeddingComposite. They would like the option to return "bqm_embedded" the way we "return_embedding"
Hmm, that would be an even bigger abstraction leak than #225, #227. If the user is interested in that level of detail, it might be best for them to just "unpack" the source code for the embedding composite, starting 
Alternatively this is the intended use case for the TrackingComposite in dimod. Something like
should give them what they need.
Thanks!
I think the TrackingComposite only stores "embedding" from the EmbeddingComposite, not "bqm_embedded". Am I just missing it? The user wants to see how their bqm is tiled on the QPU, so they want the embeddings for every copy of their problem.
The bqm in sampler.child.input is the bqm_embedded
Right. Thanks!
