It prints formal args that are "varargs" without the asterix, which is confusing in diagnostics/error messages.
I'd guess that if it gets *args wrong, it gets **kwargs wrong for the same reason, but I haven't checked yet. This piece of code has been the source of problems in the past and I doubt this is the last bug.
