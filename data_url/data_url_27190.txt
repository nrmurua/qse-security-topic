Hello, I was trying to run VQE method 2 with qiskit but it prompts the following exceptions:
The same exception pops up for all the Pauli strings. VQE method 1 works fine.
I believe this is due to the changes made to Qiskit earlier this year, where opflow was deprecated.
This is a known issue and will be investigated at some point.
However, if you have a solution, please feel free to issue a PR with the change.
Otherwise closure of the issue will be announced as a comment here once the issue is fixed.
