In the Grover's Search tutorial the following solution may not work permanently -- there may be other instances of this class of issue replicated elsewhere.
It's worth noting too that syntax has been shuffled around on this twice addressing both :

Indeed the using syntax was deprecated about a year ago, and we went through the code updating it to the latest one. But evidently, we missed the old syntax in a couple of places! Looks like there are three occurrences in ExploringGroversAlgorithmTutorial.ipynb and one in Qubit.ipynb, and they're all in the text of the tutorials rather than in the code cells. That explains how we missed them - we were looking for compiler warnings from running the code in the notebooks!
Thank you for reporting this! Do you want to do the honors and send a pull request to fix those four occurrences of the old syntax? :-) If not, I'll get to it eventually, hopefully some time later this week.
Done! And thank you for building wonderful onboarding into this nascent science!
