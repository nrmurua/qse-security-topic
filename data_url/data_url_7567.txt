My Julia version is Julia0.6.4. I tried to run the QCBM.ipynb example directly. And the following codes invokes an method error.
The error message is
MethodError: Cannot convert an object of type IterTools.Chain{NTuple{186,Float64}} to an object of type Int64
This may have arisen from a call to the constructor Int64(...),
since type constructors fall back to convert methods.
Stacktrace:
[1] update!(::IterTools.Chain{NTuple{186,Float64}}, ::Array{Float64,1}, ::Adam) at ./In[28]:16
[2] #train!#16(::Float64, ::Int64, ::Function, ::Yao.Blocks.ChainBlock{6,Complex{Float64}}, ::Array{Float64,1}, ::Adam) at ./In[29]:15

It would be great help if this is fixed. Great works!
Oops I forgot to update the example with new versions of Yao. We added an iterator for the block tree in v0.1.4. I'll fix this.
This works on v0.1.1 for Julia v0.6, if you need it at the moment.
I just tag a deprecation fix for Julia 1.0 (v0.6 support is drop) as v0.2.0, try it with
or wait for JuliaLang/METADATA.jl#16898 and simply update your old package
Or just use the master branch (which may not be stable)
