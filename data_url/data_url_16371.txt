It seems to me that the wire ordering of QFT is inconsistent with the Qiskit convention that the first wire corresponds to the least significant bit and the last wire to the most significant bit. According to its definition, QFT should perform the mapping

which should, for example, map |1>:=|01> to (|00>+i |01>-|10>-i |11>)/2. This doesn't happen:
The output is
which is not what a new user would expect.
QFT implements the canonical circuit which can be found in e.g. Nielsen-Chuang chapter 5. This causes confusion because Nielsen-Chuang uses a convention where the bottom-most wire is carries the least significant bit, opposite what Qiskit does.
Easy correction is to simply replace circ.append(QFT(2), reg) by circ.append(QFT(2), reversed(reg)) in the above example. However, it seems to me that the wire order should be reversed in the circuit library or at the very least add a clear mention in QFT documentation to prevent confusion.
Possibly related to #4440 .
Edit: Version info

I think #4849 will fix this.
@frankharkins I think you are right, thanks for pointing this out.
