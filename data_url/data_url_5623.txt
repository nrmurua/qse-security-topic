Add 2-qubit ECR gate, which is a Clifford gate, to the stabilizer simulator (Clifford simulator). Newer IBM devices have ECR as the 2-qubit basis gate. Thus, it is better to have the gate in the stabilizer simulator as well.
Hello, could I bei assigned to the topic?
I'm now fixing issue #1888 and I would like to implement this one after that
So I could take my chance to see if I can do the implementation before you start? Would be my first issue to implement ;-)
PR prepared. Review and Check needed.
Thank you, we need test case for new feature, so could you please add test case for ECR gate?
Thanks for the info! Will do. Should be done by end of this week.
@doichanj: Coding style adapted and testcase written. Unfortunately I cannot execute "stestr run" also unit test executable cannot be found. Any hints for me?
Try testing with python -m unittest
Getting ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qiskit_aer.backends.controller_wrappers'
:-(
please try mv qiskit_aer qiskit_aer_ before running tests. (do not forget to recover before building Qiskit Aer)
Thanks that helped.
