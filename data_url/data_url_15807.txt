Any import of qiskit results in this particular error (shown below)
I reproduced this error in a python3.8 conda environment after installing the latest version of qiskit (pip install qiskit). as of writing this the latest version of qiskit is 0.29
If I run any python script which imports qiskit, the resulting error occurs:
This error does not occur for qiskit version 0.25. But it does occur at 0.29 and 0.28.
Unknown. It seems to be anaconda specific, but I have  not tested it across different systems
This is a tweedledum bug unfortunately, not a Qiskit one: see boschmitt/tweedledum#159, so you may have more luck getting this sorted over there.

Thanks pointing me to that.
pip install tweedledum==1.0.0 (instead of version 1.1.0) fixed the problem for me.
