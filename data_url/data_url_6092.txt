cvxpy is needed for noise transformations but is not installed when installing Aer with the Qiskit meta-package.  It is in the requirements-dev, but not in the setup.
Is it not installed by qiskit-ignis either?
Nope.  See qiskit-community/qiskit-ignis#312, qiskit-community/qiskit-ignis#313
Is it probably a transitive dependency? I've never needed to install it.
Anyway, yes, we have to add it to the setup.py.
It was always intended as an optional dependenc since it is only used by one not frequently used function. That is is why the import is handled only when that function is called. I'm not sure what the best way to handle these are. Should we add a warning for that function, something like:
Fixed in #520
