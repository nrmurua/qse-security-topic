When specifying the qubit number in the measure instruction
k.measure(0) this passes or fails depending on wether it is an int32 or int64.
The fix should not include any changes on the C++ part of the assembler but it should accept all python Int types (and convert it to the proper int). It should explicitly not do things like rounding or other type conversions.
Hi @AdriaanRol I could not reproduce this bug. I have tested it on the following lines to keep it similar to how you are using it:
In the above example, the following is not possible as Python 3 does not have a long type:
I wonder how are you reading it as int32 and int64 in python which is causing this bug?
fixed in 64db4c1. tests/test_bugs.py contains test cases.
