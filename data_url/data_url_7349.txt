This bit of code
results in
which clearly overwrites the FockBasis. This should throw an error.
trying to 'fix' this i think there is a deeper bug: in testing_operators.jl embed(b, 1, op) returns a 45x45 array, where it should not. the reason is that it tries to embed the 15x15 op in the 5x5 space, leaving a 3x3 identity. this functionality is missing: operators cannot be properly embedded in a joint hilbert space of a CompositeBasis. i think the call should be embed(b, [1, 2], op).
Thanks for the PR and I agree with the syntax change. This also leads to the question of combining operators on composite bases with ones on single ones, which unfortunately isn't that straightforward. I'm looking into it.
i have taken the opportunity to do the index wrangling in this pr. please tell me if you want me to make separate prs, or if i'm totally off base.
i've provided what i think is a feature complete solution for embedding, though the syntax leaves something to be desired. x86 tests are failing, i don't know why. please tell me if this is an acceptable solution.
