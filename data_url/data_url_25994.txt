Write function that converts an QASM 3 string circuit to use only contiguous qubit indexing i.e removes empty registers of unused qubits. Similar to _convert_to_contiguous_qasm() but for qasm3 instead of qasm2, and implemented without any external dependencies, i.e. should not rely on cirq conversion as existing qasm2 implementation does.
Can I take a look at this too @ryanhill1 ?
@TheGupta2012 absolutely!
