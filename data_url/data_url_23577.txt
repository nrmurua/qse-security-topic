i encountered the following just now when trying to load only part of a dataset using get_data: the start index that's actually returned depends on whether the end index has been supplied or left as None.

my expected behavior would be that the first element returned should not depend on the value of end.
@WilliamHPNielsen i was tinkering with monitoring a dataset as a variant for live-plotting, and using that seemed like a natural thing. but i could of course always just extract the whole thing every time.
