pip install qiskit fails on Python 3.11 release candidate 2 because of symengine/symengine.py#422

The Faster CPython Project is already yielding some exciting results. Python 3.11 is up to 10-60% faster than Python 3.10. On average, we measured a 1.22x speedup on the standard benchmark suite. See Faster CPython for details.
Thanks for your interest.  We will add Python 3.11 support, but it is not likely to happen until some time after the final release of 3.11 - it's currently still in the release-candidate stage.
We're unlikely to start committing our own limited CI time to preparing 3.11 wheels until the majority of our dependencies have them (or at least the ones that don't reliably build from the sdist), since there would be little point for end users.  You should be able to manually compile a version of qiskit-terra from source for Python 3.11 immediately if you follow the instructions in our contributing guide.

Please be patient. I explained in the previous comment why there might be a delay in us releasing Python 3.11 support.
symengine/symengine.py#422 Is now fixed.
Closing in favor of #9028
