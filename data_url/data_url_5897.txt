When transpiling and using the schedule from the default CNOT gate of the fake Valencia device the result does not agree with the result of the CNOT gate.
I should get a state closed to {'00000':512} but I'm getting the state {'00000':51, '00010':461}
Hi @alejomonbar! Thanks for reporting this. I've been able to reproduce with the version reported. However, using the latest master I get the expected result {'00000':512}. It seems it has been fixed in the PR that starts using the terra operators (#1014). This will be included in 0.8 release.
I'm closing this. Feel free to reopen if next release doesn't solve the problem.
The problem seems to remain with the new release. This is the result I get using the exact same steps.
{'00': 60, '01': 16, '10': 353, '11': 83}
