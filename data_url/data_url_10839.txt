Current Problem
Currently in the MaxGap unit tests, "[t]he gap is checked for whether it obeys the min classical gap constraint, and whether it is the largest gap for a given BQM. However, this gap may not necessarily be the largest gap for the given set of constraints (i.e. configurations, energy ranges), and this is not checked for in this function." (taken from the docstring that I wrote for
test_generation.generate_and_check(..)`)
Proposed Solution
While it can be difficult to determine the best gap for a particular problem, at least add checks to make sure that the gap is greater than or equal to an expected gap (i.e. a known answer). Note that this check should be independent of the BQM produced by MaxGap.
