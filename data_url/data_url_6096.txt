Some of the pulse simulator tests fail randomly. The tests will typically pass when rerun, but they should be solved for overall stability, as well as to eliminate the nuisance of failed checks for PRs.
The issues that i'm aware of are:
Though we need to still solve this zvode issue, I would say this issue can be closed, as it was primarily about stabilizing the issue with randomness in the tests. I'm going to close this, but create another one about the zvode issue, along with the likely solution of adding soft-reseting the solver at all points that the RHS of the DE is discontinuous.
