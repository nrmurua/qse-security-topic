Handle creating new design if design already exists - just return existing design / raise flag
Want to clarify the desired behavior.  @ThomasGM4  and @dwang429
Presently: When any of the methods for Anysys are used, the current behavior is similar for project and design.   If the name already exists in the GUI, the GUI in Ansys appends a number to a project or design,
Metal Renderer methods:
add_q3d_design("Q3dMetalDesign")
If a design named Q3dMetalDesign already exists in the project, a new design will be created, with the name suffixed with an incremental integer: Q3dMetalDesign1, Q3dMetalDesign2, etc.
Similar for these two listed above.
new_ansys_project()
If the default of Project is already in Ansys, when a new project is added, a number is added to the suffix.
The Metal methods listed above, call pyEPR corresponding methods.
new_em_design(), new_dm_design(),  new_q3d_design(), and  new_project().  The pyEPR methods call InsertDesign() and NewProject
Going Forward.
Do we want to change the Ansys GUI "look-and-feel" to be different for Metal?  So, if user wants to add a new project or design name which already exists. Presently, a number is added to suffix in Ansys GUI and Metal.  Do we want to change that?
If so, I would change the behavior to be consistent for project, q3d design, eigenmode design, and modal design.   Based  on the request for this issue:
Metal would give the existing project/design in the GUI.  However, if you use the GUI, it will append a number.
There has been some conversations about this. Gist:
I believe connect_ansys() also allows to select which design to connect to. I believe that is the feature we need to make sure it works reliably. Once we verify that (and change code if necessary) we can then close this case.
Any concern?
