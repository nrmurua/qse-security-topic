In the Dependencies section of README (https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/src/qasm-simulator-cpp/README.md#dependencies), the command to install the dependency should be
make depend
not s at the end.
thanks this is a bug.
I will push a quick patch to fix the typo.
But we might end up having to update the doc after we change the build process (see #1056) I'm not sure that it will change that depend make target (well really the underlying build_dependencies.sh script), but the script also isn't super complicated just calling a package manager to install blas, etc.
