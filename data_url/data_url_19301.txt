I would like to propose adding a function that would convert a GKSL equation to Kraus operators.
For example, if one has a function master_equation(rho) calculating $\dot\rho = -i[H,\rho] + \sum_k\gamma_k\left[A_k\rho A_k^\dagger - \frac12\{A_k^\dagger A_k, \rho\} \right]$, the following steps would be needed to convert it to a KrausChannel that could then be added to a circuit:
