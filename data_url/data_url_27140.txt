In #201 we have decided to stick to the pregenerated libint code from Psi4's modified libint version, basically the 5-4-3-6-5-4_mm4f12ob2 from here.
Now after some time I've dealt with a 3d Nickel complex in Psi4 and the JK basis unfortunately already requires I functions. Being able to do at least 3d and 4d metals is important, I would argue. Thus we need some solution to get the libint with AM=7 working again. @markuskowa any idea? Our last attempt hasn't even finished the code generation phase after two days with AM=7.
Closed by #233
