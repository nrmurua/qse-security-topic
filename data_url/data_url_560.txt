Putting this here so we keep track of them. @tnguyen-ornl
I think the second placement strategy (https://github.com/iic-jku/minimal_ibm_qx_mapping) was implemented in enfield (https://github.com/ysiraichi/enfield/blob/master/include/enfield/Transform/Allocators/ChallengeWinnerQAllocator.h)
We probably will only need to integrate enfield then.
Enfield-based placement has been implemented in our forked branch
There are a few placement strategies that we can use. The full list is here
The minimal qx mapping is called 'ChallengeWinnerQAllocator' (Q_chw).
