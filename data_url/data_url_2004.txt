The Mølmer–Sørensen gate is nothing more than
ops.XXPowGate(exponent=rads*2/np.pi, global_shift=-0.5)
But in general that gate is usually only called that by the ion trap community (since it referes to a specific very cool trick to couple via an oscillator mode).  Right now we special case XXPowGate names when it is this gate.
This also leads to a strange coupling between ops and ion, not in code but in naming.
I think we could make the MS gate just the XXPowGate with the name change in ion.  If that were done then consumers who don't know about ions could consume it as a XXPowGate while it would show up ion trap code as desired.

I'll create a new MSGate in ion_gates.py which derives from XXPowGate and would show the correct name in repr, str etc. Does this sound good?
You should also remove the MS naming from XXPowGate as part of adding it into MSGate.
