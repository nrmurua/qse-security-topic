Hello,
first of all, very cool project :) I tried to run the Binder notebook but I got this error, which happens after the test stage:
Kind regards,
Roberto
Hi Roberto, thanks for your interest in our project!
It looks like most of the output you got was not critical, just deprecation warnings (that I think aren't our fault, but we should figure out a way to clean them up at some point), with the fatal bit being that we're trying to link the wrong python library.
Over the last couple of months we've made some major changes to our python build system on a branch which we are almost, but not quite ready to merge. It's stable enough, though, that if you want to try things out, I would suggest taking a  look at the v1.11-dev branch, which should now work for this use since I just applied some fixes in 5473a78.
