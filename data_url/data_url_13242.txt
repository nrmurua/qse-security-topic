I remember that an issue previously in the documentation were titles going out of bounds in the thumbnails.  I didn't notice the change that now makes the thumbnails in the documentation take a full row of space on https://mitiq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/examples.html
Having large thumbnails looks ok to me, but we need to have titles (even shortened ones are fine) next to the thumbnails, otherwise it's too cryptic for some examples, i.e. those that just show plots.  Also because hovering with the mouse on the titles in the index on the left does not highlight the corresponding thumbnail, so there is no easy way to know the title of an example shown in a thumbnail.
