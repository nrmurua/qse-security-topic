Why? Ideally we should implement reverse BK transformation. It is bijective, just like Jordan-Wigner. The BKSF algorithm, however, is not bijective.
Well the reverse BK should be a separate function, reverse_bravyi_kitaev. Applying bravyi_kitaev to a QubitOperator currently works but gives a nonsense output.
yeah that's no good
