Implement n*(3,1,0.79) Quantum Random Access Code(QRAC) introduced by Chuang, as a new kind of feature map, which can encode 3n bit feature string within n qubits, with the possibility 0.79.
Reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604061
The FeatureMap class in qiskit.aqua will be deprecated, but there is no FeatureMap Class in qiskit.ml now, should us first implement it?
The feature map circuits that presently exist are here https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/tree/main/qiskit/circuit/library/data_preparation
This has been open for sometime and not addressed, as such I am going to close it. I will note that QRA Optimzation PR that is pretty much complete, at the time I am writing this, in Qiskit Optimization see qiskit-community/qiskit-optimization#487
