At the moment, only the Python modules and functions are properly documented on the ReadTheDocs page. The idea would be to update and integrate the documentation of the C++ components as well.
My idea would be to do something similar to what the XSIMD library is doing: using doxygen to generate XML and then parse that using the sphinx & breathe Python packages.
