I just set up a new VM. with Ubuntu 20.4.  When building I get a message related to inlining.  I'm going to switch to Ubuntu 18, like I was using before which worked fine, but I thought you might want to know about it.
@joehellmers Do you have more information about the system configurations, e.g. full Dockerfile?
I'm using Ubuntu 20.04.1 with gcc version 9.3.0 (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) and cannot reproduce that error.
@tnguyen-ornl , this is a VirtualBox VM with the latest version of 20.04.1 including doing an "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade".  There isn't anything special about the system.  I created it from scratch and was installing XACC based on the installation instructions in the ReadTheDocs website.
Now I'm getting the same issue on 18.04.1 as well.
@joehellmers Looks like you hit this VirtualBox bug, same compile error reported elsewhere.
Could you please run gcc -march=native -Q --help=target on your VirtualBox instance and let us know the result?
Some of the options are disabled leads me to believe this might be the issue.
I upgraded VirtualBox, so maybe that's what induced the error in Ubuntu 18 and 20.
Complete output follows.
I built and test the tnguyen/fix-virtual-box-qsim-build branch and it seems to have worked fine, including all tests passing.
Will you be merging this with master at eclipse/xacc, or is it something I would just need to do whenever I'm doing work on VirtualBox?
Thanks @joehellmers for checking the fix. Yea, I've submitted a PR to get it merged.
