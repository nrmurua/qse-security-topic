The present addresser loop is designed to function for an arbitrary QPU layout. On the other hand, there exist custom SWAP schemes for rectangular lattices that outperform our generic algorithm by a wide margin. Now that Rigetti has settled on a particular lattice (trivalent and octangular), we should look into bespoke SWAP schemes for graphs of this form.
Such schemes should function in the presence of some small fraction of dead qubits. Such schemes should also take into account the "low qubit case", where the ratio of qubits at the boundary of the chip to all qubits is relatively high.
Of course, it would be of interest to have bespoke schemes for other lattices!
