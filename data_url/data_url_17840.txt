The circuit_drawer falls back to _matplotlib_circuit_drawer when _latex_circuit_drawer fails with OSError. We should remove that fallback at some point.
Yep, I agree and that's the plan. Which is why we emit a deprecation warning right now if you run circuit_drawer without the output kwarg set. This was the deprecated previous default for circuit_drawer in 0.6.0. We will have to wait until we at least have this emit the deprecation warning in at least 1 release.
It does raise a larger question for me though which is what our deprecation policy should be on this kind of thing? I haven't seen it defined anywhere where we say that we wait X amount of time (whether in an actual unit of time, or a release count) from deprecation to removal. I think that's a separate larger discussion though, but something I think that will be good to define as a policy for the project.
I would like the output of the cirucit_drawer to be text (no dependencies by default).
We can have a visitation.set_defaults for interactive when we have it etc
Maybe visitation.set_defaults can also be used for handle the drawer options (see #1075). Opinions?
Did we decide on this @1ucian0 and @mtreinish I would like to make sure that we are moving away from fallbacks? If this is done let's close if it is getting worked on who is it assigned to.
This is basically done, we've deprecated the fallback as the default and as soon as 0.7 is out I'm going to push a patch up removing the fallback and switching to 'text' output by default for 0.8.
We can say that it's decided :)
@1ucian0 and @mtreinish this is done. I am closing. If you see a reason to reopen please do and lets add a comment of what is left.
