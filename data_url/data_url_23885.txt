After compiling a sequence using the PulsePrimitive.CNOT, triggers and gate markers added at the compiling step modify the CNOT function on the same qubits permanently
Example, before compiling:
CNOT(q1,q4):
After compiling,
CNOT(q1,q4):
This can be prevented by removing the @_memoize decorator from both CNOT and the specific implementation CNOT_CR.
This happens in both master and https://github.com/BBN-Q/QGL/tree/feature/CNOT-imp.
