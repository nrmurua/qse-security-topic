Right now the benchmarks module only contains MaxCut-QAOA and 1-2 qubit randomized benchmarking. This issue is to expand the suite of benchmarking circuits, in particular by adding mirror circuits from https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11294.
This issue had no activity for 2 months, and will be closed in one week unless there is new activity. Cheers!
