Currently it's not easy to interrupt the mcsolve solver. Ctrl-C does not work well either because child processes are not killed when the controlling process receive the STOP or KILLL signals. This is especially problematic when using mcsolve from within the IPython notebook, but this problem also occurs when running a program directly from the prompt using the python interpreter. For next release we should try to make interrupting mcsolve a bit smoother.
Now that the Qt stuff is gone, mcsolve seems to interrupt cleanly on KeyboardInterrupt.
