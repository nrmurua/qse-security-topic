I think it will be pretty common to have symbol names like a0, a1, a2, ...  Having them show up as Symbol('a0') in a circuit seems pretty inconvenient.
This is with respect to Symbol's __str__ being cautious about ambiguity when there are strange characters? Rewriting it to allow digits, as long as it's not just digits, seems reasonable. Should we allow leading digits?
Is it possible to have similar rules as for naming variables?
@Ashalynd Yes, that is reasonable. If we can just duplicate python's rules, that would be easy to explain to people.
