Description
The method to_numpy_matrix raises a deprecation warning with the message bqm.to_numpy_matrix() is deprecated since dimod 0.10.0. This note in the bqm.py file suggests to use the to_dense method instead but that method doesn't seem to exist in the code base. It is not clear whether an alternative is available for to_numpy_matrix.
Proposed Solution
Suggest an alternative(if any) to the to_numpy_matrix method with a short code snippet along with the current message.
Hi @AkashNarayanan , I agree. I think there are a few things that should be done
Is this something that you'd be interested in taking on?
