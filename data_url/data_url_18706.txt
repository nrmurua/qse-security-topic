The compiler has very limited support for manipulating MEASURE instructions, but this is essentially untested because all the tests of quantum semantics are built around pure state simulation. (Look into density matrix simulation methods in the QVM and) introduce some tests that check correctness for programs involving mid-program MEASURE instructions.
