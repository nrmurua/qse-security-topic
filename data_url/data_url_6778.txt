When gate is controlled by classical register, measurement gives correct results, but probabilities and state vector are not correct.
Example circuit:
Result of measurement is correct: [0, 0] or [1, 1]
Probabilities are wrong:
[0.5, 0] or [0.5, 1]
Expected is:
[0, 0] or [1, 1]
State is wrong. It returns:
OR
But expected is:
OR
