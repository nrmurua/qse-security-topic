The OpenQASM spec provides for gate and measurement calibrations. In the case of measurements, these have defcals with return values. We don't require that these use the name measure. Among the examples in this section we have
At present this is unusable, because measure "expressions" are hardcoded to use the measure token, and an assignment statement only takes an expression or measure expression.
Given the various kinds of measurements that could occur on a given qubit, it's important that we support defcals with return values. This would require some changes to the grammar and AST.
