Why is heterodyne considered as a special case? To me the heterodyne detection scheme looks like a case of the homodyne detection. What do I miss?
Photo-current, homodyne and heterodyne are all special cases of the general stochastic ME, and all three are considered special and given "short-cuts" in the API only because are frequently occurring and probably often what a user want to do... Sure, heterodyne can be formulated in terms of two homodyne measurements, but because of their different physical origins I have kept both. Also I think it is conceptually appealing to bunch all stochastic processes for a measurement together, which in the case of homodyne is implemented with two stochastic increments. However, this is mostly an internal issue for the smesolve, and if you wish to to implement  heterodyne with two homodyne processes in the milstein solver that's totaly fine with me.
