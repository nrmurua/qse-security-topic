Hi :)
when we are executing pegamoid with LD_LILRBARY_PATH= nixGL nix run github:Nix-QChem/NixOS-QChem#pegamoid we get the following message across our computers.
Is this only something, the pegamoid developers can fix (because it seems that they did not change their np.float to float), or do you see a way to fix it with a patch within NixOS-QChem?
All the best
Philipp
This is probably resolved by Pegamoid 2.8. Will take care of it when coming back from vacation next week. For the moment you could use an older version without the breaking numpy changes, e.g.
