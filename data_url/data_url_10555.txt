Description
Including from dwave import inspector causes qpu call to fail, even though inspector is not used.
Returns KeyError: 542
Gives messages along the way:
warninghandler.chain_break(response, embedding)
broken = broken_chains(ground, chains)
To Reproduce
An example bqm and embedding are included in zip file. The keys in the embedding may need to be changed from string to tuple first.
`
from dwave.system import DWaveSampler
from dwave.preprocessing.composites import FixVariablesComposite
from dwave import inspector
qpu = DWaveSampler()
sampler = FixedEmbeddingComposite(qpu, embedding=embedding)
sample_set = sampler.sample(bqm, num_reads=num_reads)
`
Expected behavior
Returns dimod sample set
Environment:
Austin-Roberts-bqm-embedding.zip
