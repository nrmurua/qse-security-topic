From a thread on public Slack.
It's possible for CheckMap to raise a spurious exception during a run on a valid circuit, with it failing in a call DAGCircuit.compose.  This can happen when a conditional block contains another conditional, and the clbits of the inner block are not in the same order in the QuantumCircuit object in the inner block as they are in the outer, even if the qargs binding between the two maps them normally.
CheckMap shouldn't raise exceptions.
