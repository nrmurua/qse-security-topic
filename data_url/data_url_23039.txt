I set up a direct wired connection between the redpitaya board and the computer,  I can visit redpitaya homepage with the IP address assigned, and can build a ssh connection in a terminal or using PuTTY etc. However, if I use the same IP for pyrpl GUI setting, the connection fails and paramiko raises an error suggesting ssh connection can not be established. (Windows 10 operating system, precompiled executable PyRPL GUI)
(more detailed exception log will be updated later)
Hi,
my redpitaya board and my win7 pc are connected in the local network but i get an simillar error so i will post it in here, too. If it doesn't correlate please move my post!
I can connect to the redpitaya via Browser http://rp-xxxxx.local/ and via Ip Address, in terminal and PuTTY.
But the windows executable and the enviroment, via anaconda trough JetBrains, cant get the gui to work.
I get the EOF error, shown below. I tryed to get more Infos via logging paramiko "pyrpl.sshshell.paramiko.util.log_to_file("paramikologsit.log") ", but i still have no clue how to solve this...
Help is Welcome !
Here are the loggs:
i found an simmilar issue on git hub:ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues#10592
and could solve my issue by installing OpenSSL(https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) with the Option Copy openSSL DLLs to: Windows system directory.
@treeTUkl Thank you for your comments. However, I think our issues are different. Today I set up LAN and tested again. The error log I get this time is much clearer and goes as:
I've got many hits on this error and trying to figure it out now.
I cloned the source code and set up the environment, then no errors occur, both in LAN and in direct connection case. I guess the original issue is due to some package mismatches in the precompiled version.
