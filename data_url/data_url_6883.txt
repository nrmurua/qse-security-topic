There's no apparent local breakage or change in configuration that would have caused this, but tests have started timing out on travis. Example: https://travis-ci.org/Strilanc/Quirk/builds/276102565
Looks like travis-ci added webgl support (yay!), but it's not good enough to pass the tests (aw...). Added a check that detects the poor support.
Fixed by #382
