The generated errors should clearly state file name + line number.
Examples:
Fixed in the latest commit (9552605) on develop branch. test_configuration.py contains the tests.
@imranashraf I looked at the test (OpenQL/tests/test_configuration.py) in the develop branch but could not see anything checking for correct error messages. Maybe it is still on your local machine or I'm looking in the wrong place?
@AdriaanRol you are probably looking at the right place as at moment I am not catching the context of the exception to do that. Will look at it later as for now there are some other high priority tasks which i have to work on.
