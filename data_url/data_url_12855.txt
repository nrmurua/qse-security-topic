Hello,
Pertaining to task 1.6* Phase change of the "Basic.Gates" kata:
The reference solution Rz(alpha, q); doesn't seem to be correct, since:
Rz(alpha) |0> = exp(-i * alpha/2) |0>
Rz(alpha) |1> = exp(i * alpha/2) |1>
Please check.
If we apply Rz(alpha) to qubit in state β|0⟩ + γ|1⟩, we'll get
exp(-i * alpha/2) β|0⟩ + exp(i * alpha/2) γ|1⟩ = exp(-i * alpha/2) (β|0⟩ + exp(i * alpha) γ|1⟩), which is the required state up to a global phase exp(-i * alpha/2). Since the global phase can always be ignored, Rz(alpha) performs the required transformation.
Hope that helps!
Yes, it helps!
I suggest updating the goal of task 1.6* Phase change of the "Basic.Gates" kata as follows:
Thanks!
