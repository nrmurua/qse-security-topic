@alexcjohnson and others,

this fails.
At first qc complains that the parameter has no attribute name this is because I have supplied n names for n axes. If I add self.name in parameter.py that error goes away.
Then qc complains that the parameter has no attribute _vals which is also missing due to the names.
If I add that too, I can do what I planned.
in parameter.py I see:
That comment seems to contradict what is actually happening, should this just be if and if instead?
Btw, what is the correct validator for a list of numbers?
if the structure should be like

@MerlinSmiles I think this can close now? The current issue with Array/Multiparameters is that they are not settable #207 and the confusing setpoints #498
@jenshnielsen I guess yes, there have been a lot of changes that resolve this, I think
