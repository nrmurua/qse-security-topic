I am trying to make convert and use QuantumCircuit from OpenQASM3 file. After obtaining the circuit (an instance of QuantumCircuit class), I added save_statevector() instruction and CircuitError: 'duplicate qubit arguments' error is thrown.
There shouldn't be any error thrown.
No response
Thanks for the report - this is actually a bug in Aer (which is what defines the save_statevector method) that's calculating the qubits in a circuit slightly incorrectly if there's overlapping registers.  I'll transfer this issue over there so we can fix it.
