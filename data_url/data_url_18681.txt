I spend a lot of time staring at print-outs of trays of complex numbers, trying to decide if some collection of them is the same as some other collection up to phase.
We already have a complex number pretty-printer and it already has a global option to enable pretty-printing of certain fractions of pi. I'd like an option to extend it to have a global option to print polar forms of complex numbers instead of Cartesian forms.
I recommend syntax like:
where the phase is printed with nice pi fractions when enabled.
