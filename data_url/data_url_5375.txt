The cmake interface to Lightning without the use of Pybind11 is beneficial for packages that depend on Lightning's structure. To ensure this can be supported, we should keep the add_library(pennylane_lightning INTERFACE) and subsequent lines in the CMakeLists.txt file for current development. This will be a temporary measure until a future refactor and integration.
