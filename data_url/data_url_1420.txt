When you pass a cirq.PauliSum into cirq.PauliString's initializer, it iterates over the terms of the sum... multiplying them together instead of adding them together. This makes sense to do for raw lists, but for cirq.PauliSum there is context indicating this is almost certainly a mistake.

Add a check to cirq.PauliString so that it rejects cirq.PauliSum arguments.
