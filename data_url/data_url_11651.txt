Currently the newly added operator opflow does not include Z2 Symmetry support, including the commonly used 2 qubit reduction when using parity mapping. Currently, due to the lack of this capability, legacy operators are still built out by the application modules and they remain as legacy operators for such processing until explicitly converted at the last moment for algorithm use.
We should be able to create operators from the outset using opflow and be able to apply Z2 symmetry, and two qubit reductions etc. to these. With such function in place the legacy operator use can be discontinued and allow them to be deprecated and removed.
As opflow has been moved over to Terra repository (deprecated here) and Z2_symmetry has been implemented there I am closing this issue.
