I am using CP2K for AIMD simulations. When PRINT_LEVEL is set to MEDIUM in the input file, Mulliken and Hirshfeld charge are calculated after each SCF convergence. Is there a keyword that can be used to suppress these two calculations and their output when PRINT_LEVEL set to MEDIUM?
You can disable both properties explicitly via their &PRINT sections
Note, that such questions should be asked in the CP2K forum.
