Highlighted in #90 - currently the CI config explicitly specifies --config=avx, meaning it will only test the AVX build process. We need to include SSE and basic builds as well.
Discussed offline - there are already simulator-specific tests (simulator_(avx|sse|basic)_test), so this isn't necessary. To avoid confusion, I'll remove the --config=avx flag from the CI config.
The following line from this x86 options doc suggests that explicit SSE tests may still be necessary:
In other words, running the SSE tests with -mavx will still pass, but it doesn't prove that the tests will pass with -msse4 since there may be stray AVX instructions lurking).
The solution I've found is to explicitly specify the flags for tests in the BUILD file - see #93.
