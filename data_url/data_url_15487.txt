Implement __mul__ method for class qiskit.quantum_info.operators.MultiplyMixin.
Operator class can't execute left scalar multiplication.
For example,  operators class should be able to execute both -1j * Op and Op * -1j, but it cannot the latter now.
So in order to calculate Op * -1j, __mul__ method need to be used.
For context: this was originally a design choice when the operations were first added in #5617, because at the time * was overloaded twice, once with dot (see #5617 (comment)).  Since #7291, that's no longer an issue, and similar to #7502, we're now in a position to allow this re-definition.
Closed by #8007.
