Change PulseControlInterface.create_pulse_group:
Requires an additional MATLAB script that walks the array, registers the pulses and updates the entries in the pulse group.
The workflow would be:
Using this approach, the qctoolkit needs no connection to a MATLAB engine. Hence, all qctoolkit functionality can safely be called from MATLAB (since we do not run into the problem stated in #86). It requires an additional MATLAB script in the pulse_control directory however. Can we do this @pbethke @hbluhm ?
Part of #64
The current workflow would be:
Implementation along with an example can be found in the branch issue-89-matlab-alternative.
