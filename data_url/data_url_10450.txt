SampleSet for initial states (#53) will be the ultimate resolution of the #54 bug / ill-defined behaviour.
However, for backwards-compatibility reasons, a reasonable first step is to support the existing format of initial_state (tuple(ndarray, dict)), but to interpret values in the matching BQM vartype.
When we implement #54, we can deprecate the old format (but still support it for a while).
