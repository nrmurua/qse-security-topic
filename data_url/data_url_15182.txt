When the approximate quantum compiler (AQC) is used to synthesis a unitary which has a determinant âˆ’1 (e.g., an "odd parity" permutation matrix), a warning message is displayed:
then it continues its work and generates a circuit. The unitary of the generated circuit, however, is not an approximation to the original one.
The code must take this case into account
The root cause of this wrong behavior is this line of code:
As per numpy.power documentation:
Negative values raised to a non-integral value will return nan. To get complex results, cast the input to complex.
The issue can be simply fixed by replacing this line with:
Thanks @EgrettaThula for finding this bug, would you like to make a PR to implement your suggestion? You would just have to make the change you suggest, and add a test case.
I'll work on it.
