The current Sequencer class has turned out to have several limitations, the most important of which is it's inability to update a subset of frequently changing parameters for a PulseTemplate without sequencing the entire PT anew. Since also result of the Sequencer, the intermediate instruction language, and the ability to interrupt the sequencing process using the requires_stop() methods provides little to no benefit for intended use, Sequencer is deemed obsolete.
Instead of using sequencer, we will add interfaces to directly convert PulseTemplate into Programs. The intended changes are:
The two above new methods are to entirely replace Sequencer, InstructionBlock and all other instruction 'language' related objects.
