Compilation of the sdbg and pdbg versions of CP2K based on toolchain generated arch files fails because of undefined reference to BLAS routines. I am using the default OpenBLAS and noticed that the -lopenblas flag is missing from LIBS, both in local.sdbg and local.pdbg. Adding it back fixes the problem.
I ran the following command for the toolchain installation:
./install_cp2k_toolchain -j 32 --install-all --with-valgrind=no --with-reflapack=no --with-ptscotch=no --with-parmetis=no --with-metis=no --with-superlu=no --with-pexsi=no --with-quip=no --with-plumed=no --with-sirius=no --with-gsl=no --with-libvdwxc=no --with-spglib=no --with-hdf5=no --with-spfft=no --mpi-mode=openmpi --with-cmake=install --enable-omp
Did you test with a recent version and regenerated the complete toolchain with it? Because d3bb141 should have fixed that and worked in my tests.
My working branch was, indeed, not up to date. Updating it fixed the issue. Apologies!
