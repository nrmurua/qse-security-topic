Right now the TwoQubitBasisDecomposer at https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/master/qiskit/quantum_info/synthesis/two_qubit_decompose.py supports a parameter called basis_fidelity, which I understand is intended to enable implementation of approximate compiling (as in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12926.pdf). As far as I can tell though, there is no way to access this parameter from the higher-level code. I would like there to be a way to do this from the high-level interface.
@levbishop and I think that the flow for the passes should be something like this (this would be optimization_level=3):
Lev is going to implement the Decompose2qUnitary pass which has device calibration context.
@levbishop is there any update on this?
To summarize what we discussed:
Another pass can clean up any "error" operators (something like RemoveErrors).
A third pass will be written in the future to combine/merge different "errors".
I'm going to close this now that we've added an approximation_degree flag to transpile() which gets used by the unitary synthesis pass (see #5609 ). @ajavadia if there is still more to do here, please feel free to reopen it.
