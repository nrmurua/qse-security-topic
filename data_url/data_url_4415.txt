I'm doing simulated quantum annealing with qibo and I have an issue with an Hamiltonian with 6 coupled qubits (I don't have any issue if the Hamiltonian is at most quintic). Here is a very simple code
The error I get is
when it calls the evolve function which in turn is defined through models.AdiabaticEvolution.
Everything goes fine if I change the Hamiltonian to a quintic one. Is this related to QIBO?
Thank you for opening this.
I tried this code on my computer and it worked, with both qibojit and numpy backends.
Anyway, this problem seems to me related to a mismatch of dimension of size in variables types, probably related to numba in qibojit (it should work on numpy backend).
@andrea-pasquale maybe you can better understand this.
Thank you for the issue.
As @MatteoRobbiati was saying the problem seems to be related to the NumbaBackend in qibojit.
Also in my case I was able to run the code without any errors. Although the numba backend was quite slow so probably there is something wrong.
Which versions of qibojit, qibo and numba are you using @lucaanutricati?
Many thanks for the help.
Versions:  numba is 0.54.1; qibo 0.1.11; qibojit 0.0.8
Anyway, it worked after updating qibo to 0.1.12.
