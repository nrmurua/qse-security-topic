No error is returned when num_qubits is None when instantiating circuits in the circuit library.
returns an empty list indicating that qc is an empty circuit.
I think there should be an error or warning when the num_qubits is not set (default to None), similar to it is set to 0 or a negative value.
returns CircuitError
No response
This applies to many circuits in the circuit libray: TwoLocal, NLocal, EfficientSU2, etc. where num_qubits is an optional parameter. Is this behavior intended?
After some thoughts, this might be an intended behavior. For example, we might want to specify only the general structures of the ansatz and pass to VQE. And then itâ€™s up to the VQE algorithm to decide how many qubits are needed depending on the molecule and mapper.
Any comments? @ajavadia @Cryoris
As you said it's intended that you can define the circuit without num qubits so that it can be set later in the algo flow. However it's weird that it just builds an empty circuit if asked for it, I agree. We can add a check in the check_configuration method that ensures a number of qubits is given before the circuit is built.
Sounds good to me!
The error was found by many participants during the quantum challenge. The reason is that I included the following code for setting initial_point before passing to VQE algorithm. (similar to this tutorial: https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/tutorials/07_leveraging_qiskit_runtime.html#VQE)
Is it very common to set initial point for VQE? In that case we lose the benefits of not setting the number of qubits for ansatz since we need to specify the number of qubits to know the number of parameters for generating initial point.
We mainly need the feature of setting the number of qubits later in the application workflow. There, the initial point is usually also determined by the application, so it's not going to be set by the user.
