The sampling of a circuit with a single qubit returns a result with a bitstring with two bits.
Compile the following circuit in library mode:
It's execution returns:
Note: this problem seems to not happen when we add a quantum operator after the reset.
It should return:
Not a regression
No response
It seems to me that two separate measurements should return two separate answers, so I would think that the correct answer should be:

This is not the semantics of cudaq::sample. In the bitstrings of its result, each bit correspond to the measure state of a qubit, not a sequence of measurements of the same qubit.

This would mean that cudaq::sample would be unable to reuse a qubit and save the measurement from earlier usages. Maybe it's just me, but that seems undesirable to me. It's something that the QIR spec permits, so prohibiting it within a core CUDA Quantum feature (like cudaq::sample) seems suboptimal.
Stepping back a bit, will this issue still be relevant if we consider changes to cudaq::sample that allow the user to more clearly specify the return values (i.e. use something other than void)?
