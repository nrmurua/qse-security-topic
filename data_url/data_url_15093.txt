Makes total sense, if the time elapsed is 0, it will cause the exception:
[ len(f"{c.items_completed / c.time_elapsed.total_seconds():.2f}") for c in progress_bar.counters]
this happens only on windows. Linux never got there for some reason
Every now and then I get an exception DivisionByZero
I am using it to display ProgressBar counters.
Not sure I can give you the required conditions, but it is obvious how to fix. Don't divide by 0. For example, this will fix it
def get_width(self, progress_bar: "ProgressBar") -> AnyDimension:
all_values = [
len(f"{c.items_completed / c.time_elapsed.total_seconds():.2f} ") if c.time_elapsed.total_seconds() else 0
for c in progress_bar.counters
]
if all_values:
return max(all_values)
return 0
No division by 0 exception
Handle 0 time_elapsed case like:
Are you sure this relates to Qiskit?  You haven't filled in your Qiskit version, I don't see "qiskit" in any of your outputs, and Terra has never defined any function called get_width.
You are correct. I am sorry, got into the wrong project.
