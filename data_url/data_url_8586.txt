The Qobj.dag() method does not preserve superrep, which can create surprising errors when attempting to work with adjoint channels (as Watrous notes, adjoint channels can be calculated from the Hermitian conjugates of superoperators). In particular, to_choi(rand_super_bcsz().dag()) raises a TypeError:
