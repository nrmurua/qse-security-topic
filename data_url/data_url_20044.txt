Bonjour,
I created a CA of rsa3072_falcon512. When i try to import it in PQCACerts.zip as a trusted Root CA. I get the following error:
[3742:3742:0426/180506.505104:ERROR:nsNSSCertificateDB.cpp(89)] PK11_ImportCert failed with error -8168
I tried to import other certificate files which are part of the HTTPD & NGINX dockers
https://hub.docker.com/r/openquantumsafe/httpd
https://hub.docker.com/r/openquantumsafe/nginx
All the certs are attached as PQCACerts.zip
Please guide me on this.
Regards
Scott Thomas
Closing as discussion ongoing here.
