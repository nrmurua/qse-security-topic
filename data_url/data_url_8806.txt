The CQC backend should return the smallest unused ID and not simple count up forever.
Ah right, we had an issue for this.
This is now implemented, see #28.
It is however only done in the SimulaQron backend, it can be easily changed to CQC backend (the logger still counts up indefinitely).
But is the CQC backend or the quantum backend responsible for assigning ids?
@LeonWubben What does it mean that this is only fixed in the SimulaQron backend? This should concern what qubit IDs are sent back as a CQC message.
@AckslD Yep, it's the backends responsibility to choose qubit_ids, so should be fine to let the SimulaqronCQCHandler assign them.
