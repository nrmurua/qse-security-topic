The standard gates could have a better documentation. They're missing type information on the input and only a few explain what their action on the qubits actually is. This forces users to go look either in the code (which some might not do) or elsewhere (books/internet). Since the qubit ordering is different in Qiskit compared to many other places, I believe it would be very useful to have a more accurate documentation. Especially for users getting started with quantum computing; the gates are probably one of the first objects they get in contact with.
In #3472, many gates already get an updated docstring that includes the matrix representation.
However the types are still missing and the docstrings could be more elaborate in general.
For example we could go from
to
(Note: the matrix representation bit is part of #3472)
This is partially addressed by #4017 but it would probably still be useful for IDE and linter purposes to have type hints and type documentation in the docstring.
It is beneficial for whole project if type hints are supported.
