VQD result object has these fields https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/c463b3c4741c7532494a583633d2798352fc828e/qiskit/algorithms/eigensolvers/vqd.py#L468-L470
the field optimal_values is incorrectly populated with points not values https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/c463b3c4741c7532494a583633d2798352fc828e/qiskit/algorithms/eigensolvers/vqd.py#L445-L451
This can be seen in VQD tutorial where it says it will print 3 energy values, but instead it's 3 lists

See Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials#1471 which was to fix the deprecation and I had wondered why the change from using optimal_values as the output from what was checked in seemed fine. The above when its run from the latest VQD, as published out as html, is not though - so something changed since that was ran originally - hence this issue.
