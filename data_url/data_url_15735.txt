Sympy 1.9 has begun issuing deprecation warnings when accessing expr_free_symbols, which we do during visualisation.  This breaks CI, and will be removed in a future version.

No deprecation warnings.
To get CI running again immediately, we can just pin Sympy to a lower version (see #7116).  The full fix is to replace the usage with the new form (see #7117).
