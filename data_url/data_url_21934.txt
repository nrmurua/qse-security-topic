The device DB is not an experiment. artiq_run executes experiments.
and the only parameter I should change is the core_addr if I want to run the led.py using artiq_run?
Depends. The device_db.py is correct if it corresponds to your firmware, gateware, and hardware. IP address is only one parameter there. Are you really using the KC705 with the NIST backplane and the AD9914 DDSs (since that's where you copied that device database from)?
No,we only have a kc705 board.And now the board can not be found, that may also due to the device_db.py

We have run artiq_flash -t [board] -m [adapter] -f flash_storage.img proxy storage start containing the IP adderss successfully.
Can you ping the board?
What are the messages on the serial port?
I ping the IP address and it reply 'Unable to access the target host '
