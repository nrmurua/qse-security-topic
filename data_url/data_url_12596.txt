The following images have typos in the circuit they're depicting, compared to the circuits defined in the body of the tutorial.

It would clarify things to change all of the circuits to match up.
@trevormccrt can you look into fixing these ?
+1, It would be nice to fix these typos. This is the first tutorial that people will look at.
Also, it would better if the images were in a more editable format so that anyone can contribute.
