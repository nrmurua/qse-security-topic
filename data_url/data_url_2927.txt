Currently, we do qubit ordering in two different ways: (1) by specifying a list as an example of the order, and (2) specifying a key function like (the sorted method). (Also we could go C-style and specify a comparator.)
I think we should be consistent about this. Also I kind of feel like we should support both styles...? Which would imply we need some sort of object to represent ordering, or a common set of keyword args.

Default ordering would be helpful (and allow for simpler examples of the basic use cases).
Definitely agree about extending the default (ordering by __str__ with digit runs padded up to length 8 with leading 0s) ordering to all methods.
