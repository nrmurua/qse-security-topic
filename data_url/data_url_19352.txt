I'm using the following toy model for randomized benchmarking:
When I perform measurements using:
I get the same results for all the shots. Therefore it seems like that the circuit is executed only once.
Even if according to the documentation when using channels the full circuit should be re-executed for every shot.
If I re-execute the circuit manually
I get the correct output.
