Reference comment: #1749 (comment)
When creating the result object with the qelectron results as well, we're trying to access the qelectron db on the client side even though it only exists on the server side (see referred comment above). This means that'll fail in the case when remote executors are used or when using self-hosted deployment since the qelectron db will not exist where it is trying to be accessed. We need to have a different mechanism to access the db.
This should be closed when #1759 is closed.
Currently the Result.get_node_result function would fail if Covalent is hosted on a remote machine as it calls Result._get_node_qelectron_data which in turn looks for the qelectron_db locally - which isn't there. We can fix this by pickling each node's qelectron_db over to the client together with the rest of the result object for now as a temporary solution. A more permanent solution would be taking advantage of the assets mechanism introduced in the upcoming memory improvements PRs.
