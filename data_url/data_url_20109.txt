On macOS, building our fork of OpenSSH v8 against the latest liboqs commit fails with the following error:
The fix should include removing explicit_bzero here.
Ideally Picnic would use our OQS_MEM_cleanse instead of explicit_bzero. We also have OQS_MEM_aligned_alloc and OQS_MEM_aligned_free. So we have everything in picnic's compat.h except timingsafe_bcmp. I suggest we remove Picnic's compatibility layer and improve ours.
Agreed.
So we have everything in picnic's compat.h except timingsafe_bcmp.
Now I remember: timingsafe_bcmp was the symbol that made building oqs-openssh on alpine impossible (also duplicate symbol error during linking). After switching to debian, problem was gone. I didn't quite understand why, though, as the symbol was still there in both object files...
