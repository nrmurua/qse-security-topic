Hi!
The following code:
gives a differently-ordered psi's as compared to qpp::disp, and it's not a simple reversed order, but some reshuffling I cannot decipher.
Why is that? What's the internal ordering qpp::disp prefers? I couldn't figure it out looking at your code.
Thanks!
@rumschuettel Why are you incrementing i twice (first in the for loop then inside the loop in std::bitset<8>(i++))? I assume you have a state on 8 qubits, right? But it looks like in your loop you're only displaying 128 (instead of 2^8=256) coefficients.
Test this (I reduced the number to 3 qubits, so 8 coefficients), it'll give the exact same results in both cases:
Indeed, this was my fault; my print function was quite a bit more complicated before and the double increment is a bug, which is super obvious after I posted it. My fault üëç
Thanks a lot though!
