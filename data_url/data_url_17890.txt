The load_qasm_* should be part of the circuit object and not in the wrapper
circuit(qasm_file)
or
circuit.load(qasm_file)
I do agree with this approach. Somebody against it?
Something like load_qasm_file and  load_qasm_string? They should be deprecated from the wrappers.
So I'm starting to implement this now. Looking at how we'd do this we can parse the qasm and get an ast pretty easily. But when it comes to converting that ast to a circuit object it gets a bit more involved. We could either use the Unroller() with the backend set to CircuitBackend inside the new constructor methods. Or alternatively we could basically inline that code. (which would end up with a bunch of duplicated code) But I just want to make sure I'm not missing something obvious or there was another path to implement this because we'll need to loop over the ast from the Qasm parser and construct the circuit from that.
I threw together a commit to do this here: mtreinish@e50778b but it's blocked until #1152 merges because it depends on that refactor to work.
the unroller is how I would do it as well. I want to rethink the unroller but this makes the most sense now
Also, i have an initial implementation  for #1144 but it is the same code as what you have in this so i think let's get your pr in and then i make mine
