In the case of a Multiparameter with many internal setpoints that stay constant while an external setpoint is swept, the output of Dataset.get_parameter_data can get unwieldy. A useful option would be to only return setpoints once, then something similar to Dataset.get_data.
@thibaudruelle I had to modify your example a bit to get it to run, can you please confirm if the below is what you intend
This works exactly as I would expect. Can you elaborate on what you mean by unwieldy it has the same shape as the data so it's no more unwieldy than the data
@jenshnielsen Sorry for the mistakes in the working example, I corrected them.
It does work as expected. However in the specific case when the values of 't' do not depend on 't2', get_parameter_data returns a lot of redundant data. For my use case it would be useful to have an option to return only the top_level_parameter data. It might be a niche case and not worth working on it though.
