Current master, MacOS 10.15.7, Xcode-12.0.1.
Everything used to work fine (and still works on another machine with only 4 CPU cores), but for a couple of days this machine (20 CPU cores) shows this:

pytest -v -n=auto would reach the above point, and freeze. CPU usage climbs to 1000% with Python. and no progress in 60+ minutes.
Any help or suggestion?
Problem disappeared after rebooting the "big" computer. Looks like Python got stuck on something, and all the subsequent invocations were hitting the same (shared?!) wall.
