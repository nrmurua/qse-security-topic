FakeAuckland is missing config and properties
It should work like others do, eg
No response
FakePerth is affected as well.  Hard to systematically parse though since blocked by #8859
They're BackendV2 backends, which don't use configuration or properties, we decided to stop adding v1 backends for all the new fake backends. The migration guide between the 2 interfaces is here: https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/providers.html#backendv1-backendv2 (there's also a new converter class in 0.22.0rc1 to wrap a v1 backend in a v2 interface, but you don't need that for fake backends as there are v2 instances available for all of them)
Ahh I see. This is quite confusing from the user point of view though. In particular, Auckland, Hanoi, and Cairo were all released around the same time, and represent the same processor family. This makes it even harder to understand.
Since this is "expected" behavior, closing in favor of #8861
