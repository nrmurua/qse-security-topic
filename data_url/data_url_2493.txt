This code:
Produces this diagram:
Look carefully at lines 7-9 of the diagram:
These three lines all have gates; they are not vertically separated by a layer with no gates. This indicates they came from the same moment. But there is no same-moment indicator on the left or right.
Either these lines should not be placed together as they are, or the moment indicator should have been included.
I've been trying to look into this and, for what it's worth, the following code reproduces this issue with a more simple circuit:
Output:
Based on the above, it looks like the issue might be missing movement indicators, though I am still trying to better diagnose and resolve the problem here.
This works properly:
This also works properly:
This, however, doesn't:
Perhaps the problem is due to the single gates present at the end of the lines which were supposed to be grouped.
Thanks so much @Ashalynd - I think that you are right! In addition to the single gate at the bottom, it looks like the order within the movement also seems to impact whether this error occurs:
I am going to continue looking into this, but thanks so much for your help here!
