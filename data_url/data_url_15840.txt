Not all defined Gate classes accept a label in their initialiser (e.g. RXXGate), and QubitCircuit is quite inconsistent on whether instruction methods accept a label: maybe about half (e.g. QubitCircuit.x) do, and about half (e.g. QubitCircuit.h) don't.
Consistency.
Add the label kwarg everywhere.
edit: this is a partial duplicate of #5098.
Actually there's some history here. See #5098 and the referenced PR's in that issue. I believe the decision was to remove labels from QuantumCircuit gate methods, but leave them in most gate classes. So qc.append(HGate(label='h1')) will always work. And yes, some gate classes, like RZZGate don't have labels. That's still an issue.
Ah cool, I missed that issue.  Thanks.  The Gate parts of this issue are valid, but as you say, the QubitCircuit bits were deicded in a different direction.
