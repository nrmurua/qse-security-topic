When viewing coreanalyzer VCDs the extreme dynamic range of the time deltas between events makes them hard to navigate, view, and interpret.
Add an option to artiq_coreanalyzer (maybe --fixed-time-delta or --uniform-time-step) that emits VCD events at unit "time" intervals instead of actual RTIO timestamps. In that mode, add another signal that then shows the actual RTIO timestamp.
This would also make the VCDs look more like the "matrix" style of experiment description that some other tools use where columns are of equal width visually but of vastly different time width.
