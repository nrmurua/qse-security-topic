The following is quoted from an email received from Molly Saxelby via our support system:
As I continued through the documentation, I encountered another error with the following example:
I got the following error:
I fixed the error by changing the range to a list:
The tutorial, however suggests using range as above, as it was written with python 2.7 in mind. I suggest we explicitly convert classical_addresses to a list rather than raise an exception.
Hi  I have a similar problem with you but I have no idea how to fix it.
When I run this code
vqe_inst.expectation(small_ansatz([angle]), hamiltonian, 10000, qvm)
I  have the following error


Do you know how to fix this? @ntezak
Hi @huichencrytal it is hard to say without knowing more about what your variables contain. Can you post a self-contained code snippet that reproduces the behavior?
Also, feel free to post this on our slack channel https://rigetti-forest.slack.com
We and potentially other users may be able to help you more rapidly there.
I'm running the example code on the Grove page http://grove-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vqe.html

When I run the code that used to calculate expectation from sampling, the error appears.
I think the problem is the "range" in expectation_from sampling as below
