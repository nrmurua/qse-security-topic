qrl_measure/measure.py has been created to check the hash rate of CPU. But the input bytes is of 5 bytes, while the needed input bytes must be greater than 42 bytes for this to work.
This is related to a fix upstream (qryptonight) where additional checks were introduced.
Extend this to >42 bytes

The data is not important. Any values could work.
Fixed in #1571
