The Hamiltonian type hint is incorrect https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/fab61d21d105c40142e7d67a8ea7bab602dd4c12/qiskit/providers/models/backendconfiguration.py#L399. Rather then a Dict[str, str] it is actually a Dict[str, Any]. See the schema for the actual Hamiltonian definition https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/fab61d21d105c40142e7d67a8ea7bab602dd4c12/qiskit/schemas/backend_configuration_schema.json#L158
Can I also work on this since I will have to correct this to sort out #3599?
My apologies @arunraja-hub, @rochisha0 had submitted a PR before I saw your request here. Closing via #4649.
@taalexander no worries. I understand that it is good to ask for permission to fix the bug so I waited for your reply
