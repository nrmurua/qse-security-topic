Describe the issue
Bloch sphere distortion:
Hi, I am using a jupyter-lab version: '1.1.3' with the following packages:
matplotlib: '3.3.0'
qutip: '4.5.2'
When I plot the Bloch sphere, it shows up with a fair amount of distortion. Can anyone please point me in the right direction?
To Reproduce

This seems new to Matplotlib 3.3.0. Probably due to the following change:
Axes3D no longer distorts the 3D plot to match the 2D aspect ratio
documented here:

@sarsid Thank you, fixed with matplotlib 3.0.0
