The moninj proxy allows using a different port on the host for moninj, but the dashboard has this port hardcoded.
As above; solution is to use the device_db to get the correct proxy port, since the device_db is already used to get the address anyway. This is necessary since one may want to run multiple masters with different core devices on the same machine (I do this frequently to debug a test setup without disrupting the live setup), and the two core devices' moninj are no longer distinguishable by core device address.
Dashboard moninj connects
Dashboard moninj fails to connect to the proxy, because it is attempting to connect to the default port 1383
Preparing a PR to fix now.
