In QKD, if Alice transmits a random bit to Bob, it only gets accepted if the measurement bases of Alice and Bob match. If not, Alice should generate a new random bit to transmit. However, in the current implementation, Alice does not do so, but resends the same bit. This increases the probability for an attacker to get the key.
=> Generate a new random bit instead of sending the same bit again
