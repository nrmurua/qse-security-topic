I'm having trouble reproducing this, but I'm in a situation where the thing in the title is happening with GridQubit. I've narrowed it down to the fact that the cached cirq.GridQubit._hash values are different and recomputing them with cirq.Qid.__hash__(q1) gives correct, identical hash functions.
My leading theory is that I'm loading a previously-pickled gridqubit, a copy is being made somewhere and the hash is recomputed. The hash value of Qid (the class) is part of the hash input, which could differ over python instantiations
xref #3375

We should probably make the hash deterministic, e.g.
