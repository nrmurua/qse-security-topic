We have actually two places where we define our external package dependencies:
The requirements.txt is used by the make env target to install the dependencies into the conda virutal environment, and setup.py is used to create a distributable package meant to be used via pip.
Ok, we want to fix this situation. There should be only one entry point, so if a new dependency is removed/added we don't have to edit both files.
Newcomers
We want to keep requirements.txt file as the only entry point, so something must be changed on setup.py to use this file. Would you dare to change it? How?... if you are confident about a possible solution, let's jump right into a PR and I'll review it. Do you have many possible solutions in mind? ... Ok, let's discuss in this thread and see what's the best fit!.
Extra point! => if you make it work on Linux, Mac and Windows :)
The point goes to @desireevl !
Thanks! :)
