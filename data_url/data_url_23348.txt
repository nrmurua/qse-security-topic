qcodes issue:
Cannot set QCoDeS Instrument Parameter with numpy.int32, int16, int8 etc
Instrument should be set normally (works with setting with normal floats, ints, or numpy floats)
Nothing is set, following warning is printed. No exception is thrown. Response seems to be asynchronous.
WARNING:root:cannot sweep dac9 from 9.002822919050914 to 1 - jumping
Setting several values repeatedly in a loop causes the warnings to be printed in groups/ bursts.

Thanks for reporting this issue. The example you provide actually does not reproduce the warning, as it is missing one ingredient: setting the step value.
The following produces no warning:
whereas this does:
The problem is in get_ramp_values (bound method of a Parameter) that should probably just be made more permissive.
@nulinspiratie, do you see any reason to only allow int and float?
I suggest that we use the numbers.Real  abc to check this.
In addition the statement when non numeric does not actually match what it does, It returns an empty list and not a list containing the final element as the note would indicate. I suggest that we raise instead, Ignoring stepping seem potentially dangerous
