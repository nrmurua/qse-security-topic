Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
It seems measure and rydberg_corr functions (I'm not sure if rydberg_density and apply are also the case) are performed on CPU rather than GPU, when running the Bloqade simulation on GPUs (with CUDA and Adapt).
Describe the solution you'd like
@Roger-luo suggests writing a GPU kernel for these functions
Describe alternatives you've considered
Not using measure in the evolution simulation process.
Additional context
Hi @weinbe58
I would like to work on this issue for unitary hack. Can you provide more details on which function should I parallelize using CUDA ?
@RamAIbot A good place to start would be to look at #449 for some initial work I did on making a CUDA kernel for measure
