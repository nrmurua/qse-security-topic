It is fairly common to have a portable, human readable changelog for OSS projects. I think we should have one. For more background - I mostly agree with the reasons listed in https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/
My main motivation would be to introduce an "Unreleased" section, that would talk about Deprecations, Breaking changes and other notices that we can start to build before the releases.
PR authors would be asked to think about whether this PR:
It is also an opportunity to highlight awesome new features.
SGTM.  Maybe let's raise it at the next cirq cync and get broad approval?

Sounds good!
We voted against this cause the release notes already exist else where. This list would get too big on one file unless it has a directory structure that can be collapsed: #1207.
Thank you for that pointer @vtomole!!!
In my opinion we should reconsider given these arguments:
Great point on the directory structure + long file. I checked on kubernetes and this is what they've come up with:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/CHANGELOG - we could adopt this format if our changelog really becomes that long.
Finally, I think a CHANGELOG.md is still a bit more discoverable than Github releases in its current form, and portable - you can have a look at it in your IDE, no need for a browser.
Alternative idea: we could use the github wiki like SciPy does but add the link from somewhere visible to it.
This never really caught on for one reason or another. Going to close for now.
How about https://gitlab.com/salekpawel/cf_changelog ?
