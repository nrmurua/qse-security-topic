Description of the issue
Test code which create new virtual environments assumes the location of pip is /bin/pip in relation to the base directory. This is an assumption by relying on one installation scheme. Python currently supports nine schemes, https://docs.python.org/3/library/sysconfig.html#installation-paths. For example, on a system with posix_prefix the scripts path would be /usr/local/bin.
How to reproduce the issue
Run the pytests on a system with a different sysconfig scheme than posix_local.  This may be easier to reproduce with Python 3.10.

Cirq version
1.1.0
From Cirq sync:
I am using gLinux. I had a working Cirq using pyenv local 3.9.16 and was able to reproduce by running the virtual environment steps from the development doc. It used Python 3.10.9.
@pavoljuhas will investigate and report back.
@markedmiston - I have followed the steps in your comment and saw all the tests passing with the exception of
These failures were expected because I did not configure docker on my workstation.
After installing docker and fixing access permissions per https://stackoverflow.com/a/54504083 these tests passed as well.
Is there anything else that you saw going wrong?
I did not test with Docker and did not see any other errors. I presume if you drop into a Python shell on your container and checked the sysconfig scheme it would be the same as your host's Python. With a venv I believe the default is posix_venv which is the same as posix_prefix.
@markedmiston - I have specifically run the tests that were failing in the initial comment and they are all passing in my (cirq-py3) environment.  If you can reproduce those errors on your side please advice how.
Otherwise I am not sure what is the problem here.
Closing as non-reproducible.  Please reopen if you run into the initially reported errors again.
