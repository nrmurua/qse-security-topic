I am creating a simple circuit as follows:
The exported program generated by quantum-circuit.js is this:
However, when I run the exported program in Cirq, it gives me the following error:
Basically, Circuit requires the device parameter in order to use XmonSimulator. Perhaps, we could use cirq.Simulator() instead of XmonSimulator? Also, if we are using simulator.run(), the user needs to explicitly add measurement operations, otherwise the simulator can return empty measurements.
Please let me know if I am missing anything.
Hi @Kaustuvi,
Thanks for reporting. Export to cirq is not tested well, but it worked in time when it was implemented. Possibly cirq was changed in meantime (and you are first to report).
What version of cirq framework you are using?
I will test and try fix (if it is a bug) later when I reach my computer.
I am using cirq 0.5.0.
XmonSimulator is replaced with Simulator for now. (Will be added as an option somewhere in the near future).
So this issue is fixed. Closing.
