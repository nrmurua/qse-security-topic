The local_qasm_simulator does not know to sample a state vector even when a barrier is explicitly placed before the measurements.
For example, from the BZ tutorial:

The local_qasm_simulator should run once, and then sample the state vector shots times.  Instead it is doing a new run for each shot.  On my machine, a single-shot takes ~3sec, three-shots ~9sec, and 1000 shots, as given in the tutorial just runs forever (probably ~3000 sec = 50min).  In contrast, a single-shot on ibmq_qasm_simulator also takes ~3sec, but the full 1000 shots takes a total of ~9sec.
Marking this as high priority since the Deutsch and B-Z tutorials take forever to run.
Is this python vs c++. If not then this should go into aer when it comes out rather than changing the internals of the simulator.
c++ sim does not sample the circuit like it should.
Related to #666, but the barrier is explicitly added here, and it still seems not to sample.
Actually it seems that my cpp simulator is no longer being found.  So it is the Python version that is running here.
Yes, it is fixed.
ok great. But this points out that when aer comes out what is the point of the python.
