Releasing dev builds to pypi is currently done manually and in an ad hoc manner.  We could move to nightly builds.
Sounds reasonable. Any suggestions on what would actually be producing the builds? Some kind of cron job running on Travis?
We could use Cloud Build on GCP as well.
I'm looking into this.
Current idea is that we will do dev builds to a separate cirq-dev pypi package on every commit to master.  We can use travis's deploy functionality to do this I think.
We now have builds that deploy on every successful new merge.  These are pushed to "cirq-dev" which is owned by "quantumlibdev".
YAY!!
Look for a new way of doing this.
Think we can close this again since we are back doing this?  Or was there some other way we wanted to look to do this?
I think it's good! üëç
