consider
system information
You have to install Eigen library. On the main page it's specified that the default location is $HOME/eigen. If you want a different location, edit the CMakeLists.txt accordingly.
you are right; my bad - i missed that step.
no problem. thanks for trying it :)
no probs.
i can confirm that after doing what you say - installing eigen3 and then creating $HOME/eigen to point at /usr/local/include/eigen3 - it works fine.
