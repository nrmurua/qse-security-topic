Is there a method in braket (especially in braket.circuits) such that if U is an instance of the Circuit class, then U.control() refers to the controlled version of this circuit ?
Hello, Thanks for reaching out! We are sorry but currently we don't support anything like that yet, but it does sound interesting, we would love to hear more about your use case and determine how we can incorporate this in Braket.
While we don't yet offer control modifiers for gates (or abstract circuits), it might be possible for you to utilize the arbitrary Unitary gate to achieve this by passing in the matrix representing the controlled version of the unitary for the circuit (The unitary representing the circuit can be obtained using the method circuit.as_unitary()).
For instance:
