Following up conversation from PR #147 I would love to have a little discussion about what other linter alternatives we could integrate within the SDK.
I think there's an agreement to not integrating with multiple linter tools, so lets choose one.
We are using pylint from the beginning and I guess that the main reason is because it's considered a standard de facto, but we are having a bad time going full free of warnings and there's a lot of false positives, which I guess is something we can afford... but, it's kind of annoying.
My question for the real experts (@diego-plan9 @cclauss), is there anything we can do with flake8 that we can't do (or it's too cumbersome) with pylint?
Both pylint and flake8 live under the Python Code Quality Authority and we continue to see nice convergence in the progress of these two tools.  Personally, I like flake8 and will from time to time run it over the codebase to look for issues but I have no problem with sticking with pylint as the official approach for this repo.  I have taken flake8 out of #147 and changed the PR name to reflect its new focus on pylint.  There are a few open pylint issues to resolve but there are suggestions in that PR to guide us towards some solutions.
Gonna close this Issue to keep repo clean.
Please, feel free to reopen it if want to resume the discussion.
