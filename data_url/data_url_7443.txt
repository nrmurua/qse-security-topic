Hello,
Is that supported in Yao?

Thanks for the issue. Yes, it is
While it is a good question and is welcomed here, in order to make the answer more accessible to other users, a better place to ask question is the quantum domain of discourse: https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/quantum/52 . Both Roger and I watched that channel.
