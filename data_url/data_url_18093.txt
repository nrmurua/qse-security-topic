My QISKit version is 0.5.4 (the latest I believe), and I have python 3.7 on Windows 10 OS.
I wanted to find the output of the action of identity operator on the qubit |0> as a baby test. I was expecting the output to be again |0>, while the output was indeed:  {'statevector': array([7.07106781e-01+0.j , 4.32978028e-17+0.70710678j])} . I used the following sets of commands: q = QuantumRegister(1) qc = QuantumCircuit(q) job = execute(qc, backend='local_statevector_simulator') job.result().get_data(qc).
(The set up is basically from THIS page of the tutorial.)
What am I doing wrong?
The commands you have written are for an empty circuit. You need to add at least one gate.
You can add the identity gate as iden.
The code below works:
