When trying to transpile a circuit containing reset gate I get the following error:
HighLevelSynthesis was unable to synthesize Instruction(name='reset', num_qubits=1, num_clbits=0, params=[]).
Using the following circuit I found to be able to produce the error.
It should transpile successfully. Current workaround I found is removing the noise modell from the simulation.
Nvm updating to 13.1 fixed the issue
