Using Poetry's ^ syntax for dependencies whose major version is at 0 causes Poetry to pin the minor version of that dependency (see Poetry's documentation). This means that the following dependency, for example, pins qcs-api-client to version 0.8.0, despite the latest version being 0.20.10.

Unless specifically required for some dependency, change the ^0 dependencies to explicitly allow minor version updates and disallow major version updates:
Poetry's behavior is intentional because of the way that 0.x versions in Semantic Versioning indicate instability. Technically, any version of a 0.x dependency can be a breaking change, but in practice, most projects (including our API client) use the minor component to indicate any breaking changes.
In the case of the API client, a CI issue caused the wrong component to be bumped for a while. In practice, I don't think there's much difference between the latest supported version (0.12.* in pyquil 3.1.0-rc.5) and 0.20.10.
I'll do a quick audit of the changes and see if I can get the latest to be supported here (in rc). I'll also check in with the team to see if there is anything blocking the full release of 3.1.0
Alright, the range is expanded and 3.1.0 is released ðŸŽ‰! I'm going to close this issue since the specific example is resolved.
There could maybe be an argument made for removing upper ranges on dependencies altogether (I know that's a really popular trend in Python libraries right now), though I think that's more suitable for a discussion if you'd like to propose it. It's a much bigger change, so I'd like to get some feedback from a lot of folks before we do something that drastic.
