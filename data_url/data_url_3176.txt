@notmgsk could you add a little more detail here so that someone could pick this up?
Off-the-top-of-my-head:
There are various terminal-like tools on Windows: cmd.exe and powershell, and third-party tools like msys. They each have their own behaviours and quirks. The SDK is only tested under cmd.exe -- does it work under powershell? What about the "unix-like" tools like cygwin and msys2 -- does the Windows SDK work under those? do you have to install the linux version of the SDK?
Windows firewall tooling might block ports and not tell the user / not make it clear how to unblock them.
