Seen in #322, where the "passing" Kokoro build links to the MacOS run (which passed), but the Windows build failed.
My best guess for now is that Kokoro determines pass/fail based on the first completed test. It seems like there are some tools for chaining/grouping Kokoro tests; I'll look into those.
A fix was rolled out in the internal Kokoro pipeline and verified in #359 (no Github changes required).
