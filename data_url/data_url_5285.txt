Describe the bug
I tried to compile an example in the tutorial. Upon last night things work fine. I tried just now and it seems that the compilation does not work anymore. The reason I believe is that the repo libeigen/eigen does not exist anymore and the Cmake wants to get updates from that library.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Screenshots
[  2%] Performing update step for 'deps-eigen'
remote: A repository for this project does not exist yet.
fatal: repository 'https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git/' not found
CMake Error at /scratch1/08177/bfpnnl/intel-qs-new/intel-qs/build/deps/eigen-prefix/tmp/deps-eigen-gitupdate.cmake:55 (message):
Failed to fetch repository 'https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git'
make[2]: *** [deps/eigen-prefix/src/deps-eigen-stamp/deps-eigen-update] Error 1
make[1]: *** [src/CMakeFiles/deps-eigen.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2
I see this library should already exist on my local. Can I skip this step and just use my local version?
Hi @flyree ,
it is a problem with Eigen. See message "NOTICE! We are troubleshooting a technical problem. The main Eigen repository on GitLab is currently offline." in their home page:
https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
Eigen is used only for simulations with noise but the current build requires it by default.
I think the Eigen team will solve the issue quickly, but a way to move forward would be adding a build option that enable/disable the noisy simulation.
I see. Thank you for the response. Hopefully, this would be resolved by them soon!
It seems that repository Eigen is back online.
However this gave me the motivation to include it in the building process as optional (instead of as a requirement).
See pull-request #67 .
