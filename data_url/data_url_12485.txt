The equations for inner product and fidelity ops in the API docs are not being rendered correctly. Here is an example of the inner product op (screencap from the website).

I believe it should look like

I think the problems are that 1) for some reason it isn't compiling the \text command properly (hence why you see the "ext" before program and 2) I don't think text mode in latex allows for 'naked' underscores (or at least it errors when I try), so it should be \_ instead of _
I generated the example via \langle \psi_{\text{programs[i]}} (\text{symbol\_values[i]}) | \psi_{\text{other\_programs[j]}} \rangle which is very similar to the latex from the code documentation
