It's another packaging problem on Windows / Conda! Installing artiq into a new environment using the install-with-conda.py script results in a broken installation: calling e.g. artiq_run results in
Works.
Error message shown above.
Inspecting the contents of the new environment and comparing with an old one that I already had (which works) shows that C:\Users\me\.conda\envs\artiq\Lib\site-packages\llvmlite_artiq\_version.py differs:
I think the source of the error is the different .dll in llvmlite_artiq.binding. The working env's .dll file is 20,763 KB whereas the broken env's is 29,221 KB, so there is a difference.

Install the old package from the m-labs channel on anaconda.org for now (I thought conda would look at build numbers but apparently not).
Could you kindly install MSYS2 (with the official installer on https://www.msys2.org/, not the conda packages), and see if MSYS2-PyQt5 works on your machine? I see no other reports of the freezes I am seeing. MSYS2 is technically way superior to Conda and would also allow us to remove Visual Studio from the process entirely.
Running a hello world application e.g. https://pythonbasics.org/pyqt-hello-world/ is sufficient to crash it (the program just freezes at the creation of the first widget).

Hi @sbourdeauducq, thanks for the help
I ran the following in a msys2 terminal on Windows 10:
(The flag is required due to msys2/MSYS2-packages#1658, I think I might have an old version of MSYS2 installed.)
I then ran python3 test_pyqt.py with the file you copied above and received:

So looks like it's working!
I also tried another conda artiq installation to see if that commit to the hydra build has fixed things, but I'm still getting the same error.

Thanks! I don't know why it fails here then...

Are you on the stable channel (conda.m-labs/artiq and not /artiq-beta)?
Note that the conda cache mechanism is broken (moving to MSYS2 and Pacman would fix that) and you may also need to delete some files manually.

I was on the artiq-beta channel: I'm trying again now without any of the conda.m-labs.hk channels:
You do need the /artiq channel.

Do you know what MSYS version you have installed?
And what Windows version? It's Win10 here.

Yep, adding that the installation now works.
And what Windows version? It's Win10 here.
Windows 10 here too:

MSYS doesn't really have a specific version since it's just a collection of packages. Here's a dump of all of mine:
msys_versions.txt
PyQt 5.12 that you have installed is over a year old. Can you confirm if the latest version works for you? I'm trying to downgrade here and see what happens.
Still fails...
Ok I found the problem. Creating a QApplication object breaks the Python REPL and commands you enter there are no longer transmitted to Python, which gives the impression that it has crashed. It also works here when running the Qt application from a file and not copy-pasting code into the REPL.

How annoying... Congrats on getting it going!
If you're intending to move over to MSYS2 entirely does that mean you'd be dropping virtual environments?
Yes, Pacman does not support environments.
Hmmm that would be a shame to lose. Personally I'd only use MSYS for artiq so it would be fine, but being able to isolate your dependencies is a feature that I think many would miss.
