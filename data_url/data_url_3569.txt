In the QFT example we talk about doing the Fourier Transform on "[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. ".  We are doing a 3 qubit Fourier transform, but that doesn't look like a 3 qubit array.  Is this a typo, or am I missing something?
In summary, you need 2^n complex numbers to describe n qubits. In this case for 3 qubits 2^n = 8.  Taking the QFT of 3 qubits will put the qubits in a superposition of states that will need 8 numbers to describe. This is evident when you perform the Inverse FT on [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] as is done on the page you are reading . It gives you the same result as when you perform a QFT on those 3 qubits.
Let me know if you have any more questions.
I think I see.  So if you started with a state vector of [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] and did an X gate on all qubits you would end up with a state vector [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]?
Yes.
@hellmersjl3ds If you don't have anymore questions, let's close this issue.
