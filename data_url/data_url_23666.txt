The Multiples(Ints) validator checks if a give value is a multiple of some other value (the divisor).
This validator only works for Ints and there is no reason for this.
A perfectly valid example would be requiring for values to be multiples of 20ns.
The current value would then be valid 40e-9 as this would return 0.0. Currently this will raise an error as 40e-9 (which is a multiple of 20e-9) raises an error as it is not an Int. I propose dropping the constraint of it having to be an Int.
Thats sensible enough but we will need to be careful about the implementation
as floating point math cannot be assumed to be distributive. For example
@AdriaanRol I'll put up an extra validator, PermissiveMultiples, for this on Monday.
