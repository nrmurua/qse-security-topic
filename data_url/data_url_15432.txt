I get a divide by zero warning (usually but not always) in the determinant computed by NumPy for the following test:
above
No divide by zeros
No response
I tried running this on my local environment with numpy 1.23.0 from PyPI on x86_64 linux with Python 3.10 and I wasn't able to get any warnings when running the script (I even tried setting PYTHONWARNINGS=always to force it to emit everything). I'm thinking this might be a local environment issue with the numpy builds in your environment. I don't have a mac handy to test different numpy packages though
Yeah, I have tried it on 2 other machines and cannot reproduce.  It looks to be isolated to M1 mac builds of NumPy.  Closing assuming that that is what it is.
Just for the record, it is both pip and conda builds of NumPy for OSX ARM that raise these warnings.
