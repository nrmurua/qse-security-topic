I construct a mcry gate with three qubits as control qubits, and one qubits as target qubits. When I bind parameters, it doesn't work.

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, Aer
from qiskit.circuit import Parameter
qr = QuantumRegister(4)
qr_control = qr[:3]
qr_target = qr[3]
qc = QuantumCircuit(qr)
para = Parameter('input')
qc.mcry(para, qr_control, qr_target)
qc = qc.bind_parameters({para:1})
qc.draw('mpl')

the value 1 should be binded with 'input'ï¼Œbut it doesn't.
No response
This seems to be another symptom of the controlled U-gate assignment error, which will be fixed with #9118.
You can temporarily circumvent this bug by transpiling the circuit to another basis, without the CUGate. For example:
works as expected.
When will the mistake be corrected in qiskit?
