Python
Due to a bug, Qiskit transpiles single-qubit gates to u1, u2, or u3 gates even though the original gates are in the target gateset. This is being tracked upstream at Qiskit/qiskit#10568.
As a consequence, the new V2 backends in DDSIM actually transpile circuits containing such gates.
In most of the cases, MQT Core and the corresponding parser should be clever enough to reconstruct the original gate, but it is still not ideal.
This issue acts as a tracker for the upstream issue in Qiskit. Once that is resolved, we should more-or-less automatically benefit from it and can enable the respective tests again.
Backends should not transpile gates that they declare to support.
Uncomment the respective lines in the test/python/test_target.py file and run the tests.
The upstream issue has been resolved and will be part of qiskit 0.45.2.
Once that has dropped, we should be able to close this issue.
