Circuit compilation could take a lot of time to finish, so in order to make sure that the user/developer of the notebook is aware that nothing has crashed while compiling and, additionally, give them some insights about how long it would take to finish, we could implement some kind of progress bar.
How about using tqdm?

I would also add that the job could use a progress bar for the queue position.
The work on this has been started in PR #734.
Since #734 was merged, can this issue be closed?
Is there something for local run, not for Jupyter?
