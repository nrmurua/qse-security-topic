For long running optimizations, it's frequently the case that just one or two blocks need way more time than any others (likely due to bad initializations?). It would be useful if partial solutions could be returned in these cases, so that work that did get done doesn't get tossed when the process eventually has to be killed. Maybe setting a timeout for each block could address this?
