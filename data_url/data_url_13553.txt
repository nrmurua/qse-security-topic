Pull request #461 is introducing notebooks in the documentation using nbsphinx.
This should be resolved with #509 as you can use all of the regular Sphinx doctest plugin with notebooks either in *.ipynb or markdown format, and all notebooks specified are run from scratch to make sure that works. I will close this for now, please re-open if anyone feels this is not addressed.
