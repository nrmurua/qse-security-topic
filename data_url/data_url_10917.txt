Two issues:
One:
Installation was failing;
and an error message was printing about some clashing of versions:
I have a problem with the new code:
mport numpy as np
from dwave_sapi_dimod import SAPISampler
from dwave_sapi_dimod import EmbeddingComposite
from dwave_qbsolv import QBSolv
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "customer.py", line 2, in 
from dwave_sapi_dimod import SAPISampler
File "//anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dwave_sapi_dimod/init.py", line 9, in 
from dwave_sapi_dimod.samplers import *
File "//anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dwave_sapi_dimod/samplers.py", line 26, in 
class SAPILocalSampler(dimod.TemplateSampler):
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'TemplateSampler'
Two:
Exception TypeError: TypeError("expected 'num_occurences' to be a positive int",) in 'dwave_qbsolv.qbsolv_binding.solver_callback' ignoredâ€‹
On this second one, the code didn't throw this message when running on a local machine, but when the code was running on the D-Wave QPU, this message was thrown. The runs would proceed; but this message was generated.
