Problem: Currently the install_everything.sh script can only execute install_<toolname>_essentials.sh and install_<toolname<.sh together. The script should be able to install either of them (and throw a warning if one is missing). After this was fixed, SpinalHDL (contains only install_spinalhdl_essentials.sh) can be added to install_everything.sh
