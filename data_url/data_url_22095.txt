@enjoy-digital how to do that? Is the procedure still the same with the latest code, and are there no issues (iirc that required core device reboots after entering test modes)?
@sbourdeauducq: here is what i started for STATUS and PRBS:

PRBS was not working but it should be easy to get it working.
I haven't implemented STAPL but procedure is still the same.
I think we shouldn't need STAPL - the purpose of this is to test the board's integrity, and PRBS should be enough, correct?
@sbourdeauducq: yes for board's integrity this enough. (STAPL was useful to validate the core).
I'll take care of getting PRBS working in the firmware while doing others JESD related things.
