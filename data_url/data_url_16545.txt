Trying using  var_form 'TwoLocal' with VQE . getting errors whit ./qiskit/aqua/utils/run_circuit.py
AttributeError: 'BackendConfiguration' Object has no attribute 'max_experiments'
In this case,  AQT simulator backend does not have a 'max_experiment' attribute in its configuration.
using other var_forms give different errors. Qiskit aqua code does not seem to support AQT simulator.
So my general question : Is Qiskit supposed to support AQT backend up to this point ?  or qiskit only providing access to AQT backends through the aqt_provider to run basic circuits
Thanks
backend = aqt.get_backend('aqt_qasm_simulator')
seed = 10598
quantum_instance = QuantumInstance(backend, seed_simulator=seed, seed_transpiler=seed, shots=100)
qubitOp = Z
var_form = TwoLocal(1,'ry',reps=1,insert_barriers=True, skip_final_rotation_layer=True)
vqe2 = VQE(qubitOp, var_form, optimizer)
vqe2_run = vqe2.run(quantum_instance)
@patdenim Qiskit is definitely supposed to support AQT (and other) backend. It's a bug in Aqua to assume max_experiments, which is not defined as required in the schema, exits. There are other false assumptions in run_circuit that should be fixed (e.g. job.queue_position()).
thks Jessie. I'll detailed also the other problems encountered with other var_forms here then.
I will add though that since the developers here do not have access to the AQT device for testing, it hard to verify that all is working as it should.
The AQT backends have max_experiments and have since qiskit-community/qiskit-aqt-provider#21.  As such, I am closing this issue.
