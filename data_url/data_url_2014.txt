Move the code in https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/blob/master/.travis.yml to a corresponding one in https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/tree/master/.github/workflows.
can you assign it to me @vtomole
This is for unstable builds, correct (no longer called dev builds, though we have that name in the scripts).
That's right; just re-titled the issue.
@vtomole is this still valid issue?
@jitendrs  Yes.
@vtomole I'll close this - it seems that everything is moved to Github Worklfow now. Please reopen / ping me if I'm missing something!
