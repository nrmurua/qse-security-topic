Unable to output image when calling draw method on a circuit constructed by a feature map.
Error is
TypeError: unsupported format string passed to Pi.__format__
The pi from qiskit.qasm is not working with "{:.2f}".format(np.pi), which is called by draw()
(in qiskit/tools/visualization/_matplotlib.py line 752)
from qiskit_aqua.components.feature_maps import FirstOrderExpansion
import numpy as np
feature_map = FirstOrderExpansion(num_qubits=2, depth=2)
feature_map.construct_circuit(x=np.array([0.3, 0.2])).draw(output='mpl', filename='test.png')
To narrow the problem:
from qiskit.qasm import pi
"{:.2f}".format(pi)
Correct output of image, so "{:.2f}".format(pi) where pi is the one from qiskit.qasm should return "3.14"
For now I changed the one occurence of pi to np.pi in construct_circuit in PauliExpansion and it works. But we should change qiskit.qasm.pi instead. Or use qc.h(qr[i]) instead of qc.u2(0, pi, qr[i]) ( components/feature_maps/pauli_expansion.py in construct_circuit), but I saw that wasn't the norm .
The master branch of qiskit-terra has resolved this issue. If you used both master branch of Aqua and Terra, you would be able to draw the circuit of the feature map.
Ok thank you! I will try with updated Terra.
Just a quick info from qiskit 0.9, it indeed works, but
from qiskit.qasm import pi "{:.2f}".format(pi) still isn't working. Not an issue but it's just a remark. draw method works perfectly.
I am getting the same error if I want to draw the circuit for qiskit_aqua.algorithms.QAOA using mpl.
@jonguenther what is the version of your qiskit-terra and qiskit-aqua? I tested your codes against the master branch, and it works well.
@rfclambert for that issue, do you mind opening an issue in qiskit-terra? that will be a better place to resolve the issue.
Yes, I will do that! For me draw method works now (I'm not on master but I have the last release), but it can be a good idea to make qasm.pi compatible with this kind of format.
The error occured when I was using qiskit-aqua 0.4.1 with Qiskit 0.9.0. After I upgraded to qiskit-aqua 0.5.0 and Qiskit 0.10.1, it works now üëç
