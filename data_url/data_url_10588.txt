It would be great if when an EmbeddingComposite is used, the sampleset.info["timing"] dictionary was updated with the EmbeddingComposite overheads. The thing that I'm interested the most for benchmarking purposes is the unembedding stage. I would like to know how long did every chain_break_method take in order to find the optimal combination of quantum and classical resources.
See dwavesystems/dwave-samplers#22 for a discussion of timing in samplers. This should fit into that model.
