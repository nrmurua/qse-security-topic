We do have a NoiseModel::as_dict() method that we may want to change to .to_dict()  the same way Terra did, otherwise our AerJSONEncoder class won't know how to serialize NoiseModel objects.
This is changing the API of an important component, just making sure @chriseclectic and @gadial are fine with this change, and what implications have (more than changing the tutorials).
I'll put a depreaction warning in our NoiseModel::as_dict() method so we can remove it for 0.3.x or 0.4.x.
For the sake of consistency, I have changed all our .as_dict() API methods, to to_dict().
