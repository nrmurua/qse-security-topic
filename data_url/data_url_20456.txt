Some improvement comes from using OpenSSL for AES, but still not enough.  Maybe memory allocations are problematic?  Will do some microbenchmarks to try to isolate the problem.
Found one source of performance gains:
#43
The old implementation used defined constants, while the new implementation uses parameters passed in. By caching some of the parameters there are significant performance gains.
Resolved by #45.
