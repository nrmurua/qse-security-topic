When running the tests on a fresh checkout I got the following failure which should be reproducible via:
This was reported on tests.ir.circuit.test_op_gate_circ_methods.TestInsert
The hypothesis strategies for generating circuits and gates are very slow and flaky. This causes some issues since hypothesis wants inputs to be generated in a consistent and short time. I initially set the config for hypothesis to stop reporting these errors, but long term, this causes our test suite to run slowly.
We should take a look at rewriting the strategies for gates and circuits to solve this issue properly.
