Its existence implies that an Operation should maintain an ordering for its qubits. Otherwise, you wouldn't know how the old qubits mapped to the new ones. Why should an Operation maintain such an ordering? For instance, I don't see why PauliString should.
Oh, wait, since qubits is a Tuple, there is already an ordering ...
Also I realized that its purpose is really just to be called by transform_qubits
