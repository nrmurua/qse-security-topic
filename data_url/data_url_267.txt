Take the following kernel
if I try to map this to the value-semantic model, all the operations will get removed since there is no measure nodes.
With measures, everything works as expected.
TBH this may be desired behavior. I bring it up because the CUDA lang spec mandates that kernels to be used in with observe function lack measure operations.
Update, I think its those extra canonicalizers that remove the ops, if I run
everything works as expected
I think we need a new Op, quake.sink, that is a pseudo-measurement.
Closing.
This is working as expected. The --add-dealloc pass must be run before --memtoreg to introduce the sink operations and avoid DCE from removing all operations that don't have their results used.
