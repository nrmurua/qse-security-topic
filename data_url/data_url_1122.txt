We have three implementations of state tomography:
The last one isn't well tested (yet). Once it is, we should compare performance and if there isn't a clear advantage to the fixed-size implementations we should remove them.
Should we keep this open? The linked issue fixes the bug in n-qubit tomography but the larger issue is still present
Yes, thank you. My comment on PR #2739 incorrectly said that it fixed #2737. It should have said that it fixed #2738.
There can never be too many implementations of state tomography :)
But yes we should unify these standard method of state tomography (there are many others).
Is this still an open concern ?
I'd say yes this is still a concern. It'd be nice to unify these tomography functions, but not a blocker for 1.0.
