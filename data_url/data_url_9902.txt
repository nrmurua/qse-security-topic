Application
Saves memory when we are working in a memory constrained situation.
Proposed Solution
We can swap the vectors inside the object with empty vectors. This will release the memory. If we resize the vectors or clear them, the allocated memory may not be released.
Example code : std::vector<your_vector_element_type>().swap(your_vector);
Alternatives Considered
Calling delete on the quadratic model objects.
Additional Context
The quadratic model objects have limited use and during its usage other memory allocations may happen, so once a quadratic model is used and if there is no more use for the object, but we still need the parent object in which the quadratic model resides in, we can release the memory held by the quadratic model only.
