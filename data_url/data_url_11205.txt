openfermion.QubitOperator and cirq.PauliSum represent the same logical entity, i.e. A linear combination of Pauli Terms.
Since there is now a general consensus on removing the constraint to keep OpenFermion independent of Cirq (for eg: The Openfermion-Cirq, Openfermion integration), I propose that:
We should provide a way to convert QubitOperator to PauliSum. For eg, using a helper qubit_operator_to_pauli_sum.
In the long run, should we also aim to get rid of the duplicate pieces and adopt the QubitOperator to internally use PauliSum structure (need discussion here)?
For 1, there is a clear short term advantage because this conversion helps us use many nice features in cirq like PauliSumCollector etc.
For example, Given an ansatz_circuit and a qubit_hamiltonian, we can write a simple function to find the optimal parameters for the ansatz_circuit to minimise expected value of qubit_hamiltonian as follows:
Please let me know your thoughts/concerns and I can proceed with a PR accordingly.

Hi @tanujkhattar, please coordinate with @kevinsung on this larger effort.  I am not in a rush to do this integration especially since cirq is moving quickly to 1.0 and could have significant feature changes.
Hi all,
I saw some progress on my PR about this by @kevinsung . You can see the updated PR waiting for merge here:
quantumlib/OpenFermion-Cirq#396
Comments are, of course, very much welcome.
Thanks for pointing out the earlier efforts in this direction. I've left some comments on your PR. Will mark this issue as duplicate and close it. Thanks!
