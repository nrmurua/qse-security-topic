initially reported by @rybkinjr:
The documentation for units for example in &COORD says: ANGSTROM, but in fact it has to be all lowercase angstrom, otherwise one gets the CPABORT Unknown unit: Angstrom (or Bohr, ...).
Possible fixes:
The CP2K input should be case insensitive. Looks like a missing CALL uppercase in cp_unit_create. Will fix that.
