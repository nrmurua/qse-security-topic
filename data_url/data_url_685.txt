Hi,
Executing the following circuit
throws "qpp::applyCTRL(): Matrix mismatch subsystems! [A/target]"
I've implemented a unit test: antoine-bussy@fd15ca8
I suspect that is treated as a CTRL_joint in QEngine::execute.
Replacing U with kronpow(U, target.size()) fixes the issue. See antoine-bussy@6da00f5
But I guess it's not a very good fix performance-wise.
The documentation of QCircuit::CTRL states that U is a single qubit gate, unlike QCircuit::CTRL_joint.
Have I misunderstood the issue #97 ?
I see now the overload you're referring to... will check
Fixed by #135
