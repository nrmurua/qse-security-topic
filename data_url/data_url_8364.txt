This is just FYI because I needed some time to track this one down, but I do not think it can be fixed in qutip (or scipy).
A Bug in Intel MKL causes scipy.linalg.eig to break and return zeros if the matrix is too large. This in turn breaks wigner.qfunc if the state in question is a density matrix. Possibly related are issues
scipy/scipy#8713 and scipy/scipy#8205. However the fix mentioned there does not solve the problem for me, so it might be unrelated.
If you run into this error, the only workaround I know of is to link scipy and numpy to a different blas library, e.g. openblas. Note that anaconda on windows always uses MKL on intel machines, so you need to install either manually or with pip.
Thank you for the information.
Should now be fixed by later releases of MKL; see scipy/scipy#8205.
