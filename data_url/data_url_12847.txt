The comment description for that task reads:
The following code passes:
AFAICT, the above code makes n-1 measurements, if both the boolean bit arrays have different value only at the last bit.
Good point, this is one of the older katas and the testing framework doesn't count the operations used, like the later (and more sophisticated) katas do. I'll need to revisit this at some point and see whether the rest of the tasks in the Measurements kata need to have more strict checks as well.
Thank you for pointing this out!
This has been resolved as part of #101.
