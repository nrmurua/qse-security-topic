CMdDef.get error messaging returns a standard error. For example
returns
because 'u3' is not a two-qubit gate (wrong user input).
A more informative error message could suggest that 'u3' is present but that the qubits argument is wrong. Potentially, the error message could suggest the correct qubits format.
I agree. Maybe error messages such as
improve usability. and here I can show some useful tips to find your command definition.
returns a list of command names exists in CmdDef.
returns valid qubit combinations for the command.
This is really helpful. I will make this change in the pulse defaults
