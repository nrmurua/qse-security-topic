It might be helpful to use tagged commit messages to automatically generate changelog and semantic version.
Currently GitLab CI has limitations that cause issues with this. It is not possible for the squash commit to automatically include all the commit messages from the branch. See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/26303
If the squash commit issue can be resolved, then we can use a tool like https://github.com/relekang/python-semantic-release
Versioning and changelog will be controlled automatically by commit messages rather than by hand.
This will change the way changelog entries are processed.
Instead of heading the changelog entry with the version and date, it will be headed with [UNRELEASED] and the automation will handle the version and date.
