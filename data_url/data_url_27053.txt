Following linking errors (related to cuSOLVER) are observed when compiling QUICK with CUDA/9.0
The reason is that cuSOLVER depends on openmp (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/9.0/pdf/CUSOLVER_Library.pdf, page 11).  @agoetz Shall we temporarily disable support for CUDA versions < 10.0?
The compilers support OpenMP. We just need to add the right flag at linking stage if CUDA version < 10.
@Altaimorin Can you also help me with this one? @agoetz has already provided the solution.
The OPENMP issue is fixed. However I got another one on ICER HPCC:

Therefore I added cuda_dc_flags for CUDA version < 10 for volta as well.
