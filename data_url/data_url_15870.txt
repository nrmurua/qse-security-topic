In QuantumCircuit.qasm() method, when id is added to the instruction name to make it unique if it is the same as an existing instruction. See: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/34b8079844fb19ee719015681184233afb4f9f72/qiskit/circuit/quantumcircuit.py#L1465-L1468
It currently modifies the circuit data directly, which is not ideal. We could just store a copy of the instruction where we modified the name instead of storing the same instance that lives in circuit.data. See comment here by @Cryoris: #5887 (comment)
Grabbing this one for my intern, if that's alright :)
Yes, sure. Please go ahead :)
I have to give it up -- onboarding took up the time I was hoping to use on this. Apologies! I should have anticipated that
Has this been addressed in another issue/PR? If not, I'd love to work on it.
Not that I know of. Go ahead!
@epelaaez That was fast!!! Congrats on making your first code contribution to Qiskit! Way to go!!!
Happy to contribute!
