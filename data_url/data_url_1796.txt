The redirect pages on readthedocs are missing styling.
E.g.: https://cirq.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/cirq.PauliString.expectation_from_state_vector.html

This should be easy to fix. The other issue is that for reference docs the user now have to find that same page in the new structure. Maybe we could add some Javascript magic to extract the target page from the current URL and do a JS based redirect instead of the HTML based one.
I think I can repro.
It seems the index page has the right path, but not the 404 one:

I am not sure why.
We have moved off of RTD (read the docs) so I don't think we need to address this anymore.  I strongly propose to remove this from before 1.0.
I'd like to see if we can get a redirect working as part of the launch.
@dabacon It looks like the redirect is working to the quantum AI homepage (there's just a five second delay).  RTD has been deprecated for over a year now, so I don't think it's worth fixing styling or making a smart redirect.  I vote we close this issue.
@dabacon If you agree, can you close this?
yep
