consistently receive this error:

This is on an AWS hosted instance.  Tried multiple times with fresh instances:
AMI ID: ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-20180126 (ami-66506c1c)
instance type: m5.2xlarge
from a fresh instance I ran these commands:
ubuntu@ip-10-86-3-32:~$ history
1  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
2  sudo apt-get -y install swig3.0 python3-dev python3-pip build-essential cmake pkg-config libssl-dev libffi-dev libhwloc-dev libboost-dev
3  pip3 install -U qrl
4  qrl wallet_gen
5  qrl -r --host 104.237.3.185 slave_tx_generate
6  mkdir .qrl
7  cp slaves.json .qrl/
8  start_qrl
Same problem
did you manage to fix this ?

I could not reproduce the problem. I will keep investigating.
It has been reported that it was possible to reproduce using Ubuntu via WSL in Windows 10
@jplomas: I've just tried installing in Windows 10 WSL (Ubuntu) and I could not reproduce the problem.
@GasGeverij I used identical compilers (gcc/g++), It seems unlikely is related to that. I should have had the same problem.
I will move to setting up an AWS machine as per @hdelatorre repro steps
Mine was on a vultr.com machine
So I've tested 0.62.4 in AWS
Instance-type: t2.micro
AMI ID: ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-20180222-d83d0782-cb94-46d7-8993-f4ce15d1a484-ami-ee4eac93.4 (ami-f6cef993)
Followed the instructions and it seems to be working well. I have not seen any core dump.
It is a tiny bit newer AMI but I dont think that is something significant.
Yeah cyy also indicated it works fine on AWS, rather not eveyone has a credit card.
It's something with vultr and probably virtual ocean since i think vultr is a resseler of dg.
I will try with vultr later today then.
Any specific configuration you would suggest me to try?
Not really, eveything was just updated, and qrl was pulled from source.
Fixed in theQRL/qryptonight#47.
The fix will be available in the next release.
@GasGeverij so I could reproduce the bug in a vultr host.
Oddly enough, it was not happening in the 1CPU+1024MB. I managed to have the crash in a 4CPU+8192MB host.
The fix will come with 0.63.x that is planned to be released in a few more days.
