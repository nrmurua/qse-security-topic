Parsing the default stdgates.inc fail at indexIdentifier because line 188 require rangeDefinition.
In the quantumGateDefinition -> quantumBlock -> quantumStatement -> quantumInstruction -> quantumGateCall -> indexIdentifierList -> indexIdentifier -> rangeDefinition
is a required field, but according to the explanation in the Hierarchically defined unitary gates, "The arguments in qargs cannot be indexed within the body of the gate definition."
So the rangeDefinition should not be used there.
Add ? behind the rangeDefinition in the grammar line 188 to allow non indexed identifier in the indexIdentifier.
Sorry, that is covered by line 189.
