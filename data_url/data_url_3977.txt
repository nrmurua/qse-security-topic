@imranashraf, when we had a meeting to discuss #146 we discussed classical logic with an example notebook. I have not documented all changes during the meeting as this document existed. I have not been able to  find these examples in the repository.
Could you add this document to the docs folder? (This is BLOCKING)

Hi @imranashraf , Thanks for adding this notebook. I'll be using it shortly.
I do have some other comments though (bear with me).
I see you closed this issue even though this is not yet merged into the master/release version. I think it is good practice to keep issues open until they are merged into a released version. This ensures that people experiencing similar problems can find the open issues.
On a more general note, I think that this notebook addresses my immediate need (and as such closes this issue). However,  looking for this I noticed a lack of general documentation. I'm mostly refereing to a general introduction into the concepts and answering questions such as what should and should not be included in a kernel object.
Agree, it got closed because of the commit message. This previously happened when it was merged to master. Now that develop is the default branch, commit message immediately closes the issue.
The documentation part can be taken care of in #167
