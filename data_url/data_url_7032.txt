Quirk uses floating point textures when simulating circuits. If creating floating point textures isn't supported, due to the OES_texture_float webgl extension webgl extension not being present, Quirk can't simulate circuits.
It's technically possible for me to fix this limitation, but it would require rewriting every gate's shader to manually pack/unpack its outputs/inputs into/from a byte texture. Which would be a huge hassle, and would affect performance.
Currently I don't plan to fix this issue. If you feel differently, this is the place to complain about it.
Here is the code Quirk uses to detect if this issue is present:
