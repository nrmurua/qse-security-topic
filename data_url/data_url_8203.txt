I am trying to use propagator in a for loop but after going through the loop 2-3 times, I get the the exception error (line 83). To make it run again I would have to restart the kernel which again would start giving me the same exception after iterating through the loop 2-3 times.
Thank @Vinay-Tripathi for the bug report, could you give us a minimal example to reproduce it? E..g
Could you also give us the information about your system by running
The error seems to occur only when I use matplotlib to make some plots before using the propagator. For example, if I implement the two blocks of code as shown below in the same order, I would get the error as shown. But if I remove the first block and implement only the second block, the error disappears (of course after restarting the kernel).
Block 1:

Block 2:

Are you running on OSX?  If so, this could be a known bug between multiprocessing and matplotlib for matplotlib 3.2. You can downgrade to 3.1 or upgrade to 3.3 (haven't personally validated 3.3 yet).
Yes, I am running on OS X. Thanks for the advice, it worked. I see that matplotlib 3.1.0 and 3.3.0 don't give any errors but anything in between would result into the error.
PS: I was using 3.1.3
Seems to be back with matplotlib 3.4.1 in my case - exactly same error, very annoying (from matplotlib's site).

This is also an error for me. Do I need to downconvert matplotlib for windows as well?
