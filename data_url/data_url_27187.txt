Hello,  I'd like to suggest adding a feature that is similar to Binder, where users will be able to launch the benchmarking notebooks and have pre-made python environments for running the notebooks as well. It only requires adding the launch on qbraid button in the following PR: #446 and users can select the QED-C benchmarking environments for the respective software frameworks such as cirq, qiskit, etc that is freely available on qbraid.
