The opflow tutorial (in this folder)
https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/tree/master/tutorials/operators
should include a discussion of PaulSumOp
This has only just been added and not yet released yet. But yes for the refactored opflow tutorials, based on the opflow now being in Terra for the next release, it would be good to include this in there along with other function such as the Z2Symmetry
opflow will be deprecated soon. And no one has jumped on this yet. I think it's safe to close this issue.
