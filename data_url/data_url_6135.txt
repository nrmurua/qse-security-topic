The MPS simulator should (eventually) be able to support majority of the instructions of the statevector simulator method. Currently tests for the MPS simulator are barebones, so I tried updating it to run the Statevector tests and found many failed or caused segment faults that were not caught by exceptions.
My testing found:
Tests:
Edited: tick for passing
Run the following (using the test_qasm_statevector_simulator.py file as example) commenting out to only execute one set of tests at a time.
Some apparent issues include:
Following the latest fixes (pending merge of PR #390 and #393), all tests pass but 2:
QasmMethodTests and QasmInitializeTests.
@merav-aharoni thats great! The method test isn't too important since we don't select the MPS method automatically, but we should figure out whats going wrong with the initializer.
I think we can close this issue since existing features are properly tested now, and can track features that need to be implemented in #391
