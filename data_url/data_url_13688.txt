Spinning this out from #188. I propose to use a website for the docs, like @andreamari proposed.
We could set up a mitiq-alpha or mitiq-docs or similar private repo in the unitary fund org, using it to build the documentation from the docs/ folder. This is necessary for one technical reason and one style reason. The technical reason is that one can build the GH pages only from the master root or master/docs folder. We are showing a precise version of mitiq, the alpha v. 0.1a1. For style, even if we can temporarily change the gitignore, we would need to upload the built html in the repo, which is probably not nice in a built one (I don't think we can have a populated build folder that does not get downloaded by users if we update the gitignore, it will just not sync with the local versions). This way, users would access the docs from a link in the Welcome_to_mitiq.ipynb in the JupyterHub environment, and the address will be somewhat official, unitaryfund.github.io/mitiq-alpha, or something like that.
We can decide what style to use, e.g., the pydata one.
We can add a zip version of the html in the JupyterHub my_shared_data folder.
We can tear down the website if needed, after the workshops.
I can investigate why the html did not render properly in JupyterLab, or if it is an expected behavior.
All your points seem reasonable to me, @nathanshammah .
The pydata looks good to me.
I wouldn't care too much about the html rendering inside JupyterLab.
Let's stick to https://nathanshammah.github.io/mitiq and then we'll have it on UF's website when it's public. Otherwise each time is stiff.
