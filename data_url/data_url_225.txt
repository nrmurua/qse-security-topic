On the Docker image installation page, we have:
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nightly/cuda-quantum:latest
which leads to the following error.
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/nightly/cuda-quantum:latest
Fix is
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda-quantum:latest
Not a regression
No response
Hi @poojarao8 - I am not able to replicate your Cannot connect to the Docker daemon error on my machine, and that looks like a local machine error rather than a server error. Here's what happens when I ran it just now:
The fix that you recommended is to pull the latest released cuda-quantum, which will be older than the nightly build.
Have you been able to replicate this error on more than 1 machine?
The issue is from a new user who was trying to pull the image on their windows machine. I currently don't have access to one so I couldn't reproduce it. Thanks!

Windows?
Yes!
@poojarao8 This is not a CUDA Quantum issue, but a using Docker on Windows issue; please install Docker Desktop, launch Docker Desktop, and then try again. Note that you need to make sure that Docker Desktop is launched every time the machine reboots; you could add it to the start up applications.
