I got this error message while running a 30-qubits Shor example with noise.
The problem happened during the first measurement.
The 29-qubits code is still running.
Here attached the code.

@GoGoKo699 I had a chat with @stavros11, and we believe you are running on the dgx qibo env, where we have installed a development branch. I will create a separate account for you so we avoid this issues in the future, and install everything from master or pip.
Ok, thank you!
