For 0.6.0dev, c is a cirq.Circuit() and m is a cirq.Moment().
new_c = c[:j] + m + c[j:] works well without error, but
new_c = m +  c[:j] + c[j:] shows error like:
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Moment' and 'Circuit'
Could you please add this feature or is it intended?
Currently, I'm just using a hack like: cirq.Circuit(m1) + c[:j] + m2 + c[j:], which looks unhappy.
Circuit is missing an __radd__ method that will fix this. We can and definitely should put this in.
Thanks a lot
