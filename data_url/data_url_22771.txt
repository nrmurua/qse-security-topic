move_home is blocking
move_jog(direction, async=False) has blocking option
move_absolute() does not have blocking option
move_relative() does not have blocking option
All those are now blocking since 4d077f5
The only motor-moving and non-blocking call is move_velocity() which just moves the motor in one direction until you call move_stop().
I let this issue open until you test it and ack it works as expected.
Blocking as default is good.
As a note for the future, I can imagine a few situations where you want to start a move to a certain point and then abort or override it with a different target. With fire-and-forget I suspect you can not abort a blocking move. If those situations come up, I would propose adding either a state to the driver that determines blocking behavior or add the async keyword argument back back in.
Tested working.
