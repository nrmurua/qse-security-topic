Printing a circuit looks very dull and boring. Is there a way to make the circuits look a little nicer with colors and shapes when printed or drawn like in qiskit?
The reason I am asking for this feature is because I have a blog where I write about quantum computing and I would like to add code examples written using cirq. If there is a way to make circuits look nice, I will use cirq in my blog.
What is the urgency from your perspective for this issue? Is it blocking important work?
P3 - I'm not really blocked by it, it is an idea I'd like to discuss / suggestion based on principle
Hey @chitramdasgupta,
You can draw nicer looking diagrams than the ones you get from printing the circuits if you have Jupyter notebook

@chitramdasgupta I just filed https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/16521/in-cirq-how-do-you-display-circuit-diagrams-that-are-prettier-than-the-ones-d. Please re-open this issue if you have more questions.
