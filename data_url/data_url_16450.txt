When we bind a large value to a custom gate, the value appears as -pi/0 in the drawer output.
output
The value will be shown in scientific notation such as %.2e.
This is important to represent a custom pulse gate which has a parametrized modulation frequency.
Ok I should be able to fix this
But one question, how does the %.2e represent 1e9? And may I ask why you would want to add a list of a billion values to a gate?
It seems like a pi_check problem:
Hi @metacubestormerxii12 , thank you very much for taking this issue. The motivation of adding such large value comes from pulse module. Currently we are trying to represent a pulse schedule by a gate and this will enables us to seamlessly integrate pulse program with existing circuit library.
As you may know, some parameters of pulse, such as frequency in GHz, can take very large value, thus we need to show this value correctly. Scientific notation is convenient to compactly show values to fit in with the gate symbol in the circuit drawer. Perhaps we can add this formatter, i.e. %.2e, to stylesheet so that user can customize.
OK thank you @nkanazawa1989 and @1ucian0 . I will take a look into the pi_check function.
@metacubestormerxii12 Are you working on this?
I'm sorry guys, my computer broke and I could only get its parts like a day ago. Thank you for taking this over!
