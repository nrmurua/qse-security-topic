We need a means of checking whether any servo channel/profile has railed, and also of logging the IIR input/outputs over time (e.g. to watch for head room slowly decreasing due to fibre coupling efficiency degrading over time or whatever).
The way I'd imagine doing this (comments welcome) is:
That implementation has a couple issues. It would require a lot of restructuring, it doesn't fit the memory layout, the pipelining would suffer, the cycle length would increase. It would need 3282+2*8 words (~16 bit) storage. And it's really tricky to get the clearing and readout working given the collisions. And there are a couple conceptual issues as well. PI ringing can give you transient clips that would be false positive. Usually you'd want to know whether it rails at certain times. With the latching min max you'd have to interact twice with the phy to clear and then later to read them.
Let's think about what's already there and what we can do easily to enable your use case.
Right now you can read out the ADC and ASF (iir x and y) at any time and decide whether it is good or bad and decide about changing gains and attenuators. You can log that and build a gui on top of it with the available tooling in artiq.
I can add a clear-on-read railed indicator to the output channels (but not per profile). That should allow you to detect transient clips if you need that and to to detect any other problems caused by railing or drifting things.
@jordens thanks for the feedback. Points taken.

That works for me. @cjbe?

@jordens sounds good to me.
