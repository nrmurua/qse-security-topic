I'm working with tensorcircuit to build my quantum circuit and I've notice than we can use projector from tensorcircuit.quantum and it will return a QuOperator object which represent an operator in tensor network form. However, I can't figure out how to apply this porjector to my circuit. I think perhaps I need to represent my circuit in tensor network form. But I can't find relevent functions.
Can anybody please tell me how I can represent my tc.Circuit class circuit to as a tensor network? Many thanks!
say if you have c = tc.Circuit(n),  then c.quvector() is enough to extract the circuit as a tensor network in the format of QuVector
Thanks a lot!
