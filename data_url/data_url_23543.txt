If a parameter with no get_cmd has a value step>0, the ramping function fails and never recovers. The warning message says the intended behavior is the value will jump, but in reality the value is not changed at all.
Run the following snippet
The assumption is that in some actual instrument driver set_x would set the value, but getting the value is not possible due to limitations in the instrument.
The first call to set (from initial_value) would jump, since the state of the instrument is not knowable, but subsequent calls ramp as normal, since the current state is known from the cache of x.
The expected output would be:
Neither call to set ever ends up calling set_x
Actual output:
get_ramp_values should return [value] if the current value is None. Currently it returns []

@caspar-iqm thanks for reporting the issue. This should have been fixed by #2128
As a work around until the next release is out you may be able to use initial_cache_value rather than initial_value if you know the value that the instrument starts up with when you connect to it. That way qcodes internal knowlege of the value of the parameter will match the parameter
