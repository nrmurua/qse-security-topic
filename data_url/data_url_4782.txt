Edit: We could add the circuit_spec attribute to BaseBackend, which is either None or a str containing the short_name of the CircuitSpec to use when compiling for that backend.
I'm in favour of this approach, as it decouples the CircuitSpecs from the backends, and allows more flexibility (and also removes the need for redundant spec classes such as TFSpecs).
For example, a future high performance Fock backend could simply specify that circuit_spec = "fock", without needing to create a new redundant copy of FockSpec.
Perhaps we could even provide a list of allowed circuit specs, along with a default. For example, the Gaussian backend could have
