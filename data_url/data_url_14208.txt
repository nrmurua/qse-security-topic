It seems UnitaryGate.control is producing higher gate counts than is necessary. The implementation is currently using Isometry for the definition but should probably switch to qs_decomposition.  Using qs_decomposition may also help with resolve issue #10311.
Would you be able to make a PR doing the switch-over in implementation, Erick?  It seems like a sensible synthesis switch for 0.25, if you've got time.
Yes
