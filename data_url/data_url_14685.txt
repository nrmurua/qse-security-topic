Qiskit pulse enables users to add their custom calibrations to a quantum circuit through add_calibration.  These calibrations can outperform digital CNOT gates depending on the gate parameters. However, adding them in a systematic way is not yet available. By leveraging the functionality introduced through #5521, #5259, #5396 it should be possible to write transpiler passes to match templates and replace them with user defined calibration schedules.
