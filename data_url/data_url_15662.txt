QuantumCircuit(2,0) raise exception below. Expected behaviour same as QuantumCircuit(2).
This has already been addressed in #6800 and works in Terra 0.19:
Are you using the most recent version of Terra @cahalibor? ðŸ™‚
In fairness, Terra 0.19 was released only the day before this issue was made, so it's just one of those coincidences that we'd fixed it right as you made this issue.  No worries - I'll close this now as "already fixed", but feel free to open more if you're still having problems.
Thanks.
