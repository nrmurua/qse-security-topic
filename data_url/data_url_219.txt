For a particular application, we would like to do the following:
ie we would like to do -theta/8 and theta/8 as a parameter to a gate.
The workarounds for this is to define 2 thetas, perform all the operations outside and pass them in
however for optimisation cases when we want the optimizer to only consider one value and proceed, defining 2 separate values does not work and will stray the intended optimisation procedure.
The question is how do we manipulate operations at the quake level?
Thanks team

If the division operator is not implemented in the Python bindings, then it should be added as soon as possible.
A better workaround for this problem is to just use multiplication - kernel.rx((1./8.)*theta[0], qubits[0])
Can confirm the above works
