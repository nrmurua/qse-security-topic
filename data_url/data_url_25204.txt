Executors currently return the QElectron DB to the Covalent server by appending the base64-encoded database to the task's stdout. This stdout is then postprocessed in-memory to strip out the database into a separate object. This is a stopgap measure for speed of initial development but is not ideal in the long term. Reasons include:
We should revisit how we are transferring the QElectron DB back to Covalent.
Since the Asset management has been introduced to develop now as part of memory improvements changes, we should add the Qelectron DB as an asset instead.
