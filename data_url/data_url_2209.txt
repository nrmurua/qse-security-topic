The repro code below constructs a QAOA circuit and then tries to route it on a device 100 times, printing some output before each attempt. It prints up to Attempt 1 and then hangs.
Now that it is possible to seed the routing code, I've updated the repro in the opening post so that it is deterministic and hangs after printing Attempt 1.
@bryano any ideas?
