Description of the issue
It would be great if we could cancel previous Gtihub Action workflow runs on the same branch on newly pushed commits. This could save us some parallel job capacity, when there are a lot of PRs in progress in parallel.
A way could be by using https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cancel-workflow-action for each job.
