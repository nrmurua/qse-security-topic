Issue
Currently, to develop qutip from source (e.g., installing from)the installation guide says to do
However, it is suggested to use the command
This currently is not supported as there is no development_requirements.txt file. Also, in dev mode, one needs to install pytest, otherwise the qt.run() fails. If pytest as well as cython numpy and scipy were specified in such file, this should be done automatically.
Additionally, it may be ideal to pin only minor versions with tilde, stuff like  numpy~=1.18.1, which should update micro releases but not minor.
Describe the solution you'd like
Add a development_requirements.txt file and in setup add
the set option should be needed for how pypi wants it given.
Add tildes pinning.
This issue is mostly obseleted by the merging of #1465, since the complete build structure is now different.  In that we didn't necessarily implement the complete change requested here (we don't have pytest as a requirement), but we do have the PEP-517-approved way of fully specifying build requirements, so getting a correct build environment is automated.
I will note that pip install -e . doesn't play very nicely with packages with Cython components to build; at the time of writing, pip would tend to install dependencies and perform the build in a venv regardless of what was installed in the activated Python environment (especially if conda), which meant that the complete set of Cython files needed to be re-compiled every time this command was run.  That's fine if you just want to edit the Python files, but setup.py develop would correctly remember which Cython files actually needed to be re-compiled, so remains much more useful for low-level QuTiP development for practical purposes right now.
