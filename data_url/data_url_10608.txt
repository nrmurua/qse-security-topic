Currently the SampleSet returned by the DWaveSampler contains information in the info field. E.g.
the docs for the DWaveSampler should explain where to find this list. Right now it only contains timing so perhaps should link to timing-related fields?
The most common occurrence of this for me is the following.  I want to access a specific field in a SampleSet returned from sample_qubo.  I go to the documentation for sample_qubo (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/dimod/en/latest/reference/generated/dimod.Sampler.sample_qubo.html#dimod.Sampler.sample_qubo)  and see that a SampleSet is returned.  I click on SampleSet (https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/projects/dimod/en/latest/reference/sampleset.html#dimod.SampleSet) and can't find the information I want about accessing the qpu_access_time or any of the other sampler specific fields.  I end up running my program and printing out the entire SampleSet object to see what each field is named and what's there, then rerun my program to get that item.
