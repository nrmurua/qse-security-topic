Serializing + deserializing a circuit containing an empty gate (i.e. no operations) with QPY yields a gate where the definition is None instead of an empty circuit. If the definition is None the transpiler cannot decompose the gate, unless the gate is in the basis set (like e.g. x or cx are).
This is a problem in particular for Qiskit runtime as users might unintentionally construct circuits that contain empty gates, as e.g. was the case in qiskit-community/qiskit-nature#449.
produces
The gate should have a definition which is an empty circuit instead of being just None.

This seems pretty fixable without a QPY format bump.  It's our old friend bool causing problems here: QPY decides if it needs to output a definition based on bool(instruction.definition), but bool(empty) is False because QuantumCircuit defines __len__ as a pass through to the number of operations, and bool essentially tries len(x) != 0.
Pretty sure I can fix this no problems, and it'll be stable for backport.
