In the file test_cc_light.py, there is the following test case:
In the file hardware_config_cc_light.json, the cycle time is 5 ns and the duration of prepz/prepx operation is 40 (clock or ns?):

By executing this code, the output of OpenQL is:
In this case, the interval between the starting points of the prepz operations and x and h operations is 20 cycles. However, 40 is expected here (assuming the duration is 40 clocks).
It is important to notice that: seen from the eQASM program, the cycle time used in CC-Light will be 20 ns.
@gtaifu i can update the cycle time to 20 ns. Do you have a document somewhere listing the durations of cc-light instructions?
@Nader-Khammassi can you please clarify the unit of the number used for duration?
@gtaifu I fixed the issue in cclight_eqasam_compiler branch. The output now looks like:
is this correct now?
@gtaifu @imranashraf rereading this issue this seems a duplicate of #54 .
The correct resolution would be to use ns as time unit in the config file and the cycle_time parameter from the config as the conversion factor as is described in #54 .
Done. Here is an example of generated QISA:
and corresponding TQISA:
