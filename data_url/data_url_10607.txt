Description
TilingComposite should define the order it returns samples from the target graph so that doesn't change and break compatibility between versions. I wasted time under the impression that the samples are returned ordered as a series of tiles per reads but actually it turns out it returns all samples of each tile per tile.
Maybe also add markers to the response

I think this is because the way we find the tiles is not deterministic. I assume that for a single instantiated tiling composite sampler the order will be consistent.
Anyway, making it deterministic does seem useful.
I took a closer look and realized that I am not sure what the expected behaviour is.
The method to find the tiles is deterministic (link).
And it uses dimod.concatenate which simply stacks the responses. So with num_reads=2
What is is you would prefer to see?
It would have been more natural to me to see:
tile0, sample0
tile1, sample0
tile0, sample1
tile1, sample1
But the current way is fine too. My concern now is just to clarify the behavior so it doesn't change and break the JN. Thanks!
