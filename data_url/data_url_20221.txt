@dstebila Please see PQClean/PQClean#283 (comment) and the comment made there (regarding "pqclean_shim.c": I did not find that in liboqs, so am at a loss what to make of this).
As you seem to have been involved on the PQClean PR that introduced this change as well as the original liboqs copy scripts, can you suggest how to resolve this within liboqs?
When using the latest PQClean code PQClean algs don't compile any more with this error:
Thanks in advance for any suggestion/fix if that's straightforward for you. Otherwise I try to find a solution myself (although I prefer to close out issue #691 first).
Yup, I'll take care of it.
Sorry, I meant https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/tree/master/src/common/pqclean_shims
