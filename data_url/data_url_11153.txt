Explained in this 2005 paper by Verstraete and Cirac, it is possible to transform local fermion Hamiltonians on a lattice in D dimensions into local spin Hamiltonians on a lattice in D dimensions. Myself and others I've spoken with recently, including @dabacon, would love to play around with this mapping. So it would be great to have it implemented in OpenFermion. This project would be a great introduction to OpenFermion but requires that one has enough physics background to get through the paper.
I implemented the transformation on 2-d square grids with an even number of columns, in transforms/_verstraete_cirac.py. However, I can still think of some things to do:
