Hi all,
First than all, thanks a lot for your contributions to the QCoDeS project. It is my first time using VISA and without this project I'd be totally lost.
I have an AWG5202 with the DDR (2x interpolation) option available and I'd like to add it as a parameter to the AWG driver.

As the documentation states, this option only works with the NRZ or the RZ DAC mode. I thought about adding something like:
self.add_parameter('ddr',
label='DDR (2x interpolation) enabled',
get_cmd=f'SOURce{channel}:DDR?',
set_cmd=f'SOURce{channel}:DDR {{}}',
val_mapping={'ON': 1,
'OFF': 0})
But, which could be the most elegant way to add the command:
SOURCe{channel}:DMODE NRZ/RZ
in order to effectively activate the DDR?
Otherwise, we could add a Warning/Error if DDR option was not successfully activated, but it is not clear to me how to do it.
Thank you in advance for hour help. I tried to search some mention about the feature in previous issues, but it seems it has not been treated yet.
I succeded implementing a setter function. I put it here below if at any time is useful for someone:
Thanks again
