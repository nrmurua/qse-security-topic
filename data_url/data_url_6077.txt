Calling HamiltonianModel.from_dict(hamiltonian) with the dictionary in hamiltonian['h_str'] containing an empty string causes an exception in file oppparse.py, HamiltonianParser._token2qobj() since variable tokens is empty and the line return stack[0] runs with an empty stack list.
Either in the indicated function or in its caller parse(), handle empty tokens (None is already handled).
