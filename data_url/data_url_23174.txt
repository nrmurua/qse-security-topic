at least in not-latest-one -> to be tested!
Problem solved (after testing by hand)
Actually, one of the problems here is that I don't dare to include unittests involving the curvedb module because I am not sure the dummy curvedb package mimicks exactly the pyinstruments library that is installed on the lab computers. In particular, I think it should be CurveDB.objects.get(id=999) rather than CurveDB.get(999)... In principle that can be solved easily, but we should probably not loose too much time on that now if we decide to migrate soon towards a full blown curvedb system inside pyrpl anyways.
