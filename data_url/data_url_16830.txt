the visualization functions plot_gate_map  and plot_circuit_layout do not draw an image if you select 'ibmq_16_melbourne' as the backend. They work correctly for other backends.
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram, plot_gate_map, plot_circuit_layout
from qiskit.tools.monitor import job_monitor
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
backend = provider.get_backend('ibmqx2')
plot_gate_map(backend, plot_directed=True)
draws

backend = provider.get_backend('ibmq_16_melbourne')
draws

The same issue for
from qiskit.compiler import transpile
new_circ_lv0 = transpile(circuit, backend=provider.get_backend('ibmqx2'), optimization_level=0)
plot_circuit_layout(new_circ_lv0, backend)
draws

and provider.get_backend('ibm_16_melbourne') draws

This is a known issue caused by a recent change in the coupling map of melbourne (adding a 15th qubit). It has been fixed on master with #3677 and has been backported to stable/0.11 (see #3679) and will be included in a 0.11.1 bugfix release.
I'm going to close this issue since it has already been fixed. If I'm missing something please feel free to reopen.
I just wanted to add my version info
{'qiskit-terra': '0.11.0',
'qiskit-aer': '0.3.4',
'qiskit-ignis': '0.2.0',
'qiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.4.4',
'qiskit-aqua': '0.6.1',
'qiskit': '0.14.0'}
thank you. I'll wait for the fix.
