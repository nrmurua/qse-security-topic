MacOS 10.15.7, Xcode-12.4, current master.
How do I configure the build to exclude algorithms?
Weird.
To disable it temporarily, you can use cmake -DOQS_ENABLE_KEM_CLASSIC_MCELIECE=OFF as per https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/wiki/Customizing-liboqs.
@jschanck Any idea what might have gone wrong in #932?

Thank you! As I don't really need McEliece, this will work for me.
Also, when I add to src/kem/classic_mceliece/CMakeLists.txt file the following code (to attempt compiling .S files with YASM instead of Clang):
the following command gets into infinite loop with the following repeating output:
In short, McEliece and it's CMakeLists.txt appear to be screwed up.
This is fixed by PQClean/PQClean@6f22c50. It will trickle down to liboqs when we pull the latest PQClean for #937.
