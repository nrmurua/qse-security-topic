#7643 implemented mocked IBM Quantum Systems backends using the new BackendV2 interface.
However, noisy simulation of pulse job using FakeBackendV2 is not possible because Aer doesn't support generating PulseSystemModel from V2 backends yet. This issue has been raised in Aer: Qiskit/qiskit-aer#1478 and is slated to be fixed in Aer 0.11.0. After Aer adds support for BackendV2, we should revert the changes done in this commit 68fef20 to allow pulse simulation.
