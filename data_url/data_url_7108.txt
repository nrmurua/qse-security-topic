Computing a density matrix from the full superposition basically amounts to a matrix adjoint-squaring. The matrix has a column for each kept-value configuration and a row for each not-kept-value configuration, so it usually ends up highly rectangular (many more rows than columns).
Currently the code computes the density matrix by doing the full matrix multiplication in a single shader by nesting as many loops as necessary. This is probably the wrong approach. It's unclear if using a fold-based approach would be better, or if computationsof the mixed state of each wire can be overlayed in a useful way. Investigate.
This is done, for single-qubit density matrices and it's fast-enough up to 16 qubits on my machine.  The rest is deferred for when multi-qubit density displays are added.
