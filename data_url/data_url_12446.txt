Hi,
After completing this tutorial, I noticed that the quantum neural network model is not simulated using anything. How can I do that ?
It is simulated, what gives the impression it isn't?
Can you tell me at what point is the quantum neural network simulated ?
I can't see cirq.Simulator initialized anywhere.
Every time the model is executed (in training or testing) simulation occurs. The PQC layer manages this simulation.
Ohh okay, I understand now. Thank you!
