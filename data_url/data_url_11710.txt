Current status:
In qiskit/aqua/utils/measurement_error_mitigation.py
get_measured_qubits(transpiled_circuits)
get_measured_qubits_from_qobj(qobj)
The function checks whether all circuits in transpiled_circuits resp. qobj have the same mapping from qubits to cbits. If the mapping is different the error mitigation fails for HW-backends.
Expected behavior:
Enable posterior reshuffling of the mapping of the error mitigation matrix to accomodate for the above mentioned behavior.
Example:
If you want to generate a family of circuits with equivalent registers but e.g. two controlled gates which are different you cannot run them in one QuantumInstance.execute with error mitigation but have to split it into more QuantumInstance.execute runs which generates an overhead in queueing.
