Describe the bug
When the openqasm IR includes #pragma braket result expectation z($0) @ z($1), Circuit.from_ir throws error line 1:28 no viable alternative at input 'z($0'.
This error only happens to physical qubits. When using observables on virtual qubits, there is no error.
To reproduce
Expected behavior
Returns a Braket circuit that represents the QASM program above.

System information
A description of your system. Please provide:
amazon-braket-algorithm-library 1.2.0
amazon-braket-default-simulator 1.20.1
amazon-braket-pennylane-plugin  1.12.2
amazon-braket-schemas           1.19.1.post0
amazon-braket-sdk               1.65.2.dev0
Python version**: 3.10.9
Physical qubits and verbatim boxes are not currently supported; we'll need to add the stubs to the default simulator and implement them here.
