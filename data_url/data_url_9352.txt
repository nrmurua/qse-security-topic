In the current documentation, we don't have a references section for API now. Instead, API references are embedded in each manual page. Right now, some pages have some references, but others do not. I think it would be better if we make it a little more consistent, by carefully choosing those we want to expose and should be exposed.
I don't think this is necessary, some sections just don't have any extra APIs, let's just open PRs to add new ones or add new reference sections whenever you spot a missing docstring, I don't see this issue is operational in this regard.
