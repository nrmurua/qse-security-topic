quick fix is just setting the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. But we should get this properly fixed in cmake. @tnguyen-ornl have you seen this on your mac machine?
I can build and run XACC okay on my Mac. I'm currently using the gcc compiler, not sure if it's relevant.
@amccaskey After upgrading my MacOS to Catalina, I've seen this Library not loaded: @rpath/libantlr4-runtime.SOVERSION.dylib error.
My fix was to add the following to xacc/tpls/antlr/runtime/CMakeLists.txt
Hi @amccaskey I am facing the same issue when running ctest after I built xacc with gcc on my MacOS (Big Sur). I tried the above solution (adding those lines to the end of xacc/tpls/antlr/runtime/CMakeLists.txt) but that didn't help for me. Do I need to rebuild after that change? You mentioned that the quick fix is to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. What should I set it to?
Hey @mcubeddu, you would need to run make rebuild_cache and make install again to see the effect of adding those lines.
But the quick fix would be to export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/.xacc/lib (note I'm assuming you installed to the default location, if you provided CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to cmake, then make sure you point to that path)
Sorry to bother you. I did both those things (rebuild cache, make install, and the quick fix export), and am no longer getting errors related to dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libantlr4-runtime.SOVERSION.dylib when running ctest --output-on-failure, but tests are still failing for me and I'm not sure how to debug given most of the Exception descriptions are empty
what does
print?
with --verbose flag I get
sorry, add -V as well. Also, would you like to join the slack? would be easier to quickly chat for these type of things
that would be great! can you invite me at mcubeddu@aliroquantum.com
