DOcplex translator generates a wrong qubit operator in a particular case.
The expected result is x = 1 and y = 1; but, the actual result is x = 0 and y = 1. This result does not satisfy the constraint x == y.
The cause of the issue is the constraint mdl.add_constraint(x == y). If we replace it with mdl.add_constraint(x - y == 0), it outputs the correct result.
See gist for details.
Need to check the transformation of constraints.

FYI. The above code sample needs a small change to work on master
from qiskit.aqua.translators.ising import docplex to from qiskit.optimization.ising import docplex as various logic has now been refactored out into domain folders, since the last stable release, as was done for chemistry in the past.
I found the root cause of the bug. I'll work on fixing it.
@a-matsuo @t-imamichi Is this still open or has it been fixed?
Thank you. @a-matsuo is working on it. It will be fixed soon.
In the current implementation, all variables have to go to the left side of an equation and all constants have to go to the right side of the equation. It's the root cause. To support constraints such as (x=y), I'm working on it.
