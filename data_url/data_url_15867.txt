When the number_to_keep argument is added to qiskit.visualization.plot_histogram([data0, data1]), the resulting states will be misaligned between the two results.
Produces (using qiskit-terra 0.16.1)
(number_to_keep undefined)

(number_to_keep = 5)

Note that the states for 0b11000 are near-identical, and they match up in the first image, but not in the second.
Every bar in the number_to_keep plot should be aligned with the accompanying state in the other set of states.
At a brief debugging glance, it seems that the issue is likely due to state-accounting logic when reducing the number of states in _plot_histogram_data(): https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/blob/1270f7c8ad85cbcfbab2564f1288d39d97672744/qiskit/visualization/counts_visualization.py#L246-L290.
There seem to have been some recent changes to histogram plotting (#6390), but none that touch the counter dict logic, so this should still be valid.
Maybe returning the set of pruned labels from _plot_histogram_data() would help.
ping @nonhermitian, he seems to have refactored the _plot_histogram_data() most recently
This issue is related to #7461. I considered the case in #7481. Will check this specific case again.
After PR#7481 we get a good alignment:
