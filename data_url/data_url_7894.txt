Describe the issue
I am using the EnhancedTextProgressBar to track progress of an mesolve calculation in a jupyter notebook. Sometimes it works as expected; occasionally (it doesn't seem to be deterministic), I get an extra progress after the updating progress bar that does not delete, so that when the mesolve is complete, I see this:
[Total run time:   2.55s] Elapsed 2.55s / Remaining 00:00:00:00[*****70%       ] Elapsed 1.79s / Remaining 00:00:00:00
Instead of just
[Total run time:   2.55s] Elapsed 2.55s / Remaining 00:00:00:00
If I run the same thing repeatedly, sometimes I'll get the extra status (at different elapsed times), sometimes I'll get two extras, sometimes I'll get none. The longer the calculation takes, the more likely it is that I'll get one or more of these, it seems.
This is not a super huge problem, but just curious if there's any way to fix it!
Thanks,
Emma
