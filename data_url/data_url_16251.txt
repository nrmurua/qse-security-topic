When drawing the complete circuit with a user-defined name, say "gate", then when drawing with the text backend, the circuit renders the name "gate" on the relevant portion of the circuit. However, when drawing with matplotlib, the particular portion of the circuit shows "Gate" i.e. it capitalizes the first character of the name.
For example,
Output:
Doing the same with matplotlib
Output:

Both the backends must either render the name of the gate as defined by the user i.e. case-sensitive or both must capitalize the name. In my opinion, the former seems reasonable.
I'm willing to work on this issue.
