PR #249 is merged to master, and I have closed #133. As suggested in #133, the next step is to make sure that packaging is not affected by future development.
When adding these, we should take note that tests with an installed copy of qflexcirq may misbehave if run under the same directory as a qflex git repo (e.g. giving false positives due to importing from the repo instead of the installed module).
Now that qsim is public, its install tests may be a good reference point for this.
