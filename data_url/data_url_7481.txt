I'm trying to calculate the Jacobian for an example that is very similar to simple_example.jl from QuAlgorithmZoo.jl.
If I modify simple_example.jl such that the return value is a single element array then calculating Jacobian like below
returns (nothing, ) while calculating the gradient on a scalar output works.
I suspect this has something to do with the way jacobian is implemented (this is written in the Zygote doc "For arguments of any type except Number & AbstractArray, the result is nothing."), however, I don't know what to do about it.
Thanks for reporting the issue. You do not need chainrules_patch.jl anymore in the latest Yao. Now you should define the loss function in a different (more natural) way
If you have an output with many outputs, you should use the ForwardDiff, it works good.
In practise, you just compare their performance and pick a better one. The larger the output dimension, the worse the Zygote works.
