The wallet_secret only shows:
Wallet Address  : 010600157269b89997954299fbd2e5e37e3b9274b646cfdc6a97666ee7d4320aa808727465ce7c
Mnemonic        : .....
Hexseed         : .....
There needs to be a Q in front of the address
Hexseed also doesn't have a Q, not sure if it's supposed to have one.
Hexseed never have Q in it. But yes we are missing prepending Q while showing wallet Address. Basically its an UI issue, which will be fixed in upcoming version.
Fixed in PR #988
will be released in v0.61.4 with other fixes.
