This would generalize the fix introduced in dwavesystems/dwave-system#201
Upon closer inspection of the cloud-client's sample_ising function, it looks like 0 biases are treated as active except in the case of missing qubits. In that case I think it's better to maintain the current behaviour and update the fix in dwavesystems/dwave-system#201 to match the cloud client.
