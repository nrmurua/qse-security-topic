Originally mentioned in #1055
An instance of pi is not defined correctly in the code under the examples section of the U3Gate documentation.

The problem can be found here under the examples section:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.circuit.library.U3Gate.html
Pi should display as its correct symbol rather than "pi"
Add the missing backslash in front of "pi" in the lambda input variable of the example

I have fixed this issue and will have a pull request for the updated code ready soon.
