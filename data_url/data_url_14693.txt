Often times, all the circuits in a job should have the same cals. To add identical calibrations to every circuit in a job, the user currently has two options.
Here, we convert the circuit to a schedule and send a regular PulseQobj. This is a less efficient representation.
We want to still send a QasmQobj, but we want to supply the calibration only once per job to populate job.config.calibrations. This can be supported as a new argument to the assembler. Combining the above strategies, I would propose this:
First, inst_map should be accepted by assemble. It can then be added to RunConfig. In assemble_circuits.py, after the line experiments, calibrations = _extract_common_calibrations(experiments), the common cals (i.e. calibrations in this line) should be updated with those supplied by inst_map.
This sketch may (or may not) be helpful:
