I needed to parametrise the global phase and the parameter did not show up in circuit.parameters.
example 1: parameter is not present in ParameterView
example 2: parameter is not present in ParameterView either
produces
where is Parameter(x) in ParameterView?
Possible workarounds...
workaround 1
workaround 2
both render correct results now
but in cases of problems 1 & 2 this should also be the output. Solutions needed!
This is actually expected behavior since QuantumCircuit.parameters only tracks unbound parameters. If you would like to maintain a copy of the bound and unbound circuit you would do,
in which case bound_circuit will not have Parameter(x) while circuit still will.
