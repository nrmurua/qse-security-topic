Construction of Schedule using append should be much faster.
Currently, it takes 34s (273s) for constructing a schedule with 2000 (4000) instructions. Those are  measured by create_random_appended_schedule(100, 20) (200, 20) using the following code:
For drastic speed up, we may need a lot of refactoring, but I think we can improve the performance somewhat by a small modification.
I'm tackling this issue.
Do you think it makes sense to add some pulse benchmarks for cases like this to the asv benchmark suite? https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/master/test/benchmarks If so we can track the performance of these operations over time at https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit/
Yes, I think it makes sense to add something like this as a benchmark. We will likely be refactoring the module soon, so it would be great to see how performance tracks.
@taalexander @lcapelluto can this be closed since #2995 has merged?
Yes, Closing via #2995.
