Describe the bug
Measuring density matrices with more than 6 qubits using any Tensorflow backend leads to an einsum error. Thanks @AdrianPerezSalinas for finding this.
To Reproduce
gives
Additional context
Einsum is used here to calculate the probability distribution from the density matrix, by tracing out unmeasured qubits. Numpy backends do not have this issue.
