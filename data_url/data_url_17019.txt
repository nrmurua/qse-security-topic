A single qubit circuit of Rx(pi/2)X|0> produces different state vector vs Rx(pi/2)U3(pi,0,pi)|0>, which supposedly should be identical.
Qiskit 0.11.0 does not have this behavior.
The two state vectors produced should be identical.
Track global phase properly for all unitary gates.
This issue is described in #3083.
