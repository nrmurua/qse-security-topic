Hello,
I tried to solve
// Exercise 2.
operation GlobalPhaseI (q : Qubit) : Unit is Adj+Ctl {
// ...
}
with this code
}
And I got this result
Apply
Measured and observed (One).
Measured and observed (One).
Measured and observed (Zero).
Measured and observed (One).
Measured and observed (One).
Measured and observed (Zero).
Measured and observed (One).
Measured and observed (Zero).
Measured and observed (One).
Measured and observed (One).
Measured and observed (Zero).
Is it true and is there a way to write shorter ?
