installation of tensorflow_quantum was working last week, but now kiwisolver is taking an incredibly long time to load. This is the case for the tensorflow quantum MNIST example .
Is there a specific kiwisolver version that could be patch this?
Resolved on google colab after pip upgrade... silly me!
