When transferring files and returning the results as a list / tuple / dict, we get an error saying:
The UI shows the following:

Add a train.csv and test.csv in the login node in beehive under your account. Accordingly replace the filepaths in the example workflow shown below.
The iterables should be unpacked without any errors. Also, note that for a non-iterable return, there is no issue.
It's possible that during L218 of electron.py, particularly in def __iter__() when consructing the electron we copy the metadata self.metadata.copy() which would also include the callbefore & callafter deps with return value keys defined, which would in turn try to inject the files kwarg. We may want to disable this for internally generated electrons or figure out a way to make the injected keywords optional.

PR #965 might be relevant here.
