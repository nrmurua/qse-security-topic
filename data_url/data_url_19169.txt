We've discussed with @ingoroth and @wilkensJ the possibility of creating a separate class for a Clifford gate in Qibo.
An object of such a class can be initialised by specifying an element of the Pauli group and also an element from the symplectic group. The algorithm is described in the paper How to efficiently select an arbitrary Clifford group element.
Example: to get an X gate as a Clifford element one need to specify the 0th element of the symplectic group and "x" Pauli element
The other solution would be to use indices corresponding to Clifford elements and displaying the group in the documentation
However, this solution is less efficient for n-qubit Cliffords.
