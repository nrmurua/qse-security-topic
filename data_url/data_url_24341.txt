Why is it deleting and disconnecting? Track this problem
pinfo should NOT be getting overwritten, maybe set breakpoint
See notebook demo
Attempting solution:
make pinfo a property

Finding that the problem seems to be that the COM interface gets deleted

The current main branch does not have the method open_ansys_design().  The method has been deprecated. The method is not in the Metal code and not in the notebooks within guide.
Also ran the notebook in guide/6 Analysis/Eigenmode and EPR.  The plot_convergence() method did not produce errors described in this issue.
Want to connect issue #198 with this issue.
I converted the notebook from guide/6 Analysis/Eigenmode and EPR to a script and ran in VS code on main branch.  I removed the ipython commands, the hfss.open_ansys() method,  and did NOT run the cell which is optional.  The optional cell is repeated below.
RESULT:
The notebook converted to script ran in vscode, with no com errors, after hfss.plot_convergences().
When I run the jupyter notebook, on the 3rd occurrence of plot_convergence(),  I got the error.

However, I am able to continue running the cells and results appear to be as expected.
This issue is part of #198
