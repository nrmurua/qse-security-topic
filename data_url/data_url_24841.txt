Qubit objects(?) should bundle all the information relevant for a physical (or simulated) qubit, e.g. associated hardware, parameters for control pulses, other qubits to which it can couple, a qubit model.
Qubit objects should interface with pulse objects, e.g. to provide parameters for pulses, allow the implementation of algorithms in terms of qubits. Somehow, calibration measurements (that will change  a lot over time) must be executable for qubits and groups of qubits.
Note: The legacy code (pulsecontrol) is not qubit-aware at all.
Out of scope of qupulse
