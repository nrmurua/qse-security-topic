Hi guys,
I'm running qutip on an environment without any gui. qutip correctly sets
qutip.settings.qutip_gui = 'NONE'
os.environ['QUTIP_GUI'] = 'NONE'
as I have checked.
However, it still import modules like gui/about, gui/syntax etc., that does not handle os.environ['QUTIP_GUI'] = 'NONE'. For example, these lines are from gui/about.py:
but there is not similar handling for the "NONE" option, and you thus get a NameError every time QtGui or QtCore is used later on...
qutip version: 2.3.0.dev-30fb431
Hi Arne
Thanks a lot for the bug report. I'll go through the code fix it so that the qutip_gui = NONE flag is handled consistently. In the long run I think we need to refactor the code a little bit, so that GUI dependent module aren't imported at all if qutip_gui = NONE, rather that having a lot of if-else statements scattered around, but for now I'll try to make a quick fix by adding more if statements..

Hi Rob,
No problem. By the way, this bug isn't there in qutip v2.2.0.

I think that 4fa8929 fixes this problem.
