To allow for early adoption of the qc-toolkit software, there should exist functionality to convert pulses defined therein into pulses for pulse-control. This allows to define pulses in qc-toolkit but execute (and test!) them using pulse-control already during the development of suitable hardware interfaces.
This concerns the translation of TablePulseTemplates and SequencePulseTemplates. For simplicity, it seems reasonable to translate only pulse instances (where parameters are set to some values) instead of the templates itself. The result of the translation would be MATLAB script file(s) defining the pulses.
