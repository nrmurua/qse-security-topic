Openql package should be installable with -e option as:
pip3 install -e .
@AdriaanRol It is currently installable with editable option. The problem you were seeing is caused because of permissions to the site-packages directory. You probably do not want to install it system wide, so you should install it as pip install -e . --user to install it in your home directory. Otherwise, you will have to run the command as root, for instance sudo pip install -e . Of course I cannot test it as i dont have a Mac, so let me know if it works on your Mac.
This works on the CBox branch. I suggest closing when we merge that into develop.
