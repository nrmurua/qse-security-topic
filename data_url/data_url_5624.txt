Import qiskit-aer-gpu is not currently working due to ImportError: libcustatevec.so.1 #1874
So I am trying building from source with the -DCUQUANTUM_STATIC=true
However I get the following error when building from source.
And
I am using:
cuda 12.2
g++ 8.4.0 (I saw in the building information to use a g++ version not newer than 8)
Also installed last version of Ninja
To reproduce
git clone https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer
git checkout -f a8bfca9
Install dependencies
Then build
!python3 ./setup.py bdist_wheel --build-type=Debug -- -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM="/content/gdrive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/ninja/build-cmake/ninja" -DAER_THRUST_BACKEND=CUDA -DCUQUANTUM_ROOT="/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/cuquantum" -DCUTENSOR_ROOT="/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/cutensor" -DAER_ENABLE_CUQUANTUM=true -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-8 -DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda-12.2/bin/nvcc -DCUQUANTUM_STATIC=true --
This is running on the google colab environment but I also tried localy on my computer, same problem occurs.
Build the library and end without error
I have no clue, can someone help ?
There is a secret build option (used for CI build on deployment) to use CUDA runtime and cuQuantum libraries installed via pip.
The option AER_PYTHON_CUDA_ROOT sets the root directory of Python libraries (virtual environment). With this option, dynamic link path will be resolved.
here is the example on Colab

In note, Colab's Python library has dist-packages not site-packages so I made symbolic link to dist-packages
Thank you !
