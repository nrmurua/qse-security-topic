Currently the simulator will print to stdio if there are no intermediate results.  Often one want to run repeated simulations and does not want this to pollute the terminal.  Suggest that there be a verbose flag on the simulator to turn on and off this printing.
There is a verbosity flag in the qsim_options argument to QSimSimulator, e.g. QSimSimulator(qsim_options={'v': 1}). However, the default value of this flag is zero. We may be able to increase the verbosity level of certain log lines if you can identify which ones are causing issues, though.
(Part of me wants to suggest running with qsim_options={'v': -1} just to see what happens, but I have a feeling this will omit all log messages...)
