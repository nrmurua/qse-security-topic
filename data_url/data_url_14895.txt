The Qiskit transpiler seems to give incorrect circuits for the QFT when the optimization level is set to 3.
Minimal working example provided here:
Output:
The Qiskit transpiler is supposed to give a correct circuit even if the optimization level is set to 3.
No response
The optimization level 3 removes swaps at the end of a circuit or before a measurement, as they can be implemented as a classical postprocessing on the measurements. The QFT has such a final layer of swaps which is removed in optimization level 3.
You can verify the circuit is still correct, either by re-ordering the entries in the IFFT matrix, or by re-inserting the swaps:
I see, thanks for the clarification. I didn't know about this. I'll close the issue.
