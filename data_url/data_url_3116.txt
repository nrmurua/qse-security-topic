This issue is to remove noisy warnings encountered during normal work flows. The first example is the warning about proving the QPUCompiler with native QUIL, without going through quilc, which is a normal flow when generating native circuits.
Other warnings across the code base should be checked.
The intervening output to be removed are warning log messages.
Unspecified.
