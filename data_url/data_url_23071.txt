MyNumberSpinBox (and others) in attribute_widgets.py:
Why is this signal emitted? What is ooked up to it? I don't see why the gui should emit signals, I thought this was the job of the API.
the number (floats etc,) widgets definition is utterly confising in that file. It would be nice if the author of that code @SamuelDeleglise would go through it and clean obsolete stuff, because it becomes impossible to maintain our code. At the moment, it looks like some signals continuously reemit themselves since they appear to be hooked up in loops.
I changed the title to make this the collection of bugs related to attribute_widgets, since there are more problems. The main problem is that we have not documented the interface of the widgets and therefore no guidelines for a clean, maintainable code (for example, decimals should be inferred from the attribute, not be ad-hoc defined in the widget class, and many other similar issues). So the first thing to do is to redefine the interface between widget and corresponding attribute!
cleanup done, but old code is still there and should be deleted. leaving this open until then
done now
