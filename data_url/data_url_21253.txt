Phaser can enter "lock up" state that requires a power-cycle due to an interrupted experiment
Sometimes (every few minutes) the subsequent experiment using Phaser fails with the error "cannot read board ID" in the init.
After reloading the FPGA (artiq_flash start) the error changes to "DUC+Oscillator phase/amplitude test failed"
This continues until the system is power cycled (at the moment I am doing this by pulling the power for the whole rack).
The phaser init() always completes successfully.
Using Artiq master & Phaser master gateware / firmware.
Bump. RTIO underflows happen regularly in our workflow and we can't afford to power cycle kasli frequently. We often need to operate remotely. Further, a power cycle results in bad thermal transients in our RF chain.
ping @jordens what's the plan for resolving this issue?
No specific plan (as for many issues that people have posted but where long term funding and momentum for continued debugging, development, and maintenance does not exist). We're happy to offer paid support.
In any case, more context and an an effort to provide an MWE would be good.
Just to confirm, this is definitely phaser master from January?

Yes, commit quartiq/phaser@b36e506
