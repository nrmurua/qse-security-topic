Trying to move from our qcodes fork to qcodes:master. I get this behavior when trying to create an Alazar instance.
operating system
Win7
qcodes branch
master
@wpfff Since that special Parameter Class was created the regular parameter has now gained an Instrument attribute, it should be enough to remove that line from the driver. I will open a pr in 2 sec.
