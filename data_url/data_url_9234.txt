This was implemented in the older python QIP project. See this directory:

Since memory size grows exponentially you will often run out of ram before computation time becomes the bottleneck. Given rust recently added async support to the stable branch it is probably a good time to start thinking about distributed backends for RustQIP.
Initial thought is to have a implementation of the QuantumState trait which would send operations to a server, the server implementation isn't terribly restricted however, and can be written more or less from scratch.
