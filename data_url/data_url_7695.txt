I don't seem to be able to use a Jax autodiff backend with a TNOptimizer object and also use a dask executor to parallelise over a multi-component loss function.
Versions:
quimb -- 1.3.0+276.gee67688
cotengra -- up to date with GitHub version
jax -- 0.2.10
jaxlib -- 0.1.62
dask -- 2021.3.0
cloud pickle -- 1.6.0
Example that gives me the problem:
The end of the Traceback is:
Yes this seems to be a known regression with jax -- google/jax#5043, where jitted functions can't be pickled, even by cloudpickle. I don't have any immediate solution other than to try a different autodiff_backend..
