Running the test teleport circuit on the statevector simulator with cache blocking enabled gives the wrong result.
Returns

The returned counts should be equal (up to sampling fluctuations)
I'm not sure, this might only be an issue with circuits containing conditional instructions. The above example returns the correct result on the density matrix simulator with cache blocking enabled.
I found a bug in cache blocking transpiler in handling measure operation. And I think I have fixed this bug to get proper cache blocked circuit. But I think I also have to test chunk state implementation. I need one more day.
I opened PR #1197 to fix this issue.
