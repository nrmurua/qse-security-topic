Previously, XACC's noise model API was designed specifically for TNQVM, e.g. limiting to 1-site channels.
We have updated the XACC noise model to be more generic while keeping the deprecated API for TNQVM only.
Hence, we need to update the TNQVM purified-mps simulator to use the new API and then remove the deprecated one in XACC.
Currently, the purified-mps simulator cannot handle 2-site channels (e.g. the one associated w/ CNOT gates); so we need to figure out a way to handle that in TNQVM.
