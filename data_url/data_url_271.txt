In docs/sphinx/using/simulators.rst documentation the multi-GPU target does not match the correct target.
Current:
nvidia_mgpu
Suggestion:
nvidia-mqpu
Also in docs/sphinx/examples/cpp/basics/cuquantum_backends.cpp file the comments have the old way of choosing the simulator backend.
Current:
nvq++ cuquantum_backends.cpp -o dyn.x -qpu cuquantum && ./dyn.x
Suggestion:
nvq++ --target nvidia cuquantum_backends.cpp -o dyn.x && ./dyn.x
pull the container and run the nvq++ --list-targets
Expected the targets to be same as documented targets.
Not a regression
Rename the old -qpu cuquantum to --target nvidia in
docs/sphinx/examples/cpp/basics/cuquantum_backends.cpp
Rename the old nvidia_mgpu to nvidia-mqpu in
docs/sphinx/using/simulators.rst
This has been fixed.
