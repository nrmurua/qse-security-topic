A client-specified results_dir no longer makes sense with the new datastore. It should be replaced with a server-specified, central location for storing all workflow data. The path workflow_data.base_dir is intended specifically for that purpose (perhaps it could be named more descriptively).
results_dir is split in 2: client side and server side. We need to change the name on the server side to maybe data_dir.
