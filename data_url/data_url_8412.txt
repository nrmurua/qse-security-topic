Hi all
When I ran this code
The error that was thrown indicated an improper version of Scipy instead of an error associated with
the function itself. I think it's because the exception clause here is too broad. I think it should be catching NameError.
Dear @MichalKononenko, thank you very much for reporting the issue. This should be fixed now
