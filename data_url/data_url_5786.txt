When simulating with noise model using MPI + GPU, multiple shots will be distributed to multiple processes over MPI, but shots are not distributed.
Also parallelizing large qubits circuit is not working correctly.
Building Aer with MPI support and run simulation on 2 or more processes.
Simulation time should be decreased by increasing number of processes of MPI.
I will recover MPI distribution codes later.
