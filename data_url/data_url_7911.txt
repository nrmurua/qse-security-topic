Dear @Ericgig,
I have a problem with interrupting calculation of sesolve with time dependent Hamiltonian. It just doesn't stop and shows this:
KeyboardInterrupt                         Traceback (most recent call last)
//miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/qutip-4.5.0.dev0-py3.7-macosx-10.7-x86_64.egg/qutip/qobjevo.py in call(self, t, args)
1639                     self.args[name] = op.expect(t, state)
1640
-> 1641     def call(self, t, args=None):
1642         if args:
1643             now_args = self.args.copy()
KeyboardInterrupt:
Exception ignored in: 'qutip.cy.cqobjevo.CQobjEvo._factor'
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "//miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/qutip-4.5.0.dev0-py3.7-macosx-10.7-x86_64.egg/qutip/qobjevo.py", line 1641, in call
def call(self, t, args=None):
KeyboardInterrupt
Any idea what can cause this problem?
Keyboard interrupt are not handled in the cython part of the code.
It need to be manually checked.
