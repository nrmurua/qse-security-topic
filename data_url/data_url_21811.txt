In artiq 3.6, the following gives a compilation error due to the line j = i where the local pointer i is being copied to j.
The above gives an AssertionError error:
Compilation succeeds if the j=i section is removed.  For example, the below code compiles just fine.
Interestingly, it seems if the scope of the assignment is changed things compile ok.  For example this does compile.
Yes, this is a bug in the region checker. The workaround is what you posted in your second example.
ok, tx.
Not a bug in NAC3.
