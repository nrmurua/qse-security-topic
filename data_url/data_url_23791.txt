I'd like to do a sweep where I can add SweepValues, works fine, then between the two sets of sweep-values I'd like to have a delay.
Useful i.e. when doing an IV-trace up and down again, that would allow to settle at the up point.
@alexcjohnson Is this somehow possible?
@MerlinSmiles interesting... no, I don't see a way to do it right now but I imagine we could support exactly that syntax, ie + arbitrary callables to the SweepValues to slot them in between setpoints... then we could do things like change a compliance range or integration time mid-sweep.
Haha, didnt even think that far. But yes, why not...
