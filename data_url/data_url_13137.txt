In the function expectation_estimation_shadow the following code:
is equivalent to the following simplified code:
The simplified code may be slower since Python for loops are slow. The scope of this issue is to verify if the speed reduction is significant. E.g. by timing the execution of classical shadow test files or of a classical shadow notebook/example.
If the performance reduction is significant, please ignore and close this issue.
If the performance reduction is small, please replace the long code with the simplified code.
Hi @andreamari I would like to work on this issue if its still active.
Thanks, @tinaoberoi! Yes, the issue is still active.
@andreamari The code for expectation_estimation_shadow has been modified by PR to
I guess the simplified code will also have to change for the same.
Good point! The simplified code must be equivalent of the current code that you posted.
The code snippets in the description of this issue are not up to date, but they still give the idea of a possible way to simplify the code.
If this issue has gone quiet, I can take it over.
