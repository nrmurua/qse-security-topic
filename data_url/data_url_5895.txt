Add support for computing single N-qubit Pauli expectation values to the extended stabilizer simulation method.
PR #1101 adds the new instruction for saving expectation values. Currently this is supported by all qasm simulation methods except the extended stabilizer simulator. It would be good to make this instruction work uniformly for all simulation methods.
The implementation of this instruction is done by decomposing the operator into the Pauli basis and calculating the expectation value in terms of the weighted sum of single Pauli expectation values, so to support it on the extended stabilizer would only require adding functionality to compute single Pauli expectation values 
.
