This issue discusses the structure and algorithms to be moved or added to qiskit/synthesis.
See also previous discussions in #4311 and #4699.
This issue includes the following:
Deprecate qiskit/quantum-info/sytnehesis, qiskit/transpiler/synthesis and qiskit/extensions and move the relevant code to qiskit/synthesis.
New algorithms to be added to qiskit/synthesis (for all-to-all and linear-nearest-neighbor connectivity).
The starting point of this discussion is copied from #9375 (comment)
I would suggest to split linear into two folders: linear (for CNOT circuits) and linear_phase for (CNOT-Phase) circuits:
Should we split all the existing algorithms in qiskit/quantum_info_synthesis between su2 and su4 ?
Hi. The first step (moving code and deprecation) looks straightforward. Are contributions welcome on this?
Thanks @prakharb10 - your contribution is very welcome and I've assigned you to this issue.
Please follow Qiskit deprecation guidelines: https://qiskit.org/documentation/deprecation_policy.html
