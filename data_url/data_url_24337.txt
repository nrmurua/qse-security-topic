@dwang429 : For the impedance simulations, are we treating JJ's like any other lumped port? Thomas had mentioned that some users may do it differently. If so, I need to render it that way in driven modal.
I believe some set the junction as an RLC sheet, but I am more familiar with the impedance simulations where the junction is set as an internal port. I think you can just focus on doing it as a lumped port as we discussed for the time being.
