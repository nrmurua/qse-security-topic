Ground state energy evaluation with VQE succeeds with statevector_simulator backend but with qasm_simulator evaluates to 0 once and then terminates.
same as statevector_simulator
Hi, the qasm_simulator does not work with matrix operator_mode, please use paulis or grouped_paulis mode. (the second paramter in the vqe init_args)
We will update the parameter validation in the VQE.
Thanks.
@ss2165 do you still encounter this issue after you change the operator_mode?
No, that has solved it, thank you
