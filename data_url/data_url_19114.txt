The quantity ∫gₐ(t)dt is a very useful indicator for judging the convergence, and whether λₐ was chosen appropriately.
The optimize_pulses routine should calculate this quantity and make it available to the info_hook. Also there should be an info_hook that mimics the output of the optimization in QDYN (show in example 1).
