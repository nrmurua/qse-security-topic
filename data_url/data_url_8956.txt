When using sinter==1.10.dev1666117341 on macos I get the following error when running sinter collect:
sinter 1.9.0 works fine though, as it seems line 83 was added a month ago. It looks like os.sched_setaffinity is only available on some Unix platforms: https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#interface-to-the-scheduler
