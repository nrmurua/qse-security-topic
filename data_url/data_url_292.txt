When translating Quake to OpenQASM, r1 gates are translated to cu1 gates instead of u1 gates.
Compile the following code with nvq++ kernel.cpp:
The result is the following MLIR code:
Translate the MLIR code to OpenQASM with cudaq-translate --convert-to=openqasm kernel.qke. The output is:
The resulting OpenQASM code should be:
Not a regression
This can p robably be solved by applying the following change to the translation code:

Thanks for filing this! Easy fix, we'll get it fixed shortly.
