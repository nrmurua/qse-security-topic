The basis conversion pass presently is a module pass. It is a module pass because it pre-scans the entire module to determine if there are any quake::ApplyOp operation present and if so it fails to convert any of the module.
Why not just run a basis conversion as a FuncOp pass and let each thread decide if there is a blocker (like apply-op-specialization wasn't run, or inlining, or ...)? What are the issues, if any, when some of the Quake IR is basis converted while some is not?
[There is a FIXME in the code; converting it to an issue.]
