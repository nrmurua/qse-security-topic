When running
the output is:
[(-1-0j), (-1-0j), (-1-0j), (-1+0j)]
What I would expected to happen from the XmonSimulator docstring is the unitary exp( i \pi | 11 >< 11 |) to be applied, so that only state 3 should acquire a -1 phase, while the other states should remain unchanged.
Fixed and updated in #42 : we've standardized on using "half turns" as the measure.
