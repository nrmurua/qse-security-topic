E.g. looking at the example script (now working thanks to #344)
the purpose of processors is to apply measures after compilation in the preprocessors step. Speaking with @ecpeterson this is an artifact of an older implementation of quilc, in which measure instructions were not acceptable in compilation.
The task here is to:
cc @stylewarning, are there any other preprocesses we'd like to run that would justify keeping the preprocessors step around?
I don't see why it can't be removed entirely.
Closed in #372.
