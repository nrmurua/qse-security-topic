Alright, this one is tougher to go into detail, since I haven't actually managed to write a simple example that reproduces the error, so I have to dig a little deeper here. Sorry for the trouble.
Background:
I'm trying to interface skquant optimization in another package i'm developing, as a way to optimize (functions of) quantum circuits. This involves some wrappers that convert arrays into dictionaries; the important part is I have callable objects where a dictionary goes in, and a float comes out.
The code basically looks like this: the object called my_object here is a callable; essentially, a parametrized quantum circuit, with some bells and whistles on top. it takes a single argument, variables, which have to match the named parameters inside it for it  to work. it's return type is a float.
The error is thrown in this case by a circuit that has four active variables and no passive ones.
the error I get, from my real code, with a little extra information, is here:
I'll try to get a more complete test case up in running if the problem isn't sufficiently clear.
Fixed by forcing an install of the higher version of SQSnobFit from scikit-quant/opt/snobfit/setup.py   ; pip installing gives version 0.4.0; that needs to be 0.4.1
Thanks. As also mentioned in #4, I'll keep track of patch versions in the top-level setup from now on.
Fixes released on PyPI.
