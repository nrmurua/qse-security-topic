cirq.GridQubit(a, b) + (c, d) works
cirq.GridQubit(a, b) + cirq.GridQubit(c, d) does not work
The latter should act like the former.
Not sure how I feel about this. It seems odd to use GridQubit as a "delta" on another grid qubit.
The use case I ran into was defining a layout in grid qubits, and then passing in the center. It made sense for the function call to expose the center as a grid qubit, and for the internals to be defined on grid qubits, and then the offset operation is natural.
