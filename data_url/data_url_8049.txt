Call to b.render() errors after performing b.add_vectors(vec) where b is an instance of qutip.Bloch().
The code runs without an error.
This seems to be caused by this update in matplotlib. The solution seems to be to add the following method to Arrow3D.
@tomohiro-soejima Thank you for a very well organized bug report and for suggesting a fix. I've opened PR #1818 that applies your suggestion and adds tests. The PR is a continuation of #1690 because I didn't want to generate merge conflicts, so it can only be easily reviewed and merged once #1690 lands.
I've marked the fix for inclusion in 4.7 which should be released in the next couple of weeks.
Great, thanks for taking a look!
