"This would allow users to call methods like save which can load full models without the original python code that created them. For now we have only save_weights which requires the user to also have the original python code that created the model (not a huge constraint)." @MichaelBroughton
@trevormccrt do you want to look into this since you have some experience with Keras Layers ?
This seems to be a priority, since users are running into the issue on SO.  I will try.
This issue has not had any activity in a month. Is it stale ?
Would like to +1 this, and ask that it is made clear(er) in the documentation that although save won't work, save_weights will.
This is because the error given when calling save doesn't indicate that this is the problem; in my case, I got
Only when explicitly calling the model's get_config() method did I get
