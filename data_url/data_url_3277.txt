Error emitted:
The input Quil program is attached. The issue seems to be in parsing the parametric DEFGATE; the parse error seems to be at the %phi inside the first matrix element. This might be an issue with dependency quil-rs but I did not see an issue report there.
Call native_quil_to_executable() for a QPU compiler on the attached program.
This was resolved by #1589
