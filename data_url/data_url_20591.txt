Hi, I followed the Quickstart to build OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable. When I built the OpenSSL, I got some error messages.
The following are my instructions:
There is no error in the first two instructions. But when I typed "sudo make test", I got some errors.


Is the setting of  -DOQS_DEFAULT_GROUPS wrong? Or is the algorithm not supported?
Hmm -- no, the (default) algorithms (names) look OK. Does the same error happen in your environment when you build static? What if you build dynamic without setting OQS_DEFAULT_GROUPS (I'm not sure we tested the test suite when setting --other-- default groups)? What exactly are the errors (running make test V=1)?
Edit: I can reproduce now -- so Thanks for the report -- will look into it.
Does the same error happen in your environment when you build static?
Yes, it also has the same error.
What if you build dynamic without setting OQS_DEFAULT_GROUPS(I'm not sure we tested the test suite when setting --other-- default groups)?
No error occurred. All tests successful.
@AndyChung1997 please check whether the issue is also gone for you and re-open this issue if NOK. Be sure to also enable ED448 for getting all classic alg tests to pass.
