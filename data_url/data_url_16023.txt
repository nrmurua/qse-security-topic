TaperedPauliSumOp cannot be multiplied with another OperatorBase.
Try the following snippet:
The multiplication should work just fine.
Since this is very similar error to #6100 I suggest to find a more general solution which makes TaperedPauliSumOp generally compatible. I am quite positive that otherwise more such problems will arise.
Thanks.
I am sorry. I didn't think TaperedPauliSumOp with parameter exists.
I recognized TaperedPauliSumOp.assign_parameters() also doesn't work.
My question: Is Z2_symmetry invariant under parameter multiplication?
I would assume so ðŸ¤” I found this bug while trying to combine a TaperedPauliSumOp with our new EvolvedOperatorAnsatz in Nature. There, an error occured on the following line: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/blob/master/qiskit_nature/circuit/library/ansatzes/evolved_operator_ansatz.py#L162
A more extensive example which should work once this issue is resolved is given in this test: https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/blob/master/test/algorithms/ground_state_solvers/test_advanced_ucc_variants.py#L75
@pbark @woodsp-ibm Please correct me, if I am wrong about the invariance under parameter multiplication..
If invariant, parm * tapered_qubit_op can be TaperedPauliSumOp which has same z2_symmetries. If not, parm * tapered_qubit_op must be PauliSumOp.
