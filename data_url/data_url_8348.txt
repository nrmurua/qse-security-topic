The following error occurred several times while running the tests on my machine:
It is due to the fact that the default integer of python on windows is int32 instead of int64. np.random.randint(0, 2**32) produces the same error on my machine. Maybe it is better to add dtype=np.int64 or dtype=np.uint32 since they are platform independent. If you agree I can work on fixing it.
Thank you for finding the source to this testing error and proposing a fix. It would be best to have @Ericgig's opinion on this, as he refurbished the stochastic solvers and has been working on migration from int32 to int64, see also project 4 in Google Summer of Code.
It needs to be 2^32-1
Or better yer np.iinfo(np.int32).max
Thank you for finding it. You can make a patch if you have time. nonhermitian's np.iinfo(np.int32).max seems the best solution. seeds should be dtype=np.uint32
@BoxiLi nice work, thanks
Hello,
I am having the same ValueError on Windows that @BoxiLi  describes in the beginning of this thread.
I see that this was fixed by changing the line
noise = np.random.randint(0, 2**32, ntraj)
to
noise = np.random.randint(0, np.iinfo(np.uint32).max, ntraj, dtype=np.uint32).
I have two questions.
Hi @egdeist, thanks for finding it, again. Somehow my change was reverted by #990. And no one realised it since QuTiP isn't automatically tested on windows.
Do you still have after changing it to np.random.randint(0, np.iinfo(np.uint32).max, ntraj, dtype=np.uint32)?

Thanks @BoxiLi.
Yes, I realize now that it does work if I change it to np.random.randint(0, np.iinfo(np.uint32).max, ntraj, dtype=np.uint32)?
One more small q-- in the above, line 385 uses np.iinfo(np.unit32).max, but line 417 uses np.iinfo(np.int32).max -- does it matter what is used / is this a deliberate difference?
numpy seeds must be 32bit usingned int. Thus np.uint32 is better, np.int32 will cut half the available seeds. #1219 will fix this but it will take some time before it is officially released.
