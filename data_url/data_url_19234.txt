Describe the bug
The DepolarizingChannel with lam=1 on a single qubit should give 0.5 probability for both 0 and 1 but gives 0.6 - 0.4.
The problem does not appear when using density matrices.
To Reproduce
Expected behavior
Gives {'0': 6316, '1': 3684}.
When using qc = Circuit(nqubits, density_matrix=True) it gives {'0': 5035, '1': 4965} which is more right.
@renatomello @AlejandroSopena do you have any idea what could be causing this?

Since @AlejandroSopena already detected the issue and opened a PR, I put myself as a reviewer there.
