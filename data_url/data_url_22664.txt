Please automatically update manual as part of build.
http://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual
Out of date manual made it harder to notice 50a5a3b .
@whitequark can you implement automatic doc upload on the new build-server?
@sbourdeauducq yes but I would like you to set up a separate account for doc upload
You should be able to use a dedicated SFTP account (SSH file transfer) with the credentials in my home folder on the buildserver.
It is actually impossible to use sftp in batch mode using password authentication.
Use expect or some other hack.
Done
