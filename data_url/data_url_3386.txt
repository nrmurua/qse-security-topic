DefGate seems to be broken in NumpyWavefunctionSimulator.
Use any custom gate definition. Here I just copied from http://docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/basics.html#defining-parametric-gates.

Hi, thanks for reporting this.
I am not super familiar with the PyQVM API, but it looks like there are several things going on.
PyQVM doesn't support parametric defgates. There is code in the PyQVM class to detect parametric defgates and report a sane error, but calling execute in this way appears to circumvent it. So this is probably a bug.
PyQVM implements the "Quantum Abstract Machine" (QAM) interface, and I suspect you're meant to either interact with it via the QAM interface, or else indirectly via a Quantum Computer. Neither of those classes implement an execute method, so perhaps that method should "private" to the PyQVM class. This is just a guess though.
If instead of calling execute directly, you follow a procedure similar to the one outlined in the QuantumComputer docs, then you'll get an explicit NotImplementedError: PyQVM does not support parameterized DEFGATEs. For example, if you replace the final two lines of your example code with the following:
If instead of calling execute directly, you follow a procedure similar to the one outlined in the QuantumComputer docs, then you'll get an explicit NotImplementedError: PyQVM does not support parameterized DEFGATEs.
Ah, that's good to know!
PyQVM doesn't support parametric defgates.
I should clarify, that the reason I noticed this was that non-parametrized DEFGATEs used to work in the PyQVM --- they work in PyQuil 2.10, for example. We rely on this feature over in https://github.com/rigetti/pennylane-forest to compute multi-qubit arbitrary expectation values.
For example, using
I get the same error as above in the latest PyQuil PyQVM, but it works fine in 2.10.
I see. Yes, looking at the git history, the behavior of execute w.r.t. defgates did likely change recently. As a (partial) workaround, calling the PyQVM via QAM interface methods load and run should still work in the presence of non-parametric defgates, or indeed via the QuantumComputer interfaces. Note that these reset the wavefunction and memory registers each time they are called though.
Full example calling PyQVM via QAM interface:
Or via the QuantumComputer interface (building on the last example):
