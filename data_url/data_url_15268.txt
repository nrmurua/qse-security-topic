Statevector.evolve returns the incorrect answer when evolving certain subsystems if the statevector has mixed dimension subsystems. This is due to it incorrectly reshaping the temporary transposed tensors during the evolution contraction when flattening back to a returned statevector.
If things were working correctly the above code snippet should return a fidelity of 1
The error is in the Statevector._evolve_operator method where one of the np.reshape instructions is given an incorrect dimension specification in certain cases where there are >= 2 non-evolved subsystems with different dimensions.
