Right now a very common thing that transpiler passes need is the positional index of a bit object. The instructions arguments are expressed in terms of the objects, but most hardware aware passes need the qubit number to be able to look up the properties of the target backend. According I checked and as of opening this there are 26 instances of passes internally doing something:
(and at least 3 open PRs I know of adding more instances of this to passes)
Instead of doing this dict comprehension everywhere we should have a method on the dagcircuit to look this up efficiently. It should do this in constant time instead of needed to traverse DAGCircuit.qubits which likely means creating adding an attribute on the dag that tracks these positions so it's quick to look up when needed.
Hi, can I try  this issue?
Hi @zain2864: sure, thanks!  If you need a start, you might want to look at how QuantumCircuit does this as it does something similar.  To solve the issue, we'll want to add the new attribute to DAGCircuit, and replace all the times in transpiler passes where this happens with your new attribute.
Hi, @zain2864. Are you still working on this? Thanks.
Hi, @enavarro51 , I am still working on this, I was just having some trouble, but I am looking into it more now.
