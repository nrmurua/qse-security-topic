Thanks for all the work building this package, QuantumOptics.jl has been very useful to me. I've recently been doing some work in PDEs, and am trying to install the package MethodOfLines. Unfortunately this leads to unsatisfiable requirements for the OrdinaryDiffEq package.
QuantumOptics v1.0.3 supports OrdinaryDiffEq versions 4.0.0-5.71.0. However some packages (such as MethodOfLines) require version 6. Is it possible to update QuantumOptics to support version 6 of OrdinaryDiffEq?
The full error message when I run add MethodOfLines is:
@ruvilecamwasam it should work now with the new version 1.0.4.
