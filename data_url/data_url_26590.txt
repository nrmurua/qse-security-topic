mpirun -np $_PROCS -ppn ${_PPN} ${CPK_BINDIR}/cp2k.psmp -i pao_ml_tio2.inp
the run directory contains following files -
and i am getting following error message on run command invocation -
I am exploring this dataset for the first time. Do i need to carry out any preprocessing before using the same simulation run command?
