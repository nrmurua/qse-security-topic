Upon initialization of an executor object, the user's configuration file is read and overwrites whatever configuration data is in memory. This is similar to the issue fixed in Fix missing config keysÂ #92, but is specific to executors.
Upon import of Covalent, executor objects are initialized for each executor plugin available. Executor objects are not needed until the workflow is run. This requires each executor plugin to have default values for all inputs.
