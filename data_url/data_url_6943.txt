E.g. http://algassert.com/quirk#circuit={%22cols%22:[[%22H%22,%22H%22],[%22Z%22,%22%E2%97%A6%22],[%22Amps2%22],[],[%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22%E2%80%A2%22,%22X%22]]} should not show "fixed" in the amplitude display.
Furthermore, only-permuting gates should not cause a wire to be marked as involved in this sense.
This has been done for awhile.
