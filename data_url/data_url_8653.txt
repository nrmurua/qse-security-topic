I don't know how to add this, but it could be useful.
Hi. I've been looking in to this and plan to add it at some point, but we would need to rework some of our unit tests before adding travisci (because some of our tests take too long to run).
scipy deals with some slow tests by decorating them using @slow from numpy.testing.decorators and then using something like nosetests for testing.  So TravisCI by default will not run the slow tests, but you can manually override this option if you want to run them locally.  Also TravisCI will tolerate quite slow tests up to maybe 50min total (build+test).
ok, thanks for the suggestion. I will try to set it up this way.
