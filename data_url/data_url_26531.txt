SomeThingWrongAboutDBSCAR-rc3.0.txt
Rocky Linux 8.5, gcc 8.5，intel parallel studio 2020.4， icc --version=19.1.3 with MKL.  cmake=3.20.4
Libint was 2.7.0-beta.5-lmax 5 and install by cmake.
the subject caught my attention (DBCSR). However, the reported error message is not DBCSR at all:
Sorry to my limited knowledge about the code.
the error was  printed after some DBCSR code end with .k30.  all packages installation went smoothly but after source the setup file. the command make local.psmp produced these codes.
You are compiling without OpenMP - most likely you are missing the -fopenmp flag.
