From Aer 0.13.0 with BackendV2, transpiler returns circuit with unnecessary gate conversions.
For example H gate is transpiled to P gate, X gate is transpiled to U3 gate reported in #1977
For extended stabilizer method, converting H to P is bad strategy, because H is Clifford gate but P is not that takes very long time to simulate.
For the simulator backends, gate conversion is not necessary and should be ignored even when transpiler's optimization level is higher (if some of the backend model is not applied)
This can be avoided by setting some parameters in backend target class (e.g. error rates) as default parameters for simulator backends.
