CmdDef cannot bind parameters when ParametrizedSchedule consists of multiple instructions. This is related to #2603 .
Parameters are supplied to CmdDef and checked and bound at each instruction level. This problem can be avoided by checking parameters at CmdDef level.
This is a regression, as the sample code works prior to the introduction of the new parser.
Also, this runs but uses the same phase for each parameter
