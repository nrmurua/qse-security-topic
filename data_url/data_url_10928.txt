Would you please look at the snippet from solver.c function local_search_1bit() below.
It appears that on the sweep from top to bottom, kk iterates through [qubo_size - 1, 1] inclusive.
On the sweep from bottom to top, kk iterates through [0, qubo_size - 1] inclusive.
Is it intentional that kk does not get to 0 on the sweep from top to bottom?
Thank you.
S.D.
