@sbourdeauducq is this funded? I'm currently planning to use this for Sayma synchronisation, so it would be good to have it finished before v2.0 hw arrives.

Actually, I take that back. So long as we put the SYSREF generator on the RTM FPGA (which seems to be the logical place for it) I won't need KU SERDES TTL.
Yes, this is fully funded.
The code for the IOSERDES is there but often causes timing failures due to the Ultrascale TPWS flaw. The divided and high-speed clocks need to be generated from a pair of BUFGCE_DIV or a pair of BUFG_GT, the complicated part is that the divided clock has to be aligned to the existing RTIO clock.
There are two possible workarounds:
done, needs testing
üëç thanks!

That's great!
Did you also test TTL input?
