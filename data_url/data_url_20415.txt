It would be great if we had continuous integration testing of the Visual Studio project build on Windows, using one of the Azure tools.  Vlad (@vsoftco) said he would look into it.  Christian (@christianpaquin) if you have any comments about this they'd be greatly appreciated too.
I took a look a while back, but couldn't find an easy way to make this work with travis (without resorting to a clunky mechanism); I can take another look. @vsoftco, I'd be happy to discuss and share my notes.
@christianpaquin I was thinking of using AppVeyor https://www.appveyor.com, it seems to be working for some of my projects. And it's designed for integration with VS. I'll play with it and try to integrate liboqs with it.
Sounds good. I was looking at spinning up VMs and using the GitHub status API to write my own CI server, but an existing solution definitely sounds better and more maintainable. I'll make sure the Windows build is working and up-to-date; it's been a while since I tested it.
Let me know if there's anything I need to do to link AppVeyor to our project.
FYI, I'm working on fixing the Windows build that has been broken, and also to enable support for kyber. I hope to push that out soon.
PR #151 fixes the Windows build.
Managed to get the Windows build to run on Appveyor, will add the configuration to master soon after a bit more testing.
