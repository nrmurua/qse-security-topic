The setup.py configuration file has the line:
The problem is that this import happens before pyquil is installed. We get away with this because pyquil/__init__.py is empty. But if we add any imports there (see issue #302) pyquil will try to load its dependancies before it's installed.
See https://packaging.python.org/guides/single-sourcing-package-version/ for solutions to this problem. (personally, I like storing the version in git tags, using setuptools_scm)
Also grove and reference-qvm have the same issue.
