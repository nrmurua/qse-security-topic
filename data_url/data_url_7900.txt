There are two places where one can read about the development guidelines. One is
on qutip/qutip's Wiki page:
https://github.com/qutip/qutip/wiki/QuTiP-Development-Guidelines
The other one is in [qutip-doc/qutip_dev_contrib.md](https://github.com/qutip/qutip-doc/blob/2ffd6d1cc581e858674d43fe97a9297e9476a278/qutip_dev_contrib.md).
I see that we may want both to be there, but I guess they should contain the same information and possibly cross-reference each other.
