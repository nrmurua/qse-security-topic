When multiple circuits are submitted to the transpile command, the following error appears:
I used the following code:
The transpiler should transpile each circuit and return a list of transpiled circuits.
No response
This error is strange - it looks very like an error we've previously fixed. Please could you show us the version of symengine you have installed?
I have symengine version 0.8.1 installed. I just saw that there is a new version released about two months ago. I will try to update and then rerun the transpilation
Yeah, this error is caused by running with symengine < 0.9.0. We raised the minimum requirement on symengine in 0.20.0 to symengine >= 0.9. If for some reason pip isn't handling that and upgrading symengine for you you'll face an error like this with an older version of symengine.
I just found out that there was a symengine package installed incorrectly which was not updated with the main qiskit code, thus leading to the error. now everything works fine. Thanks for your support.
