Right now the c++ bqm code added in #533 is implemented as a set of type aliases and functions. Instead it might make more sense to containerize them. This would allow for nicer cython code.
would become
This can save on a lot of imports when using a lot of C++ functions.
This would also allow us to make the AdjArrayBQM and AdjVectorBQM cython implementations a lot more similar by abstracting the differences into c++ space.
