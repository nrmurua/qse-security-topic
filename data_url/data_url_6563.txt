For users interested in analyzing circuit unitaries, we should provide the ability to convert an N-qubit circuit to its 2^N x 2^N unitary form. This is required for feature parity with the TFQ variant of qsim.
Yes, how do we feel about putting in a small standalone module like this in the repo here ?
https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/blob/master/tensorflow_quantum/core/qsim/unitary_space_slow.cc
While it doesn't have to be core to any workflows, having this feature supported here makes a lot more sense than having to support it in TFQ now that we are moving to depend on this OSS version of qsim.
This has been finished here: #161
