Description of the issue
https://pypi.org/project/cirq/#history shows recent pre-releases before the 0.13.0 version which was released last week
Cirq version
0.13.0dev.
Hi @vtomole, Can you please elaborate little bit more?
All the 0.13.0.dev in https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq/pull/4595/files should be 0.14.0.dev instead.
Okay, we'll do that, can you assign me this issue?
I've assigned you.
