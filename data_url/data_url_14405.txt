You can get qubit and gate info from props = backend.properties() via
and
However the order of the inputs is reversed in these methods.  For gate property it is name, qubits where as for qubit property it is qubit, name. This is less than ideal, and the interface unified.
Hello @nonhermitian , I was just going through the source code for backendproperties here and saw that,
def qubit_property(self, qubit: int, name: str = None) -> Tuple[Any, datetime.datetime]:
and
def gate_property(self, gate: str, qubits: Union[int, Iterable[int]] = None, name: str = None) -> Tuple[Any, datetime.datetime]:
Both of these have qubit, name. Am I missing something?
Look at the order in the signatures.  The first is int, str where as the second is str, union[int, iterable[int]. That is the issue
