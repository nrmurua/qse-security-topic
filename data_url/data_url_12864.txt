Is the CTQG(CLASSICAL-TO-QUANTUMGATE CONVERSION) part proposed in the paper available now?  I want to transform some simple classical functions into the quantum circuit but do not find doc for the CTQG. The example code in the paper
cannot be compiled by current ScaffCC.
Thanks. After I build the RKQC and run the hello world example in the terminal
It prints out an error
The file examples/CMakeLists.txt is
My cmake is in version 3.5.1.
