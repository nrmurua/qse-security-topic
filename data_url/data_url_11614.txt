AttributeError raised when running unittest test.aqua.test_optimizers.TestOptimizers.test_p_bfgs. Error message discloses inability to pickle local object P_BFGS.optimize..optimize_runner as ultimate source.

Captured traceback:

From aqua source directory run tox test.aqua.test_optimizers.TestOptimizers.test_p_bfgs
No Error
Confirmed also on 3.8.3 with tox or just standard python -m unittest. Switching to Python 3.7 works however.
Edit: this is also on macOS Catalina.
python -m unittest test.aqua.test_optimizers.TestOptimizers works fine on linux with python 3.8
I believe in Python 3.8 the default multiprocessing mode was changed for the Mac. Thanks for bringing this to our attention. We will investigate how to correct this.
