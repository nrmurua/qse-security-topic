In section Types and Casting -> Physical Qubits, the specification refers to the possibility of referring to  Physical Qubits. However, the specification is not explicit about declaring physical qubits or if they just exists. A clarification would be great.
@1ucian0 can you add a PR clarifying the language? A general qubit can be declared via an identifier. If we decide we want to reference a particular qubit in the hardware, we use a physical qubit reference. Physical qubits must be declared before use, which is done w/ the qubit $N syntax.
I think the notion is that they just exist. So, no need to declare them.
I prefer taking the approach where we declare them in some standardized header that may be included. This seems more consistent for the language, and we do not have to worry about components popping into existence.
Eg.,
I wrote earlier against the '$' syntax, but if the '$' syntax prevails, then they probably don't require declaration, as the syntax is apparently unambiguous and easy to parse.
@taalexander to me, physical qubits are akin to registers in a traditional CPU which are not declared --- they just exist. Maybe it would be helpful to tell your compiler what physical qubits exist for a particular backend, but that seems like something outside the language itself.
