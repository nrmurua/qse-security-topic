Here is some output from a current pyQuil session:
This is missing a bunch of spaces, which in general prevents the reconstruction of the actual circuit definition. As far as I can tell, this is a faithful representation of the "raw string" being stored as the internal representation of the DEFCIRCUIT pseudo-instruction. Presumably there's a minor error in the parser, where the tokenized circuit definition is being agglutinated without interleaving spaces between relevant tokens.
