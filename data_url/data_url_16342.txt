In Qiskit, standard rotation gates (such as 'rx', 'ry', 'rz') take the angle theta in radians rather than in degrees. However, the visualization visualize_transition() seems to assume that angles should be specified in degrees.
For example the following code:
Results in the following plot:

Alternatively, the code below, where the angle is in degrees, gives the expected rotation.

Since the standard in Qiskit is to use radians and not degrees, the first example should result in the following plot:

There are two possible solutions:

Hey! Can I work on this issue
@diemilio  I guess I have solved this issue.
@Arijit02. OK. I was waiting for someone from IBM to comment on how they wanted to proceed since I wasn’t sure if having the phase in degrees was done by design.
Okay, I get it.

Maybe @nonhermitian can comment here?
The angle should not be in degrees. It should be radians for consistency with the rest of Qiskit. It must have been a mistake.
