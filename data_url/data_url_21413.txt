Running
throws a KeyError
If I run the same code with archive=True, which is the default everything works as expected.
I am running ARTIQ-7 version 7.8123.3038639.
Edit: Tested this also on 6.7665.83af3b75 with the same result.
Arguably, if a value should neither be broadcasted, persisted, or archived, then it should not be a dataset.
What about:
We could add a warning to set_dataset when it is a NOP.

Shouldn't be the set function be symmetrical to get function? get function clearly says it wouldn't expect NOP in any case:
If you are referring to the archive parameter, due to an unfortunate past oversight it means slightly different things for set and get. You can see in the code that it touches two different dictionaries, self.local and self.archive respectively.
This was a workaround to get our own data storage running. Rewrote set_dataset for my needs now. Closing this.
