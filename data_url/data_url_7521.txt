By mistake I was trying to measure smth which is not measurable.
This action tries to throw an error but unfortunately causes Julia to crash compeletely
strange indeed, on my machine this gives
which is the expected error, what's your versioninfo btw? by versioninfo I mean the output of executing versioninfo() in your REPL.
I tried this on both 1.0 and 1.3 on my Mac, can't freeze my julia here, I guess I'll just wait for your versioninfo.
Picture with error freeze:

Trying to abort operation with Ctrl + C gives the following:
WARNING: Force throwing a SIGINT

I don't have a linux machine on hand, @GiggleLiu could you reproduce it?  I think this might be some strange Julia bug.
@kirtsar Please also check your Yao's version. If Yao is not up to date, type ] up to update Yao related packages. Some old versions do not handle this error properly.
@GiggleLiu
Should I install master version of Yao?
My current version is 0.5.1
@kirtsar
No. The latest released version is 0.6.1 , the following command should work
Hi @kirtsar does it work for you now?
@Roger-luo
Yes it does now, thanks!
