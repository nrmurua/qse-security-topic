Description
This may or may not be a bug. In a QuadraticModel self-loop is accepted for integer variables.
Expected Behavior
Either raise an error early, or support self-loops/quadratic, square terms
Additional Context
The user doesn't get any warning that self-loop or square terms aren't supported for integer variables.
Since they are well defined we do accept them. We provide a CQM.substitute_self_loops method (#948) for any solvers that do not support them.
