In the "Running Automated Test" section of the Getting Started page, it's written:
sh tests/runAll.sh
I can't find any file like that inside tests folder. Instead, it is runTests.sh. Probably have to update the docs.
Hi @rasa97
This is a typo, thanks for spotting this. We're currently working on updating the docs :)
