A utility to decompose a Hermitian matrix A into a linear combination of Pauli operators [I, X, Y, Z] is required for several algorithms (VQLS for example).
P.S. If I have the working function, can I submit a pull-request to qiskit-terra.qiskit.utils?
You're quite welcome to submit a PR, thanks.  The most natural place for this (for me) feels like as a classmethod constructor of SparsePauliOp, rather than a separate utility function - SparsePauliOp can represent this efficiently as a single object, and then its coeffs and list attributes would give you direct access to the two variables you're returning here.
That feature already exists in the SparsePauliOp:
That's what I get for not checking if it actually exists!  But glad to see that the existing API is the same one I suggested.  I'll close this as "fixed" now, then.
