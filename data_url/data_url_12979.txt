Currently, permutation aware synthesis runs all permutations in parallel, producing output like in the attached picture for 3 qubits.
It would be really helpful if each line in the log specified which permutation it pertains to, eg
DEBUG    | [1,2,3] bqskit.passes  ...
DEBUG    | [1,3,2] bqskit.passes  ...
This would allow generation of logs for each independent permutation, eg by using grep [1,2,3] output.log
