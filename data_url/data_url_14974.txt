Qiskit terra interface for CMA-ES which is a stochastic derivative-free numerical optimization algorithm, observed  in  arXiv:2111.13454 to be on par with and sometimes outperforming SPSA with appropriate hyperparameter tuning 1.
I would be more than happy to work on this. â†©
@MarcDrudis almost finished the implementation of CMA-ES during the work on #8170, which would be nice to get in.
