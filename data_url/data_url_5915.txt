Unitary simulator does not return a matrix of a part of qubits.
Because Snapshot specifies two qubits, simulator should return a 4x4 matrix.
Change here to generate a matrix of op.qubits.
Unitary snapshots are like statevector snapshots and must be on the full width of the circuit. They don't support subsets since there is no way in general to marginalize the full unitary without converting it to a Choi (like converting Statevector to density matrix and partial tracing)
