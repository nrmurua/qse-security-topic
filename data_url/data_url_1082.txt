I would like to use the cirq.num_qubits protocol on gate classes
cc @cduck
Cirq version

Thing being Python, you can do the following underhanded thing:
What would the protocol do for gates like MeasurementGate that take a variable number of qubits to __init__?
If you decorate _num_qubits_ with @staticmethod or @classmethod it might just work.
For variable qubit gates, then the default argument will come into play and by default default raise a TypeError.
I agree with your diagnosis that those decorators could do the trick
I can work on this if no one else is on it already. Let me know @balopat @cduck @mpharrigan
