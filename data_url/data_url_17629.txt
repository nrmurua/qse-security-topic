We use params and param for the same thing.
In the instruction object it is param (so this includes dagcircuit and circuit) but in the qobj and schema it is params. I think we need to choose one. I would like us to make it params (personally I would have prefered parameters : - ) )
I agree with params as there are multiple parameters.
@ajavadia which one do you want. If you also want params can you close this and make an issue to change param in circuit, instruction, and dag to params.
It should be params. i just didn't do it in #1210 because it was already too much. But yeah let's do that now.
