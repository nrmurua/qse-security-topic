From Gerhard Huber:
Rendering correctly a rotated QComponent to Ansys
Any non 90deg design.
From Zlatko Minev:
Basically there is a part in the code when we render to Ansys which checks if a poly has four points
if those four points form a rectangle,
then uses the draw rectangle function.
So this point we just have to modify the logic so that
IF the rectangle is not at 90° or 0°,
Then we just drop the polygon as usual, rather than drawing by calling the rectangle function
Thanks for opening the issue, @zlatko-minev, do you know where in the code the check happens?
