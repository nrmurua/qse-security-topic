Qiskit natively supports z measurements using measure, but x and y basis measurements need to be done with a quick hack (reflecting how the hardware works).
However:
I'd suggest measure_x and measure_y be added to QuantumCircuit, with measure_x compiling down to h followed by measure (except for relevant hardware).
You should just be able to define a composite instruction for these. Eg
Edited to include post measurement instruction to rotate to the correct collapsed state.
Update on this issue, since I've just closed another as a duplicate of it:
We remain interested in generalising the concept of measures that Qiskit can reason about, but it is not at all a trivial task nor a case of just adding a couple of new classes; there are many assumptions baked into the library in many places that measurements are Z-basis, and modifying that will have a lot of knock-on effects throughout the library.
