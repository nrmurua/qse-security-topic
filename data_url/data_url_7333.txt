The method of timecorrelations.correlation to caculate the correlation fuctions, if I set the timelist large, there will be a warning that
Interrupted. Larger maxiters is needed
PS: For example, as discussed in the link, [https://github.com/qojulia/QuantumOptics.jl-examples/blob/master/notebooks/correlation-spectrum.ipynb]
if I chage the time list
dτ = 0.05 τmax = 1000000 τ = [0:dτ:τmax;] corr = timecorrelations.correlation(τ, ρ₀, H, J, dagger(a), a)
How could I over come this problems? To set the τmax smaller? But, sometimes, this will lead the range of freqency get through correlation2spectrum smaller than I wanted.
This isn't really surprising. The time you set is rather huge. I suppose numerical errors add up such that at some point the integrator used can no longer achieve the required accuracy within the number of iterations given by maxiters. Hence, the warning you receive.
A few options you can try to overcome this are:
For a list of options to set regarding the step-size, see the DifferentialEquations.jl documentation: https://diffeq.sciml.ai/latest/basics/common_solver_opts/#Stepsize-Control
Finally, you mention:
But, sometimes, this will lead the range of freqency get through correlation2spectrum smaller than I wanted.
Note, that the time used when computing the correlation and the resulting frequency in the spectrum are connected by a Fourier transform. This means that the final time of the integration specifies the resolution of the frequency list dω ∝ 1/τmax whereas dτ controls the total range of the frequency, ωmax ∝ 1/dτ. So to obtain a larger range of frequency you actually need to decrease dτ rather than increase τmax.
