Hello,
As I am waiting for approval on your google groups. I wanted to ask for more information on your local stress tensor. As it isn't documented (as far as I can see yet) I wanted to confirm a few things:
This option is under development. The current results are not useful.
For some Hamiltonians atomic properties are available, see
CP2K_INPUT / FORCE_EVAL / PROPERTIES / ATOMIC
@juerghutter I would be interested in helping with this. This implementation would greatly help my current research, although I would probably need some overhead discussion.
The implementation is following
A. Filippetti and V. Fiorentini, PRB 61 8433 (2000) and
CL Rogers and AM Rappe, PRB 65 224117 (2002) as well as
RM. Martin, Electronic Structure, Appendix H
I'm still not sure how to work with the basis set dependence (Pulay stress).
It is similar to the nonlocal pseudopotential term but has contributions for all terms.
I'm still looking at helping you with this, I simply have to finish a few items first. Thanks.
