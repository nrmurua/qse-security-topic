Hello,
It appears that there is still a problem with the heralded CNOT gate (the one with 8 modes) corrected last week in the 0.9 version. While it computes the right probabilities, I found that the heralded gate is reproducing a control(-X) operation instead of a controlX. I found out while applying my quantum process tomography algorithm on this gate.
I might be wrong, but my algorithm works for the heralded CZ gate in 0.9 version and also for every other 1 qubit and non entangling 2qubit gates. Besides, the heralded CZ gate with H gate on both sides of the target qubit truly implements a controlX operation.
Thanks in advance,
Arman
Hello Arman,
Thanks for the info. We'll be working on CNOTs right now. I'll keep you updated.
Best wishes,
Eric
Hello,
The CNOT fix was released in Perceval version 0.9.0.
Thanks,
Eric
