Hello,
I have tried installing pyrpl into a conda environment with the following:
$ conda create -y -n pyrpl-env numpy scipy paramiko pandas nose pip pyqt qtpy pyqtgraph pyyaml
$ conda activate pyrpl-env
$ pip install pyrpl
Then I tried running the gui as described in the documentation. I get the following
$ python -m pyrpl example_filename
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'quamash'
So I installed quamash
$ pip install quamash # could have used conda, but sticking to the "pip after conda" method
Now the gui launches, but the lockbox module which I am trying to use is blank and I get an error displayed:
AttributeError: module 'qtpy.QtCore' has no attribute 'pyqtBoundSignal'. This was discussed in issues #467 and #469. I solved the issue by installing qtpy version 1.9.0:
$ pip install qtpy==1.9.0
Now when I launch the gui I get the output from the gui

:
There are phase and magnitude pop-out displays, but no other parts of the lockbox module display. If I close both the phase and magnitude pop-out windows I get another error: TypeError: setLogMode() got an unexpected keyword argument 'xMode'
I am on Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS. I have tried using the precompiled executable pyrpl-linux, but find it does not run on my system. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Best,
js
