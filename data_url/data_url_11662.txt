When using ADAM as the optimizer for QAOA, an error "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'params_new' referenced before assignment" is raised after a few executions.
Running this program (I have simplified here the operator to minimize, but this happens also with other, more complicated operators and with the qasm_simulator backend)
gives me the following output:
Sometimes it takes several iterations, but eventually the error occurs.
The code should run without errors. When using other optimizer (COBYLA, for instance), the error does not happen.
The problem seems to be with the ADAM optimizer, seems replacing the optimizer solves the error.
Thanks for bringing this to our attention. The issue arises here in the ADAM optimizer, as its optimize() method is called each time qaoa is run() but the initialization of certain fields it uses during the optimization is only done in its constructor. It ends up working for a while before it gets into a state where it fails as you saw. For it to be able to be re-used in the way you are doing then things may need to be reset each time on the call to optimize.  As we are moving towards allowing algorithms and components to be re-used this is something we will have to address.
Until such time as this is done you can re-create QAOA with ADAM each time you want to use it, or continue what you are doing but using the other optimizers. (I would have suggested using qaoa.optimizer = ADAM() to give it a new instance each time as an alternative. We just added setters in the last release but it seems there is an issue there too that I will have to fix! - Update: This is now fixed here on master branch by #1008 )
@Zoufalc - is fixing ADAM to allow its re-use across optimize something you can take a look at?
@stefan-woerner FYI. And I think the new GSLS is ok, from looking at it, in regard of re-use.
Thanks for the workaround. With that modification, my code seems to be running correctly now.
Thanks!
