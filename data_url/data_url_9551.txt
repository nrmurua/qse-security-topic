Right now, a SystemError is raised when the validation of a serialized sequence fails as seen here in the code.
Looking at the documentation of SystemError in the python built-in exceptions this exception doesn't really seem to match the issue we want to raise to the user.
I feel bothered to try and catch a SystemError to detect invalid sequences because that error could be raised for critical reason tied to the interpreter totally unrelated to the sequence validation. Is it possible to define a new custom exception and raise it when validation fails, such as I could import it and catch for that specific issue when it occurs.
Any thoughts on that idea ?  If it sounds good to you, I can take care of implementing this change as it should be quite minimal.
Yes, that's fine with me! And thanks for offering to take care of it.
I would suggest something like SerializationError, or PulserSerializationError to be even more specific. You can place it inside the pulser.json module.
