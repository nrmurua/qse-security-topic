Describe the bug
OQS_SHA2_sha256_inc_init in sha2_ossl.c fails when compiled with OpenSSL 3.0.2: oqs_sha256() returns a null pointer.
To Reproduce
See open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider#144
Can also be reproduced by compiling with OpenSSL 3.0.2 and running test_hash (exists with code 1).

Additional context
Appeared in context of open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider#144
I'm not able to reproduce on my system, even with OpenSSL 3.0.2.
Can you try changing 
Alternatively, the changes introduced in #1431 require a call to OQS_init, maybe oqs-provider isn't calling this initialization routine?

Thank you for the hint! Indeed, these seem to be missing in oqs-provider. (Changing to SHA2-256 didn't help there).
I'll double check if this really appears independent of oqs-provider and otherwise close the issue here.
If #1431 landeed, OQS_init must be called by any consumer of liboqs, incl. oqsprovider. Didn't we label it an API breaking change requiring downstream adaptarions?
Tested it again, and the issue only occurs when OQS_init is missing (as in the downstream projects, not quite sure why it worked with OpensSSL 3.2).
I opened a PR for oqs-provider: open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider#146.
Still needs to be done in OQS-OpenSSL, OQS-BoringSSL, and OQS-OpenSSH.
