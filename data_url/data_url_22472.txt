... otherwise master CI builds override release doc builds etc.
What about having the master CI upload docs into artiq/manual-dev and the release builders into artiq/manual? I don't think we need to keep all old manuals online.
Why not?
loads of files laying around, more complex folder structure. How would you name the paths?
manual-$BRANCH
And symlink manual to the latest?
No symlinking. That would break any existing links or bookmarks every time we release.
Instead, redirect.
That needs to be a deep redirect then. How do you do that?
Doesn't need to be. The manual itself uses relative links and something outside just links to /manual, which should appropriately redirect. Afterwards, all URLs will already point where they should.
There are already a few links pointing inside /manual, but OK.
Yes, in that case a deep redirect is needed.
It's trivial to do with any reasonable webserver, e.g. Nginx or Apache, by using their rewrite module.
But I do not have access to the server configuration.
Then get a better server. This is one of the simplest things that any host is supposed to support.
Changing the URL underneath will lead to link rot and confusion. I would know; I did this mistake on http://rxr.whitequark.org and now dozens of inbound links from stackoverflow etc point to either 404 or, even worse, subtly wrong results. This is unacceptable.
Currently it goes to https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual-%25(branch)s/index.html. No variable replacement.
I put a redirect 301 into htaccess.
