The networkx API is not expected to be consistent across minor versions, e.g.:
https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/release/release_2.2.html#api-changes
https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/release/release_2.1.html#api-changes
We could either bump the version requirement to >=2.2 and hope that test coverage is sufficient to catch future breaking changes, or bind to ==2.2 and remember to review  and update in the future. (There is also the notion of a compatible release, but it seems less widely used and depends on the package maintainer keeping to semantic versioning.)
