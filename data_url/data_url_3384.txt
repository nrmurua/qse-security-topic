This is a bit open-ended, but currently the LaTeX diagram generation supports only straight gates-and-measurements programs. It won't even know what to do with RESET instructions. Something nice should be done.
On reflection, I am hesitant to do anything special with RESET instructions. To my understanding, Rigetti hardware supports active reset as an initial operation for each shot of QPU execution, but not arbitrary resetting in the middle of circuits. Programs with RESET are semantically equivalent to programs without it -- the main difference being the delay time between iterations. For this specific item, I vote omitting it from the circuit diagram (and not raising an Exception).
For more complicated control flow, I think additional though needs to be given.
