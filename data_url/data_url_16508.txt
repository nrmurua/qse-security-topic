Dear qiskit team,
I modified the RZGate for personal use (with two gates instead of one) to keep the global phase. The modification did not work, and I noticed that there is a duplication of the code. It seems that QuantumCircuit.rz is defined in standard_gates\equivalence_library.py instead of standard_gates\rz.py. Several other gates are redefined in standard_gates\equivalence_library.py. Should this part of the code be refactored?
Hi @adjs these two pending pull requests are related. We have to introduce a mechanism to track global phase, then we can make the definitions to correspond exactly to the matrix.
#4562
#4622
Is this issue still valid?
For now, this is the right structure. The definitions in standard_gates\rz.py are a subset of those in standard_gates\equivalence_library.py but are still needed for tools like the unroller/decomposer. (At this point, both versions should keep the correct global phase). Feel free to re-open if there are other questions/discussion here.
