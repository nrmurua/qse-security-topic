Port SAWG channels to Sayma and optimize.
Was originally in contract: "Port single-tone non-interpolating RTIO parallelized DDS (fDATA) core to Kintex Ultrascale."
Done. Will be debugged when Ethernet is up.

I think this is on our side, not @enjoy-digital's.
Sure. But Florent helped with integration.
@jordens: not sure i can really help on that, but if it's related to things i'm working on, yes i'll look at it.
It's done. The issue is closed. I was just documenting the progress.
