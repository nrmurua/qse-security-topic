I was testing the GUI using the template "flopping_f_simulation.py" in the examples folder and realized there maybe some problems with the function Scannable. In the following, the scan method "Linear" has been chosen in the GUI unless specifically mentioned.
I cannot reproduce item 2. Can you post the full source? It can also be due to a previous 4043.00 current value stored in artiq_gui.pyon from an older experiment version that had a larger maximum.
Regarding item 3: the standard Qt widgets do not allow spinboxes without min/max. There is a solution in Pyqtgraph, but as often: pyqtgraph/pyqtgraph#210
Since we may want a fancier scan widget later, supporting that min > max corner case is problematic. 284e3dd now enforces min <= max.
Seems Qt groks QDoubleSpinbox.setMaximum(float("inf")) and same with min/-inf. It is a rare event that one of those IEEE754 special cases produces something else than bugs.
d5f2f5c and e043179 should fix the rest of those issues.
So, how do we increase the precision to more than 2 digits after decimal point?
Have you looked at the commits I referenced above?
