of.CircuitSampler() fails. I think I personally prefer default to BasicAer, but either is fine.
To default BasicAer, you still need to chose a simulator (quasm_simulator, statevector_simulator or unitary_simulator ).
For sure it should not default to None - the typehint does not include Optional to denote this yet it is assigned None.
Removal of  the   = None seems like the thing to do especially since None is passed on to QuantumInstance that expects a valid backend
I think we should ask users to define the backend they want to use -- if they don't want to specify one we already have the plain eval  ðŸ˜„
That's fine. Just a nit that in this case I actually passed an empty backend expecting BasicAer qasm so that it would actually  sample my evaluations. I already did eval() to get the exact answer, and wanted a sampled one.
