Use better name to reflect what is happening in Ansys.
Projects is different from designs, a design can be Q3D or hfss. The project cannot be Q3 D, a project can only contain Q 3-D design.
But:
The clean_project(self): method clears what is the active design. So, if there were hffs and other Q 3-D in Project, but the active design is the only thing cleaned in the project.
Also update the notebooks to reflect the change of name.
Better user experience. Less confusion.
