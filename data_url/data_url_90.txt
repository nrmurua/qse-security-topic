Code blocks are used throughout the documentation to illustrate the respective sections. Right now, these code blocks are usually written in C++. In additional to moving snippets into their own dedicated file to ensure that they work correctly (tracked by issue #710), it would be good to create tabs instead for both C++ and Python, as it is done in #719.
