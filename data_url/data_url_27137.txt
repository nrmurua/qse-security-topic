NixOS/nixpkgs#215056 broke our, not so clean, method to add compiler flags to stdenv.
The new version uses proper functions from nixpkgs to modify stdenv.
Now I remember why I did not use that solution in the first place: it appears to some packages as if we are cross compiling for a new architecture, creating a whole new array of problems.
